Arguably none have done so more than Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic, who has surprisingly led his team to the Western Conference Finals opposite the Golden State Warriors and their all-time great trio of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green.

In just his fourth season, Doncic has already established himself as perhaps the NBA’s next great superstar and his size, scoring and passing ability have drawn comparisons to James. Indeed, Doncic’s all-around game does compare well with the Lakers’ star and Green believes so as well.

Green discussed the similarities between Doncic and LeBron, believing the two are very much alike in many ways but do have some differences as well.

Both Luka and LeBron are masters at controlling the game with the ball in their hands, reading and manipulating the defense and getting the best out of their teammates. It is an interesting note that Green makes about Doncic being slightly more of a shoot-first player than James, but it isn’t necessarily wrong either.

Obviously the other big difference that Green didn’t mention, but also doesn’t need mentioning, is LeBron’s athletic advantage. But the great thing about Luka is that he has shown he doesn’t need elite athleticism to dominate in the NBA.

The new era of NBA stars is growing before our eyes and these playoffs have seen the likes of Doncic, Ja Morant, Jayson Tatum and Anthony Edwards have truly impressive outings. There is always a tendency to compare the new stars to current or past ones and it is hard to argue that Doncic and James have some serious similarities.",2022-04-07 00:37:23,2022-04-07,"nba, lebron james, la lakers",en,en,en,en,While Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James finds himself at home during the playoffs the new age of NBA stars have cemented themselves this postseason Arguably none have done so more than Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic who has surprisingly led his team to the Western Conference Finals opposite the Golden State Warriors and their all time great trio of Stephen Curry Klay Thompson and Draymond Green In just his fourth season Doncic has already established himself as perhaps the NBA s next great superstar and his size scoring and passing ability have drawn comparisons to James Indeed Doncic s all around game does compare well with the Lakers star and Green believes so as well Green discussed the similarities between Doncic and LeBron believing the two are very much alike in many ways but do have some differences as well Both Luka and LeBron are masters at controlling the game with the ball in their hands reading and manipulating the defense and getting the best out of their teammates It is an interesting note that Green makes about Doncic being slightly more of a shoot first player than James but it isn t necessarily wrong either Obviously the other big difference that Green didn t mention but also doesn t need mentioning is LeBron s athletic advantage But the great thing about Luka is that he has shown he doesn t need elite athleticism to dominate in the NBA The new era of NBA stars is growing before our eyes and these playoffs have seen the likes of Doncic Ja Morant Jayson Tatum and Anthony Edwards have truly impressive outings There is always a tendency to compare the new stars to current or past ones and it is hard to argue that Doncic and James have some serious similarities ,Draymond Green Believes Luka Doncic Shares A Lot Of Similarities With LeBron ,0.0016461554,2.9675643e-06,0.00014685553,0.0001322963,0.00031150374,3.844573e-05,4.2367363e-05,Dallas County,32.76663,-96.77787,,20

“We Crashed,” is a story about Adam (played by Jared Leto) and his struggle to start his own business.

The first episode starts where we see that Adam is pitching his business idea to so many investors in 2007 and each one of them rejected his idea then Adam met Rebekah (played by Anne Hathaway) and Miguel (played by Kyle Marwin) who helped him to start his business. Rebekah boost his morale and Miguel gave him space and funds to start his business and they started their new business named ‘Greendesk.’

But the nature of humans is to grow at any cost and for that, Adam scraped off ‘Greendesk,’ and tried to get new investors for a bigger business idea and one investor agreed to fund his idea.

The second episode began with the conflict when the investor ditched Adam and the struggle of Adam continues. Then Adam and Rebekah got married to each other and Rebekah’s dad gave them one million dollars as a gift but Adam used that money to invest in his business and then Adam, Rebekah, and Miguel started “WeWork.”

In episode three, we saw the success of the “WeWork” and by 2012 they have 10k members working for it but every success story has its hurdle and now the hurdle was one quote from Rebekah (which I’ll not tell because it can be the spoiler) which put “WeWork” and Adam into trouble but at the end of the episode, everything got sorted out.

What I liked about the series till now is its story and its pace things that I didn’t like about the series till now are the third episode because this episode didn’t add anything to the story.

However, the beer lovers will have no choice – they will have to buy and drink only one single brand, one of the sponsors of FIFA.

Budweiser is the exclusive beer of the World Cup and has been since the 1986 edition, with parent company AB InBev renewing a deal to remain until 2022 in 2011.
According to FIFA, alcohol will be sold “within the stadium perimeter prior to kick-off and after the final whistle. Inside the stadium bowl ticket holders will have access to non-alcoholic Budweiser Zero,” FIFA said in a statement. “At the FIFA Fan Festival, Budweiser will be available to purchase from 6.30 pm,” the statement further said. Consumption of alcohol in public is prohibited in Qatar. However, it is sold in hotels and bars with licenses.
Another report said beer stands would open in zones around stadiums when gates open for a match and close 30 minutes before each game starts. The stands would reopen for a short time after the game.

(http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/20220215/83241a32cfc641b693ae3e55f2aa4f17/c.html)

Last week, Biden signed an order according to which the U.S. will use $3.5 billion of the frozen assets to address the dire economic and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, but the other $3.5 billion could be used for compensating 9/11 victims.

The move by the Biden Administration seemed to have united several people with opposite views in Afghanistan. In a press conference on Sunday, former Afghan President Hamid Karzai criticized the U.S. and called on it not to ""punish the victim,""—in this case, the Afghans.

Intellectuals, academicians, civil society organizations and others have written an open letter to Biden asking him to reconsider his decision. The letter says, ""We ask you to reconsider this decision as we are still trying to heal what is left of us as a nation."" (https://tolonews.com/afghanistan-176728)

The Taliban have been demanding ever since they came to power to release the locked funds in American banks. (https://nypost.com/2022/01/24/taliban-demand-release-of-10b-frozen-by-us-europe/)

It is for the first time that the Afghans are presenting a united face and The Taliban could be realizing this could straighten their hands more than ever before since their takeover of the country.

In exactly a day, India will encounter the favourite neighbor in a 20-over tussle at the Asia Cup. What's rather surprising is the low volume of public enthusiasm, as if calmly awaiting the next Bollywood flop.
Although, most living generations will confess that this was one matter that deeply united Indians, the imminent slaying of the perennial foe. It was at one level credible surrogacy, as the ambitions of the battlefield could be replicated, video game-like, in a gladiatorial environment. Quite naturally, the losses were scaringly scathing, most remarkably the last delivery sixer by Javed Miandad in 1986, decimating our composure for a largish spell of time.
This time, however, the box office seems rather lukewarm, and at the onset of the festive season, folks seems elsewhere engaged on Sunday evening. Which incidentally is surely a reasonable factor, as after the covid lull of play, citizens are stepping out with relieved abandon, static TV time is clearly a punitive option. Recent data points on the mall and dine-in traffic confirm that the latest threats of the ill-tempered virus are being ignored with boisterous bravado.
Also, in terms of sheer variety, there is far too much happening in India today, and I do mean the political dramas that are unfolding daily across theaters of governance. New age candidates like scams, raids, defections, and debates are arresting our imagination with galloping gusto and the OTT invasion is rapidly occupying emotional territories across the citizenry. Thus, there is a clear and present overload of 'entertainment' in urban living, from sources old and new.
Which is exactly where the IPL comes to play as the prime accused for the diminishing passion in Indo-Pak cricketing conflicts, for time to come. For starters, it has curated a deluge of world-class content with today's viewers seeing in a year more Cricket than we could imagine watching in a lifetime. And this is inarguably state-of-art stuff with India becoming the combination of the Italian and Spanish leagues in a Football context.

After joining Chelsea for £53 million from RB Leipzig in June 2020, the 26-year-old German has fallen short of expectations. Werner, who is under contract until 2025, and his agent Volker Struth, according to Sport1, are already planning his departure from the club during the next transfer window. 

Werner, who has one goal and one assist in 14 Premier League appearances for Chelsea this season, is reportedly wanted by Borussia Dortmund. According to Sport1, Chelsea are willing to take a risk on Werner and are reportedly looking for a cost of at least £34 million.

The Government's sanctions against Roman Abramovich, which presently prevent the west London club from doing any business in the transfer market, would complicate any potential acquisition. Werner's wages are also said to be a stumbling block, since he is reputedly Chelsea's fourth-highest earner, with a salary of roughly £13.5 million every season.

The German has fallen out of favour with Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel and has struggled to find a starting spot in the team. Werner came to Chelsea as one of the most sought-after strikers in the game, having scored 34 goals in 45 games across all competitions.
Werner was expected to continue his good form at Stamford Bridge, but things have not gone as planned.

Due to 'differences in the style of play,' Werner said last week that he feels more at ease representing Germany than the Blues.
'Things aren't going the way I'd like at Chelsea, so it's all the better that things are going well here under Hansi Flick,' he said after scoring in Germany's 2-0 friendly win over Israel on Saturday.

'I really enjoy playing football, no matter where I'm playing. There are differences in the style of play between football at Chelsea and here.

the midfielder. After spending six years at Old Trafford, Pogba has returned to Juventus and will be aiming to recapture the form that made him the most expensive footballer in the world when United paid £89 million ($106 million) to acquire him in the summer of 2016.

In 178 games for the Bianconeri during his first stint with the team, he scored 34 goals and contributed 40 assists. However, following a rocky period in the Premier League, it is unclear whether the 29-year-old will be able to consistently deliver elite performances when he returns to Serie A.

Pogba completed a physical on Saturday before signing a four-year contract with the Allianz 
Stadium. The pay and bonuses on the deal are expected to total about £8 million annually.

When he arrived back in Turin, Pogba was given the No. 10 jersey, a replica of the one he wore 
at Juventus during his most productive period of his career to date.

Paulo Dybala, who departed the team this summer and was rumoured to be moving to 
Manchester United as well as Juve's domestic rivals Inter and AC Milan, relinquishes the shirt to him.

Juventus on Pogba's return: “The call that after a thousand adventures eventually leads you

It appears that the days of paying hundreds of millions of dollars for a celebrity name are over. They're now concentrating on completing the job with the help of free agents and lower-league transfers.

This second strategy is quite intriguing. They scout young players with a lot of promise from the lower levels and sign them for a pittance. They frequently register them with their subsidiary team, Barca B, rather than having them in the squad.

Pablo Torre is an 18-year-old Spanish 3rd division player who currently plays for Racing Santander. He is from Cantabria, Spain, and is largely regarded as the best talent to emerge from Racing Santander's academy since Sergio Canales of Real Betis.

Torre has been a member of Racing's academy since 2015, and for the 2020/21 season, he was called into pre-season training with the first squad. He made a strong impression and was named to the first-team squad.

Pablo Torre scored four goals and added five assists in his rookie season. He has 7 goals and 8 assists this season, averaging a goal contribution every 115 minutes. He has played for Spain at the U17, U18, and U19 levels in recent years.

We've seen players like Pedri and Demir, who were signed for Barca B but then impressed so much in pre-season that they were promoted right away.

Pablo Torre could wind himself in the similar situation, especially if Riqui Puig is scheduled to move on loan next season. When asked about it, Sergi Barjuan, the manager of Barca B, stated that Torre was indeed a first-team signing.

It will be interesting to see what occurs. If you're good enough, you're old enough at FC Barcelona these days. Could Pablo Torre, like Pedri, have an early impact in the first team?

New Delhi: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has termed ""disappointing"" the Varanasi district court's decision on the maintainability of the Gyanvapi mosque case and urged the government to implement the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, with full force.
The Varanasi district court on Monday said it will continue to hear a petition seeking daily worship of Hindu deities whose idols are located on an outer wall of the Gyanvapi Masjid, dismissing the mosque committee's argument that the case is not maintainable.
In a statement, AIMPLB General Secretary Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani said the preliminary decision of the district judge's court was ""disappointing and saddening"".
Rahmani said in the midst of the Babri Masjid controversy in 1991, Parliament had approved that the status quo at all religious places, except the Babri Masjid, would be maintained as in 1947, and no dispute against it would be valid.
Then in the Babri Masjid case, the Supreme Court upheld the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, and declared it mandatory, he pointed out.
""But in spite of this, those who want to serve hatred and who do not care about the unity of this country, raised the issue of Gyanvapi Masjid in Varanasi and it is a pity that the district judge's court ignored the 1991 law and allowed the petition,"" Rahmani said.
""Now, this sad phase has come where the court has initially accepted the claim of Hindu groups and has paved the way for them. It is a painful thing for the country and the people,"" he said.
This will affect the unity of the country and harm communal harmony, Rahmani said.
The government should implement the 1991 law with full force, all the parties should be made bound to this law and a situation should not arise wherein the minorities get frustrated with the justice system and feel all the doors of justice are closed for them, he said in a statement.

In Group A, the English Premier League giants, Arsenal are set to face challenges from PSV Eindhoven, FC Zurich and Bodo/Glimt in a bid to qualify for the next round. 
Arsenal are leading the Premier League title race with five wins from six games. Manchester United disturbed their 100% record in the league with a 3-1 win over Arteta’s side at Old Trafford. Despite the defeat, the club is in fine form and can prove a hotter side in the group. 
On the other hand, PSV Eindhoven have appointed former Manchester United player, Ruud van Nilseteroy as their gaffer. In the Dutch league, they are fourth on the points table with four wins in five games. Their 100% record came to halt against FC Twente. They can be a real contender for the top spot in Group A and cause trouble for Arsenal. 
FC Zurich are going through tough times in the league with zero wins after seven games. They are facing the worst form of their life and are the worst performing side in the group. FC Zurich have two points to their name and are in the ninth position in a ten-team league. 
Bodo/Glimt are the darkhorse of Group A. They are second in Eliteserien. They are ten points behind the table-toppers, Molde. Bodo/Glimt have 41 points from 21 games. Bodo/Glimt will look to stage huge competition against FC Zurich, Arsenal and PSV Eindhoven during the group stage. 
The changed nature of the UEFA Europa League has added spice to the group stage competition. Here is what we think about Group A’s finish on the points table. 
Predicted group stage finish:

Russian and Ukrainian forces are fighting nearby, and shelling has damaged power and communication lines to the plant, prompting fears for the plant’s safety and evoking painful memories in a country still scarred by the world’s worst nuclear accident, at Chernobyl in 1986.
In addition, Russian authorities have developed plans to disconnect the plant from Ukraine’s power grid – in the event of damage to the plant, according to the Russians, as a prelude to switching the plant to the grid in Russian-occupied territory, according to the Ukrainians. Disconnecting the plant from the grid is a risky operation.
The Conversation asked Najmedin Meshkati, a professor and nuclear safety expert at the University of Southern California, to explain the risks of warfare taking place in and around nuclear power plants.
How safe was the Zaporizhzhia power plant before the Russian attack?
The facility at Zaporizhzhia is the largest nuclear plant in Europe and one of the largest in the world. It has six pressurized water reactors, which use water to both sustain the fission reaction and cool the reactor. These differ from the RBMK reactors at Chernobyl, which used graphite instead of water to sustain the fission reaction. RBMK reactors are not seen as very safe, and there are only eight remaining in use in the world, all in Russia.
The reactors at Zaporizhzhia are of moderately good design, and the plant has a decent safety record, with a good operating background.
Ukrainian authorities tried to keep the war away from the site by asking Russia to observe a 30-kilometer (nearly 19-mile) safety buffer. But Russian troops surrounded the facility and seized it in March.
What are the risks to a nuclear plant in a conflict zone?
Nuclear power plants are built for peacetime operations, not wars.

Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi was chosen to represent Kashi in the Parliament, it has remained a point of interest. Thanks to this unique situation, Kashi's days of being treated as a tourism cash cow with all of its infrastructure requirements neatly ignored are long gone.

Enhancing Connectivity Throughout Kashi
The improvement of road connectivity to and via Varanasi has received significant attention. The much-needed 6-lane expansion project of the Varanasi - Prayagraj portion of NH-19 has begun, and this widening would greatly ease traffic and congestion for vehicles travelling in the direction of Varanasi. A 119 crore project to rehabilitate Rural Link Road has been started, and another 3-lane flyover over the Varanasi-Ghazipur Road has been opened. All of these initiatives contribute to fewer traffic bottlenecks.

Additionally, the Panchkosi Parikrama Marg is being enlarged, which will further reduce traffic on this major artery. Additionally, Godaulia now offers secure, congested-free parking thanks to the opening of a multilevel parking garage.

The Kashi Mahakal Express has been launched, connecting the three Jyotirlinga pilgrim centres of Varanasi, Ujjain, and Omkareshwar, to further boost Kashi's position as a major pilgrimage hub and connect it to other significant pilgrim sites across the nation. IRCTC operates this corporate train, which offers the greatest in travel convenience.

“The emancipatory promise of urbanisation has failed to fructify for millions of Dalits and Muslims who are relegated to the spaces with poor public services,” said the study, published by four academics—Naveen Bharathi, Deepak Malghan, Sumit Mishra, Andaleeb Rahman—in the Urban Studies Journal in February 2022.


The study, which combines large scale quantitative analysis using neighbourhood-level national census data for all towns in India with at least 0.3 million residents, has qualitative fieldwork in Bengaluru, home to over 10 million residents. 


The latest findings are in line with other studies which find segregated living in Indian cities based on caste or religious identity, with Dalits and Muslims facing the worst discrimination in urban housing, with few signs of improvement 75 years after independence. While prejudice and limited social and economic mobility plague both communities, waves of communal violence have driven the ghettoisation of Muslims in riot-prone cities irrespective of social class, education, and status. 

In a paper published in 2021, Fractal urbanism: City size and residential segregation in India, the same four academics had concluded that caste-based residential segregation is rife, even among India’s most urban centres, and the degree of segregation does not vary by the population size of a city or its growth over the last six decades.


A research paper published in 2018 by three of the four authors—the first-ever attempt to use enumeration block-level data (released in 2015) to study caste-based residential segregation in India— found that 30% of Delhi's neighbourhood, 60% of Kolkata's and 80% of Rajkot’s did not have any Dalits and Adivasis. 


Since the Census of India doesn't make an enumeration of block data of religions public, it is difficult to study residential segregation along religious lines.

സിനിമ എന്ന മാധ്യമത്തിന്റെ വ്യാപ്തി, ഒരേസമയം","കത്തിയെരിയുന്ന താരസൂര്യന്മാരും സിനിമയെന്ന സൂപ്പർതാരവും 
സിനിമ എന്ന മാധ്യമത്തിന്റെ വ്യാപ്തി, ഒരേസമയം കലയായും വ്യവസായമായും പരിണമിക്കാനുള്ള ശക്തി,  ഓരോ പ്രേക്ഷകനേയും എന്നും അത്ഭുതപ്പെടുത്തുന്ന വസ്തുതയാണ്. ഓരോ സിനിമയും ഒരു കൂട്ടായ പ്രവർത്തനത്തിൽ നിന്ന് ഉടലെടുക്കുന്ന സൃഷ്ടിയാണെങ്കിലും, ഒരു പ്രേക്ഷകനെ, ഒരു പ്രത്യേക സിനിമ കാണുവാൻ തത്പരനാക്കുന്ന ഘടകങ്ങൾ പലതാണ്. അവയിൽ എക്കാലത്തും, ഒരുപക്ഷെ പ്രഥമദൃഷിയിൽ തന്നെ ഒരു സാധാരണ പ്രേക്ഷകനെ ആകർഷിക്കുന്ന ഒരു ഘടകം തന്നെയാണ് സൂപ്പർ താരസാന്നിധ്യം. ഒരു വ്യക്തിയുടെ പേരിൽ ഒരു സിനിമ വലിയരീതിയിൽ ആഘോഷിക്കപ്പെടുമ്പോൾ, കച്ചവടം ചെയ്യപ്പെടുമ്പോൾ, അവിടെ ആ വ്യക്തി ഒരു നടനോ നടിക്കോ അപ്പുറം താരമായും, സൂപ്പർ താരമായും മാറുകയാണ്.
ഒരു അഭിനേതാവ് സൂപ്പർ താരപദവിയിലേക്ക് ഉയരുമ്പോൾ , തന്റെ കലാമികവിനാൽ ഒരു വലിയ പ്രേക്ഷകവിഭാഗത്തെ തൃപ്തിപെടുത്തുന്നതിലുപരി, കഥക്കപ്പുറം കഥാപാത്രങ്ങൾക്ക് വളർച്ചയുണ്ടാവുകയും, വ്യക്തി പ്രഭാവം വർധിക്കുകയും, പ്രേക്ഷകർക്കിടയിൽ സ്വാധീനം ചെലുത്താനാവുകയും, പിന്നീട് വാണിജ്യപരമായി വരും സിനിമകളുടെ നെടുംതൂണായി മാറുകയും ചെയ്യുന്നു. സൂപ്പർ താരസാന്നിധ്യം കൊണ്ട് നിർമാതാവിന് തന്റെ ചിത്രത്തിന് മേൽ ലഭിക്കുന്ന മിനിമം ഗ്യാരന്റി, സാറ്റലൈറ്റ്, ഓടിടി അടക്കമുള്ള വിതരണാവകാശങ്ങൾ വഴി നേടാനാവുന്ന നിശ്ചിത ലാഭം തുടങ്ങി അനേകം ഘടകങ്ങൾ സിനിമ എന്ന വ്യവസായത്തിന് സൂപ്പർ താരങ്ങളുടെ അനിവാര്യതയെന്തെന്ന് നമുക്ക് കാണിച്ചുതരുന്നതാണ്. സൂപ്പർ താരസാന്നിധ്യം കൊണ്ട് മാത്രം ഒരു മോശം സിനിമയും വിജയിക്കപ്പെടില്ല എന്ന വസ്തുത കണക്കിലെടുക്കുമ്പോഴും തരക്കേടില്ലാത്ത ഒരു സിനിമയെ നല്ല വിജയത്തിലേക്കെത്തിക്കാനും , മികച്ച ഒരു സിനിമകൊണ്ട് കളക്ഷൻ റെക്കോർഡുകൾ ഭേദിക്കാനും , ആഗോളതലത്തിൽ വരെ വലിയ വിജയമാക്കി മാറ്റാനും സൂപ്പർ താരങ്ങളെക്കൊണ്ട് സാധിക്കുമെന്നതാണ് യാഥാർഥ്യം.
ആത്യന്തികമായി കെട്ടുറപ്പുള്ള കഥയും, ശക്തമായ തിരക്കഥയും, ഉത്തമമായ കലാപ്രവർത്തനവും കൊണ്ട് തന്നെ മികച്ച സിനിമകൾ ഉണ്ടാകാമെന്നിരിക്കെ സൂപ്പർ താരസാന്നിധ്യം, വാണിജ്യ സാധ്യതതകൾക്കപ്പുറം ഒരു അനിവാര്യതയല്ലാതെ മാറുന്നുണ്ട്. എന്നാൽ മറ്റു സൃഷ്ടികളുടെയും, കലാപ്രവർത്തകരുടെയും നിലനിൽപ്പിനെയും സ്വാതന്ത്ര്യത്തെയും അനാരോഗ്യകരമായി ചോദ്യം ചെയ്യുന്ന അവസ്ഥയിലേക്കുത്തുമ്പോഴാണ് സൂപ്പർതാരങ്ങളും, സൂപ്പർ താരചിത്രങ്ങളും ഒരു പ്രതിസന്ധിക്ക് ഇടയാക്കുന്നത്.
അകമഴിഞ്ഞ പ്രേക്ഷക പിന്തുണയാണ് ഓരോ സൂപ്പർ താരത്തെയും സൃഷ്ടിക്കുന്നതും വളർത്തുന്നതും. എന്നാൽ, പ്രേക്ഷകരുടെ അന്ധമായ താരാരാധന, പിന്നീട് വ്യക്തിവിദ്വേഷങ്ങളിലേക്ക് നീങ്ങുമ്പോൾ താരങ്ങൾക്കും, ഒരുപക്ഷെ അവരുടെ  സിനിമകൾക്ക് പോലും അതൊരു വെല്ലുവിളിയാകുന്നു. ഓരോ സൂപ്പർതാരത്തിന്റെ വളർച്ചക്ക് പിന്നിലും പകരം വക്കാനാവാത്ത രീതിയിൽ അവർ പകർന്നാടിയ, പ്രേക്ഷകർ ഹൃദയം കൊണ്ട് സ്വീകരിച്ച കഥാപാത്രങ്ങളും പ്രകടനങ്ങളുമുണ്ടെന്നിരിക്കെ, ഒരു വലിയ ആരാധകവൃന്ദത്തെ തൃപ്തിപ്പെടുത്തുന്നതിനായി മാത്രം സിനിമകൾ തിരഞ്ഞെടുക്കാനും, വൈവിധ്യങ്ങളിൽ നിന്ന് മാറി, പരീക്ഷണങ്ങൾക്ക് തയ്യാറാവാത്ത അവസ്ഥയിലേക്ക് അഭിനേതാവിനെ കൊണ്ടെത്തിക്കുന്ന താരപദവി തീർത്തും നിരാശാജനകമായി തീരുന്നു.
സൃഷ്ടാവിന്റെ ആവിഷ്കാര സ്വാതന്ത്ര്യത്തെയും കഥാപാത്രരൂപീകരണത്തേയും അഭിനേതാവിന്റെ താരപരിവേഷം ബാധിക്കുന്നതോടെ അഭിനേതാവെന്ന രീതിയിലുള്ള താരത്തിന്റെ വളർച്ച ഇല്ലാതാകുകയാണ് ചെയ്യുന്നത്. പുതിയ ചിന്തകളോ ആശയങ്ങളോ ഒരു താരത്തിനു വേണ്ടിയുള്ള കഥാപാത്രസൃഷ്ടിയിൽ ഉണ്ടാകാതെയാകുമ്പോൾ, വിജയ കഥാപാത്രങ്ങളുടെ സമ്മിശ്രരൂപങ്ങൾ ആവർത്തന വിരസമായ കാഴ്ചാനുഭവങ്ങൾ പ്രേക്ഷകന് സമ്മാനിക്കുന്നു . ഒരർത്ഥത്തിൽ അങ്ങനെ ഒരു ചട്ടക്കൂടിലേക്ക് സൃഷ്ടികൾ പരിമിതപ്പെടുകയോ, പരിമിതപ്പെടുത്താൻ സൃഷ്ടാക്കൾ നിർബന്ധിതരാകുകയോ ചെയ്യുമ്പോൾ സൂപ്പർതാരപരിവേഷങ്ങൾ ബാധ്യതയായി മാറുന്നു.
സിനിമയുടെ കലാസ്വാതന്ത്ര്യത്തിന് കോട്ടം തട്ടാതിരിക്കുന്നിടത്തോളം, സൂപ്പർ താരങ്ങൾ ഈ മാധ്യമത്തെ വാണിജ്യപരമായി പിടിച്ചുനിർത്തുകയും, കലക്കപ്പുറമുള്ള താരത്തിന്റെ വളർച്ച കലാസൃഷ്ടിയുടെ മികവിനെ ബാധിക്കുകയാണെങ്കിൽ, കേവലം കച്ചവടചരക്കായി മാത്രം സിനിമ പരിണമിക്കുകയും ചെയ്യുന്നു. സൂപ്പർ താരങ്ങൾ സിനിമയെന്ന വാണിജ്യത്തിന് മുതൽകൂട്ടാകുന്നതിനൊപ്പം തന്നെ മികച്ച കലാസൃഷ്ടികളുടെ ഭാഗമാകുകയും ചെയ്താൽ ഒരേസമയം കലാപരവും വാണിജ്യപരവുമായ ഒരു മാധ്യമവിപ്ലവത്തിന് നമുക്ക് സാക്ഷ്യം വഹിക്കാനാകും. അതേസമയം, ഈ സാധ്യത ഇല്ലാതായാൽ പോലും സിനിമയെന്ന യഥാർത്ഥ സൂപ്പർതാരം നവീനതകളുടെ താരപ്രഭയോടെ നിലനിൽക്കുകയും ചെയ്യും.

1 Sore or cracked nipples

Sore nipples usually happens because your baby is not well positioned and attached at the breast.

Putting up with it could make pain or discomfort worse, so it's important to get help from your midwife, health visitor or breastfeeding specialist as soon as you can.

2 Not enough breast milk

When you first start breastfeeding, you may worry that your baby is not getting enough milk. It can take a little while before you feel confident that your baby is getting what they need. Offering your baby both breasts at each feed and alternating which breast you start with will help to stimulate your milk supply. So will keeping your baby close and holding them skin to skin.

3 Breast engorgement

Breast engorgement is when your breasts get too full of milk. They may feel hard, tight and painful. Engorgement can happen in the early days when you and your baby are still getting used to breastfeeding. It can take a few days for your milk supply to match your baby's needs. Engorgement can also happen when your baby is older and not feeding so frequently, perhaps when they start having solid foods.

4 Baby is not latching on properly

Breastfeeding is a skill that you and your baby need to learn together. It may take you both a while to get the hang of it. If you are finding breastfeeding painful or your baby does not seem to be satisfied after feeds, they may not be latching onto the breast properly.

5 Too much breast milk

Occasionally women make too much breast milk and their babies struggle to cope.

The advertising revenue of the pandemic hit cinema halls and multiplexes is steadily recovering; although it is still short of the pre-pandemic levels. While brand advertising in cinema halls is slowly increasing with back-to-back film releases and increased footfall, reduced government advertising has continued to put pressure on the revenues. 

Rajesh Mishra, Executive Director and Group CEO, UFO Moviez, the in-cinema advertising platform, said, “The success of big budget movies in April'22 and May'22 provided an impetus to all revenue streams, especially the corporate advertisement revenue that has seen a substantial recovery. Whereas the lag in government advertisement spending continued to put pressure on the overall advertisement revenue.” 

PVR witnessed massive growth coming from ticketing and F&B sales, it said in its Q1FY23 earnings report that the growth in advertising revenue continues to lag. The company has reported an advertising income of Rs 63 crore which is 32% lower than the pre-pandemic figures. In other words, it reflects a 68% recovery in advertising income vis-à-vis pre-pandemic levels.

Inox Leisure reported Rs 30 crore advertising revenue in Q1FY23, depicting a steady recovery.

According to GroupM’s TYNY report of 2022, cinema advertising is expected to reach Rs 635 crore, growing by 467% from the previous year’s ad spends on the medium. Before the pandemic, the ad spend on cinema was Rs 1008 crore in 2019. It dipped to Rs 175 crore in 2020 and then Rs 112 crore in 2021.

Most recently, PVR Cinemas announced its latest innovation in the in-cinema advertising space since its come back after the pandemic. It introduced 270-degree on-screen experiential in-cinema advertising. Maruti Suzuki has become the first advertiser to use this platform to launch its new 2022 Maruti Suzuki Brezza in cinemas. 

Recently, the merger of Inox Leisure with PVR has also received ‘No Objection Certificates’ from the two stock exchanges (BSE and NSE).

Another trend that has come to the fore and is acting as a buoyant force for the multiplexes is the growing appetite of the audience to consumer regional language films. For example, ‘KGF: Chapter 2’ and ‘RRR’ were a superhit across the country.

When the Indian team qualified for the very first time for the second round of Olympic Qualifiers, the federation (AIFF), the government, started believing in me.

They asked me what I wanted to do next. I just asked for more camps and tours. Then in 2019, I got four months with the girls including the travel, SAFF Championship, the four-nation tournament and the exposure trip to Turkey.

Arsenal travel to Switzerland for their opening game in the 22/23 Europa League. After failing to quality last season, The Gunners are yet to crack this competition. A devastating defeat in Baku & a semi final knockout vs Villarreal more recently, have stopped the Gunners getting hands on this silverware.

Of course, Champions League qualification is the minimum aspiration for the club, but conquering a European competition which has improved vastly over the years, would go a long way mentally for a young squad, would add a rare spot in Arsenal’s trophy variety in recent times and would be a good opportunity, in what’s aspired by the fans to be the last season in the Europa League, particularly with the new Champions League format coming into play in the coming years. 

The Europa League is a great opportunity to provide game time, to either promising youth such as how Bukayo Saka came onto the scene vs Frankfurt, but also an opportunity for backups to get minutes.

After Arsenal’s squad has been reduced drastically in size, there’s hardly any deadwood if any, so with that there’s very few 2nd choice players. This could be a pro, for better momentum to maintain into league games, but due to the already excessive fixture congestion, quite a few starters playing twice a week isn’t ideal. 

Turner, Cedric; Holding; Saliba/ Tomiyasu, Tierney, Lokonga, Xhaka, Vieira, Martinelli, Nketiah, Marquinhos/ Saka would be the team I’d largely anticipate tonight, and most group stage games.

I think the competition should be one Arsenal go very far in, and hopefully win. With the form, the quality, there’s no reason The Gunners can’t go all the way, and have that edge in the decisive games where they’ve fell short before.

A good group, for travel but also for quality, a manageable one to balance with the League & other cups.

It occurs when the varicella-zoster virus infects a nerve in the head.

The varicella-zoster virus that causes Ramsay Hunt syndrome is the same virus that causes chickenpox and shingles.
The virus is believed to infect the facial nerve near the inner ear in people with this syndrome. This leads to irritation and swelling of the nerve. Ramsay Hunt syndrome can occur in anyone who has had chickenpox. However, it's more common in older adults, typically affecting people older than 60. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is rare in children.

Ramsay Hunt syndrome isn't contagious. However, reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus can cause chickenpox in people who haven't previously had chickenpox or been vaccinated for it. In addition, the infection can be severe for people with immune system problems.

The symptoms include a painful red rash, blisters around the ear, and facial paralysis on the same side. Patients also report hearing loss in the ear that has been impacted apart from Tinnitus or ringing sounds. In addition, the inability to close the eye causes dryness.

Which hopefully won’t lead to confusion as the Kia Rookie Ladder heads into its final two weeks.

A race for the Kia Rookie of the Year award that was starting to look like so-called settled science has had an infusion of new data. The case for Cleveland’s Evan Mobley had been made week upon week by his reliability and his nuanced if rarely pulse-quickening game both offensively and defensively. He performed like a veteran almost from his debut on the Cavaliers’ front line, providing a boost beyond expectations for the No. 3 pick in the 2021 Draft.

But with Mobley’s sprained ankle Monday in Game 75 that could jeopardize his appearances — never mind his play — in the Cavs’ remaining games, the door to that ROY has been kicked open for Detroit’s Cade Cunningham or even Toronto’s Scottie Barnes to slip through.

Voters for the annual award might not budge off their assessments of the first five months, but they surely are obliged to take another look.

This is the time of year when team PR staffs slice and dice their prize rookies’ seasons to make compelling cases.

Sometimes baubles and trinkets get sent to voters’ homes as part of the campaigns (none of them ever seems to think of cash, alas). That typically is more of a show to the player and his peeps, that the team has his back, rarely flipping ballot order.

Then again, with Mobley, Cunningham and Barnes so tightly grouped on a tier distinctly above the rest of this unusually deep class, who’s to say an insightful stats or comps breakdown might not persuade as surely as a red-hot finish by one or more candidates.

After Cunningham’s 34-point night at Brooklyn Tuesday — including a Paul Pierce-like return from the trainer’s table for 29 in the second half — Kevin Durant gave the Pistons point guard one of those blurbs we usually see on movie posters.

Ott Tanak sembra averci preso gusto. Archiviata la vittoria di due settimane fa in Finlandia, a casa del grande 
rivale Kalle Rovanpera, il forte pilota estone è riuscito a fare suo anche il Rally Belgio, nona prova della 
stagione 2022 del Mondiale WRC. L’alfiere di casa Hyundai ha fatto sua la vittoria finale precedendo di soli 
cinque secondi la Toyota Yaris Rally1 di Elfyn Evans, con la vettura gemella di Esapekka Lappi a chiudere sul 
terzo gradino del podio. Weekend amaro per il leader del campionato Rovanpera, attardato in classifica per 
un incidente al venerdì, ma comunque in grado di limitare i danni portando a casa i punti per la vittoria nella 
power stage finale. Prossimo appuntamento con il Mondiale Rally nella seconda settimana di settembre, 
quando le auto torneranno a sfrecciare sugli sterrati del Rally Acropoli in Grecia.

As the world is becoming more aware of the importance of saving the environment, sustainability is what consumers embrace while purchasing products. Brands are also taking the added responsibility of making people aware of the current situation and adopting a lifestyle that plays a part in saving the rapidly depleting resources.

On June 5, also celebrated as World Environment Day, BestMediaInfo.com reached out to experts to understand the concept of sustainability and what goes into building a sustainable brand.

Anika Wadhera, Head - Marketing and Brand Communications at Sirona Menstrual Cups, explained that there are many elements to earning the title of a sustainable brand. The following ingredients are necessary to make the recipe of sustainable brand work, however, it may also need a seasoning of other elements to set the platter right for some individual brands.

UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): The first thing that brands must align themselves with is the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. These provide the foundation for a brand with values embedded in sustainability. It is imperative to identify the targets, outline a plan for the brand and create a strategy in alignment with them.  

A sustainable product or service: If a brand is not selling a sustainable product or service, it simply cannot be considered sustainable. Conduct an audit of the current product and processes to evaluate where you stand, if there are any red flags, work on eliminating them. If you cannot operate within this discussion of sustainability, harmonisation of these three pillars is to be considered through the lifecycle of what is being sold: 

Social sustainability: A healthy and cared for society is fundamental to a sustainable society. This is one of the parts of the sustainable frameworks that brands tend to overlook, which is a foundational necessity. 

Economic viability: This is the thread that is most commonly considered in the discussion of a sustainable brand. It entails how the product is produced, distributed and consumed. Organisations must not drive profits at the expense of the exploitation of the workers or the environment.

For a side who lost their manager and (arguably) best player last summer, their performances have been remarkable. Just how has unfancied Bruno Lage made the difference?
For all of his good work, Nuno Espírito Santo's last season had been disappointing. Injuries and a small squad meant Wolves finished 13th in 2020-21. The fans were a bit underwhelmed when Bruno Lage, a manager who had mostly coached youth teams before, was appointed as Santo's successor.
After 3 consecutive losses to begin the new season, some fears seemed justified. But with Wolves producing a higher xG than their opponents in each of those matches, a rise in fortunes seemed inevitable. It did happen, with Wolves losing just 4 of their next 19 games...conceding just 14 goals in the process. 
What exactly was responsible for the turnaround?
Lage initially played a fluid 4-at-the-back system which yielded no goals or points. He then decided to stick to the basics- a defensively solid 3-man backline which the players were very accustomed to playing. 
The results were instantaneous. Wolves currently have the joint 2nd best defence in Europe.
The 3-man defensive structure not only suits the regular starters, but also players coming through the ranks. In the Wolves academy, the 3-4-3 and 3-5-2 systems are used. As a result, academy players like Max Kilman have been the standout defenders in England this season. 
Then there is the signing of goalkeeper José Sá. His predecessor Rui Patricio had quite a mediocre season- conceding 3 goals more than xGA. Sá has clearly been an upgrade. The Portuguese sweeper-keeper has already prevented 6 more goals than xGA and claimed the 2nd most crosses in the PL. His commanding performances has instilled even more confidence among the Wolves defenders.
With a relative lack of squad depth and a lot of football still to play, a top 4 finish seems unlikely. But if Wolves manage to maintain performance levels, this might go down as one of the best defensive seasons in Premier League history.",2021-12-26 18:10:23,2021-12-26,"Sports, football, england, premier league, wolverhampton wanderers",en,en,en,en,On th February Wolverhampton Wanderers won against Tottenham Hotspur strengthening their chances of a top finish For a side who lost their manager and arguably best player last summer their performances have been remarkable Just how has unfancied Bruno Lage made the difference For all of his good work Nuno Esp rito Santo s last season had been disappointing Injuries and a small squad meant Wolves finished th in The fans were a bit underwhelmed when Bruno Lage a manager who had mostly coached youth teams before was appointed as Santo s successor After consecutive losses to begin the new season some fears seemed justified But with Wolves producing a higher xG than their opponents in each of those matches a rise in fortunes seemed inevitable It did happen with Wolves losing just of their next games conceding just goals in the process What exactly was responsible for the turnaround Lage initially played a fluid at the back system which yielded no goals or points He then decided to stick to the basics a defensively solid man backline which the players were very accustomed to playing The results were instantaneous Wolves currently have the joint nd best defence in Europe The man defensive structure not only suits the regular starters but also players coming through the ranks In the Wolves academy the and systems are used As a result academy players like Max Kilman have been the standout defenders in England this season Then there is the signing of goalkeeper Jos S His predecessor Rui Patricio had quite a mediocre season conceding goals more than xGA S has clearly been an upgrade The Portuguese sweeper keeper has already prevented more goals than xGA and claimed the nd most crosses in the PL His commanding performances has instilled even more confidence among the Wolves defenders With a relative lack of squad depth and a lot of football still to play a top finish seems unlikely But if Wolves manage to maintain performance levels this might go down as one of the best defensive seasons in Premier League history ,Wolves on the hunt: the Magic of Bruno Lage,0.00037107858,1.2326802e-06,3.0199102e-05,5.8485646e-05,0.00011379367,1.4884813e-05,1.2314158e-05,Europe,48.69096,9.14062,,0

Not only should it provide an accurate portrayal of the LGBTQ community, but it also helps to normalize these relationships for children. This can help remove some of the stigma associated with being LGBTQ, and make it easier for them to come out later on in life.
Some might argue that Disney already features a diverse range of characters within its storylines, so why bother adding LBGTQ+ characters? Well, there are a few reasons why this is important. For one thing, many young people don't see themselves represented accurately in popular culture; they need positive role models to look up to. Secondly, many kids who are LGTBQ+ may feel isolation or loneliness because they don't identify as 'completely straight' or 'completely gay.' Having mainstream media representations of those experiences can be very therapeutic - especially if those representations happen during childhood/ adolescence when memories are still fresh.
So what specific examples do we have from Disney's recent history of inclusive content? Not many.
All across Hollywood studios, LGBTQ representation is slowly but surely starting to change for the better thanks to pressure from allies and LGBTQ+ groups.

No.

""We may have lost our way a bit, but it’s not because we played poorly. Across all the three games that we played, there were several phases where we dominated our opponents. Our midfield play has been fine, and this experience will serve the youngsters well in the days to come.

Here’s what  found,"How are social media platforms managing vaccine misinformation at this stage in the pandemic?

Anti-vaccine sentiment has been building since 2020, and hasn’t gone anywhere. In fact, it will have intensified following the recent approval of COVID-19 vaccinations for some babies and children under five, and the recommendation for a fourth booster shot for people over 30.

And although anti-vaxxers can be found in most online spaces, Facebook has historically been one of their platforms of choice.

Swinburne PhD student Damilola Ayeni has been interviewing anti-vaccine activists since 2019, to learn about how they grow their audience on Facebook and how they evade moderation.

Her findings help shed light on the tug-of-war between Facebook’s content moderation efforts and an unrelenting slew of vaccine misinformation.

What’s been happening?

Facebook has been moderating content under the COVID-19 and vaccine policy. It does this by warning group admins and moderators, deleting offending accounts or groups, and flagging posts containing misinformation.

In its first response to Australia’s DIGI Misinformation and Disinformation Code, Facebook said it had “removed over 14 million pieces of content that constituted misinformation related to COVID-19” – of which 110,000 were from Australian pages.

Despite this, Facebook’s moderation approach has loopholes that anti-vaxxers continue to exploit. For instance, the ABC recently fact-checked anti-vaxxers who were spreading misinformation on Facebook by claiming COVID-19 vaccines were responsible for the sudden death of a Queensland toddler.

Ayeni’s research found anti-vax Facebook groups are now “self-moderating”. This means they predict what Facebook’s automated moderation tools and independent fact-checkers will be looking for, and change their posting techniques accordingly.

FGM പല  പേരിൽ നമ്മുടെ നാട്ടിൽ അറിയപ്പെടുന്നുണ്ട്. ചേലകർമം, സുന്നത് കല്യാണം  etc...  സ്ത്രീശരീരത്തിന്  ഒരു പ്രത്യേകത ഉണ്ട്. പൂർണമായും  സെക്സിനു വേണ്ടി ഉള്ള ഒരു organ നമുക്കുണ്ട്. അതിന്റെ പേരാണ് clitoris /കൃസരി. ഏകദേശം 8000 nerve കൾ ആണ് ഇവിടെ സംയോജിക്കുന്നത്. ഈ അവയവം  സ്ത്രീകളുടെ   sex pleasure കുറയ്ക്കാനായി മുറിച് മാറ്റുകയോ, മുറിവേൽപ്പിക്കുകയോ ചെയുന്നതാണ്  FGM. ലോകം  ഇത്രയും  പുരോഗമിച്ചു എന്ന് പറയുമ്പോഴും ഇത്തരം  വൃത്തികെട്ട മനുഷ്യന് തന്നെ  നാണക്കേടായ ഇങ്ങനൊരു ആചാരം ഇപ്പോഴും നിലനിന്നുപോരുന്നു എന്നതാണ് സത്യം. അതൊക്കെ പോട്ടെ ഇതൊക്കെ ചെയുന്നത് കൊണ്ട്  എന്തേലും ആർക്കേലും ഗുണം ഉണ്ടെങ്കിൽ പോട്ടെ... ഗുണമുണ്ട് ആചാരത്തിന്റെ  കാര്യം പറഞ്ഞു ഇത് ചെയ്തു  ക്യാഷ് തട്ടുന്നവന്മാർക് ഇതോണ്ട് ഗുണമുണ്ട്.. അല്ലാണ്ട് ആർക്കുമില്ല.


എന്തിന്  പറയണം  ഇങ്ങനെ ഒരു അവയവം സ്വന്തം ശരീരത്തിൽ ഉണ്ട് എന്ന് അറിയാത്തവരാണ്  ഭൂരിഭാഗം പേരും. ജനനേന്ദ്രിങ്ങൾ  കാണാണോ  സ്വയം  മനസ്സിലാക്കുതോ  എന്തോ  വലിയ തെറ്റാണെന്ന് കുട്ടികളെ പറഞ്ഞു  പഠിപ്പിക്കുകയാണ്. സെൽഫ് discovering വളരെ important ആണ്.. അവയവങ്ങളെ  പറ്റി മനസ്സിലാക്കാൻ മാത്രമല്ല  സ്വന്തം  ജൻഡർ ഐഡന്റിറ്റി  മനസ്സിലാക്കാൻ കൂടി  ഇത് സഹായിക്കും.

    ആഫ്രിക്ക, മിഡിൽ ഈസ്റ്റ്‌, ഏഷ്യ തുടങ്ങിയ  ഭാഗങ്ങളിൽ  ഇത് ഇപ്പോളും പിന്തുടർന്നു വരുന്നുണ്ട്. Sex കുഞ്ഞുങ്ങളെ ഉണ്ടാക്കാനാണെന്ന്  പറഞ്ഞു  പഠിപ്പിക്കുന്ന നമ്മുടെ നാട്ടിൽ ഇതൊക്കെ നടന്നില്ലേലെ അതിശയം ഉള്ളു. എന്തിന് പറയണം  സമ്പൂർണ  സാക്ഷരത  ഉള്ള നമ്മടെ കേരളത്തിൽ  പോലും ഇത് നടക്കുന്നുണ്ട്.2 ദിവസം മുൻപ് വന്ന വാർത്ത തെളിവുണ്ട്. ഒന്നോ രണ്ടോ മാസം മാത്രം പ്രായമുള്ള കുട്ടികളിലാണ് ഈ ക്രൂരത  ഏറ്റവും കൂടുതൽ നിലനിൽക്കുന്നത്. വളർന്നു അവർ പ്രായപൂർത്തി ആകുമ്പോ ഇങ്ങനെ ഒരു അവയവം ഉണ്ടായിരുന്നു എന്ന് പോലും അറിയാൻ പറ്റാത്ത അവസ്ഥ. ഒരു മെഡിക്കൽ സ്റ്റുഡന്റ് anatomy ക്ലാസ്സിൽ ഇത് മനസ്സിലാക്കിയ സംഭവം വരെ ഉണ്ട്


  ചേലകർമം  4 തരത്തിലാണ്  നിലനിൽക്കുന്നത്.
1. *clitoridectomy* 
    
അതായത്  clitoris പൂർണമായി  മുറിച് മാറ്റുന്ന രീതി.


2. *Excision* 

   അതായത്  clitorisum കൂടെ labia അതായത്  ചുറ്റുമുള്ള ചുണ്ട് പോലുള്ള ഭാഗം  അതും മാറ്റുന്ന രീതി


  3. *infibulation*
   
    ഇതൊരു  സീലിംഗ് process ആണ്.


4. സ്‌ട്രെച്ചിങ്, piercing,pricking...

 ഇത് കൊണ്ട് ഗുണമൊന്നും ഇല്ലെങ്കിലും ഇഷ്ടം  പോലെ ദോഷങ്ങൾ  ഉണ്ട്.

ബ്ലീഡിങ്, genital ഭാഗത്തു മുറിവുകൾ, ഹൈ ചാൻസ്  ഓഫ് ചൈൽഡ് death, mental trauma ഇങ്ങനെ ഒത്തിരി..


    ഏത് രീതി ആണെങ്കിലും ഇത് പൂർണമായ   മനുഷ്യാവകാശ ലംഘനമാണ്. കാടത്തമായ  ആചാരങ്ങളുടെ  പേരിലുള്ള  ഇത്തരം ചെയ്തികൾ  അവസാനിപ്പിക്കേണ്ടതാണ്.  മറ്റേതൊരു  മനുഷ്യനെയും പോലെ സ്ത്രീകൾക്കും sex pleasure നു ഉള്ള അവകാശമുണ്ട്, ഞങ്ങളും  മനുഷ്യരാണ്...

So he decided to visit the divine shrine of goddess Naina to fulfill his pledge. He went to the shrine as a monk but unfortunately the police got the information of his being in the shrine and they surrounded the shrine from all sides.

He being blessed with the boon of goddess jumped from the mountain and nothing happened to him.

Will Champion, the drummer and backup vocalist, joined the band later to round out the lineup. Coldplay became the band's moniker in 1998. Chris Martin recounted this in a Carpool Karaoke segment with James Corden.

The members of the band met at university in London, but they hail from all around the United Kingdom. Jonny Buckland is from London, whereas Chris Martin is from a village near Exeter in Devon. Will Champion is from Southampton, while Guy Berryman is from Kirkcaldy, Scotland.

A slice of Bethany Hills is always with you!","There can’t be a single student of Prof Abraham Joseph (AJ) who does not have a fond memory of him. AJ sir who died last Friday, was immensely talented and hugely popular, yet never shied away from speaking his mind.   

He could have risen higher, but he preferred keeping his feet on the ground and disliked some strings that power and position often bring along.   

He was 60. 

AJ was a vibrant student leader, amazing teacher, engaging quiz master and a writer. AJ wore many hats—all of them unassumingly.  I have learnt many lessons from AJ.  

As it ought to have been with great teachers, almost all of them came from outside the classroom.  

Since I too dabbled in student politics, he used to tell me many things about leadership. “Look at the eyes of the students and speak. That’s the first step to win confidence and trust.”  

He used to write down some thoughts using a Rotomac turquoise blue pen. “Prepare before you speak or write,” he used to tell me, especially after offering a ride in his blue Maruti Omni van. I realized what he meant once after I saw him interview Kiran Bedi for All India Radio. “As an icon of youth and a beacon of hope.....” I still remember some of his questions.  

Once after the selection of Kerala University for the national model parliament competition, first in a decade, he gave me a hug and said: “Good preparation to have come this far, but to go thus far, you need to do more.”  

Once he excused himself from giving a welcome speech at a function, saying that he prefers students to do the honours. On prodding, he later told me that he didn’t want to praise someone, which is a norm in such speeches, because he felt no genuine need for that. AJ stories, all of his students will tell you, are never ending.  

AJ used to say, wherever you go take a slice of Bethany Hills (hill in which Mar Ivanios College sits). He certainly has taken one with him to the other world. Rest in Peace, AJ sir.

Although Sydney fine dining is still very much trending downwards, Oncore by Clare Smyth has so far proven difficult to resist for gourmands, chefs and celebrities alike. As the first and only female British chef to hold a coveted three Michelin stars, Smyth comes to Sydney with a considerable reputation to uphold. Crown Sydney, too, needed something like this to really up the stakes for Sydney as a culinary capital that can compete with the arguably more well-known flavours of produce-obsessed (and spolit) Melbourne.

2. Pellegrino 2000, Surry Hills

Pellegrino 2000 is a wake-up call to Sydney’s Italian restaurants and a love-letter to those bold enough to tweak the traditions of a cuisine that quite often lives or dies on convention. Reliable chefs Dan Pepperell and Michael Clift and visionary wine guru Andy Tyson run this new Surry Hills restaurant much like they run Potts Point favourite Bistrot 916. 

3. Margaret, Double Bay

As we make the slow-crawl deeper into 2022, the biggest new opening in Sydney is now Double Bay’s Margaret. Australian fine dining royalty Neil Perry has stated this will be his last big project, an ambitious $5 million restaurant in one of the city’s most glamorous neighbourhoods.

4. Ursula’s, Paddington

A piece of Paddington’s dining scene broke when Guillaume Brahimi shut his eponymous fine-diner, vacating the charming 2-floor terrace on Hargrave Street in 2016.

Former Rockpool and Pt. Leo Estate chef Phil Wood has now turned the space into Ursula’s, framing inventive Modern Australian dishes with deep caramel walls and avant-garde light sculptures.

Australia looked in the box seat after Travis Head helped them to 6-291 on a slow wicket, before the hosts (4-292) were barely troubled completing their pursuit, with nine balls to spare, on Sunday.

Pathum Nissanka hit his maiden ODI century, with 137 in the chase, while Kusal Mendis managed 87 in a 170-run second-wicket stand between the pair before retiring, hurt, with cramp.

That helped Sri Lanka to their biggest-ever chase against Australia, as they went 2-1 up in the five-match series with back-to-back wins over the tourists for the first time in 20 years.

However, beyond this bilateral series, bigger questions continue to remain around Australia's bowling structure ahead of next year's World Cup in India.

With Adam Zampa back home on paternity leave, Australia decided not to play Mitchell Swepson.

They were also not helped by a dewy surface, at night, after initially winning the toss and batting, as the pitch sped up and turned less in the second innings.

Matthew Kuhnemann (0-61 from 10 overs) and Glenn Maxwell (1-44) were left as Australia's chief spinners, with Cameron Green (0-31 off five overs) preferred as a pace-bowling all-rounder ahead of Swepson.

Where the Sri Lankans were able to get great purchase out of their wrist-spinner, Jeffrey Vanderlay, and his return of 3-49, the tourists were forced to turn to Marnus Labuschagne (0-49) for seven overs of leg breaks.

""You can always look back at a lot of decisions and wonder what was the right one,"" captain Aaron Finch said.

""We still felt that was the right combination to go for on this wicket with how slow it looked.

""You saw in the first half of the game it was very stoppy and turned quite a bit.

There is, however, still the significant concern that a dangerous new variant could emerge.

This happened when omicron arrived, but we got lucky with that one. Omicron turned out to be more transmissible, but mercifully it hasn’t caused an increase in severe disease in most countries where it is dominant.

But this wasn’t guaranteed. Variants crop up randomly, and new ones have the potential to be more dangerous than previous ones. Another has just arrived, and is currently going by the name deltacron. It is – as you can probably guess – a hybrid of delta and omicron, the two variants dominant most recently.

Deltacron’s story begins in mid-February, when scientists at the Institut Pasteur in Paris uploaded a genetic sequence of the coronavirus that looked very different from previous sequences. The virus sample had come from an elderly man in northern France and looked odd. Most of its genetic sequence was the same as delta’s, which was dominant worldwide up until late last year, but the part of the sequence that encodes the virus’s spike protein – a key part of its external structure, which it uses to get inside cells in the body – came from omicron.

By March, three further hybrid genetic sequences had been reported, this time in the US. There are now over 60 logged, across France, the Netherlands, Denmark, the US and the UK.

There may, however, be different deltacrons. Scientists at the Institut Pasteur have said the deltacron sequences reported in the UK and US have certain differences from those found in other countries. They’ve said that it might be necessary to add a number to these different forms of deltacron, to indicate which is which.

The magnificent South American nation is home to Lionel Messi and Diego Maradona, two of the greatest footballers of all time. Argentina's long-running football rivalry with Brazil has been ingrained in the sport's DNA.

Argentina continues to produce excellent players even today. On the international scene, they have always had world-class talent representing them.

1.	Lautaro Martinez (Inter Milan)

Lautaro Martinez, Argentina's great striker, has recently established himself as a consistent goalscorer for both club and nation. Last season, the 24-year-old was a key figure in Inter Milan's Serie A championship.

Martinez has continued in similar vein this season, as he has played a key role in the Nerazzurri's title defence. In 38 games in all competitions this season, he has 16 goals and two assists.

2.	Lionel Messi (Paris Saint-Germain)

Lionel Messi is enjoying one of his worst seasons in his professional career. The fact that he is second on this list while underperforming tells a lot about the expectations he has set for himself. Messi is often considered to be the best footballer of all time. In 2021, he won a record-tying seventh Ballon d'Or.

Messi joined Paris Saint-Germain last summer, but life in the French domestic league has not been easy for him.

La rossa ha usato nel GP Monaco la prima power unit della stagione, approfittando della scarsa esigenza del tracciato monegasco, ma adesso la scelta diventa cruciale in vista della tappa di Baku: il circuito cittadino del GP Azerbaijan, è infatti caratterizzato da un settore centrale stretto e tortuoso, ma anche di un super

Ed è proprio per questo che la Ferrari dovrebbe optare per l’installazione sulla monoposto di Leclerc del terzo turbo e MGU-H della stagione, con la quasi certezza di finire in penalità prima della fine del campionato.

When I think of mental health and being trans, I think a lot about language and how language shapes the way we perceive each other and perceive ourselves, and how it is also taken away and erased from us, from banning LGBTQI+ related books and race-related books in the US to the NCERT trans-affirming guide in India. 

Why does it take so long for us to understand who we are and to describe who we are and to get the correct words to say who we are? Why are we raised with a ridiculously boring cis-het lingo? Why does it take 20 years for me to understand that I'm a twink?

When I started getting mental health care, there was a time my therapist sat me down in college and had this book open in front of them and was reading out this definition of anorexia and trying to make me understand myself through that lens. 

But I realized that that wasn't something that worked out for me because, no matter what mental health diagnosis I got, the core of the whole mental distress was that I was a trans person who was trying to erase themself without knowing who they were. 

A year or two down the line, my therapist from home really helped me – they used a practice called Narrative Therapy, that centered the words that I used to describe myself, and my experiences rather than viewing it through the lens of a certain mental health diagnosis.

That helped me a lot in distancing myself from the person I was trying to be and the person I wasn't. It gave me the tools to understand how my transness is not a mental health diagnosis and the tools for how to live. 

I think the medicalization of transness through mental health diagnoses is something that takes a lot of time to break down within yourself and to distance yourself from, when you are taught to view yourself through that medicalized lens.",2022-05-02 12:32:30,2022-05-02,"Health, Inequality, Education, transgender rights, transgender, trans youth, transgender community, transgender healthcare, transcare, transcare conference, mental health",en,en,en,en,Ragi Gupta from Pixstory on Affirmative experiences and its impact on trans health When I think of mental health and being trans I think a lot about language and how language shapes the way we perceive each other and perceive ourselves and how it is also taken away and erased from us from banning LGBTQI related books and race related books in the US to the NCERT trans affirming guide in India Why does it take so long for us to understand who we are and to describe who we are and to get the correct words to say who we are Why are we raised with a ridiculously boring cis het lingo Why does it take years for me to understand that I m a twink When I started getting mental health care there was a time my therapist sat me down in college and had this book open in front of them and was reading out this definition of anorexia and trying to make me understand myself through that lens But I realized that that wasn t something that worked out for me because no matter what mental health diagnosis I got the core of the whole mental distress was that I was a trans person who was trying to erase themself without knowing who they were A year or two down the line my therapist from home really helped me they used a practice called Narrative Therapy that centered the words that I used to describe myself and my experiences rather than viewing it through the lens of a certain mental health diagnosis That helped me a lot in distancing myself from the person I was trying to be and the person I wasn t It gave me the tools to understand how my transness is not a mental health diagnosis and the tools for how to live I think the medicalization of transness through mental health diagnoses is something that takes a lot of time to break down within yourself and to distance yourself from when you are taught to view yourself through that medicalized lens ,Trans-affirmative experiences | Breaking down mental health medicalizations of transness: Ragi,0.00044979865,1.6613529e-06,4.2639866e-05,7.935031e-05,0.0001188589,1.5445308e-05,1.728859e-05,British Indian Ocean Territory,-6.0,72.0,,90

The fashion industry is the second-biggest consumer of water and accounts for 8-10 per cent of global carbon emissions. Sometimes, it is very difficult to understand why one must keep replacing clothes that are perfectly fine, just to keep up with what is ‘in fashion’ currently. It is quite impossible to keep up with ever-changing fashion trends in the first place.  All over the world, major fashion events like the Paris or Milan Fashion weeks are held every year, only to prove that what was presented last year with the same pomp and show, can no longer be worn, and it must be replaced with what the models are presently wearing, while being paraded up and down flashy runways.
 
The concept merely reeks of consumerism and meaningless dictates by an industry that can only sustain itself by telling us whatever we are wearing is somehow wrong. 
 We were taught from a young age to donate rather than throw away, and that is what we must do any time we feel that we’ve outgrown something in our closet, physically or mentally. Be it household help or a nearby shelter, donating your older clothes is a cathartic experience, knowing that you will be clothing someone less fortunate with the choice you have made.
 
Another great way to make our fashion needs much more sustainable is by repurposing old clothes, which might have a slight tear or worn out fabric. Recently, actress Sonali Bendre appeared as a judge on a popular children’s dance show wearing a two-decade-old Rohit Bal jacket. Not only did she look stunning, but she also paved the way for sustainable fashion to become the future of fashion.
 
In a world where you can shop until your card is maxed out, let us redefine being a fashionista by rehashing our outfit, using smart styling hacks and making them look as amazing as they were when we first got them home.

Do magnets seek permission to pull people towards them? Faith is a very subjective issue. From Christians to Atheists every faith or faith in absence of faith should be respected. Politics comes with agendas, and differing opinions but should stand together in a nation. But what if religion marries politics? And politicians of all shades and regions have used religion to further their political agenda at some time or another. 
‌
In my opinion, ‌when religion comes into contact with politics there is a loss of freedom and peace. Favouritism prevails.  America is no different in this regard where evangelical Christians have played an important part in the journey of the Republican party.  It isn't easy for a non-Christian to succeed at the top level of US politics.  Judge Jackson said: “My faith and my religious beliefs do not play a role in judging"" this is good as it is always better to separate religion and politics. But can she really put aside her faith while judging? 
‌
‌Let's not forget about Russia; the notion of holy war it propagated. Just days after Putin's fiery announcement that he will invade Ukraine came the statement of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, head of the Russian Orthodox Church in which he congratulated Putin for his responsible service to the people of Russia. He praised the military service as “an active manifestation of evangelical love for neighbours.” Within hours, bombs began to pour down in Ukraine! Putin's theological groundwork did its job in Russia for the most affirming the war as holy in the minds.

নয়াদিল্লিঃ বিদেশ মন্ত্রী এস জয়শঙ্কর বলেছেন যে ভারত চিনের সাথে একটি সম্পর্ক বজায় রাখবে যা “পারস্পরিক” সংবেদনশীলতা, সম্মান এবং স্বার্থের উপর ভিত্তি করে। বুধবার এক সংবাদ সম্মেলনে দুই দেশের সম্পর্ক নিয়ে এক প্রশ্নের জবাবে তিনি এ মন্তব্য করেন।
এদিকে লাদাখ সীমান্তে আগ্রাসী মনোভাব দেখিয়েছিল চিন। গালওয়ান ভ্যালিকাণ্ডের (Galwan Valley) উদাহরণ দিয়ে স্বীকার করেন দিল্লির চিনা রাষ্ট্রদূত সান ওয়েডং (Chinese Ambassador Sun Weidong))। তাঁর কথায়, “গালওয়ান ভ্যালির ঘটনার পর জরুরি ভিত্তিতে জবাব দেওয়ার প্রয়োজন ছিল। কিন্তু সেই সমস্যার পরিসমাপ্তি ঘটেছে।” সীমান্তে অবস্থা এখন স্বাভাবিক বলেও দাবি করেছেন তিনি। এর পাশাপাশি তাইওয়ান এবং তিব্বত সমস্যা নিয়েও মুখ খুলেছেন ওই চিনা রাষ্ট্রদূত। “ভারত নিশ্চয়ই চিনের স্বার্থের দিকে খেয়াল রেখে সমস্ত বিষয়গুলি ঠিকমতো খতিয়ে দেখবে।” মন্তব্য করেছেন চিনা রাষ্ট্রদূত সান ওয়েডং।
 প্রসঙ্গত, এই প্রথম ভারত-চিন সীমান্ত সমস্যার সঙ্গেই তাইওয়ান সমস্যা নিয়ে একযোগে কথা বলল বেজিং। চিনের এই পদক্ষেপকে তাৎপর্যপূর্ণ বলেই মনে করছেন প্রতিরক্ষা বিশেষজ্ঞরা।
মঙ্গলবার চিনের ৭৩তম প্রতিষ্ঠা দিবস উপলক্ষ্যে দিল্লির দূতাবাসে একটি অনুষ্ঠান করে বেজিং। সেখানে চিনা রাষ্ট্রদূত সান ওয়েডং (Chinese Ambassador Sun Weidong) বলেন, “বর্তমান সীমান্তের অবস্থা অনেকটাই স্থিতিশীল। শান্তিপূর্ণভাবে সীমান্তের সমস্যা মিটিয়ে ফেলতে চিনের তরফ থেকে কূটনৈতিক এবং সামরিক স্তরে আলোচনা চালিয়ে যাওয়া হয়েছে।” 
এর পাশাপাশি, গোগরা-হট স্প্রিং এলাকা থেকে যে সম্পূর্ণ দুই দেশের সেনা সরে গিয়েছে, তা স্পষ্ট করে দিয়েছেন চিনা রাষ্ট্রদূত (Chinese Ambassador)। তাঁর কথায়, “প্রতিবেশী দেশকে কোনওভাবেই সরিয়ে দেওয়া সম্ভব নয়। চিন সবসময়ই প্রতিবেশী দেশের সঙ্গে সুসম্পর্ক বজায় রেখে চলতে চায়।”

Heaven, Hell, and the newly created third domain, Earth, serve as the backdrops for Paradise Lost. Satan fights God in battle. He is exiled from Heaven and sent to Hell for his outrageous endeavour.

Paradise Lost is something of a novel in itself with great writing, and shades of what was not common back in the day. Have a look at some of its quotes:

What makes a work of art art is its link and meaning to its creator. Musicians, visual artists, filmmakers, and other artists cannot be separated from their works because art is so personal.

Art may be a source of money as well as a method of personal expression. By donating to an artist's work, you are also donating to the artist. It isn't until the artist becomes problematic that the connection between art and the artist becomes a problem.

Reading Rowling's books promotes her career and ability to create more content, therefore it's impossible to separate the art from the artist. You can't buy a book from JK Rowling and disregard the fact that she is an outspoken transphobe since your purchase promotes her. It's exactly like boycotting Amazon for how they mistreat their workers. It's all business in the end. You are, in fact, supporting her when you buy something from her. It's that simple. Other than that, art is the greatest expression of an artist.

It is not to say you can't read Harry Potter again. Separating the art and the artist is in the end a personal decision—just like it becomes a personal decision when you choose to support exploitative companies, but to imply that art and its artist can be separated is kind of a long shot. However, it's also to keep in mind how you supporting the said artist is affecting her victims.

New Delhi: International Cricket Council (ICC) has had to tender an apology to India’s leading national daily The Times  of India for labelling one of its senior editors as a corrupt journalist during a live ZOOM press conference in July. 
Surprisingly, the newspaper silently and ‘graciously’ accepted the 200-word apology by Claire Furlong, General Manager - Marketing and Communications.

Even more interesting is the content of apology e-mail wherein ICC can be seen promising indirect favours to 'compensate’ TOI for its bizarre comedy of error and gold standard stupidity involving Claire Furlong herself in the presence of Greg Barclay, Chairman ICC and Geoff Allardice CEO, ICC.
The apology followed a comedy of errors at a virtual press conference arranged by the ICC but was also for an earlier tit-for-tat between the two parties.
Following the ICC Board meeting in July, ICC arranged a virtual press conference attended by Journalists from worldwide. 
After the briefing was over, ICC forgot to mute its mike which caught Furlong suggesting that K Shriniwas Rao of TOI was corrupt while she was talking formally to her bosses, Barclay and Allardice. As all three were heard discussing Indian journalists during the conversation, their laughing and chuckling are very much audible.

Infectious disease physician Patrick Jackson of the University of Virginia explains how it works, who’s eligible and why some patients are having difficulties accessing it.

1. What is Evusheld, and how does it work?

Evusheld is the first FDA-authorized drug to prevent COVID-19 in high-risk people who aren’t adequately protected by vaccination alone. Data from a preliminary study that has not yet been peer reviewed showed Evusheld reduced the risk of symptomatic COVID-19 by 77% in unvaccinated high-risk adults.

When the immune system is exposed to a foreign protein – for example, by infection or vaccination – it produces antibodies in response to the potential threat. Evusheld is a combination of two antibodies, tixagevimab and cilgavimab, that bind to the spike protein of the virus that causes COVID-19 and prevent it from entering and infecting cells. Evusheld is a monoclonal antibody drug, meaning that it is made of mass-produced identical antibodies that originally came from a single type of white blood cell. Evusheld functions differently from antiviral drugs like molnupiravir, which work by stopping the virus from replicating within cells.

Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are versions of natural human antibodies that have been modified to last much longer in the body than they normally would. This allows Evusheld to provide COVID-19 protection for several months following a single dose. It is expected that Evusheld will need to be given about every six months to keep antibody levels high enough to be effective against the virus. Patients may need to keep getting Evusheld doses as long as there is a significant risk of COVID-19.

Evusheld is not intended to treat COVID-19, but to help prevent vulnerable patients from getting sick in the first place.

2. Who should be receiving Evusheld?

🌱 Flax Seeds: Flax seeds are high in fibre, protein, omega-3 fatty acids, thiamine, and copper. With so much fibre packed into each tiny seed, they help you feel fuller for longer, which aids in weight loss.

🌱 Chia Seeds: These seeds are high in antioxidants and are high in fibre, protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and other minerals.

🌱 Halim seeds: They help with hair loss. Elatim seeds contain around 12 mg of iron, which helps to improve haemoglobin levels in the body. They are also high in protein, which can help you avoid hunger pangs or overeating. Halim seeds contain phytochemicals that mimic oestrogen, which can help you manage irregular periods. Regularizing hormones is a natural technique to normalise irregular menstrual periods.

No one knew how distant Bagaha was from there, but they made different types of guesses. Our tiring foot journey had begun. We left some local officers there for planning ambush parties in the night time. When we reached the other side of the diara, we had walked for almost 35 kilometers in very difficult terrain. We had to cross minor streams at least 20 times. The time was 8.00 pm when we reached Bagaha side of the river. We sat in the vehicles to reach Bagaha, and almost everyone had bruises, and had been very tired. I told the STF commander to be prepared for another raid, the next morning which I later cancelled on phone in the night. They were very happy to know about the cancellation, which they told me later. 

Even though the massive raid was not successful in its motive, it had a great impact on the psyche of the dacoit gangs. We later realized this when one of the kidnapped persons returned back home and informed us that he had seen us in that operation from a distance of just about 20 meters. All the dacoits were hiding in a sugarcane field while we were moving towards Bagaha. He had then been warned not to make noise and so had kept silent. The gangs saw the scale and determination of the police and were not to be seen in the diara for moths to come.

‌
‌ Lynching is a symbol of the oppression of African Americans. Anti-lynching movements started as a movement; with major proponents being African Americans. 
‌
‌The first recorded lynching in the United States was in 1835 in St. Louis when an accused killer of a deputy sheriff was captured while being taken to jail. It was years of struggle from then by the activists for this movement in history. 
‌
‌The law has a history of more than 100 years and 200 failed attempts by US lawmakers to pass anti-lynching legislation. The act was named The Emmett Till Antilynching Act; after a black teenager whose brutal murder in Mississippi in 1955 helped spur the civil rights movement.
‌
‌According to the BBC; as a result of this bill; perpetrators of a lynching, death or injury resulting from a hate crime will face up to 30 years in jail. The Senate passed the bill unanimously earlier this month.
‌
‌The death of Floyd, as well as the murder of Ahmad Arbery - who was hunted down and shot by three white men in Georgia in 2020, can be considered modern-day lynchings. 
‌
‌Biden marked his historic words: ""Thank you for never giving up, never ever giving up. Lynching was a pure terror to enforce the lie that not everyone, not everyone, belongs in America, not everyone is created equal. Racial hate isn't an old problem - it's a persistent problem.

The Double Asteroid Redirection Test – or DART – was meant to test one potential strategy for preventing an asteroid from colliding with Earth. The collision occurred on Sept. 27, 2022, and on Oct. 11, 2022, NASA announced that the mission had successfully changed the orbit of the asteroid Dimorphos. David Barnhart is a professor of astronautics at the University of Southern California and director of the Space Engineering Research Center there. He watched NASA’s live stream of the successful mission and explains what happened.1. What do the images from DART show?The first images, taken by a camera aboard DART, show the double asteroid system of Didymos – about 2,500 feet (780 meters) in diameter – being orbited by the smaller asteroid Dimorphos, which is about 525 feet (160 meters) long.As the targeting algorithm on DART locked onto Dimorphos, the craft adjusted its flight and began heading toward the smaller of the two asteroids. The image taken at 11 seconds before impact and 42 miles (68 kilometers) from Dimorphos shows the asteroid centered in the camera’s field of view. This meant the targeting algorithm was fairly accurate and the craft would collide right at the center of Dimorphos.The second-to-last image, taken two seconds before impact, shows the rocky surface of Dimorphos, including small shadows. These shadows are interesting because they suggest that the camera aboard the DART spacecraft was seeing Dimorphos directly on but the Sun was at an angle relative to the camera. They imply the DART spacecraft was centered on its trajectory to impact Dimorphos at the moment, but it’s also possible the asteroid was slowly rotating relative to the camera.Read more: https://theconversation.com/nasa-successfully-shifted-an-asteroids-orbit-dart-spacecraft-crashed-into-and-moved-dimorphos-192317",2022-04-20 11:35:32,2022-04-20,"Technology, History, Food, Entertainment, Sports, Climate change , Environment, Science, Inequality, Education, Health, Politics, Economy",en,en,en,en,NASA recently crashed a spacecraft into an asteroid in an attempt to push the rocky traveler off its trajectory The Double Asteroid Redirection Test or DART was meant to test one potential strategy for preventing an asteroid from colliding with Earth The collision occurred on Sept and on Oct NASA announced that the mission had successfully changed the orbit of the asteroid Dimorphos David Barnhart is a professor of astronautics at the University of Southern California and director of the Space Engineering Research Center there He watched NASA s live stream of the successful mission and explains what happened What do the images from DART show The first images taken by a camera aboard DART show the double asteroid system of Didymos about feet meters in diameter being orbited by the smaller asteroid Dimorphos which is about feet meters long As the targeting algorithm on DART locked onto Dimorphos the craft adjusted its flight and began heading toward the smaller of the two asteroids The image taken at seconds before impact and miles kilometers from Dimorphos shows the asteroid centered in the camera s field of view This meant the targeting algorithm was fairly accurate and the craft would collide right at the center of Dimorphos The second to last image taken two seconds before impact shows the rocky surface of Dimorphos including small shadows These shadows are interesting because they suggest that the camera aboard the DART spacecraft was seeing Dimorphos directly on but the Sun was at an angle relative to the camera They imply the DART spacecraft was centered on its trajectory to impact Dimorphos at the moment but it s also possible the asteroid was slowly rotating relative to the camera Read more ,NASA successfully shifted an asteroid’s orbit – DART spacecraft crashed into and moved Dimorphos,0.007781552,2.1946628e-06,0.00019519747,0.00013690091,0.004851608,2.4618843e-05,4.168263e-05,,,,,0

And that is the reason Swapna Barman says that while her two-gold effort in the National Games Athletics competition at the IIT Gandhinagar campus gives her happiness, she is not satisfied with her own performance in her favourite event, the Heptathlon. She claimed the High Jump gold with a Games record clearance of 1.83m and added gold in the gruelling seven-event contest spread over two days. “After winning a surprise gold in the High Jump, which I had not trained for, I did not complete my recovery as well as I wanted to. That affected my Heptathlon performance,” the 25-year-old said. Swapna Barman topped three events – 100m Hurdles and High Jump on the first day and Javelin Throw yesterday – and was second best in Shot Put and Long Jump to insure against her weak efforts in the 200m at the end of the opening day and 800m, the final event of the competition.The 2018 Asian Games champion and 2019 Asian Championships silver medallist hinted that not having support staff was a reason. “Since I do not have a sponsor to fund a trainer and physiotherapist, I tried to complete the recovery process myself. But I guess that was not enough and I felt drained of energy when I reported to the call room for Heptathlon,” she said.

They weren’t awful like the previous season, when Stephen Curry missed all but five games with a hand injury and Klay Thompson was out for the first of two full years. They were something far worse for a franchise that prides itself on being light years ahead of the innovation curve. They were … normal.

While Curry turned back the clock to his glory days, the Warriors were .500 and near the bottom of the West’s play-in picture. A roster that once proudly boasted of its Strength in Numbers motif had decayed into an awkward mix of declining past heroes, ill-fitting castoffs and unprepared youth struggling to adopt to a movement-based offensive system that was beginning to seem antiquated as NBA Heliocentrism rose in prominence. 

It was around this time — March 1, 2021, to be specific — that Jordan Poole returned from his second G League assignment in as many years. When the Warriors recalled him four games early after a rash of injuries, it didn’t just signify the turning point of his career. It marked the beginning of Warriors 2.0. Just as a young Kawhi Leonard once was supposed to be for San Antonio, Poole has become the connective tissue that stitches the Warriors’ glorious past to its bright future, allowing them to cheat the eventual death that comes within a normal franchise’s life cycle. 

The 2022 NBA playoffs may be Poole’s breakout stage, but his emergence has been bubbling beneath the surface since the moment he returned from ESPN’s Wide World of Sports Complex at Disney World, site of the 2021 G League bubble. His style of play since that day epitomizes the peak version of the Warriors. He moves constantly, squirming around screens like a slalom skier. His shot selection is audacious by design, pulling defenders out beyond the 3-point line to open up driving lanes and backdoor cuts by teammates.

But the Lakers do have some of their own free agents that they could try to re-sign and chief among them is guard Malik Monk.

Monk had a career year last season with the Lakers, becoming one of the team’s most consistent players with his ability to create offense for himself and others. But the Lakers are limited in what they could offer Monk as the most they could do is the taxpayer mid-level exception worth $6 million.

As an unrestricted free agent, Monk will likely command much more than that on the open market. But in an interview with Jovan Buha of The Athletic, Monk admitted that he would be willing to take less money in order to remain with the Lakers:

“They might not be able to pay me as much as I want,” Monk said. “But I could be here and be way more comfortable as a Laker than going to any other team and they’re paying me $5 million more. So it’s just me trying to figure out what team would really want me.”

Monk truly came into his own with the Lakers last season, averaging career-highs in points, rebounds, assists, steals and field goal percentage. He was a great compliment to both LeBron James and Anthony Davis and provides a knockdown shooter and scorer around the Lakers’ stars.

But while Monk is open to the idea of remaining with the Lakers, he is not ruling anything out in regards to free agency and plans to evaluate all possibilities:

“I definitely would still want to evaluate things,” Monk said. “You never know what happens. Some other team could come in and hopefully tell me the same thing and maybe I get a little bit more minutes on that team. So it’s just actually me being presented and being able to go out there and do what I do is a priority.",2022-04-22 22:28:41,2022-04-22,"basketball, nba, la lakers",en,en,en,en,Much of the focus heading into the free agency period for the Los Angeles Lakers is on current Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving and whether or not he will be in purple and gold next season But the Lakers do have some of their own free agents that they could try to re sign and chief among them is guard Malik Monk Monk had a career year last season with the Lakers becoming one of the team s most consistent players with his ability to create offense for himself and others But the Lakers are limited in what they could offer Monk as the most they could do is the taxpayer mid level exception worth million As an unrestricted free agent Monk will likely command much more than that on the open market But in an interview with Jovan Buha of The Athletic Monk admitted that he would be willing to take less money in order to remain with the Lakers They might not be able to pay me as much as I want Monk said But I could be here and be way more comfortable as a Laker than going to any other team and they re paying me million more So it s just me trying to figure out what team would really want me Monk truly came into his own with the Lakers last season averaging career highs in points rebounds assists steals and field goal percentage He was a great compliment to both LeBron James and Anthony Davis and provides a knockdown shooter and scorer around the Lakers stars But while Monk is open to the idea of remaining with the Lakers he is not ruling anything out in regards to free agency and plans to evaluate all possibilities I definitely would still want to evaluate things Monk said You never know what happens Some other team could come in and hopefully tell me the same thing and maybe I get a little bit more minutes on that team So it s just actually me being presented and being able to go out there and do what I do is a priority ,Malik Monk Reiterates Willingness To Take Less Money To Stay With Lakers,0.0004414109,1.0280952e-06,2.8542972e-05,5.4776323e-05,0.00014726091,1.293949e-05,1.0064895e-05,Brooklyn,40.6501,-73.94958,,0

A few years ago, my association with an Ngo CFar changed many things for me I got involved more systematically in the welfare of all the Ashram inmates. During covid pandemic and susbsquent lockdowns I could arrange medicines, food and also doctors when needed.
I am not restricted to working for just the Ashram but also work for the entire Anand Parbat area which has around 20,000 population. FRom door to door surverys regarding health and hygiene to advocacy during covid or even clearing general perceptions about covid vaccination. 
I am involved with everything.
These years have been a time of struggle, but I have come a long way. I remember when we used to go to schools we were made to sit seperately and teacher would ask other students to maintain distance. Our children didnt face this much discrimination.However getting jobs is a still a problem, even if we had a leprosy patient in the family years ago, even than the stigma remains. Sometimes people for the fear of dicrimination would not even say they are from leprosy ashram. MY sisters daughter was working for a month in a house, after a month the employers asked ID proof .. the moment they saw address on her Aadhar she was asked to leave.Things have definitely changed  but more change is required.  My son who has done his class 12 and did a computer course, I hope he doesn't have to lie to get a job. 
I am thankful to God that we have come a long way, but we hope our children get better accepted and better education and work opportunities. I am trying hard to realise this dream in what ever way I can.

In the seventh minute of their Premier League match on Saturday, Arsenal and Manchester United fans came together to show their solidarity for Cristiano Ronaldo following the death of his newborn son.

Fans from both sides cheered the Portugal international, who was playing for the first time since admitting he and his partner, Georgia Rodriguez, had lost their lives in the tragic accident.

After Liverpool and United supporters applauded in the seventh minute of their Premier League match on Tuesday, this is the second time such a homage has occurred.

Both sets of supporters at Emirates Stadium stood to applaud Ronaldo and his family, paying a great homage to him and his family.

Arsenal supporters applauded Ronaldo on as he walked onto the pitch for his pre-match warm-up, despite the Portuguese star missing the Liverpool encounter due to compassionate leave.

In the home and away ends, there were also banners showing support for Ronaldo, and he was spotted thanking the Arsenal supporters for their homage.

On Monday evening, he and Rodriguez shared their heartbreaking news on Instagram. She was pregnant, and the couple was expecting twins, but only the baby girl lived tragically.

Following the Liverpool match, Ronaldo returned to training on Wednesday and expressed his gratitude to both sets of supporters for their support.

Ronaldo and Rodriguez's other children, Cristiano Junior, Eva, Mateo, and Alana Martina, released the first photo of their newborn girl on Thursday.

""Home is where the heart is. Finally, Gio and our baby girl have joined us. ""He expressed himself on social media.

years still within grasp, Manchester City’s reputation as one of the most entertaining
teams in modern-day football is not in question.

However, the club has gone back to the 1960s searching for inspiration for their new
home kit and modelled by Jack Grealish, Phil Foden, Vicky Losada and Laura Coombs,
the shirt as a homage to the free-flowing City sides of the era.

City won the second division league title in 1965-66, the first division title in 1967-68,
The FA Cup the following year and then topped off their impressive run by winning the
European Cup Winners’ Cup in 1969-70 with the likes of Collin Bell playing an
instrumental role in all the success.

Bell came to personify the swagger and flair with which those classic all-out-attack City teams came to be associated and is rightly held up as one of the finest players to ever
don a sky blue shirt. One of the stands in Etihad is already named under his honours.

And it is the legacy of Bell and his teammates that City have chosen to revisit with their
home jersey which is directly influenced by the kits worn during that period.

While the shirts and shorts were familiar combinations of light blue and white, the socks
worn and tracksuit tops worn by City players at the same time also carried flashes or
maroon trim in the form of bands, cuffs and stripes.

A further tribute to Bell can be found tucked inside the neckline where a golden crown

These don’t happen overnight — some will take time to develop and some can be implemented immediately. But all of them require conscious work from your side.

Here are 6 steps to help you stop overthinking.

1. Change The Story You Tell Yourself

2. Let Go of The Past
Overthinkers often ruminate about the past. 
When they so do, they’re exerting energy on the “what if” and “I wish” and “I should have”… But that energy is removing them from the present moment.
The past cannot be changed — but you can change the lessons, meanings and perspectives you extract from it.

3. Stop Your Thoughts in The Moment and Practice Being Present
In the heat of overthinking, stop and say: 
“No. I’m not going to have these thoughts right now. I’m not going to give in.”
Bring your attention to where you are here and now.Breathe. Focus. 

4. Focus on What You Can Control 
When you find yourself worrying, take a minute to examine the things you have control over.”
First, acknowledge what’s on your mind. Second, take a step back and broaden your perspective. 

5. Identify Your Fears
Very often, it’s the irrational fears that arise in our minds that lead to overthinking.

6.

An early brace, after the grit and resilience he displayed against Chelsea two weeks ago really has the people talking. This has been a fantastic breakthrough season for the Englishman, but he now also stands in a position wherein he's forced to make a decision on his immediate future.


“I don’t think he’ll ever end up being the first-choice striker. I think it’d be better if he moved on."" Carragher remarked.


Furthermore, Nketiah himself added some thoughts after the game.


“It’s amazing. It’s always nice to score. It’s a big three points. We’re working hard, we want to give it to the fans. It’s amazing to get the three points and it moves us closer to the top four.

Astory Co. has rallied 82% in July, boosted by the instant hit of “Extraordinary Attorney Woo” released at the end of June. The courtroom drama about a rookie lawyer with autism spectrum disorder was the most watched non-English show on Netflix during the two weeks ended July 17.

The sharp gains for Astory, one of Korea’s leading drama producers, follows a months-long slump that saw the stock shed nearly 70% from its October high. Korea’s entertainment stocks have been much sought-after following a number of blockbuster hits and the growing appeal of its pop culture, with popular shows delivering stock price gains to companies involved in their production and distribution.

“We can expect more profit in the future as many channels are already proposing the second season,” Ji InHae, an analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp., said in a report.

Shares of Korean drama and other content companies jumped Wednesday after Netflix’s earnings results showed customer growth in Asia, helping the streaming giant offset declines in the US and Europe. Bucket Studio Co. and Pan Entertainment Co. surged more than 12% each.
Other stocks have also benefited from the popularity of “Extraordinary Attorney Woo.” Satellite broadcasting provider KT Skylife Co., which owns the Korean channel that airs the legal drama, saw its stock price rise over 11% so far this month. The benchmark Kospi has gained less than 2% during the period, while the smaller Kosdaq Index advanced 5%.

“Skylife is expected to see a level-up in its ads revenues and increased competitiveness in its channel,” said Ji.

Experts collating the numbers of casualties in Ukraine report that Russia is failing to acknowledge it has killed civilians in its military action, just as it did in Syria, where Russia began its military engagement in support of the Assad government in 2015 with intense airstrikes and artillery actions.

Russian officials and state media claim they are only attacking military sites. To date, Russia has not publicly accepted responsibility for a single civilian death in Ukraine.

Biden’s comment came after Russian forces had bombed a maternity and children’s hospital in southern Ukraine, injuring at least 17 people in the attack.

At least 13 people were killed in a Russian attack on an industrial bakery in Makariv, west of Kyiv, and it was estimated by the UN’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) that two weeks into the Russian invasion at least 549 Ukrainian civilians had been killed, 41 of them children, rising to 780 killed (722 adults and 58 children) by March 17.

According to Kharkiv regional police, between February 24, when the invasion began, and March 7, 133 civilians were killed, five of them children. An attack documented by Human Rights Watch included the case of a man who was killed as he waited in line outside a supermarket.

But the OHCHR believes that the overall figures of civilian deaths are considerably higher than local estimates. This is because individual civilian reports from locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still awaiting corroboration.

The office of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, claims 1,500 residential buildings, 202 schools and 34 hospitals have been shelled across the country.

Ukraine’s defence ministry has said that Russia has lost 14,200 military personnel, while Ukrainian forces destroyed 450 Russian tanks, 1,448 armoured vehicles, 93 planes, 112 helicopters and 12 drones.

The pledge consists of $750 million over three years for a new ""Strengthening Medicare"" fund which aims to improve patient access to GPs including after hours, decrease pressure on hospitals and better manage complex and chronic conditions.

It also includes $220 million for grants of up to $50,000 for GPs to train staff, upgrade IT telehealth systems, buy equipment and improve ventilation and infection control.

If Anthony Albanese wins on May 21, Labor will also create a Medicare task force that will be chaired by the health minister and include peak body groups such as the Australian Medical Association, Royal Australian College of GPs and the National Aboriginal Controlled Community Health Organisation.

""Every day, everywhere I go, people talk to me about how it's getting more and more difficult to see a doctor,"" Mr Albanese said.

""Australians trust their GPs. It's a vital relationship in ensuring all Australians get the quality healthcare they deserve.""

The plan was immediately welcomed by Australian Medical Association (AMA) president Omar Khorshid who said it ""put general practice on a pathway to a more sustainable future"".

In 2019 Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a 10-year Primary Healthcare Fund, but the AMA has accused the Coalition of stalling on the promise.

""The primary care fund announced today by the ALP, if implemented, is a strong down payment that will help realise the recently completed 10-year primary health care plan — a plan which has remained completely unfunded by the government,"" Dr Khorshid said.

""The ALP's primary care fund pledge will allow investment in programs that will improve access to services for patients including GP after-hours services and the Workforce Incentive Program. We welcome the ALP commitment to work with the AMA on the implementation of primary-care reform.""

With recent advances in artificial intelligence and robotics technology, there is growing interest in developing and marketing household robots capable of handling a variety of domestic chores.
Tesla is building a humanoid robot, which, according to CEO Elon Musk, could be used for cooking meals and helping elderly people. Amazon recently acquired iRobot, a prominent robotic vacuum manufacturer, and has been investing heavily in the technology through the Amazon Robotics program to expand robotics technology to the consumer market. In May 2022, Dyson, a company renowned for its power vacuum cleaners, announced that it plans to build the U.K.’s largest robotics center devoted to developing household robots that carry out daily domestic tasks in residential spaces.
Despite the growing interest, would-be customers may have to wait awhile for those robots to come on the market. While devices such as smart thermostats and security systems are widely used in homes today, the commercial use of household robots is still in its infancy.
As a robotics researcher, I know firsthand how household robots are considerably more difficult to build than smart digital devices or industrial robots.
Handling objects
One major difference between digital and robotic devices is that household robots need to manipulate objects through physical contact to carry out their tasks. They have to carry the plates, move the chairs and pick up dirty laundry and place it in the washer. These operations require the robot to be able to handle fragile, soft and sometimes heavy objects with irregular shapes.
The state-of-the-art AI and machine learning algorithms perform well in simulated environments. But contact with objects in the real world often trips them up. This happens because physical contact is often difficult to model and even harder to control.

Chandigarh: Close on the heels of AAP lawmakers caught reprimanding government officials in Ludhiana and Jalandhar, another controversy rocked the four-month-old Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Punjab. 

The medical fraternity of the state is outraged after Punjab health minister Chetan Singh Jouramajra made the vice-chancellor (VC) of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences lie down on one of the soiled patient beds during his inspection of the university’s constituent medical college in Faridkot on Friday. 

Felt insulted by the minister’s act, VC Dr. Raj Bahadur resigned from the post a day later on Saturday as his admirers - from politicians to journalists to all weather experts - blamed the minister for “overstepping” and sought his apology.

This also prompted Amritsar’s Government Medical College director-principal Dr. Rajiv Kumar Devgan and medical superintendent, Dr. KD Singh, to resign from their posts.

In the first place, the key focus of the issue should have been on the pitiable condition of the state’s health institutes, so much so that patients are made to sleep on damaged and soiled mattresses despite the annual budget of the Punjab health department running into over Rs. 3,000 crores in the past several years. 

VC’s admirers spinned the AAP minister’s act in another direction, with the opposition milking it as another example of “high-headedness” and “cheap” PR stunt of the new AAP government in Punjab. 

But the issue in hindsight is much deeper than AAP’s optics or din over VC. Punjab’s health system is literally on its deathbed and the remedy is missing.

Only 29% come for treatment in Punjab govt hospitals

75th round of data of the National Sample Survey conducted between 2017-18 and released in 2019 revealed that just 29% of the state's 3 crore population goes to government hospitals for treatment. 

A whopping 66% of the state population are forced to go to private hospitals for treatment, while 5% are dependent on hospitals run by charitable trusts/NGOs, the data revealed.

As per the data, the percentage of the population seeking treatment in private hospitals is the same in both urban and rural areas of the state.

US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan on August 2, 2022, amid tensions with China. Nancy Pelosi issued a statement after arriving in Taiwan. In the official address, she said that the visit of the American congressional delegation to Taiwan honours the country’s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan’s vibrant democracy.

Against this backdrop, a video of multiple fighter planes flying simultaneously is viral on social media. This video has been recorded from a ship in the middle of the sea. While sharing the clip, many have claimed that US Navy fighter jets were seen flying near Taiwan ahead of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan.

Journalist Aji Rasheed Ali associated with Zee Media tweeted the video and wrote that the world was on the verge of World War III as US Navy warplanes were flying near Taiwan. He added, “Before Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, there were still many strong statements from China. Tension in the region has reached its highest level.”

Tomljanovic kept the Australian women's tilt alive with her straight-sets win over Catherine Harrison, while world number 40 Kyrgios took down 26th seed Filip Krajinovic.

Alex de Minaur, meanwhile, staged a massive comeback against Britain's Jack Draper, avoiding falling two sets behind before surging to a pulsating 5-7, 7-6 (7-0), 6-2, 6-3 win on Friday.

Both Kyrgios and Tomljanovic won through in under an hour-and-a-half, with Kyrgios's 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 victory over Krajinovic likely a welcome relief after he started his tournament with a dramatic, three-hour, five-set battle against British wildcard Paul Jubb.

Kyrgios worked his serve expertly on his way to victory over Croatian Krajinovic, winning more than a quarter of his 91 points with aces, and winning 37 of 40 points when he landed his first serve.

Krajinovic did not get a look at a single break point, as Kyrgios ripped 50 winners past him while only making 10 unforced errors.

The win set up an exciting third-round match-up with fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, who Kyrgios beat on grass earlier this month in Halle.

Tsitsipas ousted Australian Jordan Thompson 6-2, 6-3, 7-5 on court number one.

While Kyrgios had the company of a few compatriots in the second round of the men's draw, Tomljanovic is the only Aussie on the women's side.

The top-ranked Australian woman heading into the tournament, after defending champion Ash Barty's shock retirement in March, took down unheralded American Catherine Harrison 6-2, 6-2 in 86 minutes.

Tomljanovic is ranked 44th in the world, far above Harrison's 262, and the match played out that way.

She lost just four points as she rattled off the last four games to run through the finish line.

The first set was more of a contest, with the third game including 10 deuces, but it appeared Harrison ran out of steam by the end.

Finally, Australian number one Alex de Minaur was pushed to the very edge against Draper on Friday, with rain forcing the second-round match to be stopped for almost an hour.",2022-04-06 01:14:34,2022-04-06,"Sports, australia, tennis, wimbledon",en,en,en,en,Nick Kyrgios Ajla Tomljanovic and Alex de Minaur have powered into the third round of Wimbledon with the former two wasting little time dispatching their opponents Tomljanovic kept the Australian women s tilt alive with her straight sets win over Catherine Harrison while world number Kyrgios took down th seed Filip Krajinovic Alex de Minaur meanwhile staged a massive comeback against Britain s Jack Draper avoiding falling two sets behind before surging to a pulsating win on Friday Both Kyrgios and Tomljanovic won through in under an hour and a half with Kyrgios s victory over Krajinovic likely a welcome relief after he started his tournament with a dramatic three hour five set battle against British wildcard Paul Jubb Kyrgios worked his serve expertly on his way to victory over Croatian Krajinovic winning more than a quarter of his points with aces and winning of points when he landed his first serve Krajinovic did not get a look at a single break point as Kyrgios ripped winners past him while only making unforced errors The win set up an exciting third round match up with fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas who Kyrgios beat on grass earlier this month in Halle Tsitsipas ousted Australian Jordan Thompson on court number one While Kyrgios had the company of a few compatriots in the second round of the men s draw Tomljanovic is the only Aussie on the women s side The top ranked Australian woman heading into the tournament after defending champion Ash Barty s shock retirement in March took down unheralded American Catherine Harrison in minutes Tomljanovic is ranked th in the world far above Harrison s and the match played out that way She lost just four points as she rattled off the last four games to run through the finish line The first set was more of a contest with the third game including deuces but it appeared Harrison ran out of steam by the end Finally Australian number one Alex de Minaur was pushed to the very edge against Draper on Friday with rain forcing the second round match to be stopped for almost an hour ,"Nick Kyrgios, Ajla Tomljanovic, and Alex de Minaur reach Wimbledon third round",0.0022114073,7.3052497e-06,7.612955e-05,0.0018392754,0.0004363745,4.5072524e-05,0.00023014174,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,54.75844,-2.69531,,100

Even those who have been affected by Covid-19 before are getting infected but the vaccine protects them against serious illness.
Health officials are advising anyone over 75 who has not had a vaccine or booster in the past six months, to get one.

Sarah Crofts, from the ONS, said: ""Across the UK we've seen a continued increase of over half a million infections, likely caused by the growth of BA.4 and BA.5 variants.""

Its analysis of England found out infections are increasing and Scotland also has had the highest covid rates in the UK since May. The hospitals in the UK are also in tight condition.

 In England, almost 9,000 hospital beds were taken up with Covid patients on 30 June - and that number has doubled since the start of the month. Data from the other UK nations are not as up-to-date but indicate a similar rise over the last month.

He speaks of the work of writers, painters, footballers, musicians, and tennis players who have uniquely shaped his thoughts and life. He looks into the previous work of these people and the emotions they experience when they see the sight of the last days of their lives. The irony lies in that Dyer's book begins with an end. His book tells us how one can live life happily by savouring art and beauty.
 
In his book, he says, “So let’s celebrate the fact that I’ve finally seen Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s ‘The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp.’ The extraordinary thing was that I’d been able to do my business, living a normal life, with this huge ‘Blimp’-shaped hole at its centre. For all this time, I’d been an incomplete person. What if I hadn’t seen it? In the same way, nothing happens if you don’t read Jane Austen or listen to ‘A Love Supreme,’ but your life will be defined in some ways by these and other lacks.”

Speaking of the poetry and poets who gave the best works of their lives, Dyer writes,

എന്നാൽ ഈ 17ചിത്രങ്ങൾക്ക് പിന്നിലും വളരെ വ്യത്യസ്തങ്ങളായ തിരക്കഥയും മികച്ച സാങ്കേതികവിദഗ്ധരും ഭാവനാ സമ്പന്നരായ സംവിധായകരും ശ്രുതിമധുരങ്ങളായ പാട്ടുകളും ഉണ്ടായിരുന്നു എന്നത് ഇവർ മറക്കുന്നു.
ഈ സിനിമകളുടെ വിജയം താൻ കാരണമാണെന്ന് വിശ്വസിച്ചു തുടങ്ങിയ സൂപ്പർസ്റ്റാർ പിന്നീട് തന്റെ എല്ലാ സിനിമകളുടെയും നിർമ്മാണ പ്രക്രിയകളിൽ തിരക്കഥ മുതൽ ഷൂട്ടിങ് ലൊക്കേഷൻ വരെ തന്റെ ഇഷ്ടാനിഷ്ടങ്ങൾ അടിച്ചേൽപ്പിക്കാൻ തുടങ്ങിയപ്പോൾ സിനിമകൾ പരാജയപ്പെട്ടു തുടങ്ങി. അങ്ങനെ ഒരു സൂപ്പർ താരം പൊലിഞ്ഞു മറ്റൊന്ന് ഉദിച്ചു.
രാജ്യത്തെ മറ്റു പ്രാദേശിക സിനിമകളിലും ഇത്തരം സൂപ്പർ സ്റ്റാറുകൾ മെല്ലെ ഉദിച്ചുയർന്നു 
സിനിമയുടെ നിർമ്മാണവേളയിൽ തന്നെ സിനിമയെക്കുറിച്ച് പ്രതീക്ഷകൾ ഉണ്ടാക്കാനും ആവശ്യമാണെങ്കിൽ സാമ്പത്തിക സഹായം നേടിയെടുക്കാനും സിനിമ റിലീസ് ആയാൽ ആദ്യ ദിവസങ്ങളിൽ കാണികളെ നിറയ്ക്കുവാനും സൂപ്പർസ്റ്റാറുകൾക്ക് കഴിയും. പിന്നീട് സിനിമ വിജയിക്കുന്നത് അതിന്റ ഗുണമേന്മ ഒന്ന് കൊണ്ട് മാത്രമാണ്.
മാറി വന്നിരിക്കുന്ന ഈ ഡിജിറ്റൽ യുഗത്തിൽ സിനിമ കാണാൻ ധാരാളം മാർഗങ്ങൾ ഉള്ളപ്പോൾ ഒരു സിനിമ അത് സൂപ്പർ സ്റ്റാർ അഭിനയിച്ചതായാലും അല്ലെങ്കിലും തിയേറ്ററിൽ വിജയിക്കണമെങ്കിൽ ആദ്യ ദിവസങ്ങളിൽ തിയറ്ററിൽ കാണികൾ നിറയണമെങ്കിൽ പ്രമോഷൻ ഉണ്ടാകണം. സിനിമയുടെ ബഡ്ജറ്റിന്റെ 50% വരെ പ്രമോയ്ക്ക് ചിലവാകും. പ്രധാന നടീനടന്മാരുടെ സഹകരണം വേണം. രാജ്യം മുഴുവൻ ചുറ്റി കറങ്ങി സിനിമയ്ക്ക് പരസ്യം നൽകണം സിനിമയെക്കുറിച്ച് പ്രേക്ഷകർക്കിടയിൽ ചർച്ചകൾ ഉണ്ടാകാൻ ശ്രമം വേണം .സിനിമ കാണാൻ ജനങ്ങളെ പ്രേരിപ്പിക്കേണ്ടതുണ്ട്
ഇതൊക്കെ ഒരു സിനിമയുടെ വിജയത്തിന് അനിവാര്യമാണ് എന്നാകുമ്പോൾ വില കൂടിയ യാതൊരു ഗ്യാരന്റിയുമില്ലാത്ത സൂപ്പർ സ്റ്റാർ എന്തിനാണ്.
ഒരു സൂപ്പർ തിരക്കഥ പോരെ. നല്ല സംവിധായകനും മികച്ച സാങ്കേതിക വിദഗ്ദ്ധരും പോരെ, സൂപ്പർ സ്റ്റാറിന് പകരം വയ്ക്കാൻ.

Our long-running trans-Tasman rivalry usually revolves around accusing Australians of stealing national cultural icons like Phar Lap, Pavlova or Crowded House.

But I have to admit that when it comes to championing palaeontology (the study of fossils and what they can teach us about our biological heritage), the Australians have a good thing going.

Taking an idea that originated in America, many Australian states in recent decades have started adopting fossil emblems (alongside animal, floral, marine and mineral ones) that epitomise the natural history of each region.

In turn, these emblems can help promote fossil tourism, educational outreach and awareness of the need for fossil protection strategies.

Western Australia chose the 380 million-year-old Devonian fish Mcnamaraspis kaprios, while New South Wales picked a similarly aged fish, Mandageria fairfaxi. South Australia adopted the 550 million-year-old Spriggina floundersi from the dawn of complex life – the first animal in the fossil record whose left and right sides mirrored each other, like ours do today.

The Australian Capital Territory picked the 545 million-year-old brachiopod Atrypa duntroonensis, while a public vote in Victoria chose the 125 million-year-old giant amphibian Koolasuchus cleelandi. Queensland is currently holding a public vote to pick an emblem from 12 candidates that include dinosaurs, giant marine reptiles, an amphibian, a crocodile, a monotreme, a plant and a sea lily.

Aotearoa’s rich fossil record
Aotearoa New Zealand also has a rich fossil record that palaeontologists have used to unlock the evolution of our taonga (treasured) species and their unique whakapapa (lineage), in some cases stretching back tens to hundreds of millions of years.

In spite of this, there’s a distinct shortfall in palaeontological expertise and funding, which is affecting our ability to study and protect the local fossil record.

A leader of the Sandinista National Liberation Front, a socialist party, joined the revolution against the then dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle as a student. As a firebrand Sandinista he was arrested, tortured and jailed along with other student leaders in the 1970s.

Later, the exiled Sandinistas got trained in guerrilla warfare by Fidel Castro’s government and eventually overthrew and exiled Somoza, following the legendary Nicaraguan Revolution. In the democratic election that followed Ortega became the president, subsequently defeated and made a comeback in 2007.

In his second avatar, Ortega gradually turned anti-democratic, alienated most of his comrades of the revolution and resembled Somoza, the very autocrat they overthrew. He started to violently oppress anyone who protested against his government and curbed civil liberties to such an extent that thousands of Nicaraguans started migrating to neighbouring Costa Rica. Last year he imprisoned most of his political opponents.

Ortega’s latest target is politically active student groups, one of the last bastions of opposition to the authoritarian government. Recently he brought five universities in the country under government control. His ruse: they had defied financial regulations and hence incapable of governing themselves. He had already gained control of students and academic unions in public universities. Now his opponents fear that 30 private universities will lose autonomy and there will be clamp down on students and professors who criticise him and his regime.

Among the institutions captured this month is the Polytechnic University, which had been the vortex of protests in 2018. A 50-day long protest movement was violently crushed by Ortega’s pet vigilantes and the police. 

The latest tactics of oppression by Ortega will surely lead to a surge in exodus of students and youth out of Nicaragua. Ironically, the man who drove out a dictator in his youth is now turning into a worse and more ruthless one.

But that progress is only the beginning. More is expected in the coming years and decades, particularly following President Biden’s recent announcement of a new “cancer moonshot” initiative, coupled with a pledge to “end cancer as we know it.”

One way to help make that happen is through the study of cats and dogs. As a professor of oncology and doctor of veterinary medicine who has been researching cancer in dogs for more than 40 years, I learned long ago that companion animals can teach us an enormous amount about how to prevent and treat cancer in people.

There are many reasons why this is true. Domesticated cats and dogs share approximately 85% of the same DNA as humans. And because both have been intimately associated with people for more than 10,000 years, they have become susceptible to some of the same diseases.

Remarkable similarities in cats, dogs and people

Over decades, researchers have accumulated what is now a treasure trove of cancer data on companion animals. This data holds clues – and perhaps, answers – to how and why pets can get cancer, and how to keep it in check or get rid of it.

But because of the remarkable similarities in the biology and habitats of cats, dogs and people, it’s possible researchers can also extract this data on pets and extrapolate it to humans. Therein lies the opportunity to discover biomedical innovations that benefit not only your pet, but you as well.

This approach cuts by decades the amount of time it takes for data to come in. Consider that veterinarians observe and care for cats and dogs as they age and die over a life span of roughly 10 to 15 years. In comparison, gathering similar data from humans over a lifetime takes from 60 to 100 years.

Onana is not big on passing, as his job is being a box to box midfielder. But he gets those passes done. He is known for sending cheeky key passes to the rushing attackers. He accumulates 14 key passes ranking 0.84 per 90. He has made a total of 887 complete passes. His 6 ft 4 inches helps him in covering distance as he uses a long stride, coupled with an incredible work engine to cover every inch of the grass. He is known for spraying long passes. He has made a total of 159 of them. He has completed 7.76 of long passes.

Eye For Gold


Onana has been known for having a thunderous foot which usually leads to goal or keeper scrambling to deflect his shots.


Where did Onana made most Touches ?

Onana made most of his ball touches in the middle of the park, inclined to defensive and middle third to the right so that he can help his fellow defenders. He has made a total of 1386 touches, out of which maximum have come in the middle third with a whopping 876 touches.


The gargantuan performance this season has turned heads of recently crowned Serie A champions AC Milan. With Franck Kessie departing for Barcelona, the board will be looking to replace him and Onana fits the bill.

Don't just rely on two shot numbers, don't look at that, look at the booster protection numbers because the booster provides three times more protection against hospitalisation than just two shots alone. 90 per cent versus 70 per cent. I would really stress that. Don't just rely on border control, you have to mass test and additionally use boosters."" 

New Zealand's border is reopening in stages, with it fully reopening to visitors from anywhere in the world in October. 

There were emotional scenes on Monday last week when the border reopened to Kiwis in Australia. 

Most of New Zealand's MIQ facilities will be closed by the end of June. 

""With New Zealand now reopening to the world without the requirement to isolate for most, there is a significantly reduced demand for MIQ. This of course means that we no longer need the number of facilities we currently have,"" Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said on Thursday. 

“The relative risk of people coming across the border now is actually lower than the people walking around in the community.” 

In response to Feigl-Ding's warning, Hipkins later said on Breakfast he believes ""it's safe for us [New Zealand]"" to wind down MIQ and open the border.

Reacting to the Taliban declaration, Mohammad Mohaqiq, a religious scholar, said that the basis for deciding on Eid al-Fitr is the new moon, and that the most accurate and reliable way to renew the moon is to use modern technology that can correctly calculate and show results. .

According to Mr. Mohaqiq, today there are advanced satellites and tools related to space and cosmic observations, and in these circumstances, resorting to primitive methods and doing so with the naked eye is wrong.

""The absence of Muslims on such a simple and trivial issue is a disgrace to one and a half billion people in the world today,"" Mohammed Mohaqiq stressed.

The group announced Sunday as the first day of Eid al-Fitr, based on a decision by the Crescent Vision Committee.

The former head of the Ulema Council of Afghanistan has said that the moon has not been seen in countries armed with technology and astronomical observatories, but in Afghanistan, which is a mountainous and toolless country, the Taliban say the moon has been seen.

With the exception of Afghanistan, only two countries, Mali and Niger, located in West Africa, have declared Eid today.

Saudi Arabia and many other Islamic countries have announced that Monday is Eid al-Fitr.

This is the first time that Eid al-Fitr is celebrated in Afghanistan one day earlier than in Saudi Arabia.

However, a large number of Afghans are said to have fasted today in the face of the Taliban.

There have been reports of Taliban members arresting a number of fasters today and forcing them to eat in some places.

 Responding to the group's critics, the deputy Taliban spokesman said, ""Those who attributed the Afghan jihad to the Arabs and insulted all the Arabs under this pretext are today blaming the Islamic Emirate for not following the Arabs on the issue of Eid.""

But that history – especially during the Soviet period from 1922 to 1991, in which Ukraine was absorbed into the communist bloc – has also bred resentment. Opinions of the merits of the Soviet Union and its leaders diverge, with Ukrainians far less likely to view the period favorably than Russians.

Nonetheless, President Vladimir Putin continues to claim Soviet foundations for what he sees as “historical Russia” – an entity that includes Ukraine.

As scholars of that history, we believe that an examination of Soviet-era policies in Ukraine can offer a useful lens for understanding why so many Ukrainians harbor deep resentment toward Russia.

Stalin’s engineered famine
Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, Ukraine was known as the breadbasket of Europe and later of the Soviet Union. Its rich soil and ample fields made it an ideal place to grow the grain that helped feed the entire continent.

After Ukraine was absorbed into the Soviet Union beginning in 1922, its agriculture was subject to collectivization policies, in which private land was taken over by the Soviets to be worked communally. Anything produced on those lands would be redistributed across the union.

In 1932 and 1933, a famine devastated the Soviet Union as a result of aggressive collectivization coupled with poor harvests.

She excels in everything she does, from acting to motherhood to working and being a successful lady. ❤️❤️

1. Begin your morning with a workout🏋️💪👟

When it comes to exercise, the greatest time of day to squeeze in a training session is one that you can maintain. Shilpa Shetty firmly feels that doing out early in the day is a fantastic way to start the day off healthy. Shetty Kundra enjoys working out in the morning.

2. Stretching is always encouraged🧘‍♀️🤸🤸‍♀️🧘‍♂️

It's usually a good idea to stretch. The advantages of regular stretching are numerous. Stretching can help you become more flexible, which is a key component of fitness, as well as improve your posture, lessen tension and body aches, among other things. The actress frequently posts yoga poses on Instagram that are proven to stretch and strengthen the spine, back, neck, and shoulders.

3. Breakfast should be balanced🥚🍳

Your metabolism is boosted by breakfast, which aids in calorie burning throughout the rest of the day. It also provides you with the energy you need to accomplish your goals and keeps your attention throughout. No matter how hectic the day gets, Shetty Kundra never skips breakfast. Fresh fruit, avocado, and eggs are her go-to healthy breakfast options because they are a complete meal in her opinion.

4. Balance your meals with guilt-free treats🥗🥗

Shilpa is all about making healthy choices, but every Sunday she takes a break to splurge guilt-free.

In an interview on the ABC's 7.30, Mr Albanese said he was invited to France by Mr Macron and expected to receive a warm welcome.

""We do need to reset. We've already had very constructive discussions,"" the Prime Minister added.

Earlier this month, the new Labor government announced it had agreed to pay French shipbuilder Naval Group $835 million in compensation for the scrapped deal.

In total, $3.4 billion was spent on the program, a figure Mr Albanese labelled an ""extraordinary waste"" of taxpayer money.

""France, of course, is central to power in Europe, but it's also a key power in the Pacific, in our own region as well,"" Mr Albanese told Leigh Sales.

""It's just one of the reasons why this needs to be a relationship that's nurtured, not damaged.

""What we can offer is a relationship between our respective leaders that won't be leaked in order to make an opportunistic headline in the newspaper, one of respect and honesty in the way that we deal with each other.""

Opposition Leader Peter Dutton welcomed the meeting but said he stood by the former government's decision to scrap the French contract in favour of nuclear submarines. 

""The previous government made a decision that was in our national security interest, on all of the advice we had … the submarine the French provided wasn't going to provide the security and the defences that we needed … and so I don't make an apology for the decision we made,"" he said. 

The submarine deal with France came at a time when Mr Macron was talking up the country's future as an ""Indo-Pacific power"".

On a visit to Sydney in 2018, the President said the submarines were just the ""very beginning"" of a closer relationship with Australia that would be developed for ""the coming 50 years"".

The Welshman departs the Bernabéu having won a fifth Champions League trophy last Saturday. That, and 106 goals to add to 67 assists in Madrid colours place him in a respectable tier of Madrid legends.


Following the confirmation of his exit, Bale wrote a goodbye message addressing teammates, fans and those inside the club.


""I write this message to say thank you to all my team mates, past and present, my managers, the back room staff and to the fans that supported me.I arrived here 9 years ago as a young man who wanted to realise my dream of playing for Real Madrid. To wear the pristine white kit, to wear the crest on my chest, to play at the Santiago Bernabéu, to win titles and to be part of what it's so famous for, to win the Champions League.""


Bale expresses his gratitude to the club that gave him the opportunity to be part of some historic moments.


""I can now look back, reflect and say with honesty that this dream became a reality and much, much more. To be a part of this club’s history and to achieve what we achieved while I was a Real Madrid player, has been an incredible experience and one I will never forget. I also want to thank President Florentino Perez, Jose Angel Sanchez, and the board for giving me the opportunity to play for this club.""

This issue has been highlighted in the last few years by celebrity women including Hannah Gadsby, Daryl Hannah, British reality star Christine McGuinness and former Australian of the year Grace Tame. By talking about their adult autism diagnosis, they are helping to debunk the myth that autism is for boys and men.

Autism affects thoughts, feelings, interactions and experiences in an estimated one in 70 people. In childhood, autism is now diagnosed in three boys for every one girl (a ratio that has greatly reduced over time). Girls are often diagnosed later than boys, so miss out on opportunities for early support.

Girls who have autism but not a diagnosis grow up not understanding why they are sometimes confused in social situations. They might not be able to make friends as easily as others and can sometimes be targets for bullies. This can lead to lifelong feelings of failure and thinking they have character defects – or being told they do.

These experiences growing up can lead to or interact with post-traumatic stress symptoms in adulthood.

Girls get diagnosed (and misdiagnosed) with other things

Girls who don’t get diagnosed tend not to have readily observable co-occurring difficulties, such as hyperactivity. But many girls and women receive other (sometimes incorrect) diagnoses instead of, or before, an autism diagnosis.

Our recent case study provides reflections from our perspectives as a psychologist (Tamara) and a late-diagnosed autistic woman (Carol). In the discussion, Carol describes her confusion and challenges growing up, and how they resurfaced following traumatic experiences as an adult.

There is a long-standing bias in the world of mental health to view some symptoms as the domain of males, such as aggressive and externalising symptoms, while internalising symptoms like anxiety are seen as the domain of females.

And despite various efforts, extinction seems final.

But when does extinction start? That would seem like an easy question to answer. In the dry prose of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), extinction has occurred when “there is no reasonable doubt that the last individual of a species has died.”

And as we know from watching courtroom dramas, the concept of “no reasonable doubt” is a high bar, meant to protect the innocent in society. In conservation, it is to guard against crying wolf.

No longer extinct
In the 1980s, it was suggested that an extinction should be declared if a species was not observed for 50 years. That seems like a long time, but it wasn’t long enough. Many species have been rediscovered decades or even centuries after their last observation.

For example, the black-browed babbler was recently recorded in the jungles of Borneo for the first time in 170 years!

And indeed, extinction need not technically be forever: some rediscovered species had been formally declared extinct. These species are referred to as Lazarus species — for instance, the Miles’ robber frog was brought back from the dead after it was located in a Honduran cloud forest in 2008.

The work of Shyam Sundar Tiwari on Rohtas also enriched my knowledge.

Rohtas had been affected by Maoist activity for more than 2 decades. The district was geographically very challenging for regular policing. A large part of the district consisted of hilly areas covered by dense forests. The Kaimur Hills which originate near the Banks of the Sone in Rohtas, further extend to the Sonebhadra district in Uttar Pradeshand thereafter to the Vindhya Ranges. 

The hills also extended southward to the Chotanagpur plateau, and provided an easy travel zone for Maoists right from Andhra Pradesh via Chattisgarh and Jharkhand to plains of Bihar.

The Maoists called this zone as the Sone Ganga Vindhyachal zone. From times immemorial, the Kaimur hills had always proved as a challenge to any invader. The invincibility and strength of the Fort has been mentioned by several chroniclers like Ferishta and travelers like Tavernier. So much so, that the Forts of Rohtasgarh and Shergarh situated on the top of Kaimur Hills, have been believed to be invincible by means of direct war in history. They had always been captured by deceitful means.

Till the advent of the Maoists in recent history, the hills were known for dacoits. The menace of dacoits had also been documented during Mughal Rule. Presently, the hills of the 2 districts of Rohtas and Kaimur have also been notified as a wildlife sanctuary.


The hills presented a tough challenge for policing as there was no police post above the hills in Rohtas district. The only post on Kaimiur Hills was at Adhaura in Kaimur district. The distance from Rohtas PS situated at the foot of the Rohtas Fort (at a height of 1500 ft) to Adhaura is about 45 kms.

They were a group of singers from the family of former Austrian naval commander Georg von Trapp. The family won attention in their original singing career in their native Austria during the interwar period, later became famous in the US. 
‌
‌Maria Von Trapp is said to be the matriarch of the Trapp Family Singers. She grew up in Austria, lost her parents at a very young age. The condition of her family was very poor and being an orphan it was difficult to study. Yet her urge to study made her random jobs and finally she entered, State Teachers College for Progressive Education in Vienna from where she graduated.
‌
‌She wanted to be a Nun but her life wasn't a fair game. She married Captain von Trapp; later in her biography, she mentions that she wasn't in love with him and she wanted to be a nun but she loved his children and it's like she married for the children.
‌
‌Her family became a popular touring act after performing at a festival in 1935. Nazis were a problem to them when Germany annexed Austria. They were intolerant to witness the hostility shown towards Jewish children and the induction of Georg into the German Navy.
‌
‌The family lost most of its prosperity through the worldwide depression when their bank failed in the early 1930s. That's when she seriously decided to turn her passion into a profession.
‌
‌‌The family left Austria and journeyed to Italy, then to England and finally the United States. The Nazis made use of their abandoned home as Heinrich Himmler's headquarters.
‌
‌‌Calling themselves the ""Trapp Family Choir"", began to perform in the United States and Canada and later changed their name to 'Trapp Family Singers.'
‌

Early trends show that the BJP is leading in Uttar Pradesh and has crossed the halfway mark.

At about 1.10 p.m the figures released by the Election Commission of India showed that out of the total 403 constituencies, the status was known for 401 seats in UP, with the BJP leading in 252 seats, Samajwadi Party in 116 seats, RLD in 9 seats, Apna dal (Soneylal) in 9 seats and the BSP in 3 seats.

The early trends showed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is most likely to retain power in Uttar Pradesh.

In over three decades, since 1985, the state of Uttar Pradesh has never returned the same government to power. The BJP has termed the UP lead as a ‘historic victory’ for its ‘double-engine’ government.

The exit polls had earlier predicted a victory for the BJP.

midfielder joining Roma for a free transfer after leaving Manchester United this summer.

Matic previously worked with Mourinho at Chelsea during both the player and
manager’s second spell at Stamford Bridge, winning the Premier League together in
2015.

After winning another title with the Blues, this time under Antonio Conte, he moved to Manchester United to work with the Portuguese coach in 2017. In his five-year stay at
Old Trafford, he could not win any silverware.

And now, Sky Sports Italia has reported that the Siberian international has agreed on a one-year deal with Roma with an option for a further year depending on appearances.

In May, when it was announced that Matic was not renewing his contract with
Manchester United and was preparing to leave the club, Mourinho remained coy when
asked about the possibility of signing the 33-year-old.

He said,” Everyone knows my relationship with Nemanja. He is one of the guys with my
trust. We won together, we fought together in United too. He is a fantastic player, but
that is a kind of answer that is not good for me and the player as well.”

Mourinho already had a couple of former United players in his Roma squad, namely
defender Chris Smalling and attacking midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan although the latter
is said to be heading to Inter Milan.

Kabul, Afghanistan – Groups of women bustle through the female entrance of Sakhi Shah-e Mardan Shrine in Karte Sakhi in western Kabul, where many Afghans gather every year to celebrate Nowruz, which marks the arrival of spring. They rush towards the mosque located inside the shrine premises, posing for selfies and TikTok videos, wearing colourful dresses donned with sequins.

This is the first Nowruz since the Taliban returned to power 20 years after they were toppled in a United States-led invasion.

The Taliban rule and the flagging economy have seemingly put a dampener on celebrations this year. While the scenes at the shrine and mosque feel much like any other Nowruz in Afghanistan, today the numbers – even at peak hour on the eve before Nowruz – are fewer than last year.

Colourful flags flutter in the spring breeze outside the Shia shrine and mosque and on the streets in surrounding neighbourhoods. Street vendors at the bazaar sell sweets and ice cream to women pushing children on tricycles.

The shrine was attacked in 2018 during Nowruz celebrations. At least 31 people were killed in the attack claimed by ISIL (ISIS).

The temple is dedicated to Hindu diety Shiva, who is also known as the destroyer or the god of time and death.
The form of Shiva in the Ujjain is that of Mahakal- the Lord of Time and Death. Kaal means time and death in Sanskrit, hence Shiva is also called Mahakaleshkar, and the temple is believed to be the  most sacred abode of Shiva.
Situated in banks of river Shipra in Ujjain, the Mahakaleshkar temple is believed to be built on 6th century  AD by Kumarasena, the son of Chandpradyot, former King of Ujjain.
As per Hindu Mythology it was built by Lord Brahma.
Over centuries it was redeveloped by multiple kings and kingdom came, hence having strong influences of the Bhumija, Chalukya and Maratha architectural style.
The lingam of Mahakaleshkar is known to be Dakshina Mukhi which means its south facing. This is the only south facing Shiva lingam in the country which is believed to be in direction of Yama- the God of Death, and Lord Shiva symbolises as the master of death or Mahakaleshkar.
Temple's unique south facing feature is upheld by the tradition of Tantric Shivnetra.
The magnificent temple is built on five storeys, one of which is underground.  The first is the Mahakaleshkar lingam and the second storey is the Omkareshkar Mahadev Idol. The third level houses the image of Nagarchandreshwar- Lord Shiva and Parvati seated on a ten-hooded snake.

Russia has amassed an estimated 100,000 troops along its border with Ukraine over the past several months.

In mid-January, Russia began moving troops into Belarus, a country bordering both Russia and Ukraine, in preparation for joint military exercises in February.

Putin has issued various security demands to the U.S. before he draws his military forces back. Putin’s list includes a ban on Ukraine from entering NATO, and agreement that NATO will remove troops and weapons across much of Eastern Europe.

There’s precedent for taking the threat seriously: Putin already annexed the Crimea portion of Ukraine in 2014.

Ukraine’s layered history offers a window into the complex nation it is today — and why it is continuously under threat. As an Eastern Europe expert, I highlight five key points to keep in mind.

At 37-years-old and playing in his 19th season, he has put the Lakers on his broad shoulders for a chance to win every game. James has done practically everything he can to bring more glory to the storied NBA franchise.

Checking the stat sheet in the middle of a losing game probably isn’t one of those things he should do to help the LA Lakers win. A video of LeBron James going over the stat sheet in the loss to the Memphis Grizzlies went viral. Former Laker Kwame Brown ripped the four-time MVP for doing something the late Kobe Bryant would not even think about.

Here’s Brown on LeBron James' fact-checking act during a timeout:

“Ain’t nowhere in the hell Kobe Bryant would have never done that. Matter of fact, if Kobe Bryant would have caught anybody doing that, it’s on you. You might get jacked up if the leader of the team is doing that. Then you can see videos of him [James] standing on defense.""

""It’s like what are you really doing? What are you really out here for at this point? Because that’s not basketball and that summed it up why the Lakers are losing in my opinion. They are not a team. They are a bunch of guys out there, trying to get their numbers.”

LeBron James has not given any explanation as to why he was looking at the stat sheet. But the image of Russell Westbrook’s worried face only added layers of interpretation and hilarity to the scene.

structured approach to having leaders in the dressing room. Besides just being a natural
leader himself, Conte instilled confidence in players like Matt Doherty and Harry Kane.

Full-backs getting forward to score was a regular occurrence. Players like Reguilon and
Emerson Royal were granted freedom unlike under Nuno. Soon enough Spurs were out of
the mid-table places and were competing for a European spot again.

Tottenham's journey in the EFL cup, FA Cup and Conference league weren't much to talk
about but come March, they'd beaten Manchester City again before demolishing Everton
and Leeds United in successive weeks. Three losses in February hurt but that was followed
by an impressive March. Conte's football was working and Spurs ended the season on a
relative high — clinching Champions League football being unbeaten in the final month of
Premier League fixtures. The Italian's obsessive winning mentality, Son's quality in the final
third and January signings got Spurs over the line eventually.

Hit of the Season: Dejan Kulusevski. The Swedish winger was brought in on loan from
Juventus alongside Rodrigo Bentancur. The pair were personal requests from Conte's entourage and they did not fail to excite.

Kulusevski finished the season with 5 goals and 8
assists in 6 great months at Tottenham.

Flop of the Season: Steven Bergjwin. The flying Dutchman spent much time on the bench
and on the sidelines. The highlight of his season was when he came off the bench to rescue
a win at Leicester, scoring twice in the dying moments. Still a shadow of the player he was

Science City Celebrates Darwin Day 

Pushpa Gujral Science City celebrated Charles Darwin’s birth anniversary by organizing a webinar. Around 100 students and teachers participated in the event. Giving introductory remarks at the occasion, Dr. Neelima Jerath, Director General, Science City said that Darwin Day is celebrated to commemorate the birth anniversary of Charles Darwin and his significant contribution in the fields of science and humanity. His theory of evolution helped to dispel conventional belief that the formation of various species was a supernatural phenomenon. 

His book on The Origin of Species is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology. 

It provided many answers to doubts that had arisen about the true age of the earth and the extensive fossil collection that had been discovered. Further, the day is meant to inspire masses to understand the importance of the scientific thinking, build curiosity to find new things and hunger for truth, she added. 

Dr. N.G. Prasad, Professor Biological Science & Dean International Relations and outreach, IISER Mohali was the key speaker at this occasion. He said that the beautiful diversity that we see around us is a result of billions of years of evolution. He highlighted the importance of the work of Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in describing evolution of spotted camel. He informed that people outside Africa called Giraffe as ""Camel-Leopard"" or ""spotted camel"" for its camel-like neck and leopard-like spots when they saw it for the first time. Long neck of the Giraffe has resulted in some very peculiar anatomical features like an extra large heart, long cranial nerves etc. The quest to explain the long neck of the giraffe helps us understand the complex beauty of evolution, he added.

Speaking at the occasion Dr. Rajesh Grover Director Science City said that works of Charles Darwin has had a tremendous impact on the science of Anthropology.

Your very first task would be to bike approximately 20.6 miles (33.2 km) up to the peak of Col du Galibier in the French Alps while gaining around 4,281 feet (1,305 m) of elevation. But this is only the first of three big climbs in your day. Next you face the peak of Col de la Croix de Fer and then end the 102.6-mile (165.1-km) stage by taking on the famous Alpe d'Huez climb with its 21 serpentine turns.

On the fittest day of my life, I might not even be able to finish Stage 12 – much less do it in anything remotely close to the five hours or so the winner will take to finish the ride. And Stage 12 is just one of 21 stages that must be completed in the 24 days of the tour.

I am a sports physicist, and I’ve modeled the Tour de France for nearly two decades using terrain data – like what I described for Stage 12 – and the laws of physics. But I still cannot fathom the physical capabilities needed to complete the world’s most famous bike race. Only an elite few humans are capable of completing a Tour de France stage in a time that’s measured in hours instead of days. The reason they’re able to do what the rest of us can only dream of is that these athletes can produce enormous amounts of power. Power is the rate at which cyclists burn energy and the energy they burn comes from the food they eat. And over the course of the Tour de France, the winning cyclist will burn the equivalent of roughly 210 Big Macs.

Cycling is a game of watts
To make a bicycle move, a Tour de France rider transfers energy from his muscles, through the bicycle and to the wheels that push back on the group.

The law take effect in 14 days following French President Emmanuel Macron’s signature.

“Let's be proud, these unworthy practices have no place in the Republic. Because being yourself is not a crime, because there is nothing to be cured,” Macron tweeted following its passing. 

LGBTQ youth who were subjected to so-called ‘conversion therapy’ are twice as likely to be at risk of suicide compared to those who weren’t. Transgender and nonbinary youth are twice as likely to be subjected to conversion therapy, Trevor Project’s 2021 National Mental Health Survey of LGBTQ+ Youth reports.

Once in effect, the French law would enforce a fine ranging from €30,000 to €45,000 and two to three years in prison for practicing conversion therapy, based on the age and ‘vulnerability’ of the person being subjected to the practice.

It will also include a 10 year ban on medical professionals engaging in the practice, along with internet regulations requiring a restriction on ‘conversion’ therapy content.

“From injections to electric shocks, prayer to rape, the myriad methods used to try to change or suppress the sexual desire or gender identity of LGBT+ people have been condemned as harmful and ineffective by numerous medical groups globally,” Reuters reports.

URALKALI is a Russian Chemical company owned by Oligarch Dmitri Mazepin. Mazepin is known to be close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

It is because of the URALKALI sponsorship that his son Nikita Mazepin has been able to drive in F1. With the recent violence that Russia has unleashed on Ukraine, F1 has decided to cancel this year’s race in Russia. 

Now that the future of URALKALI is in question as the title sponsor of Haas, so is the seat of driver Nikita Mazepin in F1. Haas Team Principal Guenther Steiner has also said that the future of the association of URALKALI with Haas is uncertain. Thus, Nikita’s drive as well. 

With that being said, whispers around the paddock are being reportedly heard that Former Alfa Romeo driver Antonio Giovinazzi’s name is at the top of the list for a possible replacement. The Italian driver drove in F1 from 2019 to 2021, after which he was unable to hold onto his seat because of inconsistent performance and lack of sponsorship money. His seat has been taken this year by the Chinese rookie Guanyu Zhou.

Giovinazzi is part of the Ferrari Driver Academy. Given the close relationship between Ferrari and Haas, it seems believable that this might actually happen if Nikita Mazepin loses his paid seat. Antonio currently drives for the Dragon Penkse team in Formula E.

It made a comeback there in the weekend. The ‘steward’ of the painting, a scion of the Rockefeller family, has offered a full explanation, laying speculations to rest.

UN announcement: 
https://www.un.org/sg/en/node/261757

Picasso painted the 11-by-25-foot tapestry during the Spanish Civil War. It depicts the bombing of a town called Guernica on April 26, 1937: https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2007/apr/26/picassosguernicabattlelives

After World War II, it emerged as the most incisive visual rendering of the inhumanity of wars. It has been a cultural landmark: ‘Guernica’ is to painting what Eliot’s ‘Waste Land’ is to literature. It was exhibited at many placed, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, before it moved to a museum in Madrid in 1981.

Meanwhile, the Rockefeller family offered to buy it in 1955 but Picasso refused. What they got instead was a full-size copy. The Rockefeller estate gave that copy to the UN on loan in 1985. And it hung at the entrance to the Security Council room until February 2021. 

As Nelson A. Rockefeller Jr. got it removed abruptly, diplomats were baffled and Secretary General António Guterres was anguished: “It’s horrible, horrible, that it is gone.” 

On Saturday, the tapestry was hung in the same spot again. Rockefeller and the National Trust for Historic Preservation said it would be gifted to the trust, which will later exhibit it at various venues around the world.

When Guterres came to know of this arrangement last month, he wrote to Rockefeller: “This is most welcome news as we end a difficult year of global hardship and strife. The Guernica tapestry speaks to the world about the urgent need to advance international peace and security. We are honored to serve as careful stewards of this one-of-a-kind iconic work – as we draw inspiration from its message”: https://media.un.org/en/asset/k18/k18lq6mpm7


Rockefeller says ‘Guernica’ was removed last year only for cleaning and preservation, and the controversy was the result of “miscommunication”: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/05/world/americas/guernica-tapestry-un-rockefeller.html

“The legislature finds that there are ‘inherent differences between men and women,’ and that these differences remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial constraints on an individual's opportunity,’” the proposed act states, in a clumsy attempt to defend a gender binary that has never existed.

The bill proceeds to dismiss women athletes, claiming that their talent, commitment and grit will never match up to men: ""Boys and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition,"" it argues.

In line with 75 bills this year that attempt to ban – or have already banned – trans youth from sports, Rhode Island’s bill attempts to reduce all student athletes to their bodies, through a white supremicist suggestion on how there are certain ways to look like a ‘man’ or ‘woman’.

If a student’s gender is ‘disputed’ and they want to participate in sports, the act would need them to provide an invasive physician’s statement based on an analysis of the student’s anatomy, hormone levels and genetic make-up.

Excluding trans girls and femme youth from participating in sports has negative outcomes for all youth. It reproduces white-supremicist patriarchal concepts of toxic masculinity that associate femininity with fragility, through a practice of systemic transmisogyny and anti-Black racism.

These anti-trans sports bills disguise themselves as ‘saviours’ of women, but are practising the exact opposite – they create a violent cisgender gaze that would police all athletes through invasive procedures and tests that have been used against Black athletes like Caster Semenya.

You don’t need to read in-between the lines, the bill is quite clear about its gender essentialist intent: “This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth,” it states.

A four-second video clip of Rahul Gandhi is viral on social media. Here, he can be heard saying, “We are fighting against India’s entire infrastructure.” BJP leaders, workers, and social media users are circulating this video, calling the remark dangerous and anti-national.

BJP IT cell in-charge Amit Malviya tweeted this short clip of Rahul Gandhi and wrote, “If Rahul Gandhi’s prater were not puerile, they would be deeply dangerous.”

Fact-check
Alt News closely examined Rahul Gandhi’s YouTube channel to gather more information on this video. The full video of this press conference was uploaded on Rahul Gandhi’s YouTube channel on August 4. We listened to the press conference in its entirety.

Responding to a question asked at the 11:30 minute mark, Rahul says, “The opposition that fights in democracy fights on the strength of the institution. This means that the opposition derives its power from the country’s legal structure, judicial structure, electoral structure, and the media. All these institutions are giving full support to the government. Why? Because the government has installed its own workers inside these institutions. Today, not a single institution in India is independent. Today, every institution in India is under RSS control. Every institution has at least one RSS member sitting inside these institutions. So, we are not fighting a single political party, we are fighting against India’s entire infrastructure.

A four-second video clip of Rahul Gandhi is viral on social media. Here, he can be heard saying, “We are fighting against India’s entire infrastructure.” BJP leaders, workers, and social media users are circulating this video, calling the remark dangerous and anti-national.

BJP IT cell in-charge Amit Malviya tweeted this short clip of Rahul Gandhi and wrote, “If Rahul Gandhi’s prater were not puerile, they would be deeply dangerous.”

Fact-check
Alt News closely examined Rahul Gandhi’s YouTube channel to gather more information on this video. The full video of this press conference was uploaded on Rahul Gandhi’s YouTube channel on August 4. We listened to the press conference in its entirety.

Responding to a question asked at the 11:30 minute mark, Rahul says, “The opposition that fights in democracy fights on the strength of the institution. This means that the opposition derives its power from the country’s legal structure, judicial structure, electoral structure, and the media. All these institutions are giving full support to the government. Why? Because the government has installed its own workers inside these institutions. Today, not a single institution in India is independent. Today, every institution in India is under RSS control. Every institution has at least one RSS member sitting inside these institutions. So, we are not fighting a single political party, we are fighting against India’s entire infrastructure. When Congress was in power, the infrastructure was neutral, we did not control the infrastructure.

Don McLaughlin told a council meeting in Uvalde on Tuesday that it was his “understanding” that Robb elementary school would be destroyed and a new school built for its nearly 600 pupils.

“My understanding – and I had this discussion with the [school district] superintendent – is that school will be demolished. You can never ask a child to go back, or teacher to go back, in that school ever,” McLaughlin said. He didn't mention the date. 

This decision isn't new in America as we have seen, The school in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, where 26 people were killed in a mass shooting in 2012, was razed and a new school built on the site.

The mayor’s comments came amid ascending public anger about the police response to the shooting on 25 May and how heavily armed officers waited for 70 minutes after arriving at the school before they raged the classroom.

And hate towards the Muslims is his central plank. If he becomes the president, his agenda includes banning women from wearing Muslim headscarves in public and prohibiting the construction of any ""imposing"" mosques in France.

Another frontrunner and last presidential elections' runner-up Marine Le Pe is also running a very anti-immigrant and what is considered anti-minority campaign to garner more votes than the incumbent president Emmanuel Macron. (https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/French-far-right-presidential-candidates-fight-16833894.php)

How could Macron not do anything to show that he was taking steps to control ""radical Islam""? Macron announced a new body 'The Forum of Islam in France' to ""reshape"" Islam. This comes weeks after the state-backed French Council of Muslim Worship (CFCM) was dissolved as it was ""completely paralysed"" and failed in the mission for which it was created in 2003.  

With these moves, Is France on a dangerous path of fighting its own Muslim citizens?

Macron's government says that it will train imams in France instead of bringing them in from Turkey, Morocco or Algeria. It could also break the leadership of clerics, which many within France are important to let independent voices rise and challenge the established practice. (https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/macrons-government-seeks-give-islam-french-makeover-82689195)

Muslims in France are saying that some the steps by the new group may not result in a reduction in discrimination of Muslims in public life. Supporters of the new move say that foreign influence on French Muslims will be minimal and, hence, good for the country. As it comes just before the elections, it is being seen a political move. 

Last month, the French Senate voted in favor of the ban on wearing the hijab and other ""conspicuous religious symbols"" in sports competitions. While some Muslim women supported the move, many have opposed it. (https://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/2022/muslim-women-footballers-in-france-campaign-against-hijab-ban-in-competitions/)

France has around 5.7 million Muslims as it citizens and this is the largest Muslim population in Europe. (https://www.statista.com/statistics/1058154/women-wearing-hijab-france/)

This man knows his actors and how to cast them in exact roles to pull off their best. MR always makes me a captive of his films through luring frames, beautiful people, and beautiful emotions backed by AR Rahman’s enticing music. Look at Madhavan in Alai Payuthey and Arvind Swamy and Manisha Koirala in Bombay. You cannot escape their aura. In PS1, two beautiful women of Indian Cinema prison you under their spell. Their elusive expressions and stunning costumes speak volumes. In a scene where Aishwarya Rai and Trisha come together the script binds them in an unusual pattern of beauty and brains. Aishwarya as Nandini is a she-cobra. Trisha as Kundavai is a cunning politician. She has a dark role in Nandini’s past. Burning wounds transform Nandini’s life. She now is a mastermind behind plots against Cholas. Prince Aditha Karikalan (Vikaram) is still after his lost love Nandini. He fights and wins provinces, but loses his mind. PS1 is weaved by intriguing stories and related human dramas. It steals your brain.Ponniyin Selvan (the son of Ponni) is a huge five-part novel written by Tamil writer Kalki Krishnamurthy on Chola Empire. It was released in 1955. Making a film out of this masterwork serialized in Kalki magazine was a dream project for many veterans in the Tamil film industry. I am happy it finally came out through the master storyteller. Nobody else could have pulled it off this way.Seeing a comet in the sky is believed to bring death to the palace. Who will succeed Emperor Sundara Chola determines the entire plot of PS1. His sons - Karikalan and Arulmozhi Varman are warriors and most eligible for the throne. Madurantakan (Rahman) is a secret candidate in the race is supported by Pandyas. Secret cabinets are on to influence chieftains and strengthen allies. There are spies around. Conspiracy details are hidden even while those are conveyed. War and love embellish the plot.

Have you ever said sorry for that? Did that stem from fear? Or are you suggesting that we collectively just abandon the idea of forgiveness and let people hurt others without any consequences of it? I am confused as to why you think the urge to want to be forgiven is fear. That feeling you're talking about, that surrounds the need for forgiveness, is far from fear. We make mistakes, we seek forgiveness because we realize that we did something wrong.

We are a society, we need rules. We need to set a bar for ethics and morals. We can't just roam around like dogs in the wild doing anything and everything. It's one thing to challenge those rules but completely another to question the very idea of morality and presenting it as some sort of vile practice. Religion or no religion, people have personal morals. They seek forgiveness even without any fear of being punished by some higher entity. The atheists of the biggest kinds say sorry when they do something they think was wrong. Forgiveness is not a religious idea even though it is very strongly present there. So probably if you're against the idea of forgiveness, being against religion is not enough. You're gonna have to be against the entirety of mankind.

Religion will exist, you like it or not. It has become a necessity at this point. No matter how good your neighbour is or how close your friend is, they're not going to be there for you all the time. They have their own problems, they have their own lives. They're gonna need you some days. What's wrong in people holding on to the idea of someone up there who will always be there for them? Faith is a personal possession. People keep it close, people hold onto it. Those people should not be frowned upon because there is some evil out there. Because if that should be the case, I can present to you a list of atheists who've done horrible things to others.

There are a number of ways to reduce the hyperpigmentation, but it will take time and patience. Here are some tips:
- Try using lightening creams or gels that contain hydroquinone (HQ). This medication works by darkening skin cells, which reduces the appearance of hyperpigmentation. Be sure to follow the directions carefully so you don't end up with any unwanted side effects.
- Apply sunscreen every day even if you're only going outside for a short while. Sunlight contains UVA and UVB rays, both of which can cause skin damage and hasten the development of Hyper pigmentation lesions. Use an SPF 30 or higher when sunbathing, swimming, skiing, etc., to protect your skin from harmful UV radiation exposure.  
- Avoid wearing too much makeup or doing excessive tanning sessions because they will just make your spots darker.
- Apply topical treatments that contain glycolic or salicylic acid daily to your affected areas. These acids will break down melanin, lighten your skin tone, and reduce the appearance of dark spots and blemishes.

Cronulla rediscovered their form after last week's loss to Melbourne, with Talakai creating and benefiting from the team's excellence in a 34-22 win, although all the Sharks' brilliance was confined to the first half.

Talakai made his NRL debut back in 2016 with South Sydney but was out of the league after 2017, at one point working as a garbage man, before being given a train-and-trial opportunity in Cronulla before in 2020.

While his first two seasons with the Sharks were strong, in 2022 he is making a case for Dally M centre of the year and he looked the part on Thursday night.

The steamrolling outside back scored two tries and set up three others as the Sharks stormed to a 32-0 half-time lead, with all the points coming down Talakai's left side of the field.

The first points came just 90 seconds into the game, when a shift to the left put Talakai outside his opposite number, Morgan Harper, who was beaten again 15 minutes in when Matt Moylan gave Talakai early ball and he skipped past and through to the tryline.

He appeared set for his hat-trick in the 20th minute when he powered to the outside again, but Harper and wing partner Jason Saab reined him in, only for the Shark to pop a miraculous ball out the back to Ronaldo Mulitalo to score.

Another left-side shift saw Talakai set up Mulitalo on an overlap before the best of the lot, when Talakai stepped inside Harper on the halfway line, charged 40 metres untouched and kept his composure to grubber through for fullback Will Kennedy to score.

Talakai did not touch the ball in the lead-up to the last try in the final seconds of the half, but his presence no doubt put doubt in the mind of the defence and helped the second rower inside him, Teig Wilton, stroll over untouched off Nicho Hynes's short ball.",2022-04-06 01:14:34,2022-04-06,"australia, Sports, rugby",en,en,en,en,Cronulla centre Siosifa Talakai has reaffirmed his status as one of the most damaging players in the NRL with an unstoppable performance as the Sharks beat Manly Cronulla rediscovered their form after last week s loss to Melbourne with Talakai creating and benefiting from the team s excellence in a win although all the Sharks brilliance was confined to the first half Talakai made his NRL debut back in with South Sydney but was out of the league after at one point working as a garbage man before being given a train and trial opportunity in Cronulla before in While his first two seasons with the Sharks were strong in he is making a case for Dally M centre of the year and he looked the part on Thursday night The steamrolling outside back scored two tries and set up three others as the Sharks stormed to a half time lead with all the points coming down Talakai s left side of the field The first points came just seconds into the game when a shift to the left put Talakai outside his opposite number Morgan Harper who was beaten again minutes in when Matt Moylan gave Talakai early ball and he skipped past and through to the tryline He appeared set for his hat trick in the th minute when he powered to the outside again but Harper and wing partner Jason Saab reined him in only for the Shark to pop a miraculous ball out the back to Ronaldo Mulitalo to score Another left side shift saw Talakai set up Mulitalo on an overlap before the best of the lot when Talakai stepped inside Harper on the halfway line charged metres untouched and kept his composure to grubber through for fullback Will Kennedy to score Talakai did not touch the ball in the lead up to the last try in the final seconds of the half but his presence no doubt put doubt in the mind of the defence and helped the second rower inside him Teig Wilton stroll over untouched off Nicho Hynes s short ball ,Cronulla Sharks beat Manly Sea Eagles 34-22,0.0035570357,1.2796306e-05,8.987479e-05,0.0032438692,0.00050015183,8.9657355e-05,0.00045505798,Melbourne,-37.814,144.96332,,0

 There are women, like Goan sportsperson Steffi Cardozo, who have broken the glass ceiling by sacrificing their personal life in pursuit of their goals. Steffi was an upright girl who always dreamt of becoming a doctor. However, as a promising shot put athlete, the urge to make the state proud was too strong to resist. And at the age of 13, Steffi decided to make the switch from science stream to arts with the sole ambition of pursuing a career in sports at Patiala, Punjab. 
""I would travel alone all over the country and participate in competitions and sports events. I sacrificed my childhood and trained at the National Institute of Sports at Patiala, Punjab for over eight years,"" said Steffi.
 She represented India on nine occasions, won 28 national medals and broke a number of state and national records. Despite being a dedicated sportswoman, Steffi pursued her education and completed her masters in public administration as well as her business administration in sports management.
 According to Steffi, gender equality is one of the major concerns in Indian society. ""Over decades, women have fought their ways out of the male-dominant culture. The sports industry is one such example which has seen an upsurge in the number of women athletes,"" she said.  
""Sport teaches women and girls the values of teamwork, self-reliance, resilience and has an effect on their health, education and leadership development; self-esteem; social connections; and challenges harmful gender norms.""  Steffi says that women and girls should have an equal opportunity to enjoy the benefits. 
“People need to become more aware that women and men are equal and complementary. Behind every successful woman is her own dream and hardwork, and we all have a wonder woman inside us,"" she emphasised.

For the first time, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has shown that the fainter star at the centre of this scene is shrouded in dust. This star has been ejecting rings of gas and dust in all directions for thousands of years. 

NASA TV reported that the Southern Ring Nebula, also known as NGC 3132, is a planetary nebula that was recently photographed by two cameras on board the Webb space telescope. It is 2,500 light-years away, roughly. 

Astronomers will be able to delve into a lot more details about planetary nebulae like this one, which are clouds of gas and dust released by dead stars, thanks to Webb. Researchers will benefit from knowing which molecules are present and where they are distributed throughout the shells of gas and dust.

Two stars, which are locked in a tight orbit, shape the local landscape. Webb's infrared images feature new details in this complex system. The stars – and their layers of light – are prominent in the image from Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) on the left, while the image from Webb’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on the right shows for the first time that the second star is surrounded by dust. The brighter star is in an earlier stage of its stellar evolution and will probably eject its own planetary nebula in the future.

In the meantime, the brighter star influences the nebula’s appearance.

Niente derby contro l’Internacional","A distanza di soli pochi giorni dall’assalto al pullman dei giocatori del Bahia, una nuova macchia piomba sul calcio brasiliano, con un episodio di violenza molto simile. 

Nella serata di sabato, infatti, si sarebbe dovuto giocare il derby di Porto Alegre tra Internacional e Grêmio, valevole per la 9° giornata del Campeonato Gaùcho. Mentre la squadra ospite si stava dirigendo all’Estádio José Pinheiro Borda, però, il pullman è stato preso d’assalto dai tifosi avversari, che hanno iniziato a lanciare pietre e sbarre di ferro spaccando i vetri dei finestrini, come riportato sui canali social del Grêmio. 

Nell’attacco brutale è rimasto ferito un calciatore, il paraguaiano Mathías Villasanti, colpito all’altezza del sopracciglio e trasportato subito in ospedale. La dirigenza ha così comunicato la propria volontà di non scendere in campo per disputare la partita, a differenza di quanto accaduto col Bahia qualche giorno fa. 

Una presa di posizione netta, volta a contrastare l’ennesimo episodio di violenza del calcio brasiliano e a mostrare vicinanza al calciatore rimasto ferito. Restano ancora da individuare gli autori del gesto.

While the latter is still on the books as the club's third-choice goalkeeper, the former was moved 
out on loan in January, and the move has paid off.

During the January transfer window, Inaki Pena joined Turkish giants Galatasaray on loan until 
the conclusion of the current season. The 23-year-old was signed as a replacement for 
Fernando Muslera, who is out with an injury. He has played eight games, allowing 11 goals and 
keeping one clean sheet.

The clean sheet occurred on Pea's return to Barcelona, when the Catalans faced Galatasaray in the UEFA Europa League Round of 16 match. The Spaniard put up a strong performance at Camp Nou to help the visitors to a goalless draw, but they were defeated in the return leg at home.

Pea, on the other hand, made a strong impression on manager Xavi Hernandez, who is considering moving him to the No. 2 position behind Marc-Andre ter Stegen. At the same time, the La Masia alumnus is gaining attention from other places.

According to Diario AS, Celta Vigo, Barcelona's La Liga rivals, are mulling a summer move for 
Inaki Pena. Matias Dituro's loan arrangement with the Galician club will expire at the conclusion of the season.And they're on the lookout for a successor for the Argentine, with Celta Vigo consultant Luis Campos recommending Pea as an alternative.

Galatasaray, on the other hand, is intrigued in 
the 23-year-old and is open to extending his loan or purchasing him outright.

Pena has been with Barcelona since 2012, when he transferred from Villarreal's youth academy.

The 23-year-old has yet to play for the club in the first team.

Sharad Pawar has always been a strongman of the Marathas and one of the tallest leaders of Maharashtra, evoking strong loyalty among his men, awe and admiration for his brand of leadership across the spectrum--even as a few critics have wondered the secret of his abilities and financial clout.

However, the last few days have seen trying times for him due to the difficulties faced by his close aides and ministers of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) following action by the Central agencies on cases relating to disproportionate assets, benami acquisitions amid allegations of money laundering.

At least 14 Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) leaders in Maharashtra are being investigated by these central agencies, including the Enforcement Directorate (ED), Income Tax (IT) department and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).

Many of these leaders are very close to Pawar. Two of these leaders, Nawab Mallik and  Anil Deshmukh, were also arrested by the ED.

Most of the probes were initiated after the NCP, Shiv Sena and the Congress formed a coalition of diametrically opposite parties after the 2019 elections, outsmarting the BJP. That's because the results threw up a tally that saw the BJP's pre-poll ally Sena insisting on the chief minister's post and later walking out of its three-decade-old alliance with the BJP.

Prior to this development, Pawar and the BJP apparently tried to work out an understanding between them. Later the BJP tried unsuccessfully to break the NCP with the help of Ajit Pawar. However, the Devendra Fadnavis-Ajit Pawar government lasted only for 80 hours after an early morning swearing-in at Raj Bhavan because Ajit Pawar could not get enough NCP MLAs to defy Sharad Pawar and cross over to back the BJP.

The episode left severe heartburn among Central and Maharashtra BJP leaders because the Sena had the last laugh. Uddhav Thackeray became CM, ending his father's policy of staying directly out of office and wielding remote control.

Love according to me is -

When two people are in love , their souls share a language unknown to the rest of the world . Just being with them makes you forget everything and it feels like you have got everything you ever wanted . Well , it's true that with the right person by your side you can find joy and happiness even in the smallest things of life . Love isn't always about fancy dates or grand romantic gestures , it's actually the little - everyday - things which makes it a lot more special .

Love is sitting with them on rainy evenings playing their favourite songs and sipping a cup of tea . Love is when they just look at you and smile . Love is wearing their favourite colour . Love is when they go out of their comfort zone to cook your favourite biryani . Love is when they ask you to drop a text as soon as you reach home . Love is looking into their eyes and never getting tired of it . Love is sitting under the sky and holding their hands . Love is silently shifting them to the opposite side of the traffic . Love is keeping their picture in your wallet . ❤️

We have a thousand perceptions about love and one day we find someone who gives meaning to all of those . You find home in their embrace and your soul feels at peace with them . They are our sunshine in the morning and peaceful sleep in the night With them life has changed in a way you never expected and you don't want to give this love away for anything in the world .

The masks — which are coming from the Strategic National Stockpile — will be made available at a number of local pharmacies and community health centers, the official said, adding that the program will be ""fully up and running by early February.""

The 400 million non-surgical N95 masks amount to more than half of the 750 million stored in the US' Strategic National Stockpile, a figure that tripled over the last year as the White House sought to boost reserves. The US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention recently advised that well-fitting respirators approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health -- such as N95 masks -- offer ""the highest level of protection"" against Covid-19.

The administration's step comes as the US grapples with an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases. An average of more than 750,000 new Covid-19 infections were reported every day over the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

Beyond masks, the federal government has also quietly launched its website to sign up for free Covid-19 tests, allowing people to order a maximum of four tests shipped directly to their household.

Canada’s top weather event in 2021 was British Columbia’s record-breaking heat, according to Environment and Climate Change Canada. The temperature in Lytton, B.C., hit 49.6 C on June 29. The following day a wildfire destroyed 90 per cent of the town, killing two people and displacing 1,200 others.

Heat waves also exacerbate existing health issues, including cardiovascular and respiratory disease. They’re associated with increased hospital admissions, psychological stress and aggressive behavior, as well as excess mortality.

During heat waves, the highest temperatures are often found in urbanized areas. Urbanization is almost always associated with an increase in paved, impervious areas, and often a decrease in greenery. Concrete and asphalt roads, and other built materials readily absorb, store and release heat, raising city temperatures, a phenomenon called the urban heat island.

Many studies have shown that urban forests can reduce the urban heat island, and many policies focus their attention on large green spaces. Small green spaces, such as yards, rooftops and small parcels of undeveloped land, can make impressive contributions to lowering urban heat, but they are often overlooked when developing strategies for urban cooling 
Cities rarely have the opportunity to add large green spaces to help counter the effects of heatwaves. Smaller vegetated spaces, however, can still meaningfully decrease local land temperatures.

As to who is number one or two, it is up to you to decide. But do these bands really deserve such intense hate? 
Honest answer : No. Creed and Nickelback are two of the most consistent, unoriginal and uncreative rock bands out there, true. There is nothing special about them, but sometimes some generic corporate rock with ridiculous lyrics is fine, because it has that certain factor of dumb fun that a lot of great bands like Gojira, Iron Maiden, Dream Theater and Katatonia don’t have. These two bands have been the highest selling rock bands of the 2000s, and for many, it is rather ‘cool’ to hate on what is popular.

In the case of Creed, they are hated for three things: obscene levels of radio play of their biggest hits such as ‘With Arms Wide Open’, ‘My Sacrifice’ and ‘One Last Breath’. This made people sick to their core essentially making Creed victims of their own success. While the band has maintained that they are not religious, their sort of Christian lyrics added a stigma to the band, while Scott Stapp is not a particularly impressive vocalist, sounding basically like a cheap version of Eddie Vedder from Pearl Jam.

For Nickelback, the hate is not as much generated from their mediocre musicianship or lyrics as it is by their incredible marketing skills. Signing off to Roadrunner Records, a major heavy metal label, Nickleback marketed their music in the most innovative way one could think of. A barely classifiable hard rock band getting the backing of a major metal label made them prime targets of hate, and gave them all the publicity they needed. It's become one of the biggest memes to trash talk Nickelback, and yet their biggest haters will bump their heads to one of their songs.

When India played its debut T20 international in 2006, Dinesh Karthik was in the game and he does look ahead to the game in 2022. When Sunil Chettri kicked off an international soccer career in 2005, nobody could possibly imagine such heroic continuity till the 2023 AFC Cup.

Both are actually fine poster boys for the anti-ageism brigade, fervently proving that 'Youngness' has nothing to do with youth. Simply put, 'Youngness' is a hybrid state of body and mind, where fitness combines effortlessly with ingenuity to make the biological clock null and void. Here experience becomes an uncanny point of difference, the induction of wisdom making unique acumen a piercing missile. The tipping point surely has been the new-found ' Yo Yo' culture, with even the finest skill rendered redundant in the absence of table-stake athleticism.

But then, my observations are more to do with the world at large and not just the limited ambit of sport. In professions and vocations, across global locations, we are obsessed with thrusting the lesser in age with the largest of responsibilities. Every HR person will confess, sotto voice at least, that the CEO mandate is veering relentlessly towards the early forties, and this pattern extends organically to entire leadership suites. Most notably, such thinking is pampered by the tech geek stories, freckled dropouts in boxer shorts conjuring obscene evaluations.

Although, upon application of simple, scalable logic, this argument does seem to capsize and the icebergs are many. Just like sportspeople, even corporate players are way fitter than ever before, courtesy the evolution of wellness, a penchant for fashion, and a greater appetite for life. Indians, for instance, enjoy an average tenure expectancy close to seventy, while galloping affluence and healthcare promise to escalate this further. The fifty-plus age cohort is the newfound darling of marketers and second innings careerists now forge a burgeoning community.

These thoughts could actually trigger many mental health conditions like depression, OCD and anxiety. 
The researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem have found that proactive control is better than reactive control for managing these intrusive thoughts. It is better in the long run, it is better to sit with these unwanted or intrusive thoughts rather than changing your focus of thought. 
Managing Intrusive Thoughts
Hannah Martin, a psychotherapist and founder of Talented Ladies Club,, says that, “When we have a reactive response, such as replacing the thought with a more desirable one, we are simply trying to fool our brain, almost like a sleight of hand trick, but what we aren’t doing is interrupting and eliminating the habit.”
By being proactive it doesn't mean that we are giving the unwanted thought free rein, but “making it conscious, challenging its validity, and whether or not it serves us” so that we can choose so as to how we want to feel and think. 
“Reactive thinking is not empowering,” she says, “We aren’t ridding ourselves of our habitual, intrusive thoughts. Instead, we’re trying to mask them with a coping mechanism. Proactive thinking enables us to recognize and change habits, which empowers us.”
She describes that the intrusive thoughts as our ""mental habits"" with the thoughts that sometimes shows up from our subconscious, which stems from things we believe about ourselves or how we think we’re perceived by others. 
If you find a recurring intrusive thought or a similar theme then ask yourself that what it might be rooted in, does it relate to the things you have felt while you were young or when other people have said anything to you or about you? Then this can be a clue. 
“When you can see it has an origin, and that origin may not be based on a truth, you can stop accepting it as inevitable or a fact, and see it for the illusion it really is,” says Martin.

To mantain body storez, do these-
👉Give your baby foods that are rich in iron and zinc, such as iron-enriched infant cereals, pureed meats and poultry dishes
Iron-enriched rice-based cereals are frequently recommended as the first food to be introduced, as there is the additional benefit of a lower risk of an allergic reaction.
👉Foods can be introduced in any order, provided the texture is suitable for your baby’s stage of development. Foods range from fruits and vegetables (for vitamin and mineral content) to meat, poultry, fish and whole eggs.
👉Do not add salt, sugar or honey to your baby’s food. It is unnecessary.
👉Avoid cow’s milk as a drink in the first 12 months. Small amounts can be used in cereals and custards. All milk used should be pasteurised.
👉Whole fruit is preferable to fruit juice. Avoid juices and sugar sweetened drinks.
👉Put your baby to bed without a bottle, or take the bottle away when they have finished feeding to minimise long-term exposure of their teeth to sugar containing liquids.
👉Avoid whole nuts, seeds or similar hard foods to reduce the risk of choking.
👉Introduce foods one at a time. Offer new foods once every 3 to 4 days to avoid confusion and to rule out food allergy and sensitivity.

In his first interview about the movie, which is slated to be released by Paramount this December, he tells Vanity Fair that ""the basic idea was just to do a big, epic, multicharacter movie, set in these early days of Los Angeles and Hollywood, when both of these things were coming into what we now think of them as."" 

Babylon, which stars a brazen Brad Pitt, an unbridled Margot Robbie, and newcomer Diego Calva, appears to be an opulent romp through Hollywood's fledgling Golden Age.  

Vanity Fair reported that beneath the glitz and glamour, Chazelle wanted Babylon to underscore the fact that the town’s rapid change and growth came at a price. “Everything is shifting underneath people’s feet,” he says, “and I became really fascinated by the human cost of disruption at that magnitude, at a time when there was no road map, when everything was just new and wild.”",2022-02-09 01:45:15,2022-02-09,"Technology, History, Food, Entertainment, Sports, Environment, Science, Inequality, Education, Health, Politics, Economy, Climate change ",en,en,en,en,Since he first arrived in Los Angeles some years ago Damien Chazelle has been developing the plot for Babylon at least in his mind In his first interview about the movie which is slated to be released by Paramount this December he tells Vanity Fair that the basic idea was just to do a big epic multicharacter movie set in these early days of Los Angeles and Hollywood when both of these things were coming into what we now think of them as Babylon which stars a brazen Brad Pitt an unbridled Margot Robbie and newcomer Diego Calva appears to be an opulent romp through Hollywood s fledgling Golden Age Vanity Fair reported that beneath the glitz and glamour Chazelle wanted Babylon to underscore the fact that the town s rapid change and growth came at a price Everything is shifting underneath people s feet he says and I became really fascinated by the human cost of disruption at that magnitude at a time when there was no road map when everything was just new and wild ,Everything you need to know about Babylon!,0.005194974,4.3444616e-06,0.00026370355,0.00045208674,0.0017310871,4.382221e-05,8.636373e-05,Hollywood,26.0112,-80.14949,50.0,50

He said the move was necessary because “inflation is much too high.”

The US central bank is aggressively increasing rates at levels unseen since the mid-1990s as it struggles to tamp down soaring prices, which rose by an annual rate of 9.1% in June, the fastest inflation rate since 1981.

When mortgage rates, car loans, and credit cards are more costly, the theory goes, people are less inclined to spend, and inflation comes down.

Powell said: ""My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down. And we’re moving expeditiously to do so.
We have both the tools we need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.""
Powell added: ""The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two and a half years and have proved resilient.
We must bring inflation down to our 2% goal if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.""

This isn't healthy for America. Something has to be done as soon as possible to decrease the cost of living and an increase in interest rate will only worsen the troubles of the people.

But this is not what it actually signifies. 
Hiphop is a  worldwide cultural movement which was started in late 1970's. Hip hop basically compromises of 5 elements known as Deejaying, Emceeing, bboying, graffiti and beatboxing. Deejaying further spreads into basic deejaying, turntablism, music production etc. Emceeing refers to all the rap and hiphop artists. Bboying joining hands with breaking. Graffiti also shows some unique wall art and other creative arts on different displays. Beatboxers go individual but they also work with djs and producers.  There is another misconception that people carry and that is Hiphop means only Rap. This is just a statement and has no connection with the reality. Although rap is a big and main part of the hiphop culture today because among all the elements, rap has grown and evolved with a different approach. Rap is loved by more people if compared to other elements of hiphop. Rap is a part of hiphop culture but not the whole culture itself. Just like that some say breaking and bboying are the real hiphop elements. Some say graffiti is the true art of hiphop.

Hart hurried over to warn Celtic manager Ange Postecoglou after witnessing the broken bottle on the ground and alerting the referee, before discussing the situation with Rangers player Aaron Ramsey. 

In the Celtic penalty area, a number of stewards joined referee Collum to help remove the grass, while Ranger’s striker Kemar Roofe assisted by examining the ground alongside Celtic's Hart.

Andy Walker, a former Celtic striker, remarked on Sky Sports in response to the incident:

""That is absolutely outrageous, to see broken bottles on the field of play which can affect the referee, the players, anyone that it's aimed at. It's outrageous.

""It's one thing to demonstrate, as we saw a couple of weeks ago, to protest using tennis balls, toilet paper - and we'd even get issues with that. But broken bottles? It beggars’ belief.

Three persons were arrested when a turnstile at Ibrox was vandalised with expanding foam ahead of the Old Firm game on Sunday, which was supposed to be used by Rangers fans.

The foam was sprayed around the turnstile entrances at the Broomloan end, which was normally the Celtic fans' away end in this match.

Celtic supporters were only handed 650 tickets for the match, compared to the 7,000 tickets that used to be distributed to every visiting club at Old Firm matches prior to 2018. The match on Sunday was the first Glasgow derby to feature away fans since before the outbreak.

A police statement read: ""Police responded around 2.45am on Sunday, April 3, 2022 following vandalism at Ibrox Stadium, Govan.

A charity accounting expert explains,"Most tax-exempt nonprofits must file a 990 form with the Internal Revenue Service every year, typically in mid-May.

The 990 is purely informational. Nonprofits commit to serve an “approved purpose” – such as fighting bigotry, protecting animal welfare or sheltering the homeless – and meeting other eligibility rules. In exchange, they generally don’t pay taxes on the donations they receive or other sources of income. But they must file either this 12-page form or a shorter version of it, in which they report information about their finances, leadership and activities.

The IRS needs this information to verify that nonprofits should keep their tax-exempt status. It reviews 990s and selects some to audit, just as it does for individuals and businesses.

The 990’s formal title is “Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax.” Since 1941, these forms have given the IRS an overview of nonprofit finances, including revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities. The form sums up the group’s mission, indicates who sits on its board of directors and states highest-paid employees’ pay.

The most recent version discloses details regarding the group’s activities through answers to more than 80 questions. While charitable nonprofits file most 990s, other entities, such as nonexempt charitable trusts, private foundations and some political organizations, also must file them.

Why 990s matter

Because the government makes this data publicly available, organizations that assess the quality of a nonprofit’s operations and management, such as Charity Navigator, can analyze it. This helps the public assess whether the organization is trustworthy.

And prospective donors and others may easily access 990 forms, with help from “finder” features that groups like ProPublica and Candid maintain.

When nonprofits fail to file 990s for three years in a row, the IRS automatically revokes their tax-exempt status. Those organizations may apply to have it reinstated by sending in a new application and paying a fee.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will contest the upcoming assembly elections from Gorakhpur and not Ayodhya or Mathura. 

There was intense speculation that Adityanath will be fielded from either of the two temple towns as part of the BJP's strategy to project him as the Hindutva icon. 

But the central leadership of the BJP decided that the Chief Minister should contest from his stronghold only. 

""The decision has been made after much deliberation. The final decision was taken by the top leadership of the party,"" Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said.

""Yogiji said 'I will contest from any seat party asks me to'. This was the party's decision,"" Pradhan said, dismissing reports suggesting that Yogi had been insisting on contesting from Gorakhpur. 

Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya will contest from Sirathu seat in Prayagraj district.

In its first list, the BJP named candidates for 107 of the total 403 seats. Out of these 107, the saffrom party had won 83 in 2017. 

The winning legislators from 63 of these seats have been retained, with the remaining 20 being fresh faces. 

Also, 44 candidates are from the OBC (Other Backward Classes) communities, with 19 others from Scheduled Castes. There are only 10 women candidates in the first list of 107 candidates. 

The names on the remaining 296 seats will be announced later.

Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, the country's most populated and politically important state, will be held in seven phases, beginning February 10, with votes to be counted on March 10.

Soon after the announcement, Adityanath said: ""I am thankful to PM Modi, BJP chief JP Nadda, (and the) Central Parliamentary Committee for fielding me from Gorakhpur. BJP works on the model of 'sabka saath, sabka vikas'... BJP will form the government with full majority.""

Reacting to it, Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav took a jibe at Adityanath. ""I like that the BJP has already sent him to Gorakhpur. Yogi should stay there... there is no need for him to come from there,"" he said.

Musk also asserted that he was ""hoodwinked"" into signing the agreement to purchase the San Francisco-based social media business in a countersuit filed in a Delaware court on Friday that was filed under seal and made public on Thursday.

In India, Musk reportedly stated that Twitter should abide with local laws, according to court records. Images of the court records were shared on Twitter by Kate Conger, a tech reporter for the New York Times.

""In 2021, India's information technology ministry imposed certain rules allowing the government to probe social media posts, demand identifying information, and prosecute companies that refused to comply. While Musk is a proponent of free speech, he believes that moderation on Twitter should ""hew close to the laws of countries in which Twitter operates"" read a portion of the legal filings in Twitter Vs Musk lawsuit, as posted by New York Times tech reporter Kate Conger in a series of tweets.

Twitter reacted to Elon Musk's allegations in the court documents by saying it ""refers the Court with respect to their correct and comprehensive contents.

Twitter and Musk are currently engaged in a legal dispute over a failed acquisition bid that Twitter now plans to push through.

Musk also asserted that he was ""hoodwinked"" into signing the agreement to purchase the San Francisco-based social media business in a countersuit filed in a Delaware court on Friday that was filed under seal and made public on Thursday.

In India, Musk reportedly stated that Twitter should abide with local laws, according to court records. Images of the court records were shared on Twitter by Kate Conger, a tech reporter for the New York Times.

""In 2021, India's information technology ministry imposed certain rules allowing the government to probe social media posts, demand identifying information, and prosecute companies that refused to comply.

300 gr. tagliatelle
4 carciofi
2 acciughe sotto sale
1 limone
1 spicchio d'aglio
20 capperi
pepe q.b.
olio extravergine d'oliva q.b.
cipolla q.b.
sale q.b.
prezzemolo q.b.

Preparazione
Prima di iniziare mettiamoci un paio di guanti per evitare che si macchino le mani mentre prepariamo il nostro piatto. Iniziamo pulendo i carciofi in questo modo: eliminiamo i gambi e le foglie esterne più dure, dividiamoli a metà e togliamo la ""barba"". Li laviamo, li tagliamo a spicchi e li mettiamo in una terrina con acqua fredda e succo di limone, in questo modo eviteremo di farli annerire, infine dissaliamo i capperi sotto l'acqua corrente, togliamo la lisca e laviamo bene le acciughe.

Tritiamo la cipolla e il prezzemolo e facciamoli soffriggere con 5 o 6 cucchiai d'olio, con i capperi, le acciughe e lo spicchio d'aglio che poi andremo a togliere. Quando i nostri ingredienti sono soffritti e l'acciuga si è sciolta, togliamo l'aglio e inseriamo i carciofi ben scolati. Mischiamo tutti gli ingredienti e aggiungiamo acqua, quanto basta, per portare a cottura i carciofi. Saliamo pochissimo per via delle acciughe e dei capperi. Intanto che i carciofi finiscono di cuocere, mettiamo l'acqua per cucinare le tagliatelle e saliamo.

Quando la pasta è al dente la scoliamo e le facciamo finire la cottura  nella pentola o nel saltapasta dove abbiamo cotto i carciofi, mettendo se occorre acqua di cottura. Per servire le tagliatelle prendiamo un mestolo e una forchetta, tiriamo su una abbondante forchettata di basta e la arrotoliamo dentro al mestolo creando il famoso nido, che andremo ad impiattare. Per finire cospargiamo la pasta di prezzemolo, di pepe e mettiamo un filo d'olio, servendo le nostre tagliatelle ben calde.

Positive news for football lovers as the Premier League is set to return next weekend after the fixtures this weekend was postponed due to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth’s sad death. The EFL and WSL also postponed their fixtures this weekend after the Premier League made their announcement on Friday morning. The decision was criticized by many as it was reported that after conversations with the Government, the Premier League were not encouraged in any way to call their games off and many felt that if games continued with tributes on display for the Queen, this would have been a more suitable way to honour her life.
The EFL earlier today announced that their league fixtures will resume on Tuesday and reports now suggest that the Premier League will also resume next weekend. Of course, one factor for this decision is the fact that this season is already a congested one with the winter World Cup and it would prove to be near impossible for two sets of postponed fixtures to be rescheduled and played in January. It has been announced that the Queen’s state funeral will take place on Monday 20th September.
It has also been reported that the games set to be played in London may not be played as police officers will be on standby ahead of the Queen’s state funeral on Monday. Chelsea are set to host Liverpool and Arsenal will travel to Brentford on the same day. Tottenham will also take on Leicester in the capital on Saturday. It is understood that TV companies, clubs, and the Premier League are desperate to get the games on and will look at different alternatives. This could mean that kick-off timing could be adjusted and the potential of switching fixtures to different days has also been discussed.

A trionfare nell’edizione numero 119 della mitica Parigi-Roubaix, a succedere nell’albo d’oro all’italiano Sonny Colbrelli, è l’olandese Dylan Van Baarle, 29enne del team Ineos. Il ciclista, alla sua affermazione più importante della carriera, è 
arrivato in solitaria al traguardo come al solito posizionato all’interno del velodromo di Roubaix, con quasi due minuti di vantaggio sul belga Wout Van Aert, che ha preceduto lo svizzero Stefan Kung. Sfortunato il più quotato degli italiani: Filippo Ganna, che di Van Baarle è compagno di squadra, è sempre stato molto attivo ma ha poi perso terreno a causa degli sforzi per rientrare dopo una foratura e un salto di catena nei tratti in pavé. Male è andata anche a Davide Ballerini, che ha forato nel tratto più duro della corsa, la temibile foresta di Arenberg.

With the end of the Morrison government's fiscal stimulus programme for culture, the RISE fund, governmental financing for cultural creation will be rapidly withdrawn. 

This year, the arts portfolio budget line would shrink by 19 percent, or roughly A$190 million. The budget's forecast estimates also cut funds for a number of funding programmes and cultural institutions. Regional arts, community broadcasting, contemporary music, Screen Australia, and the National Library of Australia all face cuts.

It should come as no surprise that in such a tight budget, there was no room for publishing or literature. There were no new announcements to aid in the writing process. 

The Australia Council for the Arts is getting a small boost in funding, as is the vital public lending right subsidy, which helps authors and publishers whose work is borrowed in libraries and schools. These minor gains, however, are significantly below inflation, which is expected to be 4.25 percent this year, resulting in real-term decreases.

Commentators raise the question in editorials in newspapers and magazines, and there’ve been several well-reviewed books on this subject. The latest is from Francis Fukuyama, among the most influential political philosophers. ‘Liberalism and Its Discontents’ (releasing this week) takes the debate forward. 

Though in economics ‘liberalism’ means free markets; in philosophy and by extension in politics, it is a view that all people are equal. This goes counter to the conservative thought which accords privileges based on gender, race, class, caste, religion, etc. Over the past couple of centuries, with political revolutions and economic-technological progress, the old elite had to grudgingly accept the new order – loosely termed ‘Liberal Democracy’.
 
Liberalism strove to make societies equal – by measures like positive discrimination, extra concern for marginalized groups and various minorities. This is also reflected in the human rights movement. Such moves were resented by those who used to be privileged. Such measures also left much to be desired in their implementation, leading to the failure of the Liberal Project. 

As a result, a backlash formed up. In the US, the white middle class felt left out, and in Europe many felt their traditional culture and way-of-life were being swept aside by refugees. This anguish, understandable within their own framework, led to the rise of Donald Trump in the US and Brexit in the UK. In Brazil, Turkey, India and elsewhere, the old order came to reassert itself with the advent of a number of populist, right-wing leaders.

Putin then famously said in 2019 that Liberal Democracy was “obsolete”: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48798875

That is the backdrop to the question. Fukuyama, well known for his ‘End of History’ thesis around the fall of communism used to be placed in the conservative camp. After ‘Identity’ (2019), he has emerged as a philosopher sympathetic to liberal value while fully appreciating conservative concerns. In the new work, he argues there have been excesses from both the right and the left, damaging liberalism, and argues for revitalizing it: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374606718/liberalismanditsdiscontents

Nei miei 31 anni come operatore umanitario, raramente ho visto così tanti danni causati in così poco tempo. In Ucraina, bambini, famiglie e comunità sono sotto attacco. Dei 3,2 milioni di bambini che si stima siano rimasti nelle loro case, quasi la metà potrebbe essere a rischio di non avere abbastanza cibo. Gli attacchi alle infrastrutture del sistema idrico e la mancanza di energia elettrica hanno lasciato circa 1,4 milioni di persone senza accesso all'acqua in Ucraina. Altri 4,6 milioni di persone hanno solo un accesso limitato. La situazione è ancora peggiore in città come Mariupol e Kherson, dove i bambini e le loro famiglie sono rimasti per settimane senza acqua corrente e servizi igienici, fornitura regolare di cibo e cure mediche. Si rifugiano nelle loro case e sottoterra, aspettando che le bombe e la violenza cessino. Il 10 aprile, l'OHCHR aveva verificato 142 bambini uccisi e 229 feriti. Sappiamo che questi numeri sono probabilmente molto più alti - molti dei quali causati dal fuoco incrociato o dall'uso di armi esplosive in aree popolate. Anche tutti i sistemi che aiutano i bambini a sopravvivere sono sotto attacco. Le ostilità hanno danneggiato o distrutto centinaia di case residenziali. Gli attacchi agli ospedali, alle strutture sanitarie e alle attrezzature mediche - e l'uccisione e il ferimento del personale sanitario - stanno rendendo ancora più difficile l'accesso alle cure di emergenza, all'assistenza sanitaria di base e alle medicine. Centinaia di scuole e strutture per l'istruzione sono state attaccate o utilizzate per scopi militari.  Altre servono come rifugi per i civili. La chiusura delle scuole in tutta la nazione sta avendo un impatto sull'apprendimento - e sul futuro - di 5,7 milioni di bambini in età scolare e di 1,5 milioni di studenti che frequentano l'istruzione superiore.

Scopriamolo insieme,"Esistono, nel diritto privato italiano, alcune cause di giustificazione per comportamenti antigiuridici che altrimenti sarebbero illeciti.
Le cause tipiche di giustificazione sono tre:
- il consenso dell’avente diritto
- La legittima difesa
- Lo stato di necessità
Per quanto riguarda il primo punto, non è responsabile chi lede un diritto con il consenso della persona che può validamente disporne. Ad esempio, l’uso dell’immagine di una persona senza consenso è illecito, ma se il consenso si ha, automaticamente non perviene l’illiceità. Questo però non vale per tutti i diritti, ad esempio, non è un ragionamento che si può applicare ai diritti fondamentali e personali (come la vita). 
Per quanto riguarda la legittima difesa, basterà riportare l’ART.2044 del c.c.: non è responsabile chi ha commesso il fatto per esservi costretto dalla necessità di difendere un diritto proprio od altrui contro il pericolo attuale di un’offesa ingiusta, sempre che la difesa sia proporzionata all’offesa. 
Allo stesso modo, non sarà responsabile chi compie il fatto dannoso costretto dalla necessità di salvare sé o altri dal pericolo attuale di un danno grave alla perdona (= stato di necessità). Ad esempio, se per evitare di investire un passante colto da improvviso malore il conducente di un’auto la diriga verso il marciapiede sfondando la vetrina di un negozio, il danno verrà ripartito equamente, non sarà solo a carico del conducente.",2022-01-17 20:50:36,2022-01-17,"law, law and order, law and justice, laws, lawyer, lawyers, legge",it,it,it,it,"In Italian private law, there are some justification causes for unlawful conduct that would otherwise be unlawful. There are three typical justification causes: the consent of the person entitled to it. The legitimate defense. The state of necessity. As regards the first point, whoever violates a right with consent is not responsible of the person who can validly dispose of it For example, the use of a person&#39;s image without consent is illicit but if the consent is obtained automatically the illicitness does not occur This however does not apply to all rights, for example it is not a reasoning that can be applied to fundamental rights and personal like life As regards self-defense, it will suffice to report the ART of the civil code whoever committed the crime is not responsible for being forced to do so by the need to defend one&#39;s own or another&#39;s right against the current danger of an unjust offense provided that the defense is proportionate to the offense In the same way, whoever commits the harmful act forced by the need to save others from the current danger of serious damage to the state of necessity will not be responsible. head towards the curb by breaking through a shop window the damage will be distributed equally it will not be solely the responsibility of the driver",Esistono comportamenti antigiuridici che vengono giustificati?

I'm still in pain from that."" 

The 84-year-old former US Marine and Kiowa tribal member Donald Neconie made these remarks at the opening ceremony of the ""Road to Healing"" tour, which got under way on Saturday at the Riverside Indian School in Anadarko, Oklahoma. 

ABC News reported that former pupils of the government-sponsored ""Indian"" boarding school Riverside, including Mr. Neconie and other native American tribal elders, testified in court about the abuse they suffered there, including beatings, whippings, sexual assaults, humiliation, and terrible nicknames. 

They were from various states and tribes, but they had one thing in common: they had gone to a school that was set up to deprive Indigenous people of their cultural identities.

As the elders spoke, US Secretary of Interior Deb Haaland — herself a Laguna Pueblo from New Mexico and the first Native American cabinet secretary in US history — listened quietly.

""I'm here to listen. I will listen with you, I will grieve with you, I will believe you and I will feel your pain,"" Ms Haaland said.

Riverside was Ms Haaland's first stop in the nationwide tour that will give First Americans, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiian survivors of federal Indian boarding school policies a platform to share their painful experiences.

Ms Haaland's agency recently released a report that identified more than 400 schools that were centres of forced assimilation from the early 1800s through to the 1970s, with the stated goal of wiping out Native American culture.

The report said students, often separated from their families by the age of four or five, endured ""rampant physical, sexual, and emotional abuse"".",2022-03-02 09:50:34,2022-03-02,native americans,en,en,en,en, I ll never ever be able to forget what this school did to me I m still in pain from that The year old former US Marine and Kiowa tribal member Donald Neconie made these remarks at the opening ceremony of the Road to Healing tour which got under way on Saturday at the Riverside Indian School in Anadarko Oklahoma ABC News reported that former pupils of the government sponsored Indian boarding school Riverside including Mr Neconie and other native American tribal elders testified in court about the abuse they suffered there including beatings whippings sexual assaults humiliation and terrible nicknames They were from various states and tribes but they had one thing in common they had gone to a school that was set up to deprive Indigenous people of their cultural identities As the elders spoke US Secretary of Interior Deb Haaland herself a Laguna Pueblo from New Mexico and the first Native American cabinet secretary in US history listened quietly I m here to listen I will listen with you I will grieve with you I will believe you and I will feel your pain Ms Haaland said Riverside was Ms Haaland s first stop in the nationwide tour that will give First Americans Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiian survivors of federal Indian boarding school policies a platform to share their painful experiences Ms Haaland s agency recently released a report that identified more than schools that were centres of forced assimilation from the early s through to the s with the stated goal of wiping out Native American culture The report said students often separated from their families by the age of four or five endured rampant physical sexual and emotional abuse ,The Road to Healing Tour for Native Americans!,0.00040136778,1.0375559e-06,2.6215404e-05,5.8476555e-05,0.00013527922,1.2842555e-05,9.744411e-06,Province of Laguna,14.16667,121.33333,,0

She came home running

       back to the mothering blackness   

       deep in the smothering blackness

white tears icicle gold plains of her face   

       She came home running


She came down creeping

       here to the black arms waiting

       now to the warm heart waiting

rime of alien dreams defrosts her rich brown face   

       She came down creeping


She came home blameless

       black yet as Hagar’s daughter

       tall as was Sheba’s daughter

threats of northern winds die on the desert’s face   

       She came home blameless


In ‘The Mothering Blackness’ a young girl is confronted with the problem of returning home.  She is running home in the dark crying because she knew she did something that her mother wouldn’t agree with. In her journey back home, she worries that her mother will not accept her. She is “creeping” back home because she feels ashamed of what she did. But the lines intended, show otherwise for despite knowing what the daughter has done, her mother, wanting her to come back. The intended lines portray their mother and daughter relationship’s complicatedness and allow both their points of view to be seen.

The central idea of the poem focuses on the mother and daughter relationship. Within the relationship, the poem explores the idea of anxiety, fear, forgiveness, comfort, darkness, etc. The poem emphasizes on mother’s love and forgiving nature. Mothers though tend to forgive, especially their children, with open arms and tend to forget anything that has happened as long as their child is safe.

02: St. Sophia Cathedral and Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra

Situated in Kyiv, the capital city of Ukraine, Saint Sophia Cathedral is an architectural marvel! This monument is quite ancient and is an important landmark in the city. The cathedral is also important because it was the first UNESCO World Heritage Site in Ukraine along with the Kyiv Cave Monastery complex.

03: Wooden Churches of the Carpathian Region

The Wooden Churches of the Carpathian Region (spread in Poland and Ukraine) boasts of 16 wooden churches displaying a horizontal log construction. Among these, eight are in Ukraine. These churches from the 16th to 19th centuries, are set in secluded parts of the Carpathian Mountains. These were enlisted as a UNESCO World Heritage List in 2011.

04: Beech Forests of the Carpathians

This is a set of some 78 forests that are spread across 18 European nations and among these 12 (nearly 25%) are in Ukraine. These are ancient and primeval forests steeped deep in legends and mysteries are absolutely unique!

05: Struve Geodetic Arc

It’s basically a chain of survey triangulations stretching from Hammerfest in Norway to the Black Sea. The chain was first used by Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve (a German-born Russian scientist) between 1816 and 1855 to set the absolute size and shape of the earth. The first point of the Arc is set in Tartu Observatory in Estonia.


06: Residence of Bukovinian and Dalmatian Metropolitans

Kicking off the campaign, the English skipper Harry Kane will be seen wearing the OneLove armband against Italy in their Nations League tie on Friday (September 23). The campaign will go on till the end of the season, including the upcoming Qatar World Cup.
Following months of discussions, the captains of European nations have finally settled for a campaign to show support to minority groups. The likes of Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Wales are also part of the campaign.
The OneLove armband includes a heart consisting of colours representative of all backgrounds with number one printed in white at the middle.
“I am honoured to join my fellow national team captains in supporting the important OneLove campaign,” Kane said.
“As captains we may all be competing against each other on the pitch, but we stand together against all forms of discrimination. This is even more relevant at a time when division is common in society. Wearing the armband together on behalf of our teams will send a clear message when the world is watching.”
England’s preparation for World Cup
The Three Lions will play against Italy and Germany in the Nations League before the club football resumes. England currently have no win in four games and are sitting at the bottom of Group C. They will be desperate to win the two crucial encounters and gain confidence and rhyme ahead of the Qatar World Cup.
Surprisingly, these are the only two games they have in hand ahead of the biggest event in the football world. No warm-ups games for England before they head into the World Cup.

In 2021, a record 41,000-plus organ transplants were performed in the U.S., with top numbers for kidney, liver and heart transplants. But a limited supply of donor organs remains an ongoing problem. Currently over 100,000 people are on the transplant wait list in the U.S., and many more are unable to get on the list because of strict eligibility requirements and racial disparities in access.

As a cardiac transplant surgeon, I have personally witnessed the tragedy of this shortage of donor organs. But I have also seen the potential of one possible solution to this problem: xenotransplantation, or transplanting animal organs into human beings.

In September 2021, researchers successfully transplanted two genetically engineered pig kidneys into a brain-dead patient. And in January 2022, I was part of the surgical team that conducted the first pig-to-human heart transplant in a living patient. Recent news about the patient’s death two months after the procedure is sobering, but researchers like me remain optimistic. While much work still needs to be done, these successes point to how far science has come toward making animal-to-human transplants a viable treatment possibility.

Early attempts

While animal-to-human transplants have attracted considerable attention recently, many attempts have been made to transplant animal cells, tissues and organs into humans over the past 60 years, with varying degrees of success.

In the 1960s, kidney transplantation was not broadly practiced because of a lack of donor organs. Ethical and legal concerns made it difficult to obtain live donors, and organs collected from deceased donors did not meet much success.

So a surgeon named Keith Reemtsma performed a series of 12 kidney transplants using chimpanzees as donors. While most of the transplanted organs – and thus the human patients – survived for only a few weeks, one of the patients survived for nine months. Infection was the major issue in half of the patients, while irreversible organ rejection occurred in the other half.

Something different from what we had seen till then. We were astonished to see our English-speaking lecturers and professors wearing pants and Bu-shirts while we used to wear dhotis and shirts. We always thought they come from a different world.

They would come and give lectures in English. We were not very familiar with that language. We had some rudimentary kind of knowledge. Since the medium of restriction was Malayalam only, we found it very difficult to follow much of what they said.

I would like to particularly mention Professor Kurien. He was educated at Oxford University in London and the head of the English department in our college, which was also run by a Christian missionary.

So, he would come to the class and give a lecture in English for one hour. After he left, we all would go ‘what a wonderful lecture’ without understanding a word he had said. That was a measure of his greatness and eminence.

These were our initial days at the college. After that, we slowly got used to it. We started learning English as everybody was speaking in English only and the lectures were also given in English. Slowly we got used to it although we were not able to speak yet or converse in English. Among us, we would speak in Malayalam. Interestingly, our lecturers and professors would ask questions of us in English only and we tried to answer those in English with great difficulty. Most of us would reply in Malayalam. This went on for a year or so.

Diary of a Cop : The shift to Bagaha,"Prior to the 1st of December in 2006, I had never ever imagined even in the wildest of my thoughts that I would someday be posted as the SP of Bagaha.

The name of Bagaha in the subconscious mind had often seemed like some distant land in Bihar cut-off from the mainstream, and of which I had no particular knowledge. But so quick was the transition that just one phone call at around 9.45 p.m. changed the whole way in which my thinking process was set. At that time, I had completed about 9 months being the City Superintendent of Police in Patna.
 
On that particular day I had left office late for my residence as I had been busy with signing the orders on several crime files. As I was alighting the stairs to reach the Bedroom of the old Historic City SP Residence in Gandhimaidan, Patna, I saw the phone ringing with the name of the caller being the DGP, Bihar. 

As I picked the call, the DGP congratulated and informed me that the Government had posted me as the new SP of Bagaha and had desired my presence in the new place of posting overnight. I was advised to start within 1 or 2 hours on the journey for Bagaha via Muzaffarpur. So sudden was the impact of the call, that I could hardly react and just affirmed my consent as the short call ended. As I was on the first floor of the old residence, I saw my wife waiting who totally unaware of the new development, was seemingly perturbed about my having been very late from office.

We still lag behind in terms of even knowing what Autism is in India . Every April 2nd, we see posts about Autism, we see people sporting blue outfits, and we hear companies talking about inclusion and Neurodiversity. But what happens on the ground? Is any of this actually making a difference to autism in India?

I don’t wear blue or trot out my son, who is on the spectrum, or talk about Autism on this one day of the year. I live with it every day and work on how to make things better for those like my son – every single day.

Nine years ago, I co-founded Sense Kaleidoscopes with my partner Akshayee in Bangalore. We are the first-ever art academy for Autism in India. We are also the first to craft success stories about Autism that will blow your mind.

Our students range from ages 7 to 27. We have created an environment where their comprehension gaps are dealt with, where strength-based autism-specific curricula are developed with their cooperation, and where they are free to be who they are without judgement. That is why we have success stories. If we provide the right environment and the learning mechanism our autistic youngsters need to grow and thrive, then they will do their best to surprise us – day after day.

With their artworks being exhibited in different cities in India and globally, the students of Sense Kaleidoscopes have shown what is possible with the right kind of support. Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder, not a disease. It is a different kind of brain. Not less, just different.

This April 2nd, take a moment and reach out to someone with autism. Make them feel like they belong in this world that is more interested in finding fault than in offering acceptance.

The researchers observed unexpected, rapid ""electron precipitation"" from low-Earth orbit using the ELFIN mission, a pair of tiny satellites built and operated on the UCLA campus by undergraduate and graduate students guided by a small team of staff mentors.

By combining the ELFIN data with more distant observations from NASA's THEMIS spacecraft, the scientists determined that the sudden downpour was caused by whistler waves, a type of electromagnetic wave that ripples through plasma in space and affects electrons in the Earth's magnetosphere, causing them to ""spill over"" into the atmosphere.

Their findings, published March 25 in the journal Nature Communications, demonstrate that whistler waves are responsible for far more electron rain than current theories and space weather models predict.

""ELFIN is the first satellite to measure these super-fast electrons,"" said Xiaojia Zhang, lead author and a researcher in UCLA's department of Earth, planetary and space sciences. ""The mission is yielding new insights due to its unique vantage point in the chain of events that produces them.""

Central to that chain of events is the near-Earth space environment, which is filled with charged particles orbiting in giant rings around the planet, called Van Allen radiation belts. Electrons in these belts travel in Slinky-like spirals that literally bounce between the Earth's north and south poles. Under certain conditions, whistler waves are generated within the radiation belts, energizing and speeding up the electrons. This effectively stretches out the electrons' travel path so much that they fall out of the belts and precipitate into the atmosphere, creating the electron rain.

One can imagine the Van Allen belts as a large reservoir filled with water—or, in this case, electrons, said Vassilis Angelopolous, a UCLA professor of space physics and ELFIN's principal investigator. As the reservoir fills, water periodically spirals down into a relief drain to keep the basin from overflowing. But when large waves occur in the reservoir, the sloshing water spills over the edge, faster and in greater volume than the relief drainage.",2022-03-16 09:57:35,2022-03-16,super electrons,en,en,en,en,UCLA scientists have discovered a new source of super fast energetic electrons raining down on Earth a phenomenon that contributes to the colorful aurora borealis but also poses hazards to satellites spacecraft and astronauts The researchers observed unexpected rapid electron precipitation from low Earth orbit using the ELFIN mission a pair of tiny satellites built and operated on the UCLA campus by undergraduate and graduate students guided by a small team of staff mentors By combining the ELFIN data with more distant observations from NASA s THEMIS spacecraft the scientists determined that the sudden downpour was caused by whistler waves a type of electromagnetic wave that ripples through plasma in space and affects electrons in the Earth s magnetosphere causing them to spill over into the atmosphere Their findings published March in the journal Nature Communications demonstrate that whistler waves are responsible for far more electron rain than current theories and space weather models predict ELFIN is the first satellite to measure these super fast electrons said Xiaojia Zhang lead author and a researcher in UCLA s department of Earth planetary and space sciences The mission is yielding new insights due to its unique vantage point in the chain of events that produces them Central to that chain of events is the near Earth space environment which is filled with charged particles orbiting in giant rings around the planet called Van Allen radiation belts Electrons in these belts travel in Slinky like spirals that literally bounce between the Earth s north and south poles Under certain conditions whistler waves are generated within the radiation belts energizing and speeding up the electrons This effectively stretches out the electrons travel path so much that they fall out of the belts and precipitate into the atmosphere creating the electron rain One can imagine the Van Allen belts as a large reservoir filled with water or in this case electrons said Vassilis Angelopolous a UCLA professor of space physics and ELFIN s principal investigator As the reservoir fills water periodically spirals down into a relief drain to keep the basin from overflowing But when large waves occur in the reservoir the sloshing water spills over the edge faster and in greater volume than the relief drainage ,Researchers discover source of super-fast electron rain,0.001466964,8.206122e-06,0.00010952331,0.0004862969,0.00036814206,3.9777333e-05,8.946435e-05,Blue Earth County,44.03459,-94.06703,,0

അഞ്ച് സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളെ ചൗബെ
പ്രതിനിധീകരിച്ചു.

വിവിധ സംസ്ഥാനങ്ങളിലെ പത്തോളം ക്ലബുകൾക്കും അദ്ദേഹം ഗ്ലൗസ് അണിഞ്ഞു. എന്നാൽ ഒരു ക്ലബിലും രണ്ടു വർഷത്തിൽ കൂടുതൽ തുടരാൻ ചൗബെക്ക് കഴിഞ്ഞില്ല. 

ടാറ്റ ഫുട്ബോൾ അക്കാദമിയിൽ നിന്ന് 1995 ൽ പുറത്തിറങ്ങിയ താരം ആദ്യം കളിച്ചത് മോഹൻ ബഗാന് വേണ്ടിയാണ്. രണ്ടു വർഷം അവിടെ തുടർന്നു. പിന്നീട് ഈസ്റ്റ് ബംഗാൾ, ബംഗാൾ മുംബൈ എഫ്സി, സാൽഗോക്കർ, ജെസിടി, മഹീന്ദ്ര, മുംബൈ എഫ്സി തുടങ്ങിയ ക്ലബുകളിലും ഒന്നോ രണ്ടോ വർഷം വീതം കളിച്ചു. 

അതിനിടെ ബംഗ്ലാദേശ് ക്ലബായ മുക്തിജോദയിലും ഭാഗ്യം പരീക്ഷിക്കാൻ ചൗബെ എത്തി. ജർമൻ ബുണ്ടസ് ലീഗ് രണ്ടാം ഡിവിഷൻ ക്ലബിൽ ട്രയൽസിനായും പോയി. 

ഏജ് ഗ്രൂപ്പ് തലത്തിൽ എല്ലാ ഇന്ത്യൻ ടീമുകളെയും പ്രതിനിധീകരിച്ച ചൗബെ 1999 ലാണ് ആദ്യമായി സീനിയർ ടീമിൽ എത്തുന്നത്. കയറിയും ഇറങ്ങിയും 2006 വരെ ഇന്ത്യൻ ടീമിൽ തുടർന്നു. 

രണ്ടു തവണ മികച്ച ഇന്ത്യൻ ഗോൾ കീപ്പർ അവാർഡ് നേടുകയും സാഫ് കപ്പ് ഉൾപ്പടെ നേടിയ ഇന്ത്യൻ ടീമിൽ അംഗമാവുകയും ചെയ്തു.

കളിയിൽ നിന്ന് വിരമിച്ച ശേഷം മോഡലിംഗ് രംഗത്തേക്ക് കടന്നെങ്കിലും രക്ഷയില്ലെന്ന് കണ്ട് പിൻവാങ്ങി. പിന്നാലേ 2010 മുതൽ 2013 വരെ മോഹൻ ബഗാൻ അക്കാദമിയുടെ സി ഇ ഒ, ഗോൾ പ്രൊജക്ട് കോർഡിനേറ്റർ ചുമതലകൾ.

2015 ൽ പുതിയ പരീക്ഷണവുമായി ബിജെപിയിൽ ചേർന്നു. ലോക്സഭാ തിരഞ്ഞെടുപ്പിൽ കൃഷ്ണാനഗറിൽ ബിജെപി സ്ഥാനാർഥി. തൃണമൂലിൻ്റെ മോഹുവ മൊയ്ത്രയോട് തോൽവി.

More than 60% of voters and 30% of Democrats said Biden should not run again. Among all voters, 57% said Trump should not run again. Among Republicans, that total was 26%. But most of those polled do not know who they would like to run instead, either. The vice-president, Kamala Harris, and the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, were the leading named contenders.

Biden, 79 and the oldest president ever inaugurated, has said he intends to run for a second term.“I’m a great respecter of fate,” he said in December. “Fate has intervened in my life many, many times. If I’m in the health I’m in now, if I’m in good health, then in fact I would run again.”

Trump has suggested he will soon declare a third presidential run, probably as a way of avoiding potential criminal charges over his election subversion efforts and the deadly Capitol attack.

Respondents in the poll were asked who they would prefer as the Democratic candidate if Biden did not run. “Someone else” attracted 44.2% support but among named alternatives the vice-president, Kamala Harris, led with 16.1%.

'Badshah Khan Hospital, the hospital built by the people of Faridabad with their own hands was named after their beloved leader Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan' – Reads the inauguration plaque at the Faridabad’s civil hospital – which was inaugurated by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on June 5, 1951.

In December 2020, when the Haryana government decided to rename the Badshah Khan Hospital in Faridabad after former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the people of the New Industrial Town (NIT) in Faridabad were up in arms and eventually, the government had to roll back its decision.  

Even after seven decades of partition, for the people of NIT (in Faridabad), who have roots at the six districts of North West Frontier Post – Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan, Peshawar, Hazara, Kohat, and Mardan – late Abdul Gaffar Khan is still their beloved leader. He passed away at the age of 87 — on January 20, 1988.  

Late Abdul Gaffar Khan, who is popularly known as Frontier Gandhi, was a great advocate of Hindu-Muslim unity in the Indian sub-continent. He was conferred with the Bharat Ratna in 1987.

“Abdul Gaffar Khan was the beloved leader of all the people, who came from the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP). Many of our elders were part of the organisation Khudai Khidmatgar (servants of God) formed by him in the pre-Independence era,” says 81-year-old Mohan Singh Bhatia, the president of the Bhatia Sewak Samaj, a Faridabad based organisation of the people from NWFP.

“After 1947, whenever Abdul Gaffar Khan used to visit Delhi, he wouldn’t go without making a visit to Faridabad. He had a close association with the people of Faridabad,” says senior journalist Sushil Bhatia, 54. “I got an opportunity to meet him in 1980 in Faridabad. It’s been almost four decades, but I still remember each and every moment of that meeting by heart. He was a charismatic leader and for us, who have roots at North West Frontier Post, Badshah Khan is our identity.”

England becomes much more difficult as the team will miss out on the services of Demi Vance who picked out a niggle in the previous fixture against Austria.

England, on the other hand, smashed eight past hapless Norway on the second match day.

There were five different goalscorers for Three Lioness and Beth Mead bagged the hattrick 
against Norway.

Some of the players signed after the Abu Dhabi acquisition have been disappointing to say the least.

On that topic, let's take a look at some of the worst signings made by City since their Abu Dhabi takeover:


#5.  Wilfried Bony

Wilfried Bony earned his name in the Premier League while playing for Swansea City from 2013 to 2015. In 54 games during those two seasons, he scored 25 league goals.

Manchester City recruited the Ivorian striker in the winter of 2015 after noticing this. He was signed to play as Sergio Aguero's backup. Bony's decision was surprising, given that he might have featured regularly for Swansea City.
Bony was loaned out to Stoke City when Pep Guardiola took over in 2016. He was sold back to Swansea City at the end of his season-long loan. For all parties concerned, signing Wilfried Bony for Manchester City was a complete waste of time, money, and effort.


#4.  Eliaquim Mangala

In 2011, Eliaquim Mangala joined Porto, a Portuguese club. With his performances there, he impressed Manchester City, and a move was almost completed in the winter transfer window of 2012. The trade fell through due to Porto's high valuation of the defender.

With all the attention on him, Mangala did himself no favours in the Premier League by being reckless and needlessly aggressive.

Abstract
Background
Diabetes self-management (DSM) is essential for patients to achieve better health outcomes. However, previous studies have demonstrated that the performance of DSM is not optimal. This study was designed to identify the significant determinants of self-management behavior in type 2 diabetes(T2DM) patients to improve DSM.
Method
A convenient sampling method was employed in this study. Data were collected from a community health center from January to February 2021 in Nanjing city, China. A total of 431 patients completed the self-administered questionnaires. A structural equation model based on the theory of planned behavior(TPB) was adopted for analysis.
Results
TPB model presents excellent goodness of fit of data. Attitude (β=0.161, P < 0.01), subjective norms (SN) (β=0.239, P < 0.001), and perceived behavior control (PBC) (β=0.197, P < 0.001) were strong predictors of intention. Intention (β=0.230, P < 0.001) and PBC (β=0.259, P < 0.001) had a direct effect on self-management behavior. The impact of attitude and SN on behavior was significantly mediated via behavioral intention.
Conclusion
The application of TPB to self-management behavior in T2DM patients can significantly enhance our understanding of theory-based self-management behavior. This predictive model could potentially be a valuable tool and provide a feasible approach for formulating more targeted and population-specific DSM interventions in future research.

“Gli interventi di restauro e di valorizzazione – afferma Vittorio Vaccari, presidente dell’Associazione Il Bel San Michele onlus della Basilica di San Michele a Pavia, scaturiscono dal vivo desiderio di poter consegnare alle generazioni future un monumento, lasciatoci in eredità dai nostri padri e, allo stesso tempo, garantire all’odierna comunità una sua maggiore fruibilità liturgica e culturale e una conoscenza della propria storia.

Tall and powerfully","Jimmy Sinclair did more than anyone to put South African cricket on the map. 
Tall and powerfully built, he liked nothing more than to hit the ball hard or bowl as fast as he could. In 1898-99 he scored 86 (as an opener) at Johannesburg and followed with a brilliant 106 at Cape Town (South Africa's first Test hundred) against the all-conquering England side led by Lord Hawke. At Cape Town he also took 6 for 26 and 3 for 63. In 1901 he toured England and cemented his reputation as a big hitter but failed to put together many innings of substance - the same could be said of his visits in 1904 and 1907. But as a bowler he excelled on the green wickets, with his high action to the fore, and he took 107 wickets in 1901 and 100 in 1904. He was fortunate to make the 1901 tour - he was captured by the Boers (the Boer war was taking place) and had to escape from a POW camp and make his way to safety behind the British lines. At home his form remained breathtaking. In 1902-03 he scored back-to-back centuries against Australia at Johannesburg and Cape Town - his second hundred taking 80 minutes - and in 1905 grabbed 21 wickets against England. By 1907 South Africa were dominated by their quartet of googly bowlers, and he was largely marginalised, although his slogging continued to thrill. Against England in 1909-10 and Australia the following winter he struggled to impose himself with either bat or ball, and he died in 1913, aged 36. Sinclair not only excelled at cricket; he played rugby for South Africa and England, and was also a skilled hockey and football player.

In general, these papal visits primarily concern Catholics and may not hold much interest for the general population. With stops in Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré, Que., Edmonton, Maskwacis, Alta., and Iqaluit, this tour appears to be aimed primarily at Indigenous peoples: its purpose is to apologize on behalf of the Catholic Church for its involvement in Indian Residential Schools.

Indeed, of the 139 residential schools recognized by the legal definition of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (IRSSA), approximately 60 per cent were run by Catholics. It makes sense, then, for Indigenous communities to be the primary audience for this visit.

Should the rest of Canada overlook the visit? On the contrary, I believe the whole country should be concerned by what’s at stake. I have every reason to to feel concerned: I am an anthropologist and have been doing research for over 25 years on colonization and its impacts, the Algonquin religious landscape and residential schools. But the issue at stake here goes far beyond the boundaries of academic research.

Rewriting, erasing or judging history
What is the issue, exactly?
It is about our relationship to history, specifically that of the construction of a state that marginalized Indigenous Peoples and tried to assimilate them in order to destroy their societies and cultures.

The Catholic Church played an important role in this construction, beginning in New France. Religious men and women founded the educational and hospital systems. The parishes structured the urban network. The missionaries worked, here and there, to extend the railroads and colonize the land.

They influenced policies, promoted agriculture and gave their names to many geographical features in cities, provinces and territories. In addition, with the ideas of their times, they wrote and disseminated opinions widely shared by their fellow citizens, but which today would be considered unacceptable.

Today, some are tempted to dismiss history as, “in the past,” or to rewrite history, erase it or refuse to inherit it.

The report released yesterday, analyzed the median weekly wages of nearly 7,000 full-time LGBTQ+ workers, comparing them to the median weekly wages of others.

For every dollar, women who are trans earn about 60 cents; men who are trans, and non-binary, genderqueer, genderfluid and two-spirit folks earned about 70 cents; Latinx LGBTQ+ women earn about 72 cents; Black women earn about 85 cents.

“Despite decades of work to achieve equal pay for equal work, LGBTQ+ workers continue to earn less than their heterosexual and cisgender peers and discrimination throughout the workforce—in hiring, salaries, and promotions—is likely playing a large role,” Jay Brown, HRC Senior Vice President of Programs, Research and Training said in a statement.

The racial disparities of the broader workforce are replicated, with people of color being paid less than white people: for every dollar, white LGBTQ+ workers earn 97 cents; Native American LGBTQ+ workers earn 70 cents; Black LGBTQ+ workers earn 80 cents; Latinx LGBTQ+ workers earn 90 cents.

“It is possible that wage disparities may be even larger than what is reported here because our analyses focused just on full-time employed workers, and did not account for wages among part-time workers, or non-wage earners. Earning less impacts every facet of our lives - including access to housing, healthcare and food security—and must be addressed head on,"" Brown said. 

“While Asian/Asian Pacific Islander LGBTQ+ workers earned approximately the same as a typical worker in the United States, this represents a wage gap in and of itself: Among all workers in the United States, Asian/Asian Pacific Islander workers reported higher median weekly wages than the typical worker, though there is some nuance to this finding,” HRC reports.",2020-11-17 22:07:03,2020-11-17,"Economy, Inequality, lgbtq+, lgbtq, lgbtqia+, lgbt, transgender",en,en,en,en,The US LGBTQ wage gap is widening for every dollar LGBTQ workers are earning cents with the gap widening disproportionately for people of color trans and non binary folks according to data released yesterday by the Human Rights Campaign The report released yesterday analyzed the median weekly wages of nearly full time LGBTQ workers comparing them to the median weekly wages of others For every dollar women who are trans earn about cents men who are trans and non binary genderqueer genderfluid and two spirit folks earned about cents Latinx LGBTQ women earn about cents Black women earn about cents Despite decades of work to achieve equal pay for equal work LGBTQ workers continue to earn less than their heterosexual and cisgender peers and discrimination throughout the workforce in hiring salaries and promotions is likely playing a large role Jay Brown HRC Senior Vice President of Programs Research and Training said in a statement The racial disparities of the broader workforce are replicated with people of color being paid less than white people for every dollar white LGBTQ workers earn cents Native American LGBTQ workers earn cents Black LGBTQ workers earn cents Latinx LGBTQ workers earn cents It is possible that wage disparities may be even larger than what is reported here because our analyses focused just on full time employed workers and did not account for wages among part time workers or non wage earners Earning less impacts every facet of our lives including access to housing healthcare and food security and must be addressed head on Brown said While Asian Asian Pacific Islander LGBTQ workers earned approximately the same as a typical worker in the United States this represents a wage gap in and of itself Among all workers in the United States Asian Asian Pacific Islander workers reported higher median weekly wages than the typical worker though there is some nuance to this finding HRC reports ,"Wage Gap: For every dollar, trans and gender-conforming workers earn 60-70 cents",0.003010013,3.2641208e-06,0.0001397978,0.00018789808,0.00040153138,0.00021265767,5.4768647e-05,United States,39.76,-98.5,,0

Maybe it could have done with a bit more time, as two songs are set to be rerecorded and released.

This second change has been portrayed as a response to the singer Kelis calling the use of the sample “theft”, and to Beyoncé “allegedly failing to seek permission for usage”. But that’s not actually true. While Kelis might not have been paid for the sample – and that is an issue – that’s to do with her legal contract with her producers, not a failure on Beyoncé’s part.

Kelis is the performer of Milkshake, which was released in 2003. Now you might think she should be getting money for any use of the song. However, the credits and the royalties for Milkshake go to Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams, together known as The Neptunes, who reportedly wrote and produced it.

In the music industry, when a song is recorded it has two rights attached to it. One in the actual sound recording and one in the song itself. This is why Taylor Swift re-recorded and release her music to reclaim her rights in the sound recordings. She was the owner of the songs themselves but not the recordings, so she made new recordings.

These different rights are often owned by different people and are governed by contracts. So who owns what and how much they earn depends heavily on the agreement between the people involved.


In 2020, Kelis revealed in an interview that she doesn’t make any money from her two albums produced by The Neptunes. She said that she was told everything would be split three ways and so didn’t double check when presented with the contract.

A paleo diet typically includes lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds — foods that in the past could be obtained by hunting and gathering. A paleo diet limits foods that became common when farming emerged about 10,000 years ago: these foods include dairy products, legumes and grains.

Steps to make a oats chilla:
1. Add 1 cup of oats to a grinder 
2. Grind to a slightly coarse powder. If the flour is too coarse the oats chilla can break.
3. Add it to a mixing bowl along with

¼ cup besan
½ to ¾ cumin seeds (jeera) or carom seeds (ajwain)
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon turmeric. You can skip turmeric, I used it for the color.
4. Add
Vegetables according to you 
2 tablespoons coriander leaves finely chopped
5. Pour 1 cup water.
6. Mix to make a batter adding water as needed.
7. Heat your pan well. When it is hot enough, drizzle few drops of oil and smear with a tissue or cloth. If using a non-stick pan you don’t need to grease it.
8. Regulate the heat to medium flame. Mix the batter well. Pour 1 ladle full of batter. It will be about ¼ cup. 
9. Spread it with a light hand. Do not spread it too much. If the batter is too thick, you won’t be able to spread it as it will stick to the ladle as you spread. In this case add little more water. If the batter is too runny, the oats chilla will be too soft and limpy. In this case you may need to add a tbsp of besan.
10. Cook well on both the sides. To make it lightly crisp, cook on a medium heat for few minutes.

He made a thumbs down signal to the New York crowd at a game a few months ago. Randle has struggled throughout the season, and he hasn't missed much time either. He's only missed four games this season, so he's not as prone to injury as Anthony Davis in Los Angeles. Davis' numbers have also dropped this season, although he's been in and out of the lineup. Last season, he looked like a No. 1 option (until the playoffs), but this year, he's just another role player. Randle simply hasn't been able to compete at the same level as his teammates. He's not on Davis' level, but he's still an important part of the Knicks' lineup.

The Knicks thought they'd found their Batman and only needed a Robin, but it appears they're back on the hunt for the franchise's game-changer.

In terms of vote share, she defeated Sinha with a victory margin of only 28.06 percent. She only managed to win 64.03 percent of the vote, falling short of the 65.65 percent won by departing President Ram Nath Kovind in 2017. But with only three years under its bag, the Modi administration was still in its first term.

Murmu was able to secure the support of the entire House in Andhra Pradesh, Nagaland, and Sikkim because Sinha received zero votes in these areas. Even in Kerala, where the BJP was unable to win any seats in either the Assembly or the Lok Sabha, she was able to secure one vote.

In the 15th presidential election in 2017, Ramnath Kovind received 7 lakh 2 thousand 44 votes out of 10 lakh 69 thousand 358 valid votes, or 65.65 percent. This is the least votes ever cast for a presidential contender in the previous forty years. Former Lok Sabha speaker Meera Kumar, Ramnath's opponent in the 2017 election, received 3 lakh 67 thousand 314 votes. About 34.35 percent of the vote went to Meera, a candidate backed by numerous opposition parties, including the Congress.

The loss of the BJP and its allies in significant states like Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and Tamil Nadu as well as the drop in their seat total in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Gujarat, however, seem to have played a role in the decline in support for the NDA candidate.

In West Bengal, for example, where the BJP did well in the most recent elections, Murmu won 71 votes, up from just 11 in 2017. In Karnataka, it went up from 56 to 150. In 2017, 522 MPs backed Kovind while 540 MPs backed Murmu.

Hurricane Fiona made landfall as a powerful post-tropical storm on Saturday along the eastern shore of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador, delivering heavy rainfall, damaging winds and massive waves.The storm surge — a rise in seawater level — resulted in power outages, flooded roads, and in southwest Newfoundland, homes were washed away. The southwest coast of Newfoundland was hit particularly hard by extreme waves and storm surge, which were highest on the eastern side of the storm track.The huge storm had a very low atmospheric pressure (931.6 mb) — which is the lowest ever recorded for a tropical storm that made landfall in Canada. Low pressure weather systems are associated with strong winds and heavy rains.Offshore, the wave heights exceeded eight to 10 metres on the Scotian Shelf and reached 17 metres at the Banqureau Banks wave buoy.Past stormsHistorically, the Saxby Gale of 1869 was a massive storm that caused significant flooding in Nova Scotia. Other more recent storms, such as Hurricane Juan in 2003 and Hurricane Dorian in 2019 had big impacts, but they also weakened in storm intensity just before making landfall in Nova Scotia.Hurricanes with the size and strength of Fiona do not usually maintain their high wind speeds this far north. This makes Hurricane Fiona a pivotal event in the Canadian coastal ocean, as it raises the question of when this will happen again.How did Fiona get into Canadian water with such size and intensity? This is related to its heat source: the ocean. Ocean warming may be linked to the increasing intensity of storms making landfall and to the development of strong hurricanes.Read more: https://theconversation.com/fiona-hits-atlantic-canada-climate-change-means-the-region-will-see-more-frequent-storms-191313",2022-04-20 11:35:32,2022-04-20,"Technology, History, Food, Entertainment, Sports, Environment, Science, Inequality, Education, Health, Politics, Economy, Climate change ",en,en,en,en,Atlantic Canada has been left reeling from the impacts of one of the largest and most dangerous ocean storms to ever hit the region Hurricane Fiona made landfall as a powerful post tropical storm on Saturday along the eastern shore of Nova Scotia Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador delivering heavy rainfall damaging winds and massive waves The storm surge a rise in seawater level resulted in power outages flooded roads and in southwest Newfoundland homes were washed away The southwest coast of Newfoundland was hit particularly hard by extreme waves and storm surge which were highest on the eastern side of the storm track The huge storm had a very low atmospheric pressure mb which is the lowest ever recorded for a tropical storm that made landfall in Canada Low pressure weather systems are associated with strong winds and heavy rains Offshore the wave heights exceeded eight to metres on the Scotian Shelf and reached metres at the Banqureau Banks wave buoy Past stormsHistorically the Saxby Gale of was a massive storm that caused significant flooding in Nova Scotia Other more recent storms such as Hurricane Juan in and Hurricane Dorian in had big impacts but they also weakened in storm intensity just before making landfall in Nova Scotia Hurricanes with the size and strength of Fiona do not usually maintain their high wind speeds this far north This makes Hurricane Fiona a pivotal event in the Canadian coastal ocean as it raises the question of when this will happen again How did Fiona get into Canadian water with such size and intensity This is related to its heat source the ocean Ocean warming may be linked to the increasing intensity of storms making landfall and to the development of strong hurricanes Read more ,Fiona hits Atlantic Canada: Climate change means the region will see more frequent storms,0.00044424672,1.206064e-06,2.952999e-05,6.558905e-05,0.00012909966,1.5765654e-05,1.3629786e-05,Nova Scotia,45.00015,-62.99865,,20

Gigi opened the show in a sweater emblazoned with Ralph Lauren’s initials, teamed with tailored trousers, cut-out brogues and a sturdy black handbag embodying classic NYC style. Bella later strolled down the catwalk in an equally polished outfit, comprising a black roll neck,  with a crisp white shirt and checked blazer over the top. The look was finished off with a matching bag and loafers.The show, which involved a predominantly monochrome palette, also featured a series of timeless black and white evening looks.

Antonio Conte's first week at Tottenham had speculations swirling that he wanted to bring his former Inter Milan centre-back Milan Skriniar to North London in January to lead his signature three-man backline. The 6ft 2in Slovakian had already been linked with a move to Tottenham, with Jose Mourinho supposedly offering £30 million for the 26-year-old in the summer of 2020. 


Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool)
For several years, Virgil van Dijk has been regarded as the best centre-back in the world, with his tall frame and ball-handling abilities helping Liverpool to a Champions League final in his first six months, a Champions League trophy the following year, and a first Premier League title 12 months later.

Jules Kounde (Sevilla)
Koundé's natural position is as a right-sided central defender, but he is quick, athletic, and technically gifted enough to also play right-back. He runs long, lung-busting runs there with the expertise of a professional full-back. After a strong second season with Sevilla, the 23-year-old centre-back made his international debut at Euro 21, and his form has continued in Spain's domestic league.

Raphael Varane (Manchester United)
Varane is also a very capable defender in the air, and when he is on the pitch, he gives Manchester United an immediate boost in terms of defending set pieces.

These bills threaten 10 years of imprisonment onto doctors providing this care, and would make schools unsafe spaces for trans youth, by requiring staff to ‘out’ students to parents who could be non-supportive.

Continuing with a legacy of media misrepresentation and sensationalization, Alabama’s local media has failed to contextualize these bills, with only six articles being written about them.

In 15 local news articles covering legislation in Alabama and Idaho, half didn’t push-back against the fear-mongering misinformation of the bills, and two-thirds didn’t report that gender-affirming care is supported by every major medical organization in the country, a report by Media Matters finds.

“Local media holds an important position as a trusted source of information in communities across the country, making fairness and accuracy in local coverage of these issues a vital tool for voters to understand the dangers of bills targeting trans youth,” Media Matters reports.

In line with these coordinated legislative attacks against trans youth across the country, Alabama’s bills follow the common theme of medicalizing transness to strip a child’s autonomy, by falsley claiming that the child will ‘grow’ out of being transgender.

The “wait and see” approach recommended by the bills to support their argument for banning healthcare, will have devastating impacts.

More than half of trans children were at risk of suicide this past year, and access to gender-affirming care is linked to being at lower risk of attempting suicide by nearly 40 percent in transgender and nonbinary youth.

HB 266 and SB 184 were passed the House Judiciary Committee with a favorable report on March 2nd. HB 266 and SB 184 will also go to the Alabama House for a vote.

‌Filibuster means the 60-seat super majority needed for most legislation to pass the Senate without being blocked by any senator. This is supposed to protect the rights of the minority. According to Biden, “If the filibuster gets in the way, it’s like voting rights,“ adding that there should be an “exception to the filibuster for this action to deal with the supreme court decision”.
But many on the left charge Republicans and some centrist Democrats with using the rule more in the archaic, Spanish-derived sense of the word “filibuster” – as pirates or raiders, ransacking the political process for their purpose.

With the Senate split 50-50 and controlled by the vote of the vice-president, Kamala Harris, Democrats’ legislative options are hampered.
Biden is therefore under pressure to take executive action to protect abortion rights. Although his options are few, in Madrid he said he would meet governors on Friday to talk about the issue and would “have announcements to make then”.
Biden also repeated severe criticism of the decision to overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling which guaranteed the right to abortion, and reiterated his warning that other constitutional protections could be in danger from a supreme court leaned right by three justices appointed by Donald Trump. “One thing that has been destabilizing is the outrageous behavior of the supreme court of the United States in overruling not only Roe v Wade but essentially challenging the right to privacy.”

Organizzata da Pistoia Musei e curata da  Angelo Tartuferi, Enrica Neri Lusanna e Ada Labriola, la mostra si articola negli spazi dell’Antico Palazzo dei Vescovi e del Museo Civico di Pistoia, con un percorso di oltre sessanta opere tra  dipinti, sculture, oreficerie e codici miniati.

Anche nella stagione del Tardogotico, nonostante la perdita di autonomia politica e la definitiva sottomissione a Firenze, la città mantiene nel panorama della pittura toscana i suoi caratteri distintivi.

Partendo dalla vita di Alessandro Michele, e dalle profonde innovazioni che con il suo lavoro ha portato nella sensibilità contemporanea, lui ed Emanuele Coccia, che ha appena tenuto un ciclo di lezioni su Michele all’Università di Harvard, mostrano come due forme della creatività e della conoscenza umana tradizionalmente separate, filosofia e moda, in realtà sono indissolubilmente legate: se la moda sa far deflagrare secoli di arte e di sapere in un’esperienza quotidiana propria di ogni essere umano, la filosofia non può fare a meno di diventare, anche lei, una forma di moda.

जिन उम्मीदवारों को जीतवाने के लिए कभी शहर के नेता प्रयास करते थे।पंजाब विधानसभा चुनाव में इस बार इन नेताओं ने उन्हीं उम्मीदवारों के खिलाफ काम किया।जिनमे देवेंद्र सिंह बबला प्रमुख है।बबला हर बार मोहाली के कांग्रेस विधायक बलबीर सिंह सिद्धू के लिए प्रचार के लिए जाते थे।पिछले चुनाव में तो उन्हें मोहाली सीट के लिए कांग्रेस ने आब्जर्वर भी बनाया था।लेकिन इस बार बबला ने अपनी टीम के साथ सिद्धू के खिलाफ भाजपा उम्मीदवार के लिए खूब प्रचार किया।बबला भाजपा के पूर्व अध्यक्ष संजय टंडन के साथ भी प्रचार करने के लिए गए।पार्टी ने जब इसका प्रैस नोट जारी किया तो उन्होंने बबला का नाम देवेंद्र सिंह बदला लिखा।जिसको लेकर कुछ नेताओं ने चुटकी भी ली।नगर निगम चुनाव के बाद टंडन एक बार फिर से सक्रिय हो गए हैं जबकि अन्य नेता कुछ ठंडे पड़ गए हैं। 

नहीं दिखाई देते पार्षद
मेयर चुनाव के बाद से भाजपा, आप और कांग्रेस के पार्षदों में खटास पैदा हो गई है।जिस कारण विरेाधी दल के पार्षद मेयर के कमरे में कभी भी नहीं जाते हैं।चुने गए पार्षद भी नगर निगम में कम ही दिखाई देते हैं।जबकि पिछले नगर निगम के कार्यकाल में ऐसा नहीं था।मेयर सरबजीत कौर की ओर से भी प्रयास किया गया कि विरोधी दल के पार्षद उनके पास आकर काम करवाए लेकिन आप और कांग्रेस के पार्षद है कि मानते ही नहीं।जबकि आप के पार्षदों को मेयर से दूर बनाए रखने की भी सलाह दी गई है क्योंकि आप ने मेयर चुनाव को लेकर पंजाब व हरियाणा हाईकोर्ट में चुनौती दी हुई है।चुनाव जीतने के लिए पार्षदों ने अपने मतदाताओं से बड़े बड़े दावे किए थे लेकिन चुनाव हुए दो माह होने वाले है लेकिन किसी भी वार्ड में कोई बड़ा बदलाव नहीं हुआ है हालांकि कई पार्षद करवाए गए छोटे छोटे रूटीन के कामाें को करवाकर सोशल मीडिया पर उसे शेयर करके अपनी वाहावाही लेने का प्रयास कर रहे हैं।

Both Espanyol and Sevilla have done very poorly so far in the first few matches of La Liga2022/23. Sevilla have just 1 point in four matches while Espanyol have 4 points in 4 matches.  However, Sevilla have recently seen a managerial shift as former boss Julen Lopetegui has been sacked after the poor performances and thus Espanyol might have an upper hand in the
upcoming match. Sevilla will take some time to settle under their new system and Espanyolmight just capitalize on that.

Not everyone of us has been lucky enough to experience this wonder of nature. If the celestial event is so impressive from our planet, imagine how it must enthral those who view it from space! 

For those of us not having chosen being an astronaut as a career option, NASA comes to rescue.

Wion reported that in a solar eclipse, Moon is situated between the Earth and the Sun in a way that its shadow falls on Earth. Depending upon extent to which the Moon obstructs the Sun, there are three types of solar eclipses.

The one clicked by NASA is a partial solar eclipse. It has been clicked by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The SDO is NASA's observatory in the sky. It was launched in the year 2010.

The SDO recorded the 35-minute partial solar eclipse from space on Wednesday (June 29). Over the last 12 years, observations made SDO have been extremely useful to understand the Sun

She has been quite a journeywoman as she has plied her trade for FA WSL clubs Leicester City, Nottingham Forest, Bristol Academy, Birmingham City, Doncaster Belles, and Reading, and in the Bundesliga with VfL Wolfsburg. 


Earps joined Man Utd women in the 2019/20 season to replace retiring Siobhan Chamberlain. 


Mary Earps won the FA WSL cup with Reading in the 2016-17 season and she also won Frauen- Bundesliga in the 2018-19 season before moving to FA WSL club Manchester United.

Earps ranks 0.81 in shots which she is expected to save, even though the data doesn’t do her justice as she is a very good shot-stopper. Whether the opponent is taking shots from outside, inside or edge of the box Mary usually stops them or parries them away. 



In recent matches, she had made some saves which could be contenders for the Save of the Season award.


Her ball distribution is really good as she had made a total of 65.6 total passes per 90 out of which she had completed 29.0 and she has a pass completion of 81%. She has 16.8 per 90 in medium ball distribution passes. This season her ball distribution is much better than the last season.

Mary Earps has kept 9 clean sheets and she has faced 55 shots, out of which she had made 36 saves taking her tally to 69.1% in the number of saves she had made.

Mary also plays as a sweeper keeper. She pushes herself up the pitch and stays close to the last line of defense. Johan Cryuff always used to say that in his team, the goalkeeper is the first attacker and the striker is the first defender. Mary has come out to help her teammates. She has done 16 defensive actions outside the box. United plays from the back and Mary Earps is an integral part in orchestrating the play bringing Millie, Thorisdottir, and Mannion who are excellent ball progressors and distributors. ",2022-01-26 08:38:16,2022-01-26,"mary earps, women super league, football, Sports, visualization, goalkeeper",en,en,en,en,Mary Earps is an English footballer who plays for Manchester United women in FA WSL and England s women s national team She has been quite a journeywoman as she has plied her trade for FA WSL clubs Leicester City Nottingham Forest Bristol Academy Birmingham City Doncaster Belles and Reading and in the Bundesliga with VfL Wolfsburg Earps joined Man Utd women in the season to replace retiring Siobhan Chamberlain Mary Earps won the FA WSL cup with Reading in the season and she also won Frauen Bundesliga in the season before moving to FA WSL club Manchester United Earps ranks in shots which she is expected to save even though the data doesn t do her justice as she is a very good shot stopper Whether the opponent is taking shots from outside inside or edge of the box Mary usually stops them or parries them away In recent matches she had made some saves which could be contenders for the Save of the Season award Her ball distribution is really good as she had made a total of total passes per out of which she had completed and she has a pass completion of She has per in medium ball distribution passes This season her ball distribution is much better than the last season Mary Earps has kept clean sheets and she has faced shots out of which she had made saves taking her tally to in the number of saves she had made Mary also plays as a sweeper keeper She pushes herself up the pitch and stays close to the last line of defense Johan Cryuff always used to say that in his team the goalkeeper is the first attacker and the striker is the first defender Mary has come out to help her teammates She has done defensive actions outside the box United plays from the back and Mary Earps is an integral part in orchestrating the play bringing Millie Thorisdottir and Mannion who are excellent ball progressors and distributors ,Mary Earps - The  Red Devil Queen,0.00048121653,9.865536e-07,2.7458123e-05,6.416669e-05,0.00016304875,1.1954594e-05,9.893228e-06,Manchester,53.41667,-2.25,,50

If the sanctions continue, Russia could face the same problem Iran has been facing for several years now. According to some reports, Iran has been forced to ground more than 50 percent of its planes because of lack of spare parts after the sanctions. 

In fact, several air accidents in recent years in Iran have been blamed on acute shortage of spares after years of sanctions against it. In the meantime, reports have emerged that China has refused to help Russia with spares to violate international sanctions. ( https://www.airport-technology.com/news/china-aircraft-parts-russia/ )

There was a celebration in Iran after it struck the nuclear deal with the U.S. as one of the main reasons was that Iranians could fly fearlessly after the lifting of sanctions on the aviation industry. ( https://asiatimes.com/2022/01/in-iran-there-is-reason-to-have-a-fear-of-flying/ )

Sanctions will mean that Russia would not be able to get scores of new planes that were up for delivery this year, comprising mainly from Boeing. Hundreds of planes that have been leased from companies outside Russia are worry the companies. Will Russia allow for repossessing of jets from various carriers or “nationalise” them as some speculate will be watched closely.

According to reports, Russian airlines could run out of spares within weeks, and much of its airline industry could be grounded. As Russia is a vast country with several airlines, airline safety could become a major issue. And the aviation industry could end as one of the most unsafe countries to fly, and it could have its consequences on the economy.

The former chancellor has always been cautious of tax cuts, and is asked about the effect of borrowing £30bn for unfunded tax cuts – he says a “huge borrowing spree would only make it worse”.

“I do want to cut taxes, but do it in a way that delivers what we want and isn’t inflationary,” he says.

Sunak says he epitomizes Thatcherism in his aspiration to introduce ""sweeping sets of reforms"" that will ""drive growth"".

He also says that Thatcher ""gripped inflation"" before lowering taxes and he would follow her example to deliver tax cuts that create growth, without heightening inflation.

Now the former chancellor is asked about Brexit, he says voting Leave was the ""right thing to do. Sunak reveals that last December he flew back from a government trip overseas ""to stop us sleepwalking into another national lockdown"" due to the Omicron variant.

A press conference to announce a lockdown was ""hours away"" and he successfully fought to stop it, he says.

Sunak goes on to address the explanation the leadership contest came about in the first place, which he says was inflicted by a ""breakdown in trust"".

He says the next prime minister will need to rebuild faith in the government and be honest with people and the challenges that lie ahead.

We need a change as the people of the UK. Whoever delivers it is best suited for the next PM as problems raises one by one every day.

A 30-second long video clip where All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) President Asaduddin Owaisi is being greeted by a swarm of supporters in Jaipur’s Rajasthan was reported by multiples media outlets as supporters of the party chanting pro-Pakistan slogans.

Zee News, Zee Rajasthan, First India News and Amar Ujala ran the video while carrying the disclaimer that it could not be independently verified.

Below is the report by Zee Rajasthan News.

Fact-check
We performed a keyword search on Facebook and came across the same video but of better quality. After carefully listening to the video, it was clear that the supporters were chanting “Owaisi Saab zindabad”. This can be heard at 11 seconds in the video below.

Alt News reached out to M Salim Khan, an AIMIM worker who was present at the scene. Khan said, “Owaisi Saab left the hotel around 8:30 pm to go pray at a nearby mosque. He went with his driver in a WagonR. Between 10:00 pm and 10:15 pm, when he was leaving the mosque, people surrounded him and started chanting slogans. We reached the spot within five minutes to escort him out. The people surrounding him were mostly young and they also chanted the Taqbeer. However, no objectionable chants were made.”

We checked the Facebook page of AIMIM Rajasthan and found a second video from the incident. This video was recorded when Owaisi already sat in his car and was leaving. In this video, it can be heard that the youth surrounding him chanted, “Nara e Taqbeer, Allahu Akbar” [God is great]. This was followed by, “Dekho dekho kaun aya? Sher aya sher” [Look who’s here? The tiger].

This celebration was started to give more support and new opportunities for girls in the country. It is celebrated to expand awareness among the people about facing all disparities by the girl child in the society.

Discrimination with the girl child is a significant problem that is spread in many areas such as inequality in education, nutrition, legal rights, medical care, security, respect, child marriage, etc.

The Government of India started celebrating National Girl Child Day as the National Girl Development Mission. It helps to raise awareness among the people of the entire country about the importance of girls’ progress. It enhances the girls’ meaningful contribution to the decision-making process through the practical support of other community members and parents.

✔️Importance of National Girl Child Day 

It is celebrated among social people to improve their lives and to promote the status of girls in society. Various forms of social discrimination and exploitation must be removed entirely from the organization which girls face every day in their lives.

To enlarge focus on the need for the rights of girls in society, various political and community leaders give a speech in public about regular training and fundamental freedom. 

Girls must get a more energetic, safer, and better environment. They should be aware of each truth of life and legal rights. They must know that they have the right to exact education, nutrition, and health care.

They should be very well aware of the laws of domestic violence, including Section 2009, Prevention of Child Marriage Act 2009, Dowry Recketham Act 2006, etc. for their proper right in life and to face all challenges.

In our country, one-third of young girls are malnourished. Due to restricted access to healthcare and gender inequality in society, females of the reproductive age group are struggling with various diseases and anemia.

This has led to dramatic shifts in daily life and changed the way children and adolescents live, socialise, move around and learn.

Never before has this been so evident than at the onset of the COVID pandemic and the subsequent exponential rise in technology and internet use. Global estimates suggest that one in three internet users is a child.

Digital technology exposes children to information, social connection, education, online support groups and professional help. Yet, children engaging in the digital world are also exposed to a range of threats. These include inappropriate content (violent or sexual), undesirable contact with strangers and online bullying and victimisation.

The South African Child Gauge is an annual publication that aims to report on and monitor the situation of children in South Africa, in particular the realisation of their rights. This year, the theme of the report focuses on child and adolescent mental health.

Lately, there’s been increasing public debate and concern that digital technologies may contribute to mental health problems such as depression, self-harm and suicide among adolescents and children. To contribute to the collective understanding of the experiences and consequences of growing up in a digital world, our chapter in the Child Gauge report aims to interrogate the impact of digital worlds on children’s mental health. We also want to provide recommendations for policy and practice.

How South African children use digital technology
South Africa has approximately 38 million internet users (1.5 million households). Children most often go online on smartphones, using mobile data at home, and the level of online engagement increases as children become older. Mobile phone plans in South Africa also provide free or cheaper access to social media platforms, resulting in social media use being much more prevalent than any other online activity, driving the content that children engage with online.

The relationship between digital technology and mental health is complex.

During a recent investigation, it was found that children using metaverse are surrounded by a lot of horror and misconduct.
A 13 year- old girl in a virtual reality app was exposed to sexual content, rape threats and other profanity. VRChat is an interactive platform where people can speak to different avatars ( characters in the app).


This investigation has led to warnings from child safety charities, including the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), about children's dangers in the metaverse. The metaverse refers to a network of VR worlds that Meta (formerly Facebook) has positioned as a future version of the internet, eventually allowing us to engage across education, work and social contexts.

The question arises of how safe is children in this tech-friendly world. If this space can't safeguard children's safety in this online world, it is a fiasco.
Technology companies need to make these spaces more preventive and shielded for the children.

Many companies have claimed that these platforms also provide a section where one can report any abuse or assault that seems inappropriate to anyone.

The late eighties epic television series made him a household name and it was only then, when most of the country came to know about his sporting excellence.

Before hogging the limelight because of his presence on screen, he was a double Olympic hammer thrower, four-time Asian Games medalist, including back-to-back gold in discus throw, and a Commonwealth Games medalist in hammer throw.

He was conferred with the Arjuna award – then the highest sporting honour – in 1967, almost two decades before BR Chopra’s 94-part Mahabharat was telecasted.

Born in a Khatri family at village Sirhali, Amritsar, Praveen Kumar’s excellence in throwing events had made him a torch bearer of Indian throw events in Olympics.     

After Punjab’s Somnath Chopra, who competed in hammer throw event in 1948 London Olympics, Praveen Kumar was the second Indian thrower (in any throw event) to compete in the Olympics. He competed in hammer throw in 1968 Olympics and four-year late in discus throw in Munich.  

Praveen Kumar became the first Indian thrower to compete in two Olympics, first Indian thrower to win a medal in Commonwealth Games – silver in hammer throw in 1966.

His national record in hammer throw stood for almost two decades.

Praveen Kumar, who passed away on February 7 at the age of 75, played a pivotal role in the foundation of Indian throw events.

Now, throw events are considered as a back-bone of Indian athletics contingent in Olympics.

Javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra won gold in the Tokyo Olympics. Discus thrower Kamalpreet Kaur finished sixth.

Discus thrower Krishna Punia became the first Indian thrower to make it to the finals of the Olympics (in 2012). She finished sixth.

After his playing days were over, Stimac took to coaching but wasn’t as successful as he was as a central defender. Currently the national coach of India, the Asian Cup qualifiers to be played in Kolkata from June 8 to 14, is likely to be crucial for his continuance in the post. Pitted against weaker opponents (at least as per the FIFA rankings) like Afghanistan, Cambodia and Hong Kong, it would be a disaster if the hosts fail to make the 2023 Asian Cup. In that case, the Croatian can pack his bag immediately as his current contract till September is unlikely to be extended further.
Stimac was given a free hand to shape India’s national team in the way he wanted to. Somehow, he hasn’t produced the desired results. No one asked him to raise an unbeatable side – it’s hardly possible in the Indian football context, but under him, the team haven’t improved much. Recently, India played a friendly against Jordan in Doha. That they lost 0-2 against higher ranked Jordan wasn’t an issue. But the lacklustre attitude of the Indians on the pitch certainly pained the fans. His plan to go for a 5-3-2 formation instead of regular 4-4-2 also raised eyebrows. Stimac blamed injury to key players like Rahul Bheke, Udanta Singh and Liston Colaco as one of the reasons for below par show, but fans would find it difficult to accept it.
Is Stimac himself on the backfoot? His recent utterings give such a feeling. Few weeks ago, the Indian coach said he was confident that his team would qualify from this group. But after the Jordan match, he has changed his tone to an extent. Now he is talking about the experience of Afghanistan footballers, who play in the European lower divisions and the Brazilians players Hong Kong have in their line-up.

Increasingly, the spotlight is being shone on the mental health benefits of working out, such as boosting your mood, improving sleep and easing symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression.

Science backs this up. One study found that increasing your activity levels from doing nothing, to exercising at least three times a week, reduces the risk of depression by up to 30 per cent. Another study found that individuals who engaged in exercise had 43% lower self-reported 'poor mental health' days than those who did not.

Here are six types of workouts that could improve your mental health.

1. Running (or walking)
If you need motivation to get moving, the 'runner's high' – the clarity and expansion one feels after a jog or sprint session – should do the trick.

'Outdoor exercise or eco-therapy can be particularly beneficial and research suggests it can actually be as effective as antidepressants in treating mild to moderate depression,' says Mind Information Manager, Rachel Boyd.

Two 2007 studies commissioned by MIND revealed that 94 per cent said outdoor activities including running and walking had benefited their mental health, so for best results avoid the treadmill.

2. Boxing
The rumours that hitting a punchbag releases stress and anger is true. Finding an outlet for aggression can be both empowering and healing. Short, sharp 'rounds' of punching, followed by rest, results in an intense interval session, which releases endorphins.

If you 'spar' with another boxer you can achieve 'flow', in which you are focussed solely on the task at hand/present moment; a state that everyone from Buddhist monks to Olympic athletes champion.

3. Pilates
The mental health benefits of Pilates often get overlooked because of the traditional focus on Pilates for back health and core strength.

Sumaira Abdulali, a city-based environmentalist and founder of the Awaaz Foundation, demanded in a letter to officials on Sunday that on days when Mumbai experiences hazardous air quality, a public health advisory be issued, similar to what is done in Delhi and the surrounding national capital region when pollution levels exceed safe thresholds.


According to Abdulali, Mumbai has experienced its highest ever levels of air pollution in the last several weeks since city-wide comprehensive air monitoring began in 2015. The AQI in Mumbai exceeded 500 on January 24-25, while the first week of February saw extremely high AQI (above 300). Dust and haze were carried to northern Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan by two dust storms that originated in the Middle East, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and adjacent regions.

""However, these incidents cannot be dismissed as one-off events affecting the city's air pollution,"" Abdulali wrote to the Hindustan Times on Sunday. ""Poor air quality and its impact on health has become a significant concern for Mumbai not just during the winter months, but throughout the year,"" he wrote.

Commissioner of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and environment minister (BMC). BMC has announced the installation of 128 sensor-based systems to monitor air quality and deliver real-time data within 4 sq km each in its new budget, making Mumbai's air quality network the largest in India. ""This will make forecasting and issuing health warnings on days when the air quality is poor a lot easier,"" Abdulali added.

The National Clean Air Action Plan requires public health warnings (NCAP).

But as Ukrainian fighters capture the admiration of the world in Twitter posts and TikTok videos, even the illusion of Russian unity is beginning to crumble.

A generational struggle is breaking out across Russia. Often, it pits those who believe in the stories of state-run television against their own children, many currently living and working abroad. The latter are turning to social media to express their shock and shame at the war, and to challenge the narrative of the Putin regime.

This is a reality I am experiencing in my personal life, and not just as a scholar of Russian history and media. When my two stepdaughters, aged 28 and 29, phoned their grandmother in Moscow to ask about Russia’s invasion, the response was tears: “How could you ask such a question? Russia does not start wars. Russia does not invade other countries.”

The family’s consensus was that the young women had “totally changed” since becoming American citizens 15 years ago.

The Kremlin tightens its media grip

Inside Russia, the government has been broadcasting pro-Russian messages designed to fill viewers with either pride in their homeland or anger toward purported outside foes. Kremlin-controlled television reports – in very slick, believable stories full of interviews and on-site video – details alleged atrocities committed by neo-Nazi Ukrainians against Russian civilians. Russian correspondents in Ukraine’s Donbas region speak of “mass graves” and “genocide,” displaying what they claim are human bones.

Roskomnadzor, the state censorship agency, has forbidden all media, even independently owned newspapers and radio stations, from using the word “war” instead of “special operation.” Outlets have been ordered to stop spreading “unreliable” information and instructed to rely only on Russian government sources. On state-run television, Ukraine is referred to as a “territory,” not an independent state.

When material began circulating on Twitter that contradicted official pronouncements, the Kremlin limited citizen access.

Before the age of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, former Real Madrid great Kaka was the last player to win the prized Ballon d'Or award. As a result, his move to Real Madrid was greeted with high hopes. In the summer of 2009, the Brazilian joined Los Blancos for €65 million.

Unfortunately for the attacking midfielder, he would have a miserable time at the Santiago Bernabeu. Kaka only stayed in Madrid for four years, scoring 29 goals and providing 39 assists in 120 appearances across all competitions.
After failing to make an impression at the club, the Brazilian was signed as a free agent by AC Milan in the summer of 2013.


#2.  James Rodriguez

During the summer of 2014, James Rodriguez's transfer to Real Madrid created a lot of buzz.
At the 2014 FIFA World Cup, he was the breakthrough star. Following his €75 million move to the Santiago Bernabeu, the Colombian was supposed to shake up the football world.

In the Spanish capital, however, the assailant was unable to realise his full potential. During his six-year stint with Los Blancos, he scored 37 goals and added 41 assists in 125 games across all competitions. After failing to impress with Everton after leaving Real Madrid, the Colombian joined Al-Rayyan SC in Qatar this summer.


#1.  Luka Jovic

Luka Jovic joined Real Madrid after a productive season with Bundesliga club Eintracht Frankfurt, where he scored 27 goals and added seven assists. Transfer fees for the striker totalled €70 million for the Spanish giants. He has, however, been unable to justify his move to the Santiago Bernabeu.

In 42 games with Los Blancos, the Serb has only three goals and four assists to his name.

Birmingham: If she had not topped the wrestling trials for the Commonwealth Games, Olympic medallist Sakshi Malik could not have overcome the 'crisis of confidence' she was experiencing over the last two years.

She also strongly thought about retirement.

The demons in her mind were understandable as she was losing to her juniors in the domestic circuit and had not done much of notice since getting that historic bronze in Rio Olympics six years ago.

The 29-year-old somehow managed to beat the much younger Sonam Malik in her fifth attempt to top the 62kg trials and make the India squad for the Birmingham Games.

That was the moment when Sakshi started to get her confidence back and also paved the way for a gold medal winning performance here on Friday. Making hand written notes of her thoughts after sessions with psychologists also helped immensely.

""My confidence was down for a while. My coaches told me I was the fittest among seniors and juniors and had all the power.

""I used to wonder what was wrong with me. Whether it was bad luck. I won the trials (in May) and from then I started to feel confident about my game,"" said Sakshi after bouncing back from 0-4 to pin Canada's And Godinez Gonzalez.

She called the gold medal finish her biggest result since the Rio Games.

""I had not won gold in CWG (she had won silver and bronze earlier). I wanted to fight till the end to get that gold. Even when I was 0-4 down, it did not bother me. I had won bouts with seconds left in the Olympics, here I had three minutes left,"" she said referring to her double leg move that settled the contest.

As a scholar of Russian cyber operations, I know the Kremlin has the capacity to damage critical U.S. infrastructure systems.

Federal officials have been bracing for this. In January 2022 the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued an alert that outlined the Russian cyberattack threat, with technical details of sophisticated Russian-led hacking from recent years. That included a complicated digital break-in that targeted the U.S. energy industry and gained access to the control rooms of U.S. electric utilities. According to Homeland Security officials, the hackers “could have thrown switches” and knocked out power to the public – but did not.

In mid-February 2022, federal cybersecurity experts met with executives from big U.S. banks to discuss defenses against Russian hacking attempts.

In Ukraine, the Russian offensive began Feb. 23, 2022, with cyberattacks aimed at overloading and shutting down bank and government websites. In addition there were reports of software capable of corrupting data having been secretly installed on hundreds of computers owned by large Ukrainian organizations in the financial, defense and information technology services industries.

That malicious software spilled outside Ukraine – it was found on computers in Lithuania and Latvia – which is reminiscent of the NotPetya attack. In 2017, a piece of malware that initially seemed to be ransomware was unleashed on Ukraine and spread widely, causing more than $10 billion in collateral damage to major international companies.

Short and Martin are one of the greatest comedy duos – and they’re also great pals. The actors played friends in their 1986 film, Three Amigos, alongside Chevy Chase, and they’ve been friends in real life ever since. In addition to working on other films together, they co-headlined a comedy tour, The Funniest Show in Town at the Moment, in 2020.
They reunited on-screen again in a Hulu mystery-comedy sitcom Only Murders in the Building, in which they play neighbours, would-be detectives and bickering friends. Selena Gomez also stars in the show and its second season was released in June.

2. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire
Before they were old sports in 2013’s The Great Gatsby, DiCaprio and Maguire actually met and became friends after both auditioning for a TV show in 1990. As Maguire was slightly more established as a child star, DiCaprio was the one who made the first move.
DiCaprio and Maguire both went out for the lead role, Toby Wolff, in 1993’s This Boy’s Life, with DiCaprio getting cast. Maguire was subsequently cast as Wolff’s friend Chuck Bolger. The friends would continue to compete for roles throughout their careers.

3. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck
Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are childhood friends, famously played friends in Good Will Hunting, and continue to support each other today.
Although Affleck and Damon have been friends since childhood, their breakout roles in 1997’s Oscar-winning film Good Will Hunting solidified their friendship on screen. The pair wrote and starred in Good Will Hunting, which earned them Oscars for their screenplay. This win propelled them to A-list status, and began a long working relationship that’s endured to today. They have continuously supported, defended and commended each other.

According to ESPN's Brian Windhorst, the hamstring strain Booker suffered in Game 2 against the New Orleans Pelicans is a Grade 1 strain, and will keep him off the court for 2-3 weeks.

Booker sustained the strain in the third quarter of Tuesday's 125-114 loss to the Pelicans. With about five minutes left, he immediately left the game after jumping to block a dunk.

On Wednesday, it was reported that Booker would miss Games 3 and 4 against the Pelicans and had no timetable for his return. Having a timetable is certainly better than not having one, but 2-3 weeks is far from ideal for the Suns. The series against the Pelicans will go at least three more games and possibly more, and if they win that without him, they Booker-less Suns will have to face either the Dallas Mavericks or the New Orleans Jazz in the next round. The Mavs-Jazz series, just like the Suns-Pels series, is currently tied 1-1.

The Suns had a 64-18 record in the regular season, the best in the NBA. Booker, the team's homegrown star, averaged a career-high 26.8 points in 68 games during the regular season, plus 5.0 rebounds and 4.8 assists per game. The Suns have been the clear favorite with bettors to win their first-ever NBA championship, but Booker's prolonged absence might change that a bit.

Hamstring issues have been a recurring theme over the last year or so of Booker's career.

The Brazilian scored two goals in as many minutes, the second coming after Jamie Vardy inadvertently flicked a corner to the back post, to mark his first Premier League impression as a Gunner. The Brazilian was bemused by the heat in north London, which reached 33 degrees, and bent in a fantastic opening goal with the help of a lucky deflection on 23.

Jesus said, ""I am really glad since we played so well against a strong opponent."" To score goals, I put in all day every day. I wasn't dissatisfied with Manchester City; all I wanted was to play, and the team accommodated that.

On the other hand, Vardy received a penalty ruling that was later correctly overturned by VAR. Just before halftime, Mike Dean urged referee Darren England to reconsider the little contact involving Ramsdale and the attacker.

After the half, the action and goals kept coming, with Leicester twice taking control of the game and Arsenal responding twice as quickly. First, an own goal by the ordinarily excellent William Saliba in the 53rd minute was canceled out by a similarly terrible error from Leicester goalkeeper Danny Ward two minutes later, which allowed Jesus to set up Granit Xhaka for a sweeping goal.

The doctors at the clinic rushed her to Kaade Hospital and according to the statement given to the police, efforts of reviving her was done for 45 minutes. But to no help death embedded her.  

The actress underwent liposuction, which is a cosmetic surgery that takes away excess body fat. 

Liposuction is a surgical procedure that targets to remove fats from certain parts of the body like from abdomen, hips, thighs etc. The surgery might take away fats but it comes with various risks. Complications like filling up of fluid under the skin, fat embolism, kidney and heart problems and other infections. 

The fats that are removed through the surgery are the ones that doesn't get reduced through workouts and diet. 

This surgery is not a weight loss surgery. It only gives short term benefits and the fats are more likely to return to the treated areas within few months. 

The procedure seems to be safe to some extent, but a survey done in the US in 2000 pointed on many death incidents among those who underwent liposuction. The results of the survey was that the fatality rates among road accidents was less when compared with liposuction. 

A study from Brazil found that pulmonary thromboembolism that's a blockage of the arteries in the lungs and this was a common cause of death post surgery.

transfer window. Udinese, where the central defender spent last season on loan, wants to bring
him back, but they can't afford him, as you can see below.

AC Milan, on the other hand, is rumoured to be interested in signing the 28-year-old, who will
turn 29 on August 31. They are thought to be looking for a player who has already acclimated to
Serie A, and they have seen Mari as a player who has done so.

Udinese are in talks with Arsenal about repurchasing Pablo Mari, although they are apparently
unable to pay the price that Arsenal paid for him. According to Gazzettino (via TMW), Udinese
are hard at work trying to reach an agreement with Arsenal to sign Pablo Mari.

Udinese are focused on obtaining another loan for the defender, since a permanent acquisition
for a similar sum to what Arsenal paid to bring Mari in would be too much, according to the
source. According to previous rumours, Udinese was willing to pay as little as €4 million to make
the move permanent.

That kind of money wouldn't be enough to persuade Arsenal to sell, but talks are ongoing, and it
is probable that the two clubs will come to an agreement - potentially on a loan basis.

Mari had
fallen out of favour at Arsenal before to his loan, so any money brought in for him would be a
good thing. Going as low as €4 million, though, appears to be a stretch.

The centre-back finished his loan on a strong note, earning a spot in the WhoScored Serie A

Abstract 

Diabetes is a very important comorbidity in patients with heart failure. When both diseases coexist cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is greatly increased. Therefore, it is of clinical importance to treat both diseases as early as possible with an optimal therapy. 

Hitherto, heart failure therapy did not differ if a patient had concomitant diabetes. However, with SGLT-2 inhibitors having demonstrated to reduce hospitalization of heart failure independent of diabetes state and expected to be included into the ESC heart failure treatment guidelines in 2021 coexisting diabetes potentially will make a difference when to start therapy. 

In this article we provide an overview of current recommendations and also provide clinical considerations for the therapy of heart failure with concomitant diabetes.

In the 87th minute, Salah had a moment to reduce the deficit when he shot a beautiful curler that seem to hit the post but a sliding challenge at Nunez forces him to fire over the close range. The score remains at 4-0.

Last week, the government released guidelines around misleading ads. In those, it specified that surrogate advertising is banned, but brands prohibited by law to advertise directly can continue advertising brand extensions by matching the criteria for legitimate brand extensions.

They also lay down the guidelines around brand endorsement, conditions for bait advertising and free claims, advertising targeted at children and more.  

Since then, there have been many critics and appreciations hovering general conversations in the advertising and marketing fraternity. Some have praised the government for taking real action on the ground around misleading ads and surrogate advertising, while others have raised doubts around there being no clarity around brand extensions, what constitutes junk food, and the need for more guidelines around other issues related to advertising. 

Therefore, BestMediaInfo.com caught up with Nidhi Khare, Chief Commissioner, CCPA (Central Consumer Protection Authority), to get more clarity on the new ad guidelines. 

In the interview, she said that surrogate advertising was already banned, and the new guidelines are just a reiteration of the existing provisions of surrogate advertising. No new addition has been made there. 

Nidhi said that these guidelines cover all mediums of communication and CCPA will take action against alcohol brands advertising directly on the digital medium. She also spoke about influencers coming under the government radar, advertising targeted towards children and gender portrayal in ads. 

Excerpts: 

Surrogate advertising is banned for a long time now. There are already government guidelines in place for bait advertising, endorsement and advertising to children as mentioned in the Consumer Protection Act. What is the thought behind re-iterating these guidelines again?

We’ve been taking action against misleading ads as the Central Consumer Protection Authority since the time it had been set up in July 2020. As such, there was no need for the guidelines. Anyways, we were taking action against misleading advertising. We have penalised some of the very important brands, including Sensodyne and Naaptol. We have also issued orders against more than 40 very big names like Asian paints, Burger paints, Siyaram Fabric, Zodiac shirts, Kent RO and others.

Un simpatico siparietto che anticipa il tenore ironico e dissacrante della sfilata.
Il designer statunitense ha rivisitato la moda maschile trasformando la sua ossessione per le divise in un gioco creativo e sartoriale che con questa sfilata porta ad un livello successivo. Protagonisti della sfilata sono i sospensori, i cosiddetti jockstrap, che si intravedono dai pantaloni sartoriali a vita bassa e dalle gonne in tweed.
Questo accessorio, usato sia tra i giocatori di football americano che per il cruising omosessuale, viene elevato grazie all’abbinamento con un tessuto bon ton come il tweed. L’ultimo look, un cowboy queer in total denim con un jockstrap/strap on ricoperto di brillantini, fa il suo ingresso sulle note di Don’t Tell Me di Madonna ed è impossibile non sorridere compiaciuti davanti al grande talento e l’intelligente ironia del creativo statunitense.

This lighthearted Latin curse speaks a truth many readers and writers have felt: to have our thoughts articulated by someone else.

Coenraad de Buys is unruffled by such a possibility. He is the antihero of Willem Anker’s award winning 2014 Afrikaans novel, Buys. Vagabond philosopher that he is, Buys reflects on the nature of memories. Their substance is flaky; their origin sometimes obscure. You might glimpse them in a glass darkly or even find them outside your own mind – in the books you read. When this happens to Buys, he feels

as if the stories of others capture something of my own life … the outlines of a conversation, a fly on the edge of my hat, but not the words.

This musing occurs during one of the novel’s rare moments of uneventfulness. Nothing happens; no one comes or goes. Maybe that’s why the text opens onto four pages of near-undiluted dialogue from celebrated Irish author Samuel Beckett’s 1952 play Waiting for Godot. Of course, it’s one thing for a character to be cavalier about the words of others, and quite another for an author.

A book cover with a graphic of a pack of wild dogs, spatters of blood and large black letters reading 'Buys'

According to my analysis, at least 78 lines from Beckett’s play are reproduced in Buys without significant alteration – a fact which, if noticed, has not been noted to my knowledge.

The Afrikaans text carries no acknowledgement of Waiting for Godot, nor does it acknowledge Beckett’s influence. The English translation, Red Dog (2019), also doesn’t credit the play, though Beckett is mentioned with US writer Cormac McCarthy as an author whose “remains” might be recognised.

The McCarthy affair
Not long after the English text appeared, a reviewer for the Times Literary Supplement and The Guardian noted close correspondences with McCarthy’s epic novel Blood Meridian.

Sleep apnea is a newly recognised entity, which if diagnosed earlier then it can be easily treated. Because it has far reaching consequences like high blood pressures, cardiac arrests and even strokes.
We have to remember that not all snorers have sleep apnea. To diagnose we have to do a sleep study called polysomnography. Biological parameters, like heart rate, blood pressure, oxygenation, breathing patterns and even the brainwaves are measured while a person sleeps. This demonstrates that how many times the breathing has  stopped and its effects and based on that we measure a parameter called apnea hypopnea index and that beyond a certain level that we label it as a mild/ moderate or severe.
The treatment is simple use of a device called CPAP or BiPAP. It basically pushes
air into the nose or mouth on the patient with force so that the obstruction caused by the soft palate is avoided and keeps a patient breathing. The oxygenation improves and so does the high blood pressure. The heart arrhythmias also decrease and a patient has sound sleep, wakes up fresh. 
Majority of patients improve with the machine in case BP doesn't get controlled,  the patient can be supplemented with medications.

Are there any lifestyle advice?
 The first thing we advise the patient is to reduce weight by a good diet and exercise. So the fat reduces in the nasopharynx and chances of blockages are further reduced. 
So it's not rocket science; these simple interventions can really make a difference.",2020-11-17 22:21:28,2020-11-17,"Health, sleep apnea",en,en,en,en,So what is the treatment Sleep apnea is a newly recognised entity which if diagnosed earlier then it can be easily treated Because it has far reaching consequences like high blood pressures cardiac arrests and even strokes We have to remember that not all snorers have sleep apnea To diagnose we have to do a sleep study called polysomnography Biological parameters like heart rate blood pressure oxygenation breathing patterns and even the brainwaves are measured while a person sleeps This demonstrates that how many times the breathing has stopped and its effects and based on that we measure a parameter called apnea hypopnea index and that beyond a certain level that we label it as a mild moderate or severe The treatment is simple use of a device called CPAP or BiPAP It basically pushes air into the nose or mouth on the patient with force so that the obstruction caused by the soft palate is avoided and keeps a patient breathing The oxygenation improves and so does the high blood pressure The heart arrhythmias also decrease and a patient has sound sleep wakes up fresh Majority of patients improve with the machine in case BP doesn t get controlled the patient can be supplemented with medications Are there any lifestyle advice The first thing we advise the patient is to reduce weight by a good diet and exercise So the fat reduces in the nasopharynx and chances of blockages are further reduced So it s not rocket science these simple interventions can really make a difference ,Simple devise called CPAP helps in Obstructive Sleep Apnea- Dr Nishith Chandra (part 2),0.0005007047,1.2165624e-06,2.3149341e-05,8.57047e-05,0.00011851033,2.3326718e-05,1.2195339e-05,,,,,0

Snoring is a common symptom but not all snorers have it. Dr Nishith Chandra, Director interventional Cardiology at Fortis Escorts Heart Institute clears doubts .

What is obstructive Sleep Apnea?
It is Under-diagnosed problem. May also lead to Sudden Cardiac Arrest, if not recognised/treated in time. 
Apnea means cessation/stopping of breathing-happens when the soft palate blocks the upper airway during sleep. Obstruction in breathing causes snoring. During snoring your chest muscles have to work very hard to keep the air flowing.
The person gets tired, breath becomes very shallow and transiently for some seconds/ may even stop breathing. The person wakes up gasping for breath-the cycle continues all night even 30/40 times an hour. All this happens without the person knowing and is noticed by the partner. So the oxygen saturation (measured by the pulse oximetry) also drops.

What all are the symptoms ?
When Oxygen does not reach body, the patient wakes up tired. 
Daytime sleepiness due to lack of a restful sleep- a patient can sleep even while sitting in chair or while driving which can be dangerous. 
Sleep Apnea is more common in obese patients not that it is unheard others. Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when the muscles in the back of your throat relax too much to allow normal breathing-they are roof of your mouth (soft palate), the triangular piece of tissue hanging from the soft palate (uvula), the tonsils and the tongue.
When the muscles relax, airway narrows or closes as you breathe in, hampering your breathing for 10 seconds or longer. There is a little extra block in obese patient. As the soft palate is very thick with fat, whenever a person lies in supine position with weight it can fall back and cause the blockage.
OSA is also a common cause of uncontrolled high blood pressure, as there is not enough oxygen in the blood the heart has to pump hard. Also irregular heart rhythms which can cause sudden cardiac death.",2020-11-17 22:21:28,2020-11-17,"Health, sleep apnea, causes/symptoms/ treatment",en,en,en,en,A famous Indian musician Bappi Lahiri died reportedly due to sleep apnea a breathing disorder during sleep which can lead to sudden cardiac death Snoring is a common symptom but not all snorers have it Dr Nishith Chandra Director interventional Cardiology at Fortis Escorts Heart Institute clears doubts What is obstructive Sleep Apnea It is Under diagnosed problem May also lead to Sudden Cardiac Arrest if not recognised treated in time Apnea means cessation stopping of breathing happens when the soft palate blocks the upper airway during sleep Obstruction in breathing causes snoring During snoring your chest muscles have to work very hard to keep the air flowing The person gets tired breath becomes very shallow and transiently for some seconds may even stop breathing The person wakes up gasping for breath the cycle continues all night even times an hour All this happens without the person knowing and is noticed by the partner So the oxygen saturation measured by the pulse oximetry also drops What all are the symptoms When Oxygen does not reach body the patient wakes up tired Daytime sleepiness due to lack of a restful sleep a patient can sleep even while sitting in chair or while driving which can be dangerous Sleep Apnea is more common in obese patients not that it is unheard others Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when the muscles in the back of your throat relax too much to allow normal breathing they are roof of your mouth soft palate the triangular piece of tissue hanging from the soft palate uvula the tonsils and the tongue When the muscles relax airway narrows or closes as you breathe in hampering your breathing for seconds or longer There is a little extra block in obese patient As the soft palate is very thick with fat whenever a person lies in supine position with weight it can fall back and cause the blockage OSA is also a common cause of uncontrolled high blood pressure as there is not enough oxygen in the blood the heart has to pump hard Also irregular heart rhythms which can cause sudden cardiac death ,Bappi Lahiri died due to Sleep Apnea-but not all snorers have OSA-Dr Nishith Chandra,0.0003839488,1.1869242e-06,2.8931516e-05,6.813573e-05,0.00011792392,1.336823e-05,1.1400502e-05,,,,,0

Understanding Gender & Talking About Trans Bodies by Shaikh (edited in the speaker’s words):

Try and understand what terms are used around us, whether these terms should be used, should not be used, or are derogatory.

Let me start with this: Last Saturday, we were at a workshop where a journalist friend told me that he's making a documentary on trans persons, and one of the characters in the documentary is a 'Shemale'. And I asked, 'What do you mean by Shemale?' 

He said that that person describes themselves as a 'Shemale'. I told him that it’s considered to be a derogatory term, and shouldn’t be used. His justification was that since she called herself a 'Shemale' he will use it in the documentary.

What do you think? Should we write the words in quotes? I'm not giving you an answer, but think and reflect on it: Who decides what the right word is for a community?

For example, the word 'Harijan' — who coined this word? Mahatma Gandhi. Is Mahatma Gandhi from the Dalit community? He's not.

I move on to the term 'divyang' — another very famous person: Narendra Modi. Does Narendra Modi have a disability?

Una pole position, la settima in stagione, la sedicesima in carriera, costruita con le performance di una Ferrari in palla, ma anche con la strategia e l'aiuto di Carlos Sainz in Q3: lo spagnolo, costretto a partire dal fondo (sarà 19esimo) per effetto della penalità per sostituzione della power unit, ha infatti aiutato il compagno di

They've been celebrated for centuries. Among other popular Easter traditions like hot cross buns and exciting egg hunts, the Easter Bunny has long been a well-known and popular symbol associated with the religious holiday.

Because they persuaded many pagans to convert, many of the rituals associated with Eostre's celebration were converted into ceremonies commemorating Christ's Resurrection when Christianity spread to Anglo-Saxons. As a result, Eostre is the source of the English term Easter.

The egg, an ancient symbol of new life, has long been associated with springtime pagan festivals. Easter egg decorating has been a ritual since at least the 13th century. They are thought to depict Jesus' resurrection and emergence from the tomb from a Christian perspective. And to leave these eggs, a mythical bunny comes. Gifting bunnies is symbolic to that.

Easter bunnies bring happiness to children and most people don't hurt them. I don't understand this everyday complaining and nitpicking from people about every little thing. I mean, why can't people have one day where they aren't moral policed for celebrating something that's important to them?

And to me, there is no fiercer competition than when there’s three or four people going for a rebound and you come down with it. That’s awfully satisfying to me.”

Harry Gallatin entered the Knicks in 1948, when they were still a member of the Basketball Association of America, and spent nine years with the team, making seven All-Star Game appearances before joining the Pistons in 1957-58. Gallatin, dubbed ""The Horse,"" averaged a double-double in his final eight years in the NBA. In the Cubs and Reds organisations, he also played minor league baseball.

He fought (and won) battles under the boards with George Mikan and Dolph Schayes on a regular basis. Gallatin was a key member of three consecutive Knicks Finals teams from 1951 to 1953, losing twice to Mikan's Minneapolis Lakers and once to the Rochester Royals. In 1953-54, he had nearly a full board more rebounds per game than runner-up Mikan.

Surprisingly, Gallatin's follow-up season in 1954-55 was the only time another Knick finished second in the rebounding category, trailing Philadelphia's Neil Johnston. Willis Reed and Patrick Ewing never made the top three, while David Lee was third in 2009 (11.7), a tenth of a rebound behind Troy Murphy (and 2.1 behind Dwight Howard).

Gallatin was named into the Naismith Hall of Fame in 1991, and long-time Knicks supporters have argued that his No. 11 jersey should be displayed in the rafters alongside the rest of the franchise's luminaries. Gallatin set a single-game Knicks record with 33 rebounds against the Fort Wayne Pistons on March 15, 1953. (later matched by Willis Reed).

Ancient Remains at Jaimanglagarh : 'Bajralepit' & 'Mahavesh' stupas at Jaimanglagarh,"Thus, after visiting the temple, I visited the Harsain Stupa complex consisting of four stupas with the largest being in the centre and other equidistant smaller ones in three directions, one each in the west, north and south. Only one smaller southern stupa seemed to be intact due to thick vegetation cover and the main stupa was seen to have been almost cut to half by locals probably looking for constructional landfilling. It could be seen from the remains that the completely clay built stupa used to have a hard outer surface strengthened by brick-dust (surkhi), extensive remains of which were found scattered around as we climbed upwards. I learnt that such ‘Bajralepit’ stupas are referred in the ‘Mahavansh’, and are believed to date back to the times of the Buddha. 

The construction of such mud stupas was in vogue only in the earlier phases of Buddhism as architecture became more advanced in the 
times ahead. Thus, the existence of such a remarkable stupa at the site is significant for the history of the region and needs to be understood or analysed in the context of Buddha’s visit to Anguttarap, as referred in the “Majjhim Nikaya”. 

After a visit to the temple and the stupa, I visited the District Museum and examined the excavated remains on display including coins, terracotta balls in large numbers, probably to be used for ancient defences and various statues including one of the Navgrahas from the Pala period, similar to the one available in the Indian Museum at Kolkata, indicating a high level of artisanship prevailing in the region. Subsequent to this visit, I made further revisits to the site in December, 2017 and January, 2018, when I could also find some more time to explore the lake in a boat and click photographs of the beautiful avian visitors from far off lands.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture banned imports of the fleshy fruit from Mexico on Feb. 11, 2022, after an employee of its Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, who was working in Mexico, received threats after refusing to certify a mislabeled shipment of avocados.

With only a two- to three-week supply stored in American warehouses, any extended disruption to the avocado pipeline would have been quickly felt.

Eight days later, the ban was lifted, and cooks could resume smashing avocados into guacamole, blending them into smoothies and smearing them onto bread without trepidation.

Yet to me, this disruption – however brief – reveals just how reliant the U.S. has become on its neighbor for a product that has seen its demand soar. When I was working on my book “Avocado: A Global History,” I was struck by the extent to which this lucrative trade has evolved over the past 25 years, making it an attractive business possibility for both legitimate and criminal enterprises.

Mexico’s cash crop

Avocados from Mexico have been fueling America’s taste for the fruit since 1997, when the U.S. Department of Agriculture lifted a 1914 import ban, which originally was implemented due to fears over pests like seed weevils infesting U.S. crops. At the time, Southern California produced about 90% of the avocados eaten by Americans.

Since then, per capita avocado consumption in the U.S. has ballooned from 2 pounds in 2001 to nearly 8 pounds in 2018.

This increase in the popularity of avocados, coupled with the limitations of domestic sources, has allowed Mexican avocados to dominate the American market. Today, Mexico – specifically, the Mexican state of Michoacán, which is the only state certified to sell the fruit to the U.S. – supplies about 80% of the 60 million pounds of avocados eaten north of the border each week.

High-achieving students from low-income backgrounds are half as likely to be placed in a gifted program as their more affluent peers, according to our new study.

Arkansas, like all the other states, has a unique process for identifying gifted kids. We wondered whether academically advanced students – the top 5% of scorers in math and literacy, who are ready for greater academic challenges – would be placed as gifted irrespective of their socioeconomic background. We examined test scores of third grade students from 2014 to 2019.

We found that of the 4,330 students who made up the top 5%, 1,310 – about 30% – were left out of gifted programming. This rate of identification was about equal across various racial backgrounds, but economic differences mattered. Among low-income students, about 37% were missed, a greater proportion than the overall number.

Once we statistically controlled for variation in district enrollment, location, region and differences in gifted selection or school policies, being from a low-income family was associated with a 50% lower likelihood of being identified as gifted relative to similar peers from higher-income backgrounds.

Why it matters
States have different gifted identification policies. In Arkansas, students are first nominated by parents, school personnel or community members. Next they are evaluated on multiple measures, including a creativity test. Finally, a team of educators uses all the information to make the placement decision.

Nationally, students from disadvantaged communities, such as low-income communities and communities of color, are underrepresented and are less likely to be nominated for gifted programs than other students.

Other research has found that when nomination is a first step, some gifted students are missed, particularly those from low-income backgrounds.

But screening all students significantly improves the chances that a disadvantaged student who is gifted will be identified for gifted programs.

It's very interesting to reflect on the story behind the TransCare project, and how such a diverse set of people came together to work on a common goal. 

It was September 2020 and we were passing through the first wave of COVID-19 in India. During that time, I had a COVID infection and I got admitted in my own hospital where I work as the Associate Professor of Community Medicine and I was also the Nodal Officer for COVID. 

I was admitted for 10 days – remember that I’ve been in this hospital or college for the last nine years now. This is the institute where I transitioned. A lot of doctors who are residents in that hospital were my students. So they are aware about my process of transition. Most of them know me quite well.

In spite of that, when I was admitted as a COVID patient, I was on the patient's side, and my transness was completely ignored, it was invisibilized. 

When the medical history or surgical history or past history or any significant history was taken, I was never asked about my experiences as a trans person in those moments. My gender was not asked to me -- it was assumed, 'Okay you look like a woman so it's a woman.' 

No one asked me in which ward I will be admitted -- of course, there are no gender-neutral wards in my hospital, as is the case with most of the hospitals.

Sadly, since all this information – which is important for providing care to a trans person – was not documented, there was an error in the diagnosis process for detecting pneumonia because the breast implants I have were thought to be some shadows in the lung.

The 26-year-old forward has been erratic in form since his arrival at Old Trafford 7 years ago as flashes of brilliance from the French international has been too few and far between over the years. This culminated during his disastrous campaign last season as he battled for fitness due to injury and struggled for game time in both Manchester United and his loaned club Sevilla. 

The striker only managed to rack up a combined 2 goals in the just concluded season having spent the second half of the season on loan at Sevilla. Recovering from injury, Martial has however expressed his wish to be handed a chance to prove himself at Manchester United next season. 

Martial has been heavily linked with a move away from the Red Devils following his poor stint at the club but reports from The Athletic has now suggested that United boss Erik Ten Hag intends to look closely to Martial in preseason. 

This implies a possibility of the striker being retained at the club against the upcoming campaign should he put up an eye-catching performance at the preseason.

He had a breakthrough season in 2021/22 for Real Madrid and it was his goal in the UEFA Champions League final against Real Madrid that won the Los Blancos their 14th title.

Vini scored 22 goals and provided 16 assists across all tournaments last season which speaks heaps and bounds about the massive improvement he has seen in his performances lately. It would be safe to say that he was one of the keymost players in Real Madrid illustrious 2021/22 season.

However, one of the prime concerns of Real Madrid fans regarding their much loved youngster is that his contract terminates in 2024 and given that rich suitors like PSG are on the lookout for him is kind of unnerving for them, especially after the whole Kylian Mbappe saga. Luckily, Vinicius Jr is a loyal fan of the La Casa Blanca and thus he was quick to refuse an outrageous €40 Million salary offer by PSG last summer. He has made it very clear that he will definitely be staying at the Real Madrid.

Talking about the renewal of Vinicius Jr, Fabrizio Romano said on his Podcast ‘Here We Go’ - “New contracts as we know, Vinicius Jr, we said long time ago - New contract till 2027 for Vinicius Jr to be signed by Real Madrid in the coming days. The Brazilian boys of Madrid will stay for long time because Rodrygo and Eder Militao will sign till 2028. Let me mention that all these players will have a release clause for €1 BIllion.”

The ambience will be more nightmarish when a child witnesses his parents fighting and quibbling on just mere issues.
I think seeing them unhappy together will be more traumatising for a child.
As every child has this ideal image of their parents, which they never want to get tainted. Although divorce will undoubtedly do harm, staying in an unhappy marriage will be more vicious.
Being surrounded by constant abuse will deteriorate their mental health, whereas a divorce is inevitable. However, parents still decide to work together for the children's sake in parenting; then, it becomes far easier.

What we do know is that some foods do contribute to healthy hormone levels and there is absolutely no reason you shouldn’t include some in your diet.

Foods that increase estrogen : 

Estrogen is essential for maintaining good health and plays a significant role in a woman’s body. Although research is ongoing on the effects of dietary estrogen, preliminary studies have indicated they can mimic or enhance estrogen’s natural effect, making foods that naturally increase estrogen a viable strategy for managing your hormone levels.

Some foods contain phytoestrogens – naturally occurring nutrients derived from plants that are similar to estrogen. While the jury is still out, the majority of research has linked phytoestrogens to a variety of health benefits. Foods that increase estrogen levels in females may help offset health problems associated with low hormone levels.

The best dietary sources of estrogen (known as phytoestrogens) can be found in the following foods:

Soy:
Although some debate remains, soybean products contain plant estrogens known as isoflavones. 

Nuts:
Already packed with fiber and protein, nuts also contain phytoestrogens. Peanuts, pistachios, and walnuts pack the biggest punch, but other nuts, like almonds, can help boost your dietary estrogen as well.

Flaxseed:
Containing lignans, a type of dietary estrogen, flaxseeds are an excellent addition to an estrogen boosting diet.

Red wine:
Rich in resveratrol, another type of dietary estrogen, red wine in limited consumption can be helpful in maintaining your hormonal balance and adding a boost of estrogen to your diet.

Berries:
Loaded with vitamins and minerals, berries also have beneficial phytoestrogens to add to their list of impressive benefits. 

Dried fruits:
Typically containing more phytoestrogen than their fresh varieties, dried fruits can be an easy and convenient way to add estrogen rich food to your diet.  

Garlic:
Loaded with health benefits, garlic is rich in phytoestrogens and may influence blood estrogen levels.",2022-03-24 22:47:01,2022-03-24,"Health, healthcare, estrogen, hormones, healthy food",en,en,en,en,Can foods really help to increase estrogen What we do know is that some foods do contribute to healthy hormone levels and there is absolutely no reason you shouldn t include some in your diet Foods that increase estrogen Estrogen is essential for maintaining good health and plays a significant role in a woman s body Although research is ongoing on the effects of dietary estrogen preliminary studies have indicated they can mimic or enhance estrogen s natural effect making foods that naturally increase estrogen a viable strategy for managing your hormone levels Some foods contain phytoestrogens naturally occurring nutrients derived from plants that are similar to estrogen While the jury is still out the majority of research has linked phytoestrogens to a variety of health benefits Foods that increase estrogen levels in females may help offset health problems associated with low hormone levels The best dietary sources of estrogen known as phytoestrogens can be found in the following foods Soy Although some debate remains soybean products contain plant estrogens known as isoflavones Nuts Already packed with fiber and protein nuts also contain phytoestrogens Peanuts pistachios and walnuts pack the biggest punch but other nuts like almonds can help boost your dietary estrogen as well Flaxseed Containing lignans a type of dietary estrogen flaxseeds are an excellent addition to an estrogen boosting diet Red wine Rich in resveratrol another type of dietary estrogen red wine in limited consumption can be helpful in maintaining your hormonal balance and adding a boost of estrogen to your diet Berries Loaded with vitamins and minerals berries also have beneficial phytoestrogens to add to their list of impressive benefits Dried fruits Typically containing more phytoestrogen than their fresh varieties dried fruits can be an easy and convenient way to add estrogen rich food to your diet Garlic Loaded with health benefits garlic is rich in phytoestrogens and may influence blood estrogen levels ,Foods which increase estrogen level,0.0006976171,4.1551334e-06,5.0438914e-05,0.0002862694,0.00024329548,2.671784e-05,6.304881e-05,,,,,50

Alphabet-owned Google dedicated today's doodle artwork on its google search engine to the annual Earth Day which shows the devastating effect of climate change, one of the most important topics of our time.

Google doodle is known to celebrate the most significant days, events, people, etc. from across the world with creative images or animated artworks. This time also on the occasion of World Earth Day 2022 Google has brilliantly shown the year-on-year impact of climate change on our planet using real-time images from its Google Earth platform.

Through its creative doodles, Google aims at spreading awareness about Earth Day 2022, so that we not only start thinking but also take some steps as individuals, society and nations to save our planet. For there is only one habitable planet i.e. our planet earth where we live.

The imagery used in Google doodle today will show you a time-lapse bringing attention to climate change showing imagery of several parts of the planet, including coral reefs, glaciers, and general greenery, which have changed from what it used to be say ten or twenty years ago.

The first Doodle includes real imagery of a glacier retreat at the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. The image used in the time-lapse has been taken each December from 1986 to 2020.

Another imagery shows a glacier retreat in Sermersooq, Greenland using the images taken every year from December 2000 to 2020.

The third image shows the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, showing the coral bleaching on Lizard Island in pictures taken every month from March to May 2016.

Recently in a study published in Nature Neuroscience, the scientists stated about a new screening platform for characterising genes that regulates specific microbial functions that could contribute tl Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 
By characterizing the regulatory genes that causes mito move from a healthy state tl a diseased state, like how in the brains of an individual with AD and other neurodegenerative conditions, this could help therapeutics to target the genes or proteins encoded by these genes. 
The role of microglia 
AD is a con ern and it is a form of dementia that accounts for 60 to 80% of all dementia cases. Even after there have been advance in medical sciences, there is still no proper and effective treatments for this neurodegenerative disease. 
One of the hallmarks of AD is that the accumulation of the misfolded beta-amyloid protein clumps or plaques are the ones. There have been a wide range of atudy conducted focusing on the mutations that could lead to abnormal processing of the beta-amyloid protein and its accumulation. 
But these treatments targeting pathways involved in the processing of beta-amyloid did not succeed. 
The researchers have also discovered that those  individuals with AD do not show mutations in the genes that's associated with accumulation of the amyloid protein. In contrast the evidence received recently have suggested that individuals with AD often shows defects in the clearance or removal of misfolded beta-amyloid. 
This could be due to the dysfunction of microglia, which are primary cells in the brain  the functions of microglia is phagocytosis, it is a process involving ingestion of fear cells, pathogens and misfolded proteins to facilitate their removal. 
There have been many evidences that shows the ability kf microgila to remove the beta-amyloid protein that could be impaired in AD. Microglia also contributes to the development of AD by secreting inflammatory proteins and causing excessive removal of neurons and synapses, tha association between neurons allows them to ""communicate"".

Barbara has been running and scoring for Juventus since the inaugural season, collecting goals, assists and trophies along the way - eight so far. With two more up for grabs, there is this season’s finale still to be lived to the full. 

Other than the scudetto, which would make it five league titles in a row, there is also the Italian Cup final, reached after last weekend’s semi-final success, when Barbara was on target with a goal worthy of the occasion.

I am a huge potterhead myself. 
There's a reason why it's called one of the best selling books ever. Having sold more than 500 million copies worldwide, J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter has gone down in history as the best-selling book series ever. Most people in my generation have at least heard of the name ‘Harry Potter’. But for those who grew up with ‘Harry Potter,’ it was a different experience altogether. Even if you do not enjoy the fantasy genre, there will be something in there that you can relate to. Also, since the Harry Potter series is a children’s book it’s pretty easy to read. The writing is clear, simple and entertaining and is rich with word choice that will improve your vocabulary. The fact that books also appeal to both genders and all age groups is just a bonus.
The Harry Potter book series is a living example that screams “Do not judge a book by its cover”. What some may see as just another silly children’s storybook filled with magic, witchcraft and wizardry (which is not wrong) are in for a ride.

Chelsea's greatest ever defender, he worked well with John Terry to build a strong defense for the club. He was at Chelsea for 7 years and teamed well with John Terry. An undisputed Chelsea king who left a legacy.
He won every domestic championship with the Blues and led the club to the Champions League final. When Terry left, he became captain and inspired the club to many memorable games before leaving for Crystal Palace. He made 290 appearances for Chelsea.
7 Thiago Silva
Many questioned Silva's age when he joined on a free transfer at the age of 35, but he had a significant impact on the Premier League and provided stability at the back under Tuchel. He did something that impressed fans in every game, and he was compared to John Terry.
His performance demonstrated that a young defender has been at the heart of Chelsea's defense and Silva made it look easy; despite being 37 years old, he is still the club's most important defender. Although the Brazilian CB has only made 89 appearances, his outstanding performance in the Club FIFA World Cup earned him the Golden Ball award as the tournament's best player.

Rudiger, who was brought in for an initial fee of £29 million during Conte's tenure, had a difficult start to his Premier League career and appeared to be a liability for the club as he failed to perform well and was benched for the majority of his playing time. His move to another club appeared to be imminent, but the arrival of Tuchel reinvigorated his career, he transformed into an aggressive defender and became a pivotal player.

These were for issues such like self harm and eating disorders which was reported between April and October 2021. 

There is an increase of 77% than from the data's collected during 2019 during the same span of time. 

Head teachers and a children's charity say they are seeing a rise in other less severe issues, too. 

The government plans to have 400 mental health teams to support schools by 2023. 

The referrals data, analysed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, includes the most serious and urgent cases where the child faces an immediate risk from an eating disorder, self-harm or suicidal thoughts. 

There were 349,449 under-18s in touch with NHS child and adolescent psychiatric teams at the end of October 2021, which is the highest number on record. 

Only the young children and teenagers with the most serious mental health problems are referred for specialist care. 

But schools are reporting a surge in mental health problems below this high threshold, with pupils needing extra support such as counselling. 

The children's mental health charity, Place2Be, and the union, National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), sent a survey to schools and more than 1,000 teaching and support staff responded. 

Almost all described seeing an increase in emotional and mental health issues among pupils since the pandemic, including anxiety and low self-esteem. 

Schools were closed for months and exams cancelled for two years, as everyone had to stay at home during various lockdowns to control the spread of Covid.

Two mystery women are being sought after they drove 53-year-old Maxine Messam to Jacobi Medical Center in her own BMW SUV and then walked off, leaving the vehicle behind early Tuesday.

“We don’t know what happened,” the victim’s shocked husband Carlos Simpson told the Daily News, speaking outside the family’s home in Bridgeport, Conn. “She was at work and she left work. So we don’t know what happened from there.”

Police got involved when the hospital called 911 at 1:51 a.m., shortly after the woman died.

Messam, who was naked from the waist down when she was left at the hospital, had needle marks on her body and doctors found a foreign substance had been injected into her buttocks.

The two women who dropped her off cast themselves as Good Samaritans to hospital staff before taking off, claiming they found her in distress at Woodlawn Cemetery and wanted to help her, police said.

“Everybody is really emotionally damaged at this point in time,” said Messam’s son, who declined to give his name. “I would like to say something, but we don’t have all the details.”

An autopsy will determine Messam’s cause of death.

In comparison to the first wave of COVID-19, more kids were infected during the second wave which was caused by the Delta variant of coronavirus. The same trend is being witnessed at present as the Omicron variant is burgeoning to different parts of the world, leading to a surge in infection cases. Kids who were earlier considered only the carrier of the virus are now equally at the risk of developing severe symptoms and hospitalisation, particularly when there is underlying health complications. The cases in India might have gone down in the past week, but the COVID variant is here to stay for a while. That's what makes it vital to know about the common symptoms of this infection in kids.

📍The common symptoms of COVID in kids-

As per a Zoe COVID Symptom study, fatigue is the most common sign of coronavirus infection in kids, followed by headache, sore throat, runny nose and sneezing. The Zoe COVID study is a smartphone app developed during the pandemic to log how people across the UK felt daily when suffering from coronavirus. The app is used by both kids and adults to track the symptoms, based on which the researchers have prepared the list of the common Omicron symptoms. As per the data available from the app, the symptoms seen in adults were different from kids. It also revealed that, in adults, runny nose is the first sign, followed by headache, fatigue and sneezing.

📍Rare symptoms of COVID in kids-

Apart from respiratory system related symptoms, the Omicron variant may also impact other organs of the body. It can lead to some uncommon symptoms like diarrhoea and rashes. However, it is rare and is witnessed in a small percentage of cases. The data collected during the study also suggest that in some cases kids may develop croup, a condition in which an airway infection leads to a dog barking sound while coughing. The study, however, did not include asymptomatic COVID-19 cases.

The earliest documented evidence of kalaripayattu are in the form of palm leaf manuscripts with drawings of fighters, found in Kerala c. 200 BCE, but it is possible it is several hundred years older than that. The Dhanurveda, an ancient Indian text on Military Science, tells us that Kalaripayattu is one of the 64 art forms existing in Indian . The Dhanurveda is one of the Vedas, the ancient Indian ethical and moral teachings.
Kalaripayattu reach its zenith during the hundred years of war between the Cholas, Pandyas and Cheras. 
It was customary in Kerala to have all children above the age of seven to obtain training in kalaripayattu. British objected to the tradition of training with and carryin arms.  Laws were passed to prevent the people from practicing and training in kalaripayattu. These laws were put in place by the British to quell the chances of any form of mutiny.
Bodhidharma is credited with spread of martial arts to East Asia. He was well versed in Kalaripayattu and After his teacher’s passing, he went to China to spread the teachings of the Buddha in China, as this was his master’s last wish. Upon arriving in the area of Shao, he encounterd monks living there. He began to teach them his style of dhyana meditation only to discover the monks did not possess the stamina of body to continue. He then showed them the breathing techniques and Kalaripayattu’s body conditioning and fighting exercises to help the monks increase the levels of Prana in their bodies. Prana is the “vital energy” present in all life. Also called Chi, Qi, or Ki. So the combination of Kalaripayattu practices and meditation techniques brought to China from India. Bodhidharma has been given the title of “father of martial arts”. From these practices, the monks of Shao created the Shaolin temple and the martial arts known as Kung Fu.",2021-02-01 16:35:34,2021-02-01,Sports,en,en,en,en,Kalaripayattu is Derived from the Sanskrit word Khalurika meaning battlefield threshing floor or military training ground kalaripayattu is one of the most ancient forms of martial arts still practiced in the world The earliest documented evidence of kalaripayattu are in the form of palm leaf manuscripts with drawings of fighters found in Kerala c BCE but it is possible it is several hundred years older than that The Dhanurveda an ancient Indian text on Military Science tells us that Kalaripayattu is one of the art forms existing in Indian The Dhanurveda is one of the Vedas the ancient Indian ethical and moral teachings Kalaripayattu reach its zenith during the hundred years of war between the Cholas Pandyas and Cheras It was customary in Kerala to have all children above the age of seven to obtain training in kalaripayattu British objected to the tradition of training with and carryin arms Laws were passed to prevent the people from practicing and training in kalaripayattu These laws were put in place by the British to quell the chances of any form of mutiny Bodhidharma is credited with spread of martial arts to East Asia He was well versed in Kalaripayattu and After his teacher s passing he went to China to spread the teachings of the Buddha in China as this was his master s last wish Upon arriving in the area of Shao he encounterd monks living there He began to teach them his style of dhyana meditation only to discover the monks did not possess the stamina of body to continue He then showed them the breathing techniques and Kalaripayattu s body conditioning and fighting exercises to help the monks increase the levels of Prana in their bodies Prana is the vital energy present in all life Also called Chi Qi or Ki So the combination of Kalaripayattu practices and meditation techniques brought to China from India Bodhidharma has been given the title of father of martial arts From these practices the monks of Shao created the Shaolin temple and the martial arts known as Kung Fu ,Traditional Sports,0.00041546166,1.6505809e-06,2.6811438e-05,9.477805e-05,0.000101759295,2.5801799e-05,1.4200949e-05,People’s Republic of China,35.0,105.0,,0

As the team was ravaged by injuries all season long, the team made a big splash in the buyout market by bringing in big man Andre Drummond who was released by the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Drummond’s time with the Lakers was a bit of a mixed bag as he had some good showings but also struggled to fit in with the constantly changing lineups L.A. was forced to employ. The two sides ultimately parted ways in the offseason, but Drummond has no hard feelings toward the Lakers and enjoyed his time in Los Angeles.

In an interview on the Jefe Island YouTube Page, Drummond spoke about his time with the Lakers, admitting that any player who puts on the purple and gold must be built different from a mental aspect:

“The Lakers is exactly what you think it is man, you gotta be built differently to play for that organization. You gotta be mentally strong not even just on the court, but off the court too because it’s so much expectations to being a Laker and putting that purple and gold on because if you don’t meet those expectations they will let you know that you not worthy enough to wear that jersey. You gotta play to the best of your ability and play hard each and every night, regardless of win, lose, or draw you gotta just play hard that’s what gets respect. I had a lot of fun out there.”

Drummond is spot on about that as the Lakers fans are extremely passionate and vocal when they feel like players aren’t living up to expectations. On the other side, however, they will fully embrace those who come through and deliver and exceed those expectations on the way to a championship.

Drummond also noted the weird situation he was coming off after not playing in Cleveland before coming to the Lakers and wishing he had a better opportunity to show what he could do.",2022-04-23 23:39:29,2022-04-23,"la lakers, nba, basketball",en,en,en,en,The season for the Los Angeles Lakers saw a lot of new faces put on the purple and gold As the team was ravaged by injuries all season long the team made a big splash in the buyout market by bringing in big man Andre Drummond who was released by the Cleveland Cavaliers Drummond s time with the Lakers was a bit of a mixed bag as he had some good showings but also struggled to fit in with the constantly changing lineups L A was forced to employ The two sides ultimately parted ways in the offseason but Drummond has no hard feelings toward the Lakers and enjoyed his time in Los Angeles In an interview on the Jefe Island YouTube Page Drummond spoke about his time with the Lakers admitting that any player who puts on the purple and gold must be built different from a mental aspect The Lakers is exactly what you think it is man you gotta be built differently to play for that organization You gotta be mentally strong not even just on the court but off the court too because it s so much expectations to being a Laker and putting that purple and gold on because if you don t meet those expectations they will let you know that you not worthy enough to wear that jersey You gotta play to the best of your ability and play hard each and every night regardless of win lose or draw you gotta just play hard that s what gets respect I had a lot of fun out there Drummond is spot on about that as the Lakers fans are extremely passionate and vocal when they feel like players aren t living up to expectations On the other side however they will fully embrace those who come through and deliver and exceed those expectations on the way to a championship Drummond also noted the weird situation he was coming off after not playing in Cleveland before coming to the Lakers and wishing he had a better opportunity to show what he could do ,Andre Drummond Says You Must Be ‘Built Differently’ To Play For Franchise,0.0009350735,1.8579882e-06,6.9425514e-05,0.0001113524,0.00025846512,1.8981216e-05,2.785155e-05,Cleveland County,33.89836,-92.18514,,0

A volte non è giusto. Credo che sinceramente dopo l'1-0 abbiamo creato una chance per andare sul 2-0. La chance non l'abbiamo sfruttata e sul contropiede abbiamo preso l'1-1. Per i ragazzi andare al riposo sull'1-1 è stata dura. Potevamo fare chiaramente il 2-0, poi abbiamo difeso male. Forse eravamo già col nostro pensiero negli spogliatoi e invece c'era da giocare. Loro con forse l'unica occasione che abbiamo avuto hanno segnato, non abbiamo difeso bene in quella occasione. Nel primo tempo, ma anche nel secondo, abbiamo conquistato tanti palloni. La squadra ha lottato e dato tutto ma dobbiamo migliorare perchè quando prendiamo il pallone non dobbiamo perderlo. Su Destro c’era un chiaro rigore non concesso, ma c’è stato un chiaro strappo alla maglia. Dopo aver visto l'immagine era un rigore netto. Io non voglio che i giocatori facciano teatro, se un giocatore cadeva era rigore. Destro è stato disturbato, ha continuato l'azione ma il fallo è stato chiaro. Mi spiace tantissimo perchè mi fa pensare perchè non hanno chiesto neanche al VAR. Mi dispiace, queste cose non mi piacciono.
Il risultato non mi soddisfa. Il punto fatto a Roma potevamo sfruttarlo con una vittoria. Non sono contento del risultato. Non vivo sulla luna. So benissimo la classifica e i punti che abbiamo.

L’allenatore si è raccontato a lungo parlando della sua famiglia e dell’amore per l’Italia: «La verità è che mi sono innamorato di voi il 17 maggio 1989, quando il Napoli venne in Germania per giocare la finale di Coppa Uefa. Era il Napoli di Maradona: non dimenticherò mai il suo riscaldamento in campo. Palleggiava con ogni parte del corpo e la palla non cadeva mai a terra. Avevo 16 anni, vidi la partita in mezzo ai tifosi napoletani: saltavano tutti, la tribuna tremava e io pensavo: ""Cazzo, adesso viene giù tutto"". Finì 3-3, all’andata il Napoli aveva vinto 2-1 e conquistò la coppa. 
Mia moglie mi dice: sei a casa e non sul campo, abbassa un po’ il tono della voce. È che io sono fatto così. Soprattutto, non sono un attore: se sono triste o arrabbiato, oppure felice e orgoglioso, si vede. E a Genova mi sono sentito felice già dopo la prima partita. Avevamo pareggiato a Udine, eppure i tifosi facevano festa come se avessimo vinto. Mi sono chiesto dove fossi finito"". A casa mia moglie e le mie tre figlie Chiacchierano, chiacchierano, e io non ho più niente da dire. Mi è spuntato un orecchio anche sopra la testa (punta un dito in cima al cranio).

Cybersecurity staff often find themselves inundated with data they need to sort through to manage their cyber defenses.

The stakes are high. Cyberattacks are increasing and affect thousands of organizations and millions of people in the U.S. alone.

These challenges underscore the need for better ways to stem the tide of cyber-breaches. Artificial intelligence is particularly well suited to finding patterns in huge amounts of data. As a researcher who studies AI and cybersecurity, I find that AI is emerging as a much-needed tool in the cybersecurity toolkit.

Helping humans

There are two main ways AI is bolstering cybersecurity. First, AI can help automate many tasks that a human analyst would often handle manually. These include automatically detecting unknown workstations, servers, code repositories and other hardware and software on a network. It can also determine how best to allocate security defenses. These are data-intensive tasks, and AI has the potential to sift through terabytes of data much more efficiently and effectively than a human could ever do.

Second, AI can help detect patterns within large quantities of data that human analysts can’t see. For example, AI could detect the key linguistic patterns of hackers posting emerging threats in the dark web and alert analysts.

More specifically, AI-enabled analytics can help discern the jargon and code words hackers develop to refer to their new tools, techniques and procedures. One example is using the name Mirai to mean botnet. Hackers developed the term to hide the botnet topic from law enforcement and cyberthreat intelligence professionals.

Downsides of AI

Despite the significant benefits of AI for cybersecurity, cybersecurity professionals have questions and concerns about AI’s role. Companies might be thinking about replacing their human analysts with AI systems, but might be worried about how much they can trust automated systems.

Frank Vogel’s team trailed by as many as 32 points and was completely embarrassed by a much hungrier New Orleans squad.

The Lakers shot just 41.7% from the field and 20.4% from 3-point land. They also had 23 turnovers on the night, which surely played a factor in the 26 transition points the Pelicans had as well. Quite simply there were no positives on this night for the Lakers and Vogel said as much after the contest in explaining what went wrong.

“Well, we didn’t play well,” Vogel said. “We’re not shooting the ball well from the perimeter and the paint is clogged and we’re trying to force inside with the pass, with the bounce. It’s leading to a lot of turnovers and we’re not moving that well defensively, but we weren’t really good on either end tonight.”

Coming out of the All-Star break the Lakers still had a chance to potentially turn things around and salvage this season. But after a close loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, it looked as if the team wasn’t even trying against the Pelicans.

The biggest issue was undoubtedly the turnovers with many of them being a product of just laziness on the part of the Lakers and Vogel didn’t sugarcoat the impact that had.

“It was huge. With 23 turnovers, you are not going to win. So it was a huge part of it,” Vogel added. “Like I said, some of it is carelessness. I’ll have to look at all the turnovers, but some of it is carelessness and some it is we’re ice-cold from the perimeter right now. We’re trying to attack the paint and there’s five guys in there, so we’re trying to execute through that, but we definitely got to be better.”",2021-11-24 03:40:07,2021-11-24,"la lakers, nba",en,nl,en,nl,In a season full of disappointing lows the Los Angeles Lakers may have once again hit a new one in Sunday night s loss to the New Orleans Pelicans Frank Vogel s team trailed by as many as points and was completely embarrassed by a much hungrier New Orleans squad The Lakers shot just from the field and from point land They also had turnovers on the night which surely played a factor in the transition points the Pelicans had as well Quite simply there were no positives on this night for the Lakers and Vogel said as much after the contest in explaining what went wrong Well we didn t play well Vogel said We re not shooting the ball well from the perimeter and the paint is clogged and we re trying to force inside with the pass with the bounce It s leading to a lot of turnovers and we re not moving that well defensively but we weren t really good on either end tonight Coming out of the All Star break the Lakers still had a chance to potentially turn things around and salvage this season But after a close loss to the Los Angeles Clippers it looked as if the team wasn t even trying against the Pelicans The biggest issue was undoubtedly the turnovers with many of them being a product of just laziness on the part of the Lakers and Vogel didn t sugarcoat the impact that had It was huge With turnovers you are not going to win So it was a huge part of it Vogel added Like I said some of it is carelessness I ll have to look at all the turnovers but some of it is carelessness and some it is we re ice cold from the perimeter right now We re trying to attack the paint and there s five guys in there so we re trying to execute through that but we definitely got to be better ,Frank Vogel Believes Poor Perimeter Shooting & Turnovers Cost Lakers In Loss To Pelicans,0.001785609,8.61833e-06,0.00022523759,0.0004246633,0.0004864028,3.3376287e-05,0.00020681412,New Orleans,29.95465,-90.07507,,90

The justices on Wednesday rejected a bid by Trump to withhold the documents from the committee until the issue is finally resolved by the courts. Trump's lawyers had hoped to prolong the court fight and keep the documents on hold.

Following the high court's action, there is no legal impediment to turning over the documents, which are held by the National Archives and Records Administration. They include presidential diaries, visitor logs, speech drafts and handwritten notes dealing with Jan. 6 from the files of former chief of staff Mark Meadows.

The committee already has begun to receive records Trump wanted kept secret, said Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and Rep.Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., the committee chairman and vice chairwoman, respectively.

The Supreme Court's action tonight is a victory for the rule of law and American democracy, ""Thompson and Cheney said in a statement pledging to ``uncover all the facts about the violence of January 6th and its causes.""

White House spokesman Mike Gwin called the ruling ""an important step forward"" for the investigation, ""and in ensuring accountability for an unprecedented assault on our democracy and the rule of law.''

The House committee agreed to defer its attempt to get some documents, at the request of the Biden White House. The current administration was concerned that releasing all of the Trump administration documents sought by the committee could compromise national security and executive privilege.

Messi left Barcelona last summer to sign a two-year deal with PSG.

He was on the team that gave up a two-goal advantage to lose to Real Madrid in the Champions League round of 16 and was then booed during the next game, against Bordeaux.

Alves, who is in his second spell with Barcelona and has helped revitalise them under the management of Xavi Hernandez since rejoining in November, questioned Messi's mindset.

""I'm proof of that. There's nowhere better than here. For whatever reason, Leo isn't here today but I hope he can come back.""

A circular issued by the Directorate of Education regarding the reimbursement of tuition fees to minority students of classes 1 to 12 is widely being shared on social media with the claim that the Kejriwal-led AAP government in Delhi is trying to appease Muslims through such policies. It is alleged that the order is only applicable to Muslims.

BJP Delhi spokesperson and media in-charge, Harish Khurana, tweeted a screenshot of this circular saying that it is not wrong to accuse Kejriwal of indulging in Muslim appeasement as this circular is an example.

Another BJP spokesperson, Vikram Bidhuri, tweeted a screengrab of this circular asking whether being a Hindu is a crime. He further alleged that after the salary of maulvis (Muslim priests), the Kejriwal government will refund two-year fees of Muslim children studying in private schools.

On Facebook, BJP worker Ravinder Singh Negi shared the same circular calling it a “Tughlaqi” order.

Fact-check
We performed a keyword search and found a copy of the order on the website of the education department. Nowhere does the order state that the reimbursement of tuition fees is only applicable to Muslim minority students.

According to various news reports, the Delhi government has issued instructions to refund the tuition fees of eligible minority students of all private schools in Delhi. The Directorate of Education of Delhi in its instructions has asked the education officers to ensure the completion of the tuition fee refund process for minority students for the years 2020-21 and 2021-22. None of the news reports mentions that the policy is applicable to students of a particular religion only.

And a quarter of our time asleep is spent dreaming. So, for the average person alive in 2022, with a life expectancy of around 73, that clocks in at just over six years of dreaming.Yet, given the central role that dreaming plays in our lives, we still know so little about why we dream, how the brain creates dreams, and importantly, what the significance of our dreams might be for our health – especially the health of our brains.My latest study, published in The Lancet’s eClinicalMedicine journal, shows that our dreams can reveal a surprising amount of information about our brain health. More specifically, it shows that having frequent bad dreams and nightmares (bad dreams that make you wake up) during middle or older age, may be linked with an increased risk of developing dementia.In the study, I analysed data from three large US studies of health and ageing. These included over 600 people aged between 35 and 64, and 2,600 people aged 79 and older.All the participants were dementia-free at the start of the study and were followed for an average of nine years for the middle-aged group and five years for the older participants.At the beginning of the study (2002-12), the participants completed a range of questionnaires, including one which asked about how often they experienced bad dreams and nightmares.I analysed the data to find out whether participants with a higher frequency of nightmares at the beginning of the study were more likely to go on to experience cognitive decline (a fast decline in memory and thinking skills over time) and be diagnosed with dementia.Weekly nightmaresI found that middle-aged participants who experienced nightmares every week, were four times more likely to experience cognitive decline (a precursor to dementia) over the following decade, while the older participants were twice as likely to be diagnosed with dementia.Read more: https://theconversation.com/nightmares-are-a-good-predictor-of-future-dementia-new-study-191016",2022-04-20 11:35:32,2022-04-20,"Economy, Climate change , Technology, History, Food, Entertainment, Sports, Environment, Science, Inequality, Education, Health, Politics",en,en,en,en,We spend a third of our lives asleep And a quarter of our time asleep is spent dreaming So for the average person alive in with a life expectancy of around that clocks in at just over six years of dreaming Yet given the central role that dreaming plays in our lives we still know so little about why we dream how the brain creates dreams and importantly what the significance of our dreams might be for our health especially the health of our brains My latest study published in The Lancet s eClinicalMedicine journal shows that our dreams can reveal a surprising amount of information about our brain health More specifically it shows that having frequent bad dreams and nightmares bad dreams that make you wake up during middle or older age may be linked with an increased risk of developing dementia In the study I analysed data from three large US studies of health and ageing These included over people aged between and and people aged and older All the participants were dementia free at the start of the study and were followed for an average of nine years for the middle aged group and five years for the older participants At the beginning of the study the participants completed a range of questionnaires including one which asked about how often they experienced bad dreams and nightmares I analysed the data to find out whether participants with a higher frequency of nightmares at the beginning of the study were more likely to go on to experience cognitive decline a fast decline in memory and thinking skills over time and be diagnosed with dementia Weekly nightmaresI found that middle aged participants who experienced nightmares every week were four times more likely to experience cognitive decline a precursor to dementia over the following decade while the older participants were twice as likely to be diagnosed with dementia Read more ,Nightmares are a good predictor of future dementia – new study,0.0050271805,9.725266e-05,0.0002984028,0.005698586,0.0006479473,0.00036107644,7.850224e-05,,,,,0

His invasion of Ukraine is not just bogged down. It’s going rapidly backwards.
Ukraine’s armed forces have launched two stunningly successful counteroffensives around Kharkiv in the nation’s east, and in the south near the Russian-occupied city of Kherson. Kyiv is now claiming to have recaptured some 2,000 square kilometres of its territory, with the potential to cut off and trap a sizeable portion of the Russian invasion force.
By the Kremlin’s own standards, this is hardly winning. Realising Russia’s war aims – including regime change and the establishment of a “Crimean corridor” that denies Ukraine access to the Black Sea – would require nothing short of a dramatic reversal of its fortunes.
Putin now essentially has three options.
First, he can seek a political solution, hoping to hold onto the territory Kremlin proxies captured in the eight years prior to his 2022 invasion. That’s an unattractive choice, especially since a bullish Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is hardly in the mood to negotiate favourable terms for Moscow. Internationally, it would be a humiliating blow to Russian prestige: a smaller state defeating a top-tier nuclear power in a major land war.
Domestically, and more worrying for Putin, it would sharply call his leadership into question. Mounting signs of domestic discontent now even include St Petersburg regional deputies publicly calling for Putin to be tried for treason, another group from Moscow calling for him to step down, and even state media questioning the conflict.
Option two for Putin is to try to reimpose a long and grinding campaign. But even if his forces can blunt the Ukrainian advance, Russia can achieve only a stalemate if the war returns to static artillery duels. That would buy time. It would wear down Ukrainian forces and allow him to test whether using energy as a weapon fragments the European Union’s resolve over the winter.

We have to carry on and every time learn the lessons and give the maximum.
“Only good, for me, is good enough and by far we are not that good. We have seen on Sunday [against Manchester City]. 
We have to do much better and that is what we did in games before – better intensity.
“We have to bring much better intensity. That was the big difference between City and us

13 times champion Rafael Nadal came back from 2-5 down in the 4th set to beat World No. 1 and defending champion Djokovic and reach the semifinals at Roland Garros for a record 15th time.

Officially, it was a quarterfinal set-up, but the way both the champions had played against each other made it look like a perfect grand finale event from the quality of play to the quality of effort and the atmosphere that it had created in the packed gathering at Roland Garros.

In the post-match presser, Nadal said: ""To win against Novak, there is only one way — to play at your best from the first point to the last and tonight has been one of those magical nights for me"".

Rafa, however, maintains he can’t know for sure whether any match at Roland Garros might be his very last at a place he loves, a place he is loved!

For now, if he keeps winning and keeps executing the way he did during his memorable quarterfinal victory over his old foe, Djokovic which began in May and ended in June, Nadal will have more chances to play.

Rafa is now 110-3 for his career at the place. Two of those came against Djokovic, including in last year’s semifinals. This time, however, he made sure Djokovic remains behind him in the Slam count with 20!

It's worth noting here that Nadal broke their three-way tie with Roger Federer at that number by capturing the Australian Open in January when Djokovic was not able to play because of his Covid-19 vaccination saga.

Without an iota of doubt, Rafael Nadal is the most inspiring athlete ever. Living with a foot injury at age 36, having far from ideal preparations for French Open, playing against his great rival and the No. 1 in conditions unfavourable for him, and still ending up on the winning side.

The investigation unraveled after weeks of disagreements between the veteran prosecutors and the new District Attorney. Pomerantz and Dunne were confident that the investigative team could demonstrate that the former President had intended to inflate the value of his assets, but Bragg wasn't convinced and decided to not pursue an indictment against Trump. Due to this the investigators were not able to present the evidence to a grand jury and this was the last straw for them as they resigned. Bragg's predecessor Vance Jr. had in his final days of office decided to move towards an indictment but Bragg's desicion has for now appeared to remove one of the greatest legal threats that the former president has faced. Pomerantz in his resignation letter had some harsh words and wrote that ""No case is perfect, whatever the risks of bringing the case may be, I am convinced that a failure to prosecute will pose much greater risks in terms of public confidence in the fair administration of justice."" 

Trump's lawyer said that the charges against his client was baseless, and unwarranted and also said that Pomerantz had repeatedly failed to show the results of his investigation to the District Attorney on several occasions. Trump's company in its statement called Pomerantz a never-Trumper and applauded Bragg for following the law and making a fair decision.

In the past, it was like a tabo inK-pop industry to talk about Alcohol. Now the one person who overcomes this tabo is lee young Ji. Lee young Ji start her YouTube series called ""My Alcohol Dairy"" where she invited kpop idols to comfortably talk while drinking. Her hilarious charisma has become the talk of the internet.
Jin is also no stranger to making people laugh with his charms.
The combination of Jin and Lee Young Ji would be perfect, and it seems like people’s dreams are coming true.
For the past few episodes, ARMY wants to see drunk seokjin and its final dream of ARMY comes true.
On October 7, Lee Young Ji finally spilled the real gossip when she got to announce the news on her Instagram officially.
""Yes, he is coming on the show. Yes, he will be appearing. I wanted to say something so badly I could have died. Stop DMing me. Yes, he is coming. It’s very true, he is appearing.""
-Lee Young 
A fan then shared the post on Weverse, and Jin just so happened to see it. As expected, the idol had the funniest reaction, adding, “Don’t die.”
Of course, excitement about the news was sky-high, and one ARMY had the most relatable reaction on Weverse.
""Ah, you’re coming on ‘No prepare’ kekeke. I’m on break during that time, I should watch while copying what Seokjin drinks kekeke, so let us know what to prepare~ please!!!!""
— ARMY
It seems like ARMYs should prepare for true hilariousness as Jin revealed that the alcohol tolerance between the two of them was so intense… with Jin even warning fans not to copy them.
""The speed that Lee Youngji-nim and I drink at is fast, so please dont copy us…""
— Jin
There was even some dancing to Jin’s viral track “Super Tuna.”

This is no longer the case. As technology has become more advanced, and the enemy more sophisticated, states have moved further away from this traditional warfare style.Now warfare is conducted across multiple battle domains: air, land, sea, space and through cyberspace, and often simultaneously.Hybrid warfare refers to newer and more unconventional methods of fighting a war. It can occur across the political, economic and civil spheres, often blending several warfareHybrid warfare blurs the lines between conventional and unconventional warfare, as well as the distinction between times of peace and war. As stated by NATO, hybrid warfare can include a variety of tactics such as terrorism, migration, piracy, corruption and ethnic conflict.While hybrid warfare isn’t a new concept, advances in technology have allowed hybrid strategies to be executed in new ways, such as cyber attacks and information warfare.Many commentators are concerned Russia or other states with similar military capabilities could attack underwater internet cables.It’s therefore understandable why some European politicians are claiming that if such critical energy infrastructure has been sabotaged, this would herald a new stage of hybrid warfare.Read more: https://theconversation.com/hybrid-warfare-nord-stream-attacks-show-how-war-is-evolving-191764",2022-04-20 11:35:32,2022-04-20,"Technology, History, Food, Entertainment, Sports, Environment, Science, Inequality, Education, Health, Politics, Economy, Climate change ",en,en,en,en,It s not yet clear who carried out the attacks on the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea last week although many Western nations are suspicious it was an act of sabotage by Russia What is clear is that the ruptures have added to already heightened tensions and an impending energy crisis in the region While further investigations are required if Russia was behind such sabotage we can view it as an evolution of hybrid warfare because it would highlight how the energy sector and critical infrastructure can be strategically targeted as an unconventional warfare method If the damage to Nord Stream is deemed to be a deliberate act of sabotage there will likely be an escalation in the regional conflict What is hybrid warfare Traditionally war was conducted on a battlefield between two states in a defined territory This is no longer the case As technology has become more advanced and the enemy more sophisticated states have moved further away from this traditional warfare style Now warfare is conducted across multiple battle domains air land sea space and through cyberspace and often simultaneously Hybrid warfare refers to newer and more unconventional methods of fighting a war It can occur across the political economic and civil spheres often blending several warfareHybrid warfare blurs the lines between conventional and unconventional warfare as well as the distinction between times of peace and war As stated by NATO hybrid warfare can include a variety of tactics such as terrorism migration piracy corruption and ethnic conflict While hybrid warfare isn t a new concept advances in technology have allowed hybrid strategies to be executed in new ways such as cyber attacks and information warfare Many commentators are concerned Russia or other states with similar military capabilities could attack underwater internet cables It s therefore understandable why some European politicians are claiming that if such critical energy infrastructure has been sabotaged this would herald a new stage of hybrid warfare Read more ,‘Hybrid warfare’: Nord Stream attacks show how war is evolving,0.00046954284,1.8643105e-06,4.3338623e-05,0.000100113066,0.00010343003,1.5825803e-05,1.8794859e-05,White Sea-Baltic Canal,62.8,34.8,,50

Remember me when I am gone away,

Gone far away into the silent land;

When you can no more hold me by the hand,

Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.

Remember me when no more day by day

You tell me of our future that you plann’d:

Only remember me; you understand

It will be late to counsel then or pray.

Yet if you should forget me for a while

And afterwards remember, do not grieve:

For if the darkness and corruption leave

A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,

Better by far you should forget and smile

Than that you should remember and be sad

 It was written in 1849 but not published until 1862 when it occurred in Rossetti’s first volume, Goblin Market and Other Poems.

The poet requests that the addressee of the poem remember her after she has died. (The addressee is presumably her lover since they had ‘plann’d’ a ‘future’ together.) But what twists the poem is the inferring thought that it would be better for her loved one to forget her and be happy than to recall her if it makes that person sad. It is this second part of the poem’s ‘argument’ that saves it from spilling over into corny sentimentality.

Rossetti entreats someone not to sing any sad songs for her when she dies and says it does not matter whether her lover remembers or forgets her.

The poem is an extraordinary technical accomplishment for a sonnet written by a teenager, during any era.",2022-04-22 20:31:06,2022-04-22,poetry,en,en,en,en, Remember by Christina Georgina Rossetti Remember me when I am gone away Gone far away into the silent land When you can no more hold me by the hand Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay Remember me when no more day by day You tell me of our future that you plann d Only remember me you understand It will be late to counsel then or pray Yet if you should forget me for a while And afterwards remember do not grieve For if the darkness and corruption leave A vestige of the thoughts that once I had Better by far you should forget and smile Than that you should remember and be sad It was written in but not published until when it occurred in Rossetti s first volume Goblin Market and Other Poems The poet requests that the addressee of the poem remember her after she has died The addressee is presumably her lover since they had plann d a future together But what twists the poem is the inferring thought that it would be better for her loved one to forget her and be happy than to recall her if it makes that person sad It is this second part of the poem s argument that saves it from spilling over into corny sentimentality Rossetti entreats someone not to sing any sad songs for her when she dies and says it does not matter whether her lover remembers or forgets her The poem is an extraordinary technical accomplishment for a sonnet written by a teenager during any era ,“Remember” by Christina Georgina Rossetti,0.0056324145,2.2275946e-05,0.00020801276,0.0036387222,0.00072976336,8.745378e-05,0.00010818978,,,,,0

This finding led the Italian company Mold to conceive a sustainable solution to remove the plastic and oily waste directly from the watercourse. 

River Cleaning Plastic & Oil works 24 hours a day, seven days a week, intercepting floating waste on the river course. Buoy-like modules form a diagonal barrier along the river, filtering the debris and directing them to a collection point on the bank. The floating buoy modules have specific characteristics according to waste, whether plastic, oil, or industrial waste, and can intercept up to 85% of floating garbage.

An entirely self-powered solution with no environmental impact, River Cleaning achieved the Friend of the Sea sustainability certification after demonstrating that the system preserves the aquatic environment while respecting the well-being of native species. The recognition granted by Friend of the Sea, the preeminent international certification for products and services that respect and protect the marine environment, is a first for this type of product.

The system is designed to offer a standardized solution to different waterways, both in terms of width and depth. Mold’s River Cleaning technology is unique compared to conventional techniques as it does not interfere with inland navigation. 

River Cleaning uses an independent power source, harnessing the water's current to generate renewable energy with zero impact. Targeting the waterways is a much more effective and sustainable solution than recovering waste from the sea, which has higher energy costs and lower results. Additionally, around 95% of garbage sinks when reaching the ocean.

Recovered material from the sea usually is highly corroded, substantially reducing the possibility of recycling. 

“It is estimated that there are currently about 150,000 tonnes of plastic floating in the sea,” said Paolo Bray, Founder and Director of Friend of the Sea.
