       "      <td>While Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James finds himself at home during the playoffs, the new age of NBA stars have cemented themselves this postseason. Arguably none have done so more than Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic, who has surprisingly led his team to the Western Conference Finals opposite the Golden State Warriors and their all-time great trio of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green.\\n\\nIn just his fourth season, Doncic has already established himself as perhaps the NBA’s next great superstar and his size, scoring and passing ability have drawn comparisons to James. Indeed, Doncic’s all-around game does compare well with the Lakers’ star and Green believes so as well.\\n\\nGreen discussed the similarities between Doncic and LeBron, believing the two are very much alike in many ways but do have some differences as well.\\n\\nBoth Luka and LeBron are masters at controlling the game with the ball in their hands, reading and manipulating the defense and getting the best out of their teammates. It is an interesting note that Green makes about Doncic being slightly more of a shoot-first player than James, but it isn’t necessarily wrong either.\\n\\nObviously the other big difference that Green didn’t mention, but also doesn’t need mentioning, is LeBron’s athletic advantage. But the great thing about Luka is that he has shown he doesn’t need elite athleticism to dominate in the NBA.\\n\\nThe new era of NBA stars is growing before our eyes and these playoffs have seen the likes of Doncic, Ja Morant, Jayson Tatum and Anthony Edwards have truly impressive outings. There is always a tendency to compare the new stars to current or past ones and it is hard to argue that Doncic and James have some serious similarities.</td>\n",

Rebekah boost his morale and Miguel gave him space and funds to start his business and they started their new business named ‘Greendesk.’\\n\\nBut the nature of humans is to grow at any cost and for that, Adam scraped off ‘Greendesk,’ and tried to get new investors for a bigger business idea and one investor agreed to fund his idea.\\n\\nThe second episode began with the conflict when the investor ditched Adam and the struggle of Adam continues. Then Adam and Rebekah got married to each other and Rebekah’s dad gave them one million dollars as a gift but Adam used that money to invest in his business and then Adam, Rebekah, and Miguel started “WeWork.”\\n\\nIn episode three, we saw the success of the “WeWork” and by 2012 they have 10k members working for it but every success story has its hurdle and now the hurdle was one quote from Rebekah (which I’ll not tell because it can be the spoiler) which put “WeWork” and Adam into trouble but at the end of the episode, everything got sorted out.\\n\\nWhat I liked about the series till now is its story and its pace things that I didn’t like about the series till now are the third episode because this episode didn’t add anything to the story.\\n\\nThe next episode of the series will premiere on 25th March. \\n\\nIf you are interested in business then you should watch this series.\\n\\nI’ll talk about everything in details once all the episodes come out.</td>\n",

Arguably none have done so more than Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic, who has surprisingly led his team to the Western Conference Finals opposite the Golden State Warriors and their all-time great trio of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green.\\n\\nIn just his fourth season, Doncic has already established himself as perhaps the NBA’s next great superstar and his size, scoring and passing ability have drawn comparisons to James. Indeed, Doncic’s all-around game does compare well with the Lakers’ star and Green believes so as well.\\n\\nGreen discussed the similarities between Doncic and LeBron, believing the two are very much alike in many ways but do have some differences as well.\\n\\nBoth Luka and LeBron are masters at controlling the game with the ball in their hands, reading and manipulating the defense and getting the best out of their teammates. It is an interesting note that Green makes about Doncic being slightly more of a shoot-first player than James, but it isn’t necessarily wrong either.\\n\\nObviously the other big difference that Green didn’t mention, but also doesn’t need mentioning, is LeBron’s athletic advantage. But the great thing about Luka is that he has shown he doesn’t need elite athleticism to dominate in the NBA.\\n\\nThe new era of NBA stars is growing before our eyes and these playoffs have seen the likes of Doncic, Ja Morant, Jayson Tatum and Anthony Edwards have truly impressive outings. There is always a tendency to compare the new stars to current or past ones and it is hard to argue that Doncic and James have some serious similarities.   \n",

       "2  “How to win the game of life,” and this one quote sum up the first three episodes of ‘We Crashed,’ web series available on Apple TV+.\\n\\n“We Crashed,” is a story about Adam (played by Jared Leto) and his struggle to start his own business.\\n\\nThe first episode starts where we see that Adam is pitching his business idea to so many investors in 2007 and each one of them rejected his idea then Adam met Rebekah (played by Anne Hathaway) and Miguel (played by Kyle Marwin) who helped him to start his business. Rebekah boost his morale and Miguel gave him space and funds to start his business and they started their new business named ‘Greendesk.’\\n\\nBut the nature of humans is to grow at any cost and for that, Adam scraped off ‘Greendesk,’ and tried to get new investors for a bigger business idea and one investor agreed to fund his idea.\\n\\nThe second episode began with the conflict when the investor ditched Adam and the struggle of Adam continues. Then Adam and Rebekah got married to each other and Rebekah’s dad gave them one million dollars as a gift but Adam used that money to invest in his business and then Adam, Rebekah, and Miguel started “WeWork.”\\n\\nIn episode three, we saw the success of the “WeWork” and by 2012 they have 10k members working for it but every success story has its hurdle and now the hurdle was one quote from Rebekah (which I’ll not tell because it can be the spoiler) which put “WeWork” and Adam into trouble but at the end of the episode, everything got sorted out.\\n\\nWhat I liked about the series till now is its story and its pace things that I didn’t like about the series till now are the third episode because this episode didn’t add anything to the story.\\n\\nThe next episode of the series will premiere on 25th March. \\n\\nIf you are interested in business then you should watch this series.\\n\\nI’ll talk about everything in details once all the episodes come out.   \n",

       "      <td>While Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James finds himself at home during the playoffs, the new age of NBA stars have cemented themselves this postseason. Arguably none have done so more than Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic, who has surprisingly led his team to the Western Conference Finals opposite the Golden State Warriors and their all-time great trio of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green.\\n\\nIn just his fourth season, Doncic has already established himself as perhaps the NBA’s next great superstar and his size, scoring and passing ability have drawn comparisons to James. Indeed, Doncic’s all-around game does compare well with the Lakers’ star and Green believes so as well.\\n\\nGreen discussed the similarities between Doncic and LeBron, believing the two are very much alike in many ways but do have some differences as well.\\n\\nBoth Luka and LeBron are masters at controlling the game with the ball in their hands, reading and manipulating the defense and getting the best out of their teammates. It is an interesting note that Green makes about Doncic being slightly more of a shoot-first player than James, but it isn’t necessarily wrong either.\\n\\nObviously the other big difference that Green didn’t mention, but also doesn’t need mentioning, is LeBron’s athletic advantage. But the great thing about Luka is that he has shown he doesn’t need elite athleticism to dominate in the NBA.\\n\\nThe new era of NBA stars is growing before our eyes and these playoffs have seen the likes of Doncic, Ja Morant, Jayson Tatum and Anthony Edwards have truly impressive outings. There is always a tendency to compare the new stars to current or past ones and it is hard to argue that Doncic and James have some serious similarities.</td>\n",

       "      <td>“How to win the game of life,” and this one quote sum up the first three episodes of ‘We Crashed,’ web series available on Apple TV+.\\n\\n“We Crashed,” is a story about Adam (played by Jared Leto) and his struggle to start his own business.\\n\\nThe first episode starts where we see that Adam is pitching his business idea to so many investors in 2007 and each one of them rejected his idea then Adam met Rebekah (played by Anne Hathaway) and Miguel (played by Kyle Marwin) who helped him to start his business. Rebekah boost his morale and Miguel gave him space and funds to start his business and they started their new business named ‘Greendesk.’\\n\\nBut the nature of humans is to grow at any cost and for that, Adam scraped off ‘Greendesk,’ and tried to get new investors for a bigger business idea and one investor agreed to fund his idea.\\n\\nThe second episode began with the conflict when the investor ditched Adam and the struggle of Adam continues. Then Adam and Rebekah got married to each other and Rebekah’s dad gave them one million dollars as a gift but Adam used that money to invest in his business and then Adam, Rebekah, and Miguel started “WeWork.”\\n\\nIn episode three, we saw the success of the “WeWork” and by 2012 they have 10k members working for it but every success story has its hurdle and now the hurdle was one quote from Rebekah (which I’ll not tell because it can be the spoiler) which put “WeWork” and Adam into trouble but at the end of the episode, everything got sorted out.\\n\\nWhat I liked about the series till now is its story and its pace things that I didn’t like about the series till now are the third episode because this episode didn’t add anything to the story.\\n\\nThe next episode of the series will premiere on 25th March. \\n\\nIf you are interested in business then you should watch this series.\\n\\nI’ll talk about everything in details once all the episodes come out.</td>\n",

Arguably none have done so more than Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic, who has surprisingly led his team to the Western Conference Finals opposite the Golden State Warriors and their all-time great trio of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green.\\n\\nIn just his fourth season, Doncic has already established himself as perhaps the NBA’s next great superstar and his size, scoring and passing ability have drawn comparisons to James. Indeed, Doncic’s all-around game does compare well with the Lakers’ star and Green believes so as well.\\n\\nGreen discussed the similarities between Doncic and LeBron, believing the two are very much alike in many ways but do have some differences as well.\\n\\nBoth Luka and LeBron are masters at controlling the game with the ball in their hands, reading and manipulating the defense and getting the best out of their teammates. It is an interesting note that Green makes about Doncic being slightly more of a shoot-first player than James, but it isn’t necessarily wrong either.\\n\\nObviously the other big difference that Green didn’t mention, but also doesn’t need mentioning, is LeBron’s athletic advantage. But the great thing about Luka is that he has shown he doesn’t need elite athleticism to dominate in the NBA.\\n\\nThe new era of NBA stars is growing before our eyes and these playoffs have seen the likes of Doncic, Ja Morant, Jayson Tatum and Anthony Edwards have truly impressive outings. There is always a tendency to compare the new stars to current or past ones and it is hard to argue that Doncic and James have some serious similarities.   \n",

       "2  “How to win the game of life,” and this one quote sum up the first three episodes of ‘We Crashed,’ web series available on Apple TV+.\\n\\n“We Crashed,” is a story about Adam (played by Jared Leto) and his struggle to start his own business.\\n\\nThe first episode starts where we see that Adam is pitching his business idea to so many investors in 2007 and each one of them rejected his idea then Adam met Rebekah (played by Anne Hathaway) and Miguel (played by Kyle Marwin) who helped him to start his business. Rebekah boost his morale and Miguel gave him space and funds to start his business and they started their new business named ‘Greendesk.’\\n\\nBut the nature of humans is to grow at any cost and for that, Adam scraped off ‘Greendesk,’ and tried to get new investors for a bigger business idea and one investor agreed to fund his idea.\\n\\nThe second episode began with the conflict when the investor ditched Adam and the struggle of Adam continues. Then Adam and Rebekah got married to each other and Rebekah’s dad gave them one million dollars as a gift but Adam used that money to invest in his business and then Adam, Rebekah, and Miguel started “WeWork.”\\n\\nIn episode three, we saw the success of the “WeWork” and by 2012 they have 10k members working for it but every success story has its hurdle and now the hurdle was one quote from Rebekah (which I’ll not tell because it can be the spoiler) which put “WeWork” and Adam into trouble but at the end of the episode, everything got sorted out.\\n\\nWhat I liked about the series till now is its story and its pace things that I didn’t like about the series till now are the third episode because this episode didn’t add anything to the story.\\n\\nThe next episode of the series will premiere on 25th March. \\n\\nIf you are interested in business then you should watch this series.\\n\\nI’ll talk about everything in details once all the episodes come out.   \n",
