    "\n",
    "- Get IP address of your local machine: ipconfig (Windows) or ifconfig (Mac or Linux). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Configure the web server to bind to the host IP address: Once you have determined the IP address of your local machine, you can configure the web server to bind to that IP address. The steps to do this will depend on the web server software you are using, but typically involve editing a configuration file or settings file. Look for a setting that specifies the IP address or hostname that the web server should bind to, and set it to the IP address of your local machine. For example, in Apache, you would edit the httpd.conf file and set the Listen directive to Listen <your_local_ip>:8888.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Configure Docker Desktop to access the web server: Once the web server is bound to the host IP address, you can configure Docker Desktop to access it. Open the Docker Desktop settings and go to the \"Resources\" section. Under \"File Sharing\", add the directory that contains your web server files, and make sure the checkbox next to it is selected. This will allow Docker Desktop to access the directory and the web server files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test the web server in a Docker container: Once you have configured Docker Desktop to access the web server, you can test it by creating a Docker container that accesses the web server. You can do this by creating a Dockerfile that specifies the image you want to use, and the command to run the container (which would typically involve starting the web server). Then, build the image and run the container, and access the web server using the IP address and port number of the Docker container. For example, if your web server is running on http://localhost:8888 and your Docker container is running on http://172.17.0.2:8888, you would access the web server using http://172.17.0.2:8888.\n",
