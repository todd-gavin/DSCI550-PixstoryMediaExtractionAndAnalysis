      "As part of its deadly assault on Ukraine, Russia has taken the rare step to use intellectual property rights as a war tactic. In early March, the Russian government issued a decree saying that Russian companies are no longer obliged to compensate owners of patents, utility models and industrial designs from “unfriendly” countries. These are the western states who have issued sanctions against Russia, including the UK and US.\n",
      "\n",

      "Remember the 25th minute goal in the Argentina versus Mexico second round match in the 2010 World Cup?  Carlos Tevez was offside by yards, but the referee didn’t disallow the goal. The replay on the big screen inside the stadium confirmed the offside and fight broke in the technical bench followed by the entire Mexican team surrounding the referee. But the decision wasn’t changed. Equally shocking was the decision of the referee in the South Korea-Spain encounter in the 2002 World Cup quarter-finals.  South Korea got the benefit of the doubt as Egyptian Referee Gamal Al-Ghandour disallowed two legal Spanish goals and his linesmen judged one Spanish attack after another to be offside, as South Korea went on to win 5-3 on penalties to reach the semi-finals. Shortly afterward, the referee was forced to retire.\n",
      "Now, all these things are set to come to an end. Hopefully. The Qatar World Cup will have an interesting and new feature within it’s official match ball “Al Rihla”. The feature will be an updated VAR (Video Assistant Referee) system which is called semi-automated offside technology. The new technology will replace the VAR system which was introduced in the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The authorities believe that the new system will help the match official make more accurate decisions with the new technology. “VAR has already had a very positive impact on football and we can see that the number of major mistakes has already been dramatically reduced. We expect that semi-automated offside technology can take us a step further,” said FIFA Referees Committee Chairman Pierluigi Collina in a statement. The new system will have 12 cameras within the stadium which will track the movement and position of both the ball and players. The ball is with a motion sensor inside which will provide the information on the player’s position at the time when the ball is kicked. As per ESPN, the old VAR system used to 70 second to make an official offside decision. But now, the decision will be made in only 25 seconds.\n"

      "Carotid plaque is one of the typical manifestations and precursors of diabetic cardiovascular complications. As a new adipokine, asprosin participates in the development of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, and is considered to be closely related to insulin resistance and glucolipid metabolism. This study aimed to analyze the relationship between serum asprosin level and carotid plaque in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods\n",
      "\n",
      "A total of 180 patients with T2DM were selected. The basic parameters and biochemical indexes of the subjects were measured, and the serum asprosin concentration of the subjects was detected by ELISA. The carotid plaque was evaluated by color Doppler ultrasound.\n",
      "\n",
      "Results\n",
      "\n",
      "The level of serum asprosin in the T2DM with carotid plaque group was significantly higher than that in T2DM without carotid plaque group [2.53(1.73-3.21) vs. 1.72(1.23-2.34) ng/mL, P<0.05]. The incidence of carotid plaque in the low, middle and high quartiles was 31.7%, 48.3% and 70% respectively. Correlation analysis showed that serum asprosin was positively correlated with BMI, WHR, SBP, DBP, FIns, LDL-C, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-β (P<0.05). Linear regression analysis showed that WHR, DBP, FIns, and LDL-C were independent influencing factors of asprosin. Logistic regression analysis showed that serum asprosin was still significantly correlated with carotid plaque in T2DM patients after adjusting for multiple confounding factors. The area under receiver-operating curve (ROC) of asprosin predicting carotid plaque was 0.701 (0.625-0.777) in T2DM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The level of serum asprosin in T2DM patients with carotid plaques is significantly higher, suggesting that asprosin may play a role in the occurrence and development of carotid plaques in T2DM. Detection of this index can provide new clinical evidence for the prevention and treatment of diabetic cardiovascular disease.\n",

      "Abstract</p>\n",
      "<p dir=\"ltr\">Telomeres are often considered as the &#8216;ageing clock&#8217; that determines the lifespan at the cellular level, forming the ends of a chromosome, which shorten each time the cell divides itself to the point where they become so short the cell is unable to divide itself further. Telomere length alteration is often linked with lifestyle factors such as age, obesity, exposure to pesticides and pollution, depression, unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, and stress. The current review discusses the mechanism of telomere shortening in relation to ageing and lifestyle factors in general and its association with chronic diseases like diabetes which may influence the health and lifespan of an individual by increasing telomere shortening. Accelerated or excessive telomere shortening is also associated with the early onset of age-related disorders globally and, hence, reduced lifespan of individuals. Upregulated Telomerase activity and reactivation of telomeres is observed in &gt;70% of cancer patients by TERT point mutations, rearrangements, DNA amplifications, and transcript fusions, making it a useful marker in diagnosis and prognosis of various cancers. The study presents a systematic review of the unregulated Telomere activity with progression of various cancer and extrapolation of suitable pathways and prognostic information correlated with mRNA levels of TERT, which are critical among thymic epithelial tumors (TETs). In most cancers, unlimited proliferation is due to the reactivation of reverse transcriptase gene TERT. All these observations are comprehensively presented in the paper and might be useful for researchers working in the field of telomere dynamics and finding the correlation of age shortening with mRNA expression profiling.<br></p>\n",

      "Diabetes without cancer group had higher fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c levels and lower adequate glycemic control than did the other two groups. The preexisting cancer group had low treatment rates. After adjusting for age, sex, employment status, and duration of diabetes, the preexisting cancer group had 0.51-fold lower odds of receiving treatment, such as insulin injection or oral diabetes medications, than the other two groups (adjusted odds ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.66) \n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion \n",
      "\n",
      "Cancer survivors had lower fasting glucose and HbA1c than those with diabetes without cancer. However, as a result of the sub-analysis, the treatment rate of the pre-existing cancer group was significantly lower than that of diabetes without cancer. Based on these results, cancer survivors’ care-related healthcare workers should be aware of the need for monitoring blood sugar even in cancer survivors without underlying diabetes mellitus and pay more attention to early detection and active treatment of diabetes. \n",
