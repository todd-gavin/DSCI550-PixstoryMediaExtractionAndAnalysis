EDWIN van der SAR

Edwin van der Sar, David de Gea's predecessor at Manchester United, set the bar high for the Spaniard in terms of performance.

Van der Sar joined the Red Devils when he was 34 years old, having previously played for Ajax, Juventus, and Fulham. Van der Sar, a calm and steady demeanour, helped Manchester United defeat Chelsea by saving Nicolas Anelka's penalty in the 2008 Champions League final.


JENS LEHMANN

Jens Lehmann is recognised as one of the best goalkeepers to have ever played the game. He was a member of Arsenal's 'Invincibles' side, which would play every game of that season.

The Germany international came to AC Milan after making over 300 appearances in all competitions for his boyhood club Schalke 04, before returning to Germany to play for Borussia Dortmund. In 2003, he joined Arsenal, where he quickly established himself as an important element of Arsene Wenger's system.

After leaving Arsenal in 2008, Lehmann played for Stuttgart before returning to the club for a brief period before retiring in 2011. He holds the record for most consecutive clean sheets in the Champions League, with the Gunners going 10 games without allowing a goal.


VICTOR VALDES

The brilliance of Xavi, Andres Iniesta, and Lionel Messi were highlighted during Barcelona's brilliant period under manager Pep Guardiola, but Victor Valdes was also an integral part of the team.

Despite making over 500 appearances for the club in all competitions since his debut in 2002, the Spain international often remained unnoticed. Valdes was a legendary goalkeeper for Barcelona, known for his quickness and concentration in front of the goal.

Following a major injury, he departed Barcelona in 2014. Before retiring in 2017, he played for Manchester United, Middlesbrough, and Standard Liege. He was named manager of Barcelona's Juvenil A team in 2019, but was fired three months later.
