I want to meet Pellegrini and Zaniolo This is how Fabio answered through eye pointer and vocal synthesizer to the question of what his last wish was Fabio Ridolfi a years-old Giallorossi fan who has been immobilized for years in his bed in Fermignano in the province of Pesaro Urbino due to a quadriplegia After a grueling battle for access to assisted suicide and bureaucratic obstacles Fabio chose the fastest solution deep and continuous sedation which will take him to the end of his life after a few days spent without nutrition and hydration The last wish for Fabio was to meet his fresh idols winners of the Conference League Lorenzo Pellegrini has responded to the appeal circulated on the net in the past few days and from the retreat of the national team with which he was preparing the match against England he recorded a video message to say goodbye to Fabio I&#39;ve heard about you and your desire I&#39;m in the national team and unfortunately I won&#39;t be able to pass in person but I really wanted to make this video to send you a big hello I send you a hug and a kiss A few hours later the response from Fabio Andrea&#39;s brother arrived Hi Lorenzo I wanted to thank you name of all my family and in particular of Fabio for the thought you had towards him You fulfilled one of his wishes and it was a huge gift for him As I told him a short while ago you are leaving as European Champion and this cup is makes it even more proud to support Rome Thank you from the bottom of my heart
