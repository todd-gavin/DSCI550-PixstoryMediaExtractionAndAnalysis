This magic bus is waiting for you just outside the Vishwavidyalaya metro station gate no. 3. Absolutely loved the experience of dining in this bus. The chefs, and the staff managing and serving the food are doing a commendable job.🥰

My personal recommendation is Pav bhaji and the Thali. Everything tasted super yumm. Grab your friends and visit this bus, you'll have a great time! At NORTH CAMPUS 🚌
