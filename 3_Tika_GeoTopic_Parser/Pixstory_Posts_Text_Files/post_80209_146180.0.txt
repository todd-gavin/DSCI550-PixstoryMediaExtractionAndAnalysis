Manifest- With so many people using the flowery word as part of their vocabulary and for achieving certain things. What do you think of the series? I honestly have mixed opinions and I have just watched season 1. It keeps you glued but prolonging the conclusion does shift your focus.
What are your views on the series and the process of manifestation? Do share!
