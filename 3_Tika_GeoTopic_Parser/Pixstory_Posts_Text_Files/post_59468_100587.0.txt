Hello everyone, myself Sanjh, and I’ll try to tell you a bit about myself, so let’s start with the one thing that everyone asks me when they first meet me: "What is the meaning of your name? and why did your parents choose this name?” 
Sanjh means “evening or the twilight time” which somehow just fits me perfectly and now why my parents... precisely my dad chose this name is something even I am not sure about. Every time I ask him this question he always says, “I just knew. I looked at you and I knew it .” So, now I’ve accepted the fact that it is what it is and there is no reason.

Other than sharing the meaning of my name, Science & Technology has always piqued my interest. I love to read or watch or listen to anything related to crime, mystery, and historical fiction. I love to write especially when I have so much on my mind and I don’t know what to do about it. I love making to-do lists and then checking them out. I love cakes, sweets, and chocolates so I learned to bake. I have a very messy taste in music that changes faster than my mood swings. Even though my family annoys me so much, I can’t imagine a life without them. And even though I’m clueless about my life, I’m grateful to be privileged enough to have this all.
