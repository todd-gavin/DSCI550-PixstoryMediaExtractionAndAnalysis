Settling an issue for a tech giant like Google would not be so tedious but what remains apparent is that the gender gap in pay has always existed. The picture is clear regarding the companies with set marks and names for them and even claims to have an egalitarian view. Women who have been working with the same amount of labour and work as men need an unbiased reward; they have been long tormented in fighting for equality, and the pay gap is just another manifestation of existing discrimination.

However, the developed countries claim that they have eradicated gender discrimination and inequality, but the stats reveal it differently.
A survey found that "Women working full time in the U.S. are still paid just 83 cents to every dollar earned by men — and the consequences of this gap affect women throughout their lives. The pay gap even follows women into retirement: As a result of lower lifetime earnings, they receive less in Social Security and pensions.  As a result, in terms of overall retirement income, women have only 70% of what men do."

The gender Pay Gap has maintained the stereotypes that pushed women toward working for jobs identified as women's work and pay less. Nevertheless, women have taken positions that were long dominated by the presence of men but still, they're paid less. So even if the job changes or matches men's, the discrimination exists; there won't be a pragmatic reason to answer it all.
It is hard for society and tech giants like Google to accept and realise that the pay is not decided by the gender but rather by the work and labour the person puts into doing something.
