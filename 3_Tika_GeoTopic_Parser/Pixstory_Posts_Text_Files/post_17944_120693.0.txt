Top 5 breastfeeding necessities! Today we are celebrating world breastfeeding week . Here are some products we found that'll make life much easier for a women.

1. Baby Buddha pump- This pump is tiny but packs a punch! It has several levels of suction for stimulation and suction mode. Be prepared for the long pull but it does a great job of emptying the breast quickly and efficiently! The best part- IT IS WIRELESS! That's right. No more being plugged in.

2. Breastfeeding pillow. A good breastfeeding pillow can be so helpful with positioning and help ensure you are helping baby get a good latch. If you are busy holding baby, you might not be able to position the breast the way you need to (i.e. sandwich). Also, as baby getting bigger, you shoulders and back will thank you.

3. Haakaa pump- This is a life savior for those times when you are very full but are trying to avoid pumping while your supply is regulation. You don't want to waste those precious ounces of liquid gold. A haakaa is a great way to catch the extra ounces.

4. Combination nursing and pumping bra- another huge time and effort saver. If you pump and nurse within the same day then you need one of these bras. If it such a hassle to switch bras. Recommending kindredbravely Sublime. Makes life so much easy.
