#3 Cuauhtémoc Blanco (Age: 37 years, 151 days)
Blanco was so influential for his country despite his age that he was called up for the 2010 FIFA World Cup at age 37. Cuauhtémoc Blanco's name meant "one who descended like an eagle," which is how his mind was formed. He was still their first-choice penalty taker, and it came in their most crucial game, a 2-0 win over France, when he converted the spot-kick. His goal made him the only Mexican player to score in three World Cups in a row.
#2 Gunnar Gren (Age: 37 years, 236 days)
Gunnar Gren being 37, had football at his feet. After winning the Olympic gold medal in 1948, Gren and Sweden were hoping to translate that performance in the 1958 World Cup. 
And Sweden made it to the finals, where they met Pele's Brazil; despite losing the match, Gunnar, then 37-year-old, had a goal in a penultimate 3-1 defeat to Germany. 
#1 Roger Milla (Age: 42 years, 39 days)
No country will call up a 42-year-old player for football's most important tournament at this time. But, back then, Africa's most outstanding player, Roger Mila, set a benchmark so high that no outfielder has ever broken it.
Mila featured in the 1994 World Cup in the United States but did not play in the majority of the games. However, when he got a chance, Milla did not fail to impress, scoring a goal against Russia in the group stage, breaking his record of being the oldest scorer in the competition he set four years before.
