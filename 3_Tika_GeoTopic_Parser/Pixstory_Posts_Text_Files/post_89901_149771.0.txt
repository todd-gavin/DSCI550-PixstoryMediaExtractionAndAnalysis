Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo continue to split opinion. Many footballing figures have taken turns over the years to say who is better between the duo, and former Spain manager Vicente del Bosque is one of them.
In 2018, the legendary tactician made his opinion known during a conversation with the official channel of A la Contra. Despite his association with Real Madrid, where he won two UEFA Champions League titles, the Spaniard snubbed Ronaldo as he declared Messi the best player in the world.
“This isn't about t-shirts or anything. As a player, I think Messi is the best," Vicente del Bosque said when asked to pick one between Messi, Ronaldo and PSG forward Neymar.
He continued "I feel bad saying it because I don't want to bother anyone, but I think Messi is a player for life, one of those we've known in the neighbourhood, the one who haggled over everyone, who was always the best of all and who everyone gave the ball to him. The ball always goes to Messi and that, when one in the neighborhood is the best, they give you all the balls."
The Spaniard highlighted Ronaldo's finishing and Neymar's dribbling skills, saying that it's a privilege to have players of those profiles. 
“(Cristiano) Ronaldo is a different style," the World Cup-winning manager continued. "He is not interested in midfield football, he is not interested in the development game. ... he is only interested in finishing and in that he is tremendous.
He continued "Neymar is a player who has something that is currently in disuse, which is dribbling. It is a privilege to have a footballer of those conditions”, he concluded.
