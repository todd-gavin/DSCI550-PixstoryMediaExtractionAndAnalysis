As I roamed around the district in the initial days, there was no routine which could be followed and as it often depended on the circumstances encountered enroute and the distance away from the headquarters, the days were quite tiring and often I could return only by late night or even in the very next morning in case of a night stay out. I was soon getting used to the schedule and so were the large number of visitors who upon my assurance that I could be contacted at any time if available in the headquarters, used to gather near my residence and wait till late, often even camping there for the night under the special waiting sheds, if I happened to stay out. I made it a point to meet all visitors at the first possible opportunity, be it any hour of the day and thus the SP Residence was almost being used like a police station with a constant flurry of new visitors. Visitors used to come to meet from long distances and if they did not find me available, they preferred to spend the night waiting in Bagaha rather than going back to their villages since travelling was not easy both due to bad roads as well as due to fear of the dasyus. In the initial days, I was staying alone as my wife could join me only towards the end of December, 2006 and soon left thereafter.
