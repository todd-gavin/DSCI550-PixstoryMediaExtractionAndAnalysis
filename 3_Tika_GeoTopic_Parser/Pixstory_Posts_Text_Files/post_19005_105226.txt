There are no more adjectives to describe Nadal The Spanish tennis player conquered his th Roland Garros by beating the young Casper Ruud in three sets who in fact never even bothered Nadal An impressive game that played by the Majorcan in this edition of the French tournament in in which he won more than all in which in all editions he lost only three matches and never any final Before the quarterfinal against Djokovic Nadal said it could have been the last meeting between the two at Roland Garros Many after this sentence and after having underlined how the foot problem is increasingly unbearable for him they believed that Nadal could have announced his retirement at the end of the Parisian awards ceremony But no I don&#39;t know what will happen in the future but I will continue to try and fight as long as I have the strength The doctor was here in these two weeks I play with an injection on the nerve my foot is put to sleep How many injections I have done Better I don&#39;t tell you The foot problem is not affecting his victories but physically difficult to bear For this reason Nadal had skipped the internationals d Italy In Rome it was impossible to manage On Wimbledon instead he said he will try to be there If my body will let me I will be there
