Xavi s appointment as Barcelona manager in November had been a long time coming Flailing finances and comical on pitch performances were the norm when Xavi was drafted in with the Blaugrana sitting th in La Liga It s fair to say the fans were skeptical initially having witnessed Andrea Pirlo and Frank Lampard legendary players but inexperienced managers fail to make a mark at their former clubs Xavi s impact at the Camp Nou so far tells a very different story Barca have picked up the second most points in La Liga since his appointment now sitting th in the table climbing places in one of the most competitive league tables in Europe in just months Under Xavi Barcelona have a distinct identity something that was lacking under his predecessor Ronald Koeman The Blaugrana s style of play is now centered around a high man to man press maintaining possession high up the pitch and positional rotation A formation with the aforementioned attributes is reminiscent of Barca s golden days under Guardiola and Enrique Xavi has a very settled group of players in his starting XI with only the forwards prone to rotation depending upon the opposition The winger midfielder and fullback constantly interchange positions on either side making it difficult for opposition defenders to man mark This opens up a lot of central space for strikers to exploit Barcelona have scored the most goals in La Liga from crosses or cutbacks New signings Torres Adama Traor and Aubameyang have been instrumental in turning the Blaugrana s fortunes They have been rotated with existing attackers Gavi Demb l and Luuk de Jong This combination of various attributes have often bamboozled opponents and kept them on the back foot for long periods in games Frenkie de Jong s new role as an advanced playmaker operating between the opposition s lines has added to the fluidity of Barca s attack It s still early days for Xavi and the ongoing glory might just be a purple patch But with Xavi restoring a distinct team identity on the pitch and Joan Laporta slogging to alleviate financial troubles off it the fans can dream about a return to the glory days soon
