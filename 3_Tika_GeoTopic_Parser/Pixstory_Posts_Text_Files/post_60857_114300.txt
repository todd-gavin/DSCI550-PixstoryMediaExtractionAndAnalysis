I m not too fond of chocolate but I can t deny the soft spot I have for chocolate tarts It s the slight saltiness of the tart that I particulary enjoy I usually can make my own tarts but I didn t have the time today So I went out and had the tarts I was missing so much in honour of chocolate day With simple ingredients like double cream sugar milk and dark chocolate you can make chocolate tarts If you re a fan of chocolate or tarts do try out the following recipe Boil double cream with sugar and a pinch of salt Remove once boiled Add dark chocolate chunks and butter to the boiled mixture and whisk until everything has melted Add some cold milk till you get the desired consistency Put the mixture into tart shells lots of recipes to make this one is there too Even out the mixture and let the tarts cool down for a few hours before you enjoy them I have tried this recipe and the results are almost always perfect I don t like eggs in my tart so this version works really well for my taste buds But there are numerous recipes that contain eggs as well I hope all the chocolate lovers get to have their favourite chocolate treats today
