Premier league: Arsenal took on Liverpool in the Emirates Stadium on October 9. League leader Arsenal made it eight wins from their nine games after a 3-2 victory over Liverpool. 
Liverpool would be looking to make a comeback as they are suffering their poorest start to a season among these years. Jurgen Klopp's team is heading into Sunday's meeting their forthcoming opponents who are 11 points ahead of them. They just took two points from the first three games. 
The game started off by a kick off from Liverpool with an early goal by Arsenal. The goal came in just 58 seconds, scored by Gabriel Martinelli. Gabriel gave the home side an early lead with his fabulous finish. 
The hosts looked assured in the first half when in the 34th minute Liverpool scored their first goal and equalised the scoreboard. Darwin Nunez scored his second league goal of the season. 
Though Liverpool managed to equalise the score, Arsenal still found its way to take a lead in the first half. Martinelli on the ball takes it past Henderson and Arnold to pass it across the goal to Saka who calmly deposited it in the net. 
The lead wasn't there for long as just after the halftime in the 53rd minute Roberto Firmino found his space and wastes no second to take the shot into the goal for an equaliser. Scores level for 2-2. 
Luck favoured Arsenal this game as they got a penalty in a crucial stage of the game. In the 76th minute Arsenal was awarded a penalty as Thiago kicked through the back of Jesus's leg. Bukayo Sala takes the penalty and again gives his team a lead.  
The referee blew the final whistle with the scoreboard showing 3-2 and Arsenal registered their 8th win this season out of their nine games so far. Liverpool were trying to get their winning days glory back but Arsenal's performance shadowed them as they have to wait for their next game to change the fortune.
