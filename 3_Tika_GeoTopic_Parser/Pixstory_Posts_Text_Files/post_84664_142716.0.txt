I live in a village situated in Uttar Pradesh .There are many issues present in my villages but main issue is about electricity supply which is atrocious and which gives birth to many other problems like in irrigation, study of children and many other.
What I want to change is installation of street ligth which operates on solar energy.
Increase in time for which electricity is given by government in rural areas.
Installtion atleast one solar operated power house.
