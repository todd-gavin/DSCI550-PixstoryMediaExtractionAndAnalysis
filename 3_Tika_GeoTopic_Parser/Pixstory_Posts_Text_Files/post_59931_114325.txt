Although a little let down I m fine A great film Though I gave this movie a positive review there were still many aspects of it that I didn t enjoy It is not on the same level as Thor Ragnarok in my opinion The villain is without a doubt one of the best characters in the MCU but he ought to have been more scary and disturbing like in the comic Additionally He is also dangerous and the film s picture of his origin backstory was clever but not as compelling as it was in the comics Also the scenario shown in the film is not dreadful and explains Gorr s hatred Positives Gorr The Godbutcher He always seemed too dark scary and middle of the action in any scene he was in Additionally as we all desired and as one can understand him The action parts are very fantastic VFX were fantastic as usual In comedic films we laughed aloud Jane and Thor get along well and the Mighty Thor comics are more accurate It successfully completes Thor s journey The movie occasionally gets dark and serious for about of the runtime which is the same as a bad point but it happens which supports the villain and what the storyline should have been Nagatives The central character played by Christian Bale has less screen time than he should and his image in the storyline fails to have the proper effect on the audience The storyline should ve been far more powerful dark and terrible Disney made it such that we could not witness violence They should have shown Gorr killing at least gods as brutally as one could conceive just like in the comics since we only watched one god get destroyed and a brief ten second sequence where gods had previously been killed in Godbutcher Its conclusion would have been much better but on the plus side it was engaging and has lot of humour Despite the fact that the storyline is very different they could have made more use of the characters and brought three Thors Ratings for entertainment For a Marvel fan
