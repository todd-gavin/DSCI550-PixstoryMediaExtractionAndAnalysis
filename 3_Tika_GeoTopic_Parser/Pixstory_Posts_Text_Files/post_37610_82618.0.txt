Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant have been released by the Indian team management for the third and final Twenty20 International against West Indies. The match will be played at Eden Gardens on Sunday

The decision to release the former captain and current vice-captain have been taken by the team management and Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as there are sufficient number of players in the squad and the series has been clinched. India lead the three-match series 2-0.

The development also is a clear indication that Kohli and Pant, who play all three formats, will be given rest for the three-match Twenty20 series against Sri Lanka that starts in Lucknow in a few days.

The decision is on the expected lines because accomplished players Shreyas Iyer and Shardul Thakur and promising batsmen like Ruturaj Gaikwad and Deepak Hooda are in the bench waiting for opportunities. 

Kohli has been playing non stop for quite some time, including in the away series against South Africa. Rishab Pant was also released because Ishan Kishan can also fill in for the wicket keeper and it will free up a space for another youngster waiting on the bench 

For the record, in the 18-member squad that was picked for the Twenty20 series, Iyer, Thakur, Gaikwad, Hooda, Mohd. Siraj, Avesh Khan, Deepak Hooda and Kuldeep Yadav have warmed the benches in the first two games. 

It is believed Ruturaj Gaikwad might finally get his much deserved debut with the international team which might also be a confidence boost for the player ahead of the new IPL season.
