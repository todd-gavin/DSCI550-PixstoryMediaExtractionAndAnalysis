Newcastle United's new shirt pays homage to the club's 130-year history. Newcastle have
officially unveiled their 2022/23 home jersey, amidst talk of a Saudi-themed away kit. The design
is kept as simple as possible, with Newcastle's black and white stripes serving as the only
distinguishing characteristic.

The new Castore-designed outfit also signals a departure from last season's perplexing "4"
symbol, which was made by combining the white placket with the blue Fun88 sponsor's logo.

The only change to the kit is the inclusion of light blue details. A modest 130 years motif has
been added to the lower back, in addition to the Castore emblem on the chest, to help the Magpies commemorate an important occasion.

A vicious knock to the mouth appeared to have done some serious damage to the Magpies'
man, but he's made a full recovery. Callum Wilson has provided an update on his tooth loss
during Newcastle's Premier League win against Arsenal on Monday, stating that "panic is past"
now that the issue has been resolved.

During a 2-0 win over the Gunners, the attacker was seen receiving medical attention for what
appeared to be his front tooth dangling loosely from his gums. His smile, on the other hand, has
been quickly restored, with the England forward taking to social media to demonstrate that he is
in good spirits.

Wilson appeared to be missing a tooth that had been knocked loose in the front of his mouth,
according to footage shot at the game. The injury appeared to be more serious than a simple
cosmetic patch.
