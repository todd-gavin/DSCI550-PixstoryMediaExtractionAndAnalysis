Libya and Bostwana are set to kick off Group J of the AFCON group qualifiers at the Martyrs of February Stadium on Wednesday.

Libya come into the qualifiers with a strong showing in friendlies, having won two out of the 3 friendlies that took place. However they lost in their last outing, falling to a 2-0 defeat to Mauritania. Libya were suffering a poor run of form before these 3 friendlies, winless in the last five.

Bostwana come to the qualifiers with not a lot of hopes, suffering a woeful run of form of 1 victory in their last six outings. Bostwana head into Wednesday's game off the back of yet another disappointing campaign in the COSAFA Cup crashing out in the group stages after picking up four points from five games.

Libya vs Bostwana: Probable Playing XI

Libya: Mohamed Nashnush (GK), Sanad Al Warfali, Ali Salama, Ahmed El Trbi, Ali Youssef, Salah Fakroun, Mohammed Al Tuhami, Mouad Eissa, Noor Aldeen Al Qulaib, Hamdou Elhouni, Mohamed Zaabia

Bostwana: Kabelo Dambe (GK), Thatayaone Ditlhokwe, Simisani Mathumo, Mosha Gaolaolwe, Tendai Kesekile, Gape Gaogangwe, Kutlwelo Mpolokang, Thatayaone Kgamanyane, Kobamelo Kebaikanye, Kabelo Seakanyeng, Tumisang Orebonye

Libya vs Bostwana: Predictions

The two teams have faced each other three times in the past, with Libya winning two of them and one match ending up in a draw.

Libya should prove to be too strong for Bostwana, who have appeared vibrant and full of flair. However, Libya still remain favourites and enjoy home advantage as well.

Prediction: Libya 2-1 Bostwana
