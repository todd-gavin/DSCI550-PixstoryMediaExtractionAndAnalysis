Environmental Educator Isaias Hernandez uses colorful graphics, illustrations, and videos to advance discourse around the climate crisis through their environmental jusice project Queer Brown Vegan.

QueerBrownVegan offers an easy-to-navigate introduction to climate change basics – from dissecting carbon footprint to climate doomism – “a scare tactic to disempower collectivized communities on their journey for environmental liberation.”

Hernandez grew up in a community facing environmental injustices in Los Angeles, California, also known as Tongva Land. Witnessing how pollution affected their body while in affordable housing, Hernandez translated their anger and sadness through environmental justice.

“When we think about environmentalism we often try to separate nature and people, when in reality people coexist in nature… indigenous communities and Black people of color globally have been tending the Earth for so long. They have been creating regenerative circular practices that have allowed them to coexist together in a sustainable manner. So I would say when looking at the intersection between how BIPOCs, environmentalism, and queerness intersect is understanding that BIPOCs in the United States have faced the highest rates of environmental burdens. Most black, indigenous, and brown individuals and families live near toxic facilities,” Hernandez told Flaunt.
