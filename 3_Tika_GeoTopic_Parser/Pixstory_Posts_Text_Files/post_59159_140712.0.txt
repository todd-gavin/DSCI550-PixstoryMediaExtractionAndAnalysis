Sonali Phogat, a leader of the BJP from Haryana 
who first rose to fame as a TikTok star and Big Boss reality show contestant, had partied at the restaurant hours before her death last month.

The demolition of parts of Curlies Restaurant at Anjuna Beach in Goa, which was in news after the death of BJP leader Sonali Phogat last month, resumed on Friday afternoon following a brief halt due to a Supreme Court order.

The top court earlier in the day stayed the demolition, so the action was halted for a few hours, but the order was limited to only the part of the restaurant standing on a particular survey number, said a senior official of the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA).

The GCZMA in 2016 ordered action against the restaurant as parts of it stood on No Development Zone in violation of Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms which govern construction activity in coastal areas.
