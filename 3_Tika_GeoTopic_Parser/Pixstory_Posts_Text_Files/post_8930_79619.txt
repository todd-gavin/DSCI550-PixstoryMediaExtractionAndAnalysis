As a kid I wasn t found of maize bread and alway made a face when my grandma would offer me some I love corn but not in the form of bread and didn t understand why would someone make bread out of maize Back then my little head didn t understand the why maize flat bread but now I absolutely love to eat it especially when warm and with fresh milk
