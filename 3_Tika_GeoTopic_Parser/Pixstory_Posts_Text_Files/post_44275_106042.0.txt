On Thursday, June 9th, the UEFA Nations League begins with another round of fixtures, with
Sweden taking on Serbia. Both sides have been inconsistent in recent months and will need to
improve in this match.

Serbia is in second position in their Nations League group after a 4-1 win against Slovenia last
week. They will be confident going into the match against Sweden.

Sweden, on the other hand, is now third in the group and will need to improve their performance. In their previous match, they were defeated 2-1 by Norway, and they will try to
bounce back this week.

Sweden vs Serbia: Probable Playing XI

Sweden: Robin Olsen; Emil Krafth, Carl Starfelt, Joakim Nilsson, Ludwig Augustinsson; Emil
Forsberg, Jesper Karlstrom, Kristoffer Olsson; Dejan Kulusevski, Alexander Isak, Viktor
Claesson

Serbia : Vanja Milinkovic-Savic; Nikola Milenkovic, Milos Veljkovic, Strahinja Pavlovic; Nemanja
Radonjic, Nemanja Maksimovic, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, Filip Kostic; Dusan Tadic, Andrija
Zivkovic, Aleksandar Mitrovic

Sweden vs Serbia: Prediction

Both teams will be aiming for victory when Norway hosts Slovenia, who might perhaps pull
ahead at the top of Group 4. This could make for a more open encounter than expected.

With both Dusan Vlahovic and Zlatan Ibrahimovic absent, others will get an opportunity to shine,
and Serbia still has the firepower to grab at least a point from what is on paper their toughest
opponent.

Prediction: Sweden 2-2 Serbia
