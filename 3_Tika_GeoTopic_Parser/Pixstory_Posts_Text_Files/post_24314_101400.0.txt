Australia goes to the polls on May 21 to elect 151 members to its House of Representatives and about half in the Senate. The elections take place just as the four-member Quad grouping will meet in Tokyo for its second meeting with US President Joe Biden.

Of the 151 seats in the House of Representatives, the winning party will need to win at least 76 seats to form a government.
