The bad accidents of past seasons will be a thing of the past. The Red Bull Ring, the Spielberg circuit which hosts the MotoGP and Formula Austrian GPs, is changing precisely to host the two-wheeled World Championship with a new chicane which has been inserted in the long straight which leads to the riders darting uphill towards the hill From the next edition of the Austrian GP therefore there will be a new fast esse to break the straight into two parts, also lowering top speeds in favor of safety Nothing will change for the four wheels however the F will continue to use the classic layout already seen in recent years Instagram photo redbullring
