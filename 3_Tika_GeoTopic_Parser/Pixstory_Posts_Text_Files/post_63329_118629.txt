Targeting the thyroid alone is rarely helpful longterm when trying to manage hypothyroid That s because many people are experiencing conversion issues T is not converting to T auto immunity and or mineral imbalances that are driving their condition T converts to T mainly in the liver and the gut So if you ve got liver congestion and or underlying gut infections dysbiosis leaky gut and you re only targeting the thyroid replacing thyroid hormone in the body you re doing little to support the bigger picture If you have an imbalance between calcium and potassium replacing thyroid hormone won t do much good When potassium is low thyroid hormone is poorly utilized and when bio unavailable calcium is high thyroid hormone has a hard time actually getting into the cell Think of this like a wall of calcium surrounding your cell Your blood panel for your thyroid markers may come back normal but it doesn t mean anything if you have too much calcium is preventing the use of those thyroid hormones When we can do a deep dive into intracellular mineral status we re able to build a solid foundation that translates into more energy higher libido better stress response quality sleep better mental health and improved thyroid activity No guesswork involved Source lifeasjenn
