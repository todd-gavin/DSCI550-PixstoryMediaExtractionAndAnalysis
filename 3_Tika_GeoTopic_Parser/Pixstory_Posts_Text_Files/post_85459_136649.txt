My preview of the Manchester United game This fixture used to be the first game I d look for when the fixtures come out around years ago now both clubs have been on the decline however they both look to have turned a corner Manchester United after a shaky start under new manager Eric Ten Haag have managed wins on the bounce away from home and of course the big one against Liverpool Arsenal on the other hand have had a perfect start wins from and looking like they haven t come out of rd gear the whole time However injuries to some key players have left fans worried we re short in key areas and this is interesting with this being dubbed arsenals first real test The form of Gabriel Jesus has been exciting he looks like he can score from any chance he gets works hard to create he s own chances as well as putting them on a plate for others and he s my key man for this game I think if we re going to make the trip to old Trafford and win he s going to have to have a good game Another man I think will be key is degaard the Norwegian has started this season in fine form putting in real captains performances for the young man who s just taken the reins as captain He picked up a knock against villa midweek and seeing him in the starting will fill me with confidence United have looked more sturdy since Maguire dropped out of the team and I m sure they ll be looking to stay tight again against Arsenal who haven t failed to score yet this season A win here for United would put them right back up where they want to be however I m going to have to side with a Arsenal win We have looked excellent this season and with every game I feel like we re always going to score Arsenal Let me know what team you d start for this game in the comments UP THE ARSENAL
