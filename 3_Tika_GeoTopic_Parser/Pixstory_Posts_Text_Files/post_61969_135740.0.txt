Louis Tomlinson surprised fans on Wednesday morning (Aug. 31) when he announced that his second studio album, Faith In the Future, is set to arrive Nov. 11 — but that’s not all he had up his sleeves.
The star followed up by revealing that the album’s first single, “Bigger Than Me,” will be arriving on Thursday (Sept. 1) at 6 a.m. ET/3 a.m. PT. “This one is for all of you!” he wrote alongside a short snippet of the song’s guitar-driven, acoustic instrumental.
Faith In the Future will mark Tomlinson’s second album released as a solo artist, and follows his 2020 debut Walls. That record peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard 200, and No. 4 on the Official U.K. Albums Chart. Tomlinson just wrapped up his world tour in support of Walls, performing in front of audiences everywhere from the U.S., the U.K. and Europe to Australia.
