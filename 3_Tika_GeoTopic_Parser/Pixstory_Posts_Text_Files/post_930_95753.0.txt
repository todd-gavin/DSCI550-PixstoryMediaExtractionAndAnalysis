Sri Lanka, Pakistan and now Nepal. 
Is it only a problem of dwindling forex? 

Nepal, the tiny country wedged between India and China has  been forced to restrict its imports of luxury items including gold, cars and cosmetics after foreign exchange reserves fell by more than 16 per cent over the seven months to the middle of February.

Since then stories of economic hardsjops are manifold. 
What is clear is that China has become the world’s biggest creditor nation, exerting control over low- and middle-income nations in a stranglehold of dealings, even as they are offered up as a means of help and support. Economists are concerned that the conditions around these loans are rather secretive and lack transparency.
