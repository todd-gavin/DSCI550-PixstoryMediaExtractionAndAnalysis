Thinking About Workout Exercise Sit ups and Squats are the exercises which comes in my mind Earlier when I was a Kid I thought that these exercises are same But Noo I was totally Wrong As soon as I grew up i got to know the difference between I want to share with you all the difference i got to know Sit ups and Squats are two different types of exercises Their primary function it work out the muscles to make them lean and strong The forms of the two exercises differ significantly Sit ups I start them By lying on the floor keeping my knees bent and the arms across the chest or hands behind the head Without moving the hips or legs attempt to sit up and then lie back down Repeat The Sit ups are primarily used for abdominal endurance training as they strengthen core and abdominal muscles Squats I Start them by standing upright legs spaced out with or without weights The arms can be kept on the sides raised in front of the body or behind the head Now I slowly dip down to the floor and Slowly rise back up and repeat Squats primarily trains the muscles of thigh hips and Hamstrings It also Helps in Strengthen bones and ligaments Well among the Squats are My fav As Squats Target almost my entire Lower back It depends upon you body There is no magic Number you can do it as much as You want What your Saturday Workout Tell me In notes
