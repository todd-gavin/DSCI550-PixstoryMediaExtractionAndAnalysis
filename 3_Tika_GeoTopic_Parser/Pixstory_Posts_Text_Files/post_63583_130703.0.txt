An occult horror, and the spiritual successor to the Maid of Sker, Sker Ritual is a round based first person shooter developed and published by Wales Interactive. Releasing on PC, PS4 and PS5 in the first quarter of 2023. Recently we got a new trailer of the game where we meet some of the horrifying enemies who we need to gun down in order to survive, some of whom include the Mariner, Banshee, Phantom and Blazesliner.
Sker Ritual will unfold on the island of Sker, where players will fight solo, or in the company of three more people and will aim to survive the attacks of the Quiet People and their stronger neighbors, the Elites who are basically mini-bosses.
Sker Island has recruited new Elites, each with unique abilities that will force you to constantly change your playstyle in order to adapt to the different enemies. The game will constantly change your location, or enlist the help of your teammates. Old foes aren't the only ones cursing the lands of Sker, there are many more new faces, some of whom are literally without faces and all of them are out to get you.
Players can protect themselves with weapons and ammunition, which can be found at the Laughing Policeman's booth at various locations on the maps. The goal with this is to reach a higher base level and gain the weapon ranks with unique upgrades like the Super Charger for bonus buffs or visible steam-punk inspired improvements.
