Australian limited overs captain Aaron Finch made the decision to retire from the one-day international (ODI) format of the game months before the 2023 Cricket World Cup. 

Well, Australian ODI cricket will surely miss him. He was, and still is, one of a kind player that this country has had!

Mint reported that on Sunday in Cairns against New Zealand, Finch will compete in his 146th and final ODI. Next month, the squad will defend their World Championship crown under his continued leadership. 

“It has been a fantastic ride with some incredible memories. I have been extremely fortunate to be a part of some brilliant one-day sides. Equally, I have been blessed by all those I have played with and the many people behind the scenes. I thank all of those who have helped and supported my journey to this point," Finch said in a statement.

Finch had a dismal ODI record, with 5 of his previous 12 innings ending in ducks, including 2 in Crain's. He only managed to score 27 runs in his last 7 innings. 

The ODI World Cup 2023 is set to take place in India the following year, therefore the retirement also coincided with that. Finch was looking forward to that World Cup, but in order to try to retain his title as World T20 winners, he will now let someone else lead the team in that format.

Let’s see what happens next!
