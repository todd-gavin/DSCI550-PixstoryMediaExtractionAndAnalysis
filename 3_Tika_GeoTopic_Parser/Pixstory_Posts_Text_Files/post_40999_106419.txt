quid Game star Jung Ho yeon is surprisingly fond of one of the most gut wrenching scenes in the show Variety reported that the actress who portrayed Kang Sae byeok in the Netflix smash hit was thrilled when it came time for her to film her character s gruesome death scene Maybe it s weird to say it but while I m shooting my death scene I was so happy Ho yeon told Sandra Oh during their Variety Actors on Actors conversation It was the most comfortable scene I ever had The sequence which sees the doomed prisoner fight to survive but ultimately succumb to her wounds proved to be a relief for the star It meant getting to let go of the tortured character s pain and allowing her to find peace It s because I ve been living with my character over a few months and then there is a time that I have to let her go and I kind of feel like I can happily let her go because I can understand Ho yeon said Maybe not fully but I m the one who can understand her most in this world so I know her stress and I know how her life was such a struggle and hard So it wasn t that bad or sad
