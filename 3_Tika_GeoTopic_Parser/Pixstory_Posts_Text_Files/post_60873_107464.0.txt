Recently, I had some great peach iced tea at a restaurant and wanted to recreate the refreshing cool drink to beat the summer heat.

It can be a bit difficult to find fresh peaches. You can get readymade syrup from the store if you want. But if you do find some peaches, then make a syrup out of it by boiling them with sugar and lemon. I did not use too much sugar for the syrup because I wanted to bring out the natural sweetness of the peaches.

Next, you can boil any kind of tea (black or white tea would work just fine) and make sure it doesn't get too bitter. Strain out the tea with the peach syrup, mix and refrigerate it.

After a few hours assemble the drink in a glass by putting in peach slices (not necessary), and some mint leaves. Also, don't forget the ice cubes.

It's a very easy recipe and you can store the syrup you made for at least a week or so (in a glass container). Who said lemonde needs to be the only summer drink?
