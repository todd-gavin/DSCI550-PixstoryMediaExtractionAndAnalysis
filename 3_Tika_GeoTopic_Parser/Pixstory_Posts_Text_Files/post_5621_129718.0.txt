When you awaken to the lovely sound of rain and cozy weather, it's just the ideal way to start your weekend. 🌧🫶

I’m sucker for rains, so i had to go for a drive to enjoy this perfect weather. 😌 ☔️ 

drank my all-time favourite drink, which is iced coffee. I can't function without it; it's my go-to beverage every day. 🥤🍨🫠 

How are you spending your weekend today? 😌☔️🌧
