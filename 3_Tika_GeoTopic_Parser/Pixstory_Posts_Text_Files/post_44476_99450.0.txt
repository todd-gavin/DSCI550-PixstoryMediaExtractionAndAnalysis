Before their current Premier League game against Newcastle, the Premier League winners
wore the distinctive strip for the first time.

Manchester City have unveiled a new training uniform inspired by Sergio Aguero, in honor of
the Argentinian striker's title-clinching goal against QPR in 2012.

At the end of the 2011-12 season, Aguero produced one of the most memorable goals in
Premier League history, scoring a stoppage-time winner for City to cap a spectacular comeback.

The strike helped Manchester United win their first title, and the club has now revealed a special
shirt honoring the Argentine, whose ten-year tenure at the club came to an end last summer.

The new City training kit has a white foundation with horizontal stripes of the club's trademark
light blue and gold embellishments around the logo. The light blue also has images of Sergio
Aguero's famous goal.

Man City have teamed up with Puma to create a limited-edition 93:20 pre-match shirt, as well as
special-edition football boots with the same color scheme as the striker's versus QPR.

Pep Guardiola's team wore the kit for the first time during their 5-0 Premier League victory
against Newcastle on Sunday, celebrating the ten-year anniversary of the goal in style.

The 93:20 gear will be available to the general public at Puma shops and online.

Aguero scored 260 goals for City between 2011 and 2021, becoming the club's all-time leading
scorer, and then joined Barcelona on a free transfer after his final contract expired.

The 33-year-old was forced to retire early due to a heart ailment in December, but he fondly
remembers his time in Manchester and was affected by their recent homage.

For me, this is a tremendous honor. After the introduction of the new training shirt, Aguero
remarked, "I had many wonderful years with Manchester City, but the 93:20 goal was unique."

The excitement in the stadium, the comeback, the titleâ€”I've never experienced anything like it.
