Bridgeton 1 was all about the brooding Duke, Season 2 seems much more relatable(although Simon is missed). May be because the main lead is an Indian and a family is far from being royalty. The Sharmas seem like an average middle class Indian family, father a clerk, the older sister looking for her younger sister, taking care of her, even putting oil in her hair. 
Both sisters have a mind of their own and unlike many others in this period drama, the aim of life of older Miss Sharma is not just to get a rich man for marriage. She is strong, educated, talented, makes her own opinions- has no qualms being a spinster and managing an independent life. So it’s all about loving the Sharmas. 
But than comes the love story, a bit of a fairy tale, a bit of Pride and prejudice. Like the Jane Austen’s heroine, the older Miss Sharma wants more from a husband than being mere provided for (even for her sister she wants to make sure she marries for love). She finds the male lead arrogant and snobbish and the initial lack of mistrust is mutual. She is not the focus of everyone attention, her younger more amiable sister is-very Jane Austen. 
Than the love story unfolds -getting drawn to an unlikable character, the growing tension ( sexual and otherwise) between the Viscount and her. The encounters between the two leads are interesting with good dialogues. 
While the storyline is fine except  when there is too much focus on other side characters. My only problem, however was the female lead. 
Played by stunning Simone Ashley, who has a striking face (makeup didn’t do justice). She is tall with perfect features, especially her sparkling bright doe eyes. I however wish she wasn’t as stiff as she appears in certain parts. Has a beautiful voice but in parts it lacked emotions necessary for conveying feelings. Even her expressions felt short at times. 
I loved the series in parts and have entirely different take than what the critics have said. 
Tell me if u agree or disagree.
