During the hearings on Thursday night (July 21) at the Cannon House Office Building in Washington, D.C., a man dubbed "Clark Kent" was seen sitting behind witnesses Matthew Pottinger and Sarah Matthews.

Matthew Pottinger, a former member of the National Security Council, and Sarah Matthews, a former Deputy White House Press Secretary, both testified at the hearings.

Unfortunately for all the fans of the mystery man, we've learned some information that may upset you.

Journalist Yashar Ali did not reveal the man's identity, but he did reveal that he is straight and in a relationship.

"The attractive man sitting behind Pottinger is not married. That's all I have to say and all you need to know!" Ali used Twitter.

Ali responded to Andy Cohen's thirst tweet with, "He's straight and in a relationship."

Many people believe that the man sitting directly behind Sarah Matthews is her boyfriend. Many people are comparing the man's appearance to Superman's real-life alter-ego Clark Kent, and some are joking that he's there to cover the hearings for Superman.
