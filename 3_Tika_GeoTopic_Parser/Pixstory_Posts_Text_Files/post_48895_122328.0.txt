Rape jokes are never appropriate, regardless of the routine or delivery. They denigrate rape. The clue should be obvious if the punch line involves laughing at someone being sexually assaulted. It is abhorrent to make a living out of jokes about VAWG, especially as a man. It's absurd how many men are supporting this jerk. Jokes about rape are dangerous because they normalise the practise and make it extremely dangerous for women.

"Look at the context," they say. What makes it relevant to suggest that he would rape and kill a woman for fun? Was he soliciting a group of men for a cheap chortle as usual, or was he offering a lengthy analysis of the toxic masculinity's existential crisis?

Rape should not exist in any culture and by default rape jokes should not exist, much less be okay. Unfortunately, rapes do exist which makes it even worse to make such jokes. It's not only insensitive and tone deaf but also a display of privilege and ignorance. Rape jokes adds to rape culture. They normalize the existing of rapes. Rapes are not supposed to be normal, men need to stop trying to normalize them. Why do men think it's okay to invalidate thousands of victims of rape like that?

And honestly, I am very curious, why do they find it funny? What makes it funny for them? Why is the topic of sexual abuse funny to you? What do you share common with the mentality of those who commit it?
