Recently i had the opportunity to visit Kuala Lumpur I was surprised to see that the city is FULL of skyscrapers Whichever way you turn your head you WILL have to crane your neck to see the top of the buildings The city of Kuala Lumpur has over completed high rise buildings of which over are buildings standing taller than ft are buildings over ft are buildings over ft and are buildings over ft One of the most remarkable one will have to be the Petronas Twin Towers They re storeyed skyscrapers looming at the height of ft and the world s tallest twin towers These towers are also visible from many places throughout the city and if you end up staying in a hotel with room at one of the higher floors nbsp like i did you may even be able to see it from your balcony The towers are open to the tourists after paying entry fee and the view from the top is breathtaking Do go there is you ever have a chance
