Giuseppe Bergomi (CB)
The one club player who gave his all when he made his Inter debut. He also had the most Inter appearances before being surpassed by Zanetti. He was their longest-serving captain and was nicknamed "Lo zio" ("the uncle") because of his prominent brows and mustache when he was younger.
He retired in 1999, having set the record for most UEFA Super Cup appearances, and was named the greatest footballer in March.
Franco Baresi (CB)
Milan's defensive heart, a dreadful defender whom many strikers feared when they came across him, his defensive discipline saw Milan concede very handful of goals in the matches. His ability to repel attackers and read the ball well distinguished him as a standout performer in Milan history.
During his 20-year tenure at the Rossoneri, he stayed with the club rain or shine, winning six Scudetti and three Champions Leagues.
Paolo Maldini (LB)
Words cannot express his love and passion for football. With his tenacity and determination, a player who never received a yellow card in his playing career became one of Milan's greatest players. Maldini was not your average defender; his demeanor was too potent for the forwards to overcome.
Having played 901 games for Milan, Maldini also contributed in forward line, bagging 33 goals and 43 assist. 
He began his career as a right-back but later switched positions as his speed deteriorated as he aged. Maldini won 26 trophies during his 25-year career at Milan and held the record for most Champions League appearances until Iker Casillas trumped him. In 1994 and 2003, he finished third in the Ballon d'Or standings.
