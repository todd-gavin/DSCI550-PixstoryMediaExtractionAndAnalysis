What learning means to us This question is maybe asked first time to you Why Cause In India we have a rot culture of education We are told to memorise everything getting taught sometimes even without grasping the meaning But when this will be going to stop Our government is taking various steps to do so for example Bringing NEP National education policy But that can t change anything until and unless we are willing to change our mindset is ready for the change Here s something we can do Start asking questions always get something better Find reason Just know why you are studying this this will increase your interest for sure Interaction interaction can be a step raised by teacher for better learning More we interact more we learn Change methods All of us a actually bored of the method currently being used so we can focus on changing method to make learning fun Application based study Remember how we all love science experiment but only few like the theory class This is what we need to do apply all the knowledge and see how you ll love learning Concept understanding Instead of rot leaning we need to understand the concept the happiness after understanding can t be matched with feeling after gaining marks Here s all from my side today hope your learning would be fun Thank you reading patiently Pic credit
