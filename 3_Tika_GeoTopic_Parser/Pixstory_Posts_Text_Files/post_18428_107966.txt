Marcell Jacobs remained a spectator at yesterday&#39;s Diamond League He is recovering but the desire to return to racing is stronger than ever as is the goal of the World Cup A month to go World championships arrive and I want everything Exactly in a month I&#39;ll be back on track in Eugene ha said at the end of the sports evening The World Championships are almost here where Jacobs will have all eyes on him To get to the best he should skip all the next appointments even if it is not excluded that he can compete officially at least once again perhaps at the Assoluti di Rieti of June
