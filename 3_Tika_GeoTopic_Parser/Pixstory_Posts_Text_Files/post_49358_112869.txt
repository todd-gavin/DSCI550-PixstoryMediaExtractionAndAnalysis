I adore Taylor because of her music and lyrics and many of her lyrics really speak to me on a personal level But she also creates the impression that she is someone you just can t be like while penning songs that millions of people can connect to She s kind of like an icon You wanna be her but you also are her She puts into words what we experience every day yet struggle to express She s a remarkable joyous rarity in my opinion who manages to mix making her own music with still having a captivating stage persona But it was the songwriting that made me fall in love with her music Each line serves a purpose and she makes numerous subtle references to add in that extra touch of character It is lovely and profound Her songs almost always tell a story Taylor Swift has a penchant for wanting to tell stories generally the tragic ones And I think that s something people fail to notice She brings out your own emotions in words you never knew existed I can never talk enough about Taylor Swift the artist the poet and the storyteller
