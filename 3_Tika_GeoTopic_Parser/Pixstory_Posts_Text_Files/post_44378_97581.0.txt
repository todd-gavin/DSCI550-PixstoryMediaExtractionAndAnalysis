John Terry is Chelsea's most successful captain, having won 16 major awards during his time in 
charge at Stamford Bridge. However, he had a low-key debut. Terry would have to wait another three months for his first Chelsea start after appearing as a substitute in a League Cup triumph over Aston Villa in 1998.

With rumours swirling that Terry would be returning to Chelsea as a coach, we've looked at the starting lineup from his debut appearance â€” a 2-0 win against Oldham in the FA Cup third 
round in January 1999.

Let us take a look at the players who played alongside Terry in his debut match for Chelsea and where are they now?

Ed de Goey

De Goey was a valuable asset as a trustworthy pair of hands between 1997 and 2000, despite 
being supplanted by Carlo Cudicini and spending his final three years at Stamford Bridge on the periphery. De Goey joined with Stoke City after being released at the end of the 2002-03 season. He spent the rest of his career with the Championship club.

In 2007, he joined QPR as a goalkeeping coach, but his contract was cancelled by the slightly 
insane Briatore regime. According to the most recent information on De Goey, he is the 
goalkeeping coach of VOC Rotterdam, a fifth-tier club in his home Netherlands.

Michael Duberry

Duberry rose through the Chelsea ranks, but was battling against World Cup-winning defenders Marcel Desailly and Frank Lebouef for a starting spot at center-back.

He came to Leeds in the summer of 1999 in search of regular play, and shone in the club's run to the Champions League semi-finals in 2001. After relegation three years later, the centre-back continued with Leeds and went on to play for Stoke and Reading until retiring in 2013.

Duberry founded Made Leaders, a mentoring, coaching, and leadership firm, after retiring as a player. He has also dabbled in the realm of poker.
