Nuclear fusion reactions in the sun are the source of heat and light we receive on Earth These reactions release a massive amount of cosmic radiation including x rays and gamma rays and charged particles that can be harmful for any living organisms Life on Earth has been protected thanks to a magnetic field that forces charged particles to bounce from pole to pole as well as an atmosphere that filters harmful radiation During space travel however it is a different situation To find out what happens in a cell when travelling in outer space scientists are sending baker s yeast to the moon as part of NASA s Artemis mission Cosmic damageCosmic radiation can damage cell DNA significantly increasing human risk of neurodegenerative disorders and fatal diseases like cancer Because the International Space Station ISS is located in one of two of Earth s Van Allen radiation belts which provides a safe zone astronauts are not exposed too much Astronauts in the ISS experience microgravity however which is another stress that can dramatically change cell physiology As NASA is planning to send astronauts to the moon and later on to Mars these environmental stresses become more challenging The most common strategy to protect astronauts from the negative effects of cosmic rays is to physically shield them using state of the art materials Lessons from hibernationSeveral studies show that hibernators are more resistant to high doses of radiation and some scholars have suggested the use of synthetic or induced torpor during space missions to protect astronauts Another way to protect life from cosmic rays is studying extremophiles organisms that can remarkably tolerate environmental stresses Tardigrades for instance are micro animals that have shown an astonishing resistance to a number of stresses including harmful radiation This unusual sturdiness stems from a class of proteins known as tardigrade specific proteins Under the supervision of molecular biologist Corey Nislow I use baker s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study cosmic DNA damage stress Read more
