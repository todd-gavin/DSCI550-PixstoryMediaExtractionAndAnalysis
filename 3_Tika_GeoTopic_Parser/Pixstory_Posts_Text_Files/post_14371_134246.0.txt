After four failed attempts with Argentina in finals, Leo Messi lifted the Copa America after a 1-0 win over Brazil at the Maracana stadium on July 11, 2021.

As a fan who has watched Leo since his early days in FC Barcelona colors and then later with the Albiceleste, it was a different sort of joy and a dream come true to see him lift a trophy with the national team for the first time. 

Often criticised for not having won any major trophies with the South American country, Leo Messi commented on the victory by saying 'I have peace of mind of having achieved the dream that has been denied to me so many times.’

‘It was like a dream, a spectacular moment. I couldn't believe it had happened. I enjoy watching the images now more than at the time as I was in a daze. I didn't quite understand what was happening,’ added Leo Messi. 

The seven-time Ballon d'Or winner was voted the player of the tournament after contributing four goals and five assists in the competition.

This surely is one of the iconic moments in the history of football. The next challenge is the World Cup later this year. Imagine Argentina and Leo Messi lifting the trophy.
