4 - Liverpool

While Jurgen Klopp’s well-oiled Liverpool may be pushing Manchester City for the Premier League honours they will eventually need to add some sort of creativity in their attacking line. 

Moreover, with Divock Origi headed for free-agency, signing Dybala would only add more fire-power to Liverpool’s attacking arsenal. 

5 - Barcelona

In recent times, the Blaugrana have done some mean business and it wouldn’t be surprising if the Catalans show interest in Paulo Dybala once his time at Juventus is up. 

He could offer Barca the kind of creativity that Leo Messi once offered, and with the latter now having left for PSG, his Argentine compatriot could well excel in a free-roaming role.
