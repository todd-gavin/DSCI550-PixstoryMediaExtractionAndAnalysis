Hi! This is my first post on Pixstory, and I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce myself!
 I'm Tanishqa and I love to crochet! Most people associate crochet with grandmas on rocking chairs, but lately I've seen the younger generation get into this amazing craft and come up with the most wonderful things! 
My preferred form of crochet is 'Amigurumi' which is Japanese for 'knitting or crocheting small yarn creatures'. Amigurumi makes for the cutest toys or showpieces, and it really lives up your space. Another reason I enjoy this particular form is because it's quick and typically only takes a few hours to complete, depending on the size of the project. 
Here's a picture of a cup of hot chocolate and a cream cookie I made with crochet!
