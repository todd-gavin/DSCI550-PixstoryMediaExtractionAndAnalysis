 I spend too much time thinking about Who I m supposed to be I play by everybody s rules That don t seem right to me I m cool and polite on the outside When I get the chance I run and I hide If your eyes are closed It s hard to see What if I back down now Cause I m afraid of what might happen What I they turn away When I show them who I truly am What if I lose my breath When I throw those big doors Or tonight just tonight What if I shine Should I even care They re all sitting there And everyone s staring at me If I step out in the spotlight Maybe I ll be set free I ve always thought Barbie movie songs are always so empowering This one standa out to me I remember listening to it when I was in a difficult moment afraid to make a decision and ever since then it has been one of my favorite songs It just hits everytime I listen to it There are other barbie songs as well that are very close to my heart
