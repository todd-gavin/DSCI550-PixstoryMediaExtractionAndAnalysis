I have been fed up with the hate and too much misinformation that Twitter spread without any regulation I mean you can disagree but yes use your words carefully That s when I found Pixstory Pixstory indeed helps a lot in spreading so much information Moreover this challenge option is so perfect way to challenge It gives a very healthy environment to disagree and to react Each time I open Pixstory I get a lot of positive energy Numerous debates on various topics and even on many topics that are relevant and never given full attention It s a joy to sit and read differing opinions as well as to react and support many posts Moreover the red on the notes that never fades is always a motivation for all the good comments that never fade away The positivity the app generates is so much So many inspirational and real life stories each day would help people share their stories openly and discuss various issues and contents I mean what a Mental Health friendly app it is
