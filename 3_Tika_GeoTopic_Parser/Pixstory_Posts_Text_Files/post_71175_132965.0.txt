Zarger, the first female café owner in Kashmir, co-founded Me 'n' U Café in Srinagar. She admitted to studying law but never practising it in an interview with SheThePeople.TV since she had always preferred to follow an entrepreneurial path. Her passion for cuisine inspired her to create a restaurant. Since she was a little child, she had to endure many hardships. For instance, when she was just six years old, her father passed away from cancer. She also discussed how individuals tried to discourage her from starting a business by telling her that, as a girl, she was unsuited to do so. However, Zarger ignored them and concentrated all of her efforts on achieving her objective. 

“There are so many girls here who have such big dreams and they have the capability to fulfill them. So, if I fulfill my dream and show them that it is a possibility, then it instils a faith in them to take a step forward towards their dreams as well.” – Zarger
