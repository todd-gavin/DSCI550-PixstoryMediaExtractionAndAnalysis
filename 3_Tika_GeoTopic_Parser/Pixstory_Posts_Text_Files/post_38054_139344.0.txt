Chelsea Sack Thomas Tuchel! 
The Blues on Wednesday confirmed that they have parted ways with head coach Thomas Tuchel. Chelsea FC announced through their social media sites following the Champions League loss to Dinamo Zagreb. 
The London-based club announced on social media that the decision was taken by the new ownership group. It was also stated that Todd Boehly and co. feel that this is the right time to begin the transition and hence they have gone ahead with the decision. 
Chelsea have not started the 2022/23 season in the best of form. The Blues have won just 3 out of their 6 Premier League games. The 1-0 loss to Dinamo Zagreb in the UEFA Champions League was the final straw. 
As per Chelsea Football Club, the Club's staff will take over until the next manager is appointed. There is no news yet as to who could be next in line to take over the club. 
No matter what, Thomas Tuchel's time with Chelsea would be remembered dearly by the fans. The German manager led the club to their second UEFA Champions League title. He also helped them with the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup last season.
It has to be seen what comes next for the club and the manager.
