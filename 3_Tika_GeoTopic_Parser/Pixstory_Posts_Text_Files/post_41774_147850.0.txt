Novak Djokovic is still awaiting word on whether he will be allowed to return to the Australian Open in January after missing the tournament this year because he is not vaccinated against COVID-19, as reported by IE.“It’s really not in my hands right now,” Djokovic said on Thursday at the Laver Cup.“So I’m hoping I will get some positive news.” Djokovic is a 21-time Grand Slam singles champion — a total that stands second among men, behind only Rafael Nadal’s 22 and one ahead of Roger Federer’s 20 — and he has won a record nine of those trophies at Melbourne Park.But after a 10-day legal battle that ended with his visa being revoked, he was deported from Australia last January. Initially, he had received a waiver from stringent vaccination requirements from two medical panels and Tennis Australia in order to compete in the Australian Open. Since July 6, entering tourists are no longer required to show proof of COVID-19 vaccines or even to produce a COVID test result that is negative, according to a change in Australia's border regulations.
