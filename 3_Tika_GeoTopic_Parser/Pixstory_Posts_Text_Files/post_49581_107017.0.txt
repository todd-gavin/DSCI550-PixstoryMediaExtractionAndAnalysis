Seems like there's never a no-drama time when it comes to out 'beloved' Former President Donald Jr Trump. In its second hearing Monday, the House select committee examining the Jan. 6, 2021 insurgency claimed that the Capitol attack was a direct result of Donald Trump's repeated unfounded claims that the 2020 presidential election was rigged.

Not only did he make those claims but he also knew very well that the claims were false because he'd been told many times to stop because Joe Biden had won the elections fairly.

Bill Stepien, Trump's campaign manager, told the committee that Trump's sides had split into two camps: "Team Crazy" and "Team Normal," and that he was pleased to be on the latter. Trump, on the other hand, was increasingly listening primarily to allies who promoted election-related conspiracy theories.

“I was somewhat demoralized because I thought, boy … he has become detached from reality if he really believes this stuff,” former Trump attorney general William P. Barr said, according to video testimony the committee played Monday, according to The Washington Post. “When I went into this and would tell them how crazy some of these allegations were, there was never an indication of interest in what the actual facts were.”
