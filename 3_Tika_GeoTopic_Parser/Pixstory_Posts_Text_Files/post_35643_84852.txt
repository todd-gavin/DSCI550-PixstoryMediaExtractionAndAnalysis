The blue swimmer and Olympian of the meters Gregorio Paltrinieri spoke about his Ukrainian friend Romanchuk who remained in his homeland despite the war, an absurd situation Paltrinieri made his debut I am hearing from him every day He lives in the suburbs of Kiev and yesterday he told me he was moving because the alarm had sounded even in his area The surprising thing is that I told him many times that if he wanted to come here to Italy I would have hosted him without problems Instead he preferred to stay there He says he wants to fight to the end He has a strong patriotic sense and wants to fight for your country I understand what you are experiencing
