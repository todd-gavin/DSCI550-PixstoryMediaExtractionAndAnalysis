We spend three days bedding down early in time with nature s clock getting up at the crack of dawn to catch the sunrise the most peaceful sight the first rays of the sun casting a glow on the peaks while the deep valley is still in inky darkness We tramp around the fields startling pheasants into flight do a day trek to the spur on other side of the village feeling a bit like mountain goats minus the finesse as we traverse narrow ledges at times Go down the spine of the spur beyond the camp along a stone wall Mountain people can give mountain goats a run for their money with their agility at times which divides two village lands collect suspicious looking herbs Which turn out to be fantastically aromatic but sadly nothing more read soak in the view The peaks dominate the panoramic setting each one Nanda Devi Nanda Kot seem right there they are Unless you are actually climbing up to them We have a run of the camp as it is still early on in the season In the evening sit around the bonfire with warming drinks totally disconnected by now from the world as there is no electricity in the camp so no phones No portable chargers That would be cheating No wonder when it is time to head back to the world below from this suspended idyll the trek to the vehicle seems to get over too fast the sounds of the phone coming back to life is cold comfort Fact File Camp Shaama is run by Wildrift Adventures Concluded
