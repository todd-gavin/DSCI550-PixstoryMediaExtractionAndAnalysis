Vijay Deverakonda and Puri Jagannadh s highly anticipated movie Liger which was released worldwide yesterday with huge expectations has managed to pull off an impressive start at the worldwide box office on day Liger has grossed crores on its opening day worldwide in all languages Given the ever increasing fan following of Vijay Deverakonda the film has taken a thunderous start It s huge attainment that the movie was released on a weekday to gross a massive crores on the first day This includes the film s overall collection from all across the world in all languages Liger released in Hindi Telugu Tamil Malayalam and Kannada The film s domestic collection stands at Rs crore The film has raked in Rs crores in the Telugu states but the much hyped Hindi version has opened at a dismal Rs crore The Hindi figures are rather disappointing because the makers of Liger went on many city tours to build excitement around the film which has somehow not translated into numbers Liger saw huge occupancies for the first and second shows as well As per trade analysts the bookings are good for today as well The four days long weekend and then the Ganesh Chaturthi holiday Wednesday is going to help the movie mint massive collections in its first week Since there s no big competition for Liger this week there will be no stopping the movie Liger has amassed over half a million dollars in overseas and this is a big start in the region Hitting the million in the first weekend would be a cakewalk for the mass action entertainer Despite the negative reviews Liger took a grand opening at the box office However the negative word of mouth had a direct impact at the box office from the afternoon shows The boycott trend around the film emerged last week after Vijay spoke in favour of Aamir Khan s Laal Singh Chaddha The film registered a grand opening but eventually slowed down due to negative word of mouth
