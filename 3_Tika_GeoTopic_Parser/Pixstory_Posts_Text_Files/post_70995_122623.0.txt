The ambiance was good 
Beautiful Hanging Lights, Quick Service and Staff but the manager was quite rude , Ambience was Super Cool, Sanitised Service, Affordable and the food was quite ok in taste they need to improve their pizza but the pasta, fries, cold coffee were good in taste . I love the dim-sumsðŸ¥Ÿ the taste was so good .
