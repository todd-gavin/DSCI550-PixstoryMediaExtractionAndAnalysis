Liverpool legend Ian Rush has told in a news conference Mohamed Salah is the best 
the player in the world at the moment and that the Reds forward is only going to get better. 

Rush was speaking as Salah picked up his second Football Writers Association Footballer of the year award on Thursday night and said that the Egypt international’s form has been unrivalled this season. 
“He’s absolutely incredible to watch.” Rush told William Hill. “The last two or three years he just got better and better. It’s no surprise to see him win the FWA award, he deserves it. He has this thing where he wants to improve all the time, he keeps himself incredibly fit and the way he conducts himself is amazingly well.” 

Rush who scored 346 goals in 660 games for Liverpool, believes Salah would have slotted straight into his legendary Reds team in the 1980s. 

With the quadruple still a possibility for Liverpool, Rush is excited about the end of the season, though he remains wary of Real Madrid ahead of the Champions League final. 

Rush added, “It’s going to be a very tough game. When you look at Real Madrid, they have been down at so many games- PSG, Chelsea and Manchester City. They are a team that never gives up on anything. I think there will be goals in it. But if we go 2-0 or 3-0, don’t take things for granted, as we have seen what Real Madrid can do. They are the comeback kings.” 

Rush commented on Liverpool’s Premier League season, “ They have been very very strong.” Klopp has performed magnificently. He was given time as well, not only to put his geet under the table but also to put his stamp on the football club.”
