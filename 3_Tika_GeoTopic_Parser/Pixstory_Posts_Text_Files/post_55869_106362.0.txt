The congressional Jan. 6 committee held its first prime-time hearing about the attack on the Capitol and the events leading up to it. What do we pick up for this? 

‌First and foremost the committee holds Trump responsible for the attack.“President Trump summoned the mob, assembled the mob and lit the flame of this attack.” That is the top Republican on the committee, Vice-Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) promptly laying the blame for the turmoil on Donald Trump.

“When a president fails to take the steps necessary to preserve our union or worse causes a constitutional crisis,” she said, “we’re at a moment of maximum danger for our republic.

She also said that the committee will also present the evidence that Trump made not even a single effort to call any of the security agencies during the attack. 

The committee said it will demonstrate evidence that the president “refused for hours to do what his staff, his family and many of his other advisers begged him to do, immediately instruct his supporters to stand down and evacuate the Capitol.” He also yelled at advisers who told him to act, the panel said.

Most importantly, the committee said that he cheered on the protesters’ most brutal tendencies. Cheney said, “Aware of the rioters chanting to ‘hang Mike Pence,’ the president responded with this sentiment ‘Maybe our supporters have the right idea. [Mike Pence] deserves it.’”
