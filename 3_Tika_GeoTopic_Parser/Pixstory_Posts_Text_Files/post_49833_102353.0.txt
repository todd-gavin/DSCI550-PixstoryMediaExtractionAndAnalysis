‌According to newly released FBI data, there were 61 “active shooter” incidents in the United States in 2021. Last year’s attack spread across 30 states, leaving 103 people dead and 140 wounded.

In 2020, the department counted 40 active-shooter attacks in 19 states that killed 38 people and bruised 126. That year coincided with the height of regulations on social and financial life due to the coronavirus pandemic. The FBI had recorded 31 such incidents in 2017, and 30 in both 2018 and 2019.

What exactly is an active shooter? It refers to rs someone engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a public space in a seemingly random fashion. About one in five “active shooter” incidents in 2021 were also mass killings.

The incidents counted in the FBI report included the killing of 10 by a gunman at the Kings Soopers Grocery Store in Boulder, Colorado, in March 2021; an attack on three spas in Atlanta, Georgia, that same month that killed eight; and an attack on a FedEx facility in Indianapolis, Indiana in April of that year that also killed eight.

The attackers ranged from 12 to 67 years old and were primarily male, with only one incident involving a female shooter.


Excluded from the data were also gang or drug-related shootings, incidents interpreted strictly as domestic disputes, isolated hostage situations or crossfire from other criminal acts, the FBI said.


This year too we have no lack of gun violence cases as we hear about them almost every day. Gun violence is how America is being remembered now. The deaths become a shock for many and then it is often forgotten and people continue to handle guns without care. Gun control is necessary for all states in the US so that we might not lose one more life.
