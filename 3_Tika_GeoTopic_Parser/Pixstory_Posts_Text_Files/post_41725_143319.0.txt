The playing uniform for the Australian men's cricket team has been released in time for the T20 World Cup, which will begin on October 16 in Australia. Cricket Australia posted a picture of the team's uniform on their Twitter account on Wednesday. Wion reported that the outfit was developed by Aunty Fiona Clarke and Courtney Hagen in collaboration with Asics; the two have previously worked together on other Australian indigenous garments. For the first time at a World Cup match, the hosts will wear a jersey with indigenous design elements. An Australian cricket team will participate in a significant event for the first time ever wearing a playing uniform honouring the First Nations. The shirt is surrounded by artwork and has a green and gold gradient on the trunk and black sleeves.The brims of the black cap and black pants will feature the colours of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags, and the sleeves of the long-sleeved shirt will have artwork in gold and green.The front of the jersey is once again dominated by the Walkabout Wickets artwork, which has become a recurring motif in previous iterations. The creator of Walkabout Wickets is Clarke, a Kirrae Whurrong woman and the great, great granddaughter of James "Mosquito" Couzens, a player for the Aboriginal XI in a famous game at the MCG in 1866 and a member of the first Australian sports team to play abroad in England in 1868.How do you think it looks?
