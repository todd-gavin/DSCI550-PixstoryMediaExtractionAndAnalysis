Timothee Chalamet had all of Venice seeing red on Friday night at the world premiere of “Bones and All.” The actor donned a sparkling backless jumpsuit in a blood-red shade — a cheeky wink to the drama’s central protagonists, two cannibals in love.
The film, which reunites Chalamet with his “Call Me By Your Name” director Luca Guadagnino, lives up to its title with gory attacks and scenes that involve limb-chewing and eating. But despite the uncomfortable subject matter, the audience at the Venice premiere for the movie devoured “Bones and All.” The film received a 8.5-minute standing ovation, the longest and most enthusiastic of the festival so far. (It handily beat the previous record holder “Tar,” a drama starring Cate Blanchett as a tortured composer, which had a 6-minute ovation.)
It marks a reunion for the director and actor Timothée Chalamet, who was nominated for an Oscar for "Call Me by Your Name". The two worked on their first collaboration on "Suspiria". The Italian director wiped tears from his eyes as he welcomed the cast and crew into the Sala Grande.
“The second I read it, I said, I think only Timothee can play this role,” Guadagnino said in an interview last year. “He’s fantastic, a great performer and to see him soaring the way he is doing now, I feel proud of him. And this character is something very new for him, both endearing and heartbreaking.”
Guadagnino has had a rich history with the Venice Film Festival. His directorial debut “The Protagonists” debuted at the 1999 festival. His films “I Am Love,” “A Bigger Splash” and “Suspiria” also world premiered at Venice.
MGM is releasing “Bones and All” in theaters on Nov. 23
