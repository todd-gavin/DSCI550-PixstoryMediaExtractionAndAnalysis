After her father passed away while she was on holiday in Kenya in 1952, Queen Elizabeth was crowned the British monarch there. The biggest British Massacre in Africa happened only six months later.
An African freedom fighting organisation called the Mau Mau Rebellion that was active in Kenya in the 1950s. Its main objectives were the overthrow of British control and the expulsion of European settlers from the nation.
The British repressed Kenyans who rose up, and that was called the Mau Mau Massacre. Many thousands of Africans were murdered. The number of people slain during the rebellion is a hotly debated topic. Officially, 11,000 Mau Mau and other insurgents were murdered, including 1,090 convicts who were executed by hanging by the British government. However, according to the locals, there were more than 30,000 or even 40,000 Kenyans who fell martyr to their struggle in the same massacre.
The Queen remained mum on this barbarism. The British have a history of genocides against several indigenous communities. She was definitely not the great Monarch the British claimed she was.
