Premier league has always had amazing title races, some very iconic moments where the teams have fought their way into the ultimate title. But there is another race worth watching out for, the race for the top four spot, they get their entry into Europe, into the much-loved Champions league. 

This year, the race for the top four is hotter than ever, during the beginning of the season, several teams which were not even in consideration for a spot are now favourites to get it and other big names are falling down to the surface. While the race for the title has finally come alive with Liverpool breathing fire in every game and City having a major slip up against Tottenham. Liverpool are 3 points away from City and if a miracle occurs and City drop points against Crystal Palace then it is well and truly on. But the title race remains within the confines of these two. Klopp or Pep, we will find out soon enough. 

We come to the top four race, where it is fire in veins of every team right now, West Ham, Arsenal, Manchester United and Spurs are neck to neck in this fight, it is heating up. As we look back onto the form of the teams, we see pretty much equal chances for all four teams to outdo the others and make it to top four. If Chelsea finish their season and no further financial crisis hit them, I am sure that Tuchel will “Drive their seven-seater to the third spot”. 

Now, as we talk about chances, for me I believe that Manchester United are on their way to what would prove to be a title winning fourth spot considering the horrendous season that they have had, with Sancho in form and defence looking less horrifying with Maguire finally finding the bench or being dropped, the chances are high. 

As for the others, many experts have said that Arsenal, even though are in hot form might bundle their top four spot. Whatever follows us, it is going to be a hell of a race.
