After two seasons and matches played, Pepe Reina greeted Lazio and its fans with a message on social networks. It was a pleasure to defend these colors and enter the history of Lazio, always looking on and off the field to honor the shirt. I leave great comrades, friends and thank you all from my heart Thank you very much The Spaniard who will turn 10 at the end of August is about to return to Villareal the team he played with from to Reina just landed in Spain commented on his return I am excited like a child I hope to be able to sign soon years ago I had hair and there were no children now everything has changed but I still have high expectations I want to start as soon as possible
