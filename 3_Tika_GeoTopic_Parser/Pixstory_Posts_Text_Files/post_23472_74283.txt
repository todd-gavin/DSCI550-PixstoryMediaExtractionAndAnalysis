Zipping on a fantastic road through the teak forest with the odd Flame of the Forest adding that dash of colour from Jhansi towards Hidden Orchha we have had a latish start so I don t get to see the famed chhatris or cenotaphs either at sunset as originally planned or at sunrise oh well God proposes and lazy man disposes If India has its own standard time which has a certain time lag it seems Madhya Pradesh is in a time lapse mode Ah That explains the time warp feeling Picnic Breakfast with a View We head straight for the park on the bank of the Betwa opposite the chhatris It is deserted and we put our packed breakfast picked up from a shop on the main thoroughfare on a bench close to the waters We soak in the sight of the ethereal chhatris by the ghats on the Betwa their ephemeral reflections bathing in the river the clouds behind in retreat A huge kingfisher breaks the silence of the cool morning as we sit down to sip our tea and help ourselves to the hot jalebis and pohas We spy massive vultures nesting on the slender spires of the chhatris their colouring making them seem like living extensions of the carvings Wildlife Discovers Us Then pandemonium ensues Two langurs decide to join us for breakfast To be fair they are polite at first sitting in companionable silence with the husband as he wolfs his poha The cousin and I jump around as she has had a run in with a boorish one as a child and isn t too keen to renew the acquaintance Just then three four more lope in to make it a party I put my plate down on the bench and back off as I get dirty looks from one and then they proceed to sit there and dine on our breakfast technically theirs now as we stand at a safe distance and wring our empty hands The cousin s husband the hungrier and smarter one has already had round one of breakfast at the shop itself There is nothing left to do but to wait and clean up after them To be continued Pictures by Mandvi
