Salman Khan's last few films like Radhe: The Most Wanted Bhai, Antim: The Final Truth and more have not performed really well at the box office. ❌❌🎬

Salman khan fans are now expecting something bigger and better. 🔥🔥

There is a lot of anticipation around his Tiger 3 which also stars Katrina Kaif. Apart from that, his film Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan is almost making headlines. 🎬🔥

The film was earlier named Kabhi Eid Kabhi Diwali and it underwent a title change in order to avoid hurting any sentiments. ✅💗

But will this film be a hit⁉️


As per a report in Etimes, 

Numerologist Sanjay Jumaani has predicted that the title Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan is the most ideal among the other chosen ones like Kabhi Eid Kabhi Diwali and Bhaijaan. He says that he is the most convinced with this title as it adds up to number 37. The number is considered auspicious as it indicates good fortune in terms of health, wealth and happiness. He says, "It is associated with the Sun, which stands for recognition and leadership. Lakhs of people worship the Sun, one can expect recognition for what they deserve with this number." The title Kabhi Eid Kabhi Diwali added up to number 48. It could provide inconsistent results. The astrologer stated that Bhaijaan was a tricky one as it could have been fortunate provided it is not associated with other single numbers of four and eight. 👍🏻👍🏻
