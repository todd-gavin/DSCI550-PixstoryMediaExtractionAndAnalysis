The urban fantasy follows seven tiger hunters, referred to as the “CHAKHO,” who come together to hunt these tigers (Beom) who are mystical in nature.

1. RM as Do Geon
Do Geon: a crime expert skilled in weaponry who was so used to being independent, he was reluctant to join a team like CHAKHO.

2. Jin as Hwan
Hwan: the “Hawkeye” of the group after his family was killed by Beom, and makes it his mission to hunt them down.

3. Suga as Cein
Cein: nearly eaten alive by a Beom, survives and is strengthened by the other members’ friendship.

4. J-Hope as Hosu
Hosu: kidnapped by Beom, and while trying to survive the den, might’ve gone to extreme lengths.

5. Jimin as Haru
Haru (cue “Just One Day”): a rock that guarded the gate to the Beom’s world turned human to join the CHAKHO.

6. V as Joo An
Joo An: falls in love with a Beom and will show a story of forbidden love, much like that of Romeo & Juliet.

7. Jungkook as Zeha
Zeha: a Beom and human hybrid, something he finds out while fighting a Beom.
