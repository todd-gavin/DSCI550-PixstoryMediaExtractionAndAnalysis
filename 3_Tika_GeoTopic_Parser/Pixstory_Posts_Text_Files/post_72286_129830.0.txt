Manchester City have been the best team in the Premier League for quite some time now. Ever since Pep Guardiola joined the club back in 2016, he has completely transformed the club and it's players for good and he turned Manchester City into one of the most successful Premier League clubs of this decade. 

Man City have already won 4 Premier League titles under his guidance and if they are currently on a hat-trick. If Guardiola and his men are able to win the Premier League this season as well, they will join their city rivals Manchester United as the only two teams to have won a hat-trick of Premier Leagues. Manchester United did it twice under Sir Alex Ferguson. 

To be honest, Man City have a good chance of winning the Premier League 2022-23 as well and in this article, we shall be discussing 3 reasons why Manchester City can win the title this season. 

3. Insane Squad depth

Manchester City spend a crazy amount of money on their transfers in every single window and this transfer window has been no different. Opposition fans often complain that City waste money by signing players that they don't actually need. Their €100 M signing Jack Grealish is a big example of the same. 

However, what they fail to understand is that these transfers increase Man City's depth and that is exactly what a team needs to win difficult leagues like the Premier League.

2. Pep Guardiola's tactics

Although it is true that Pep Guardiola is often criticized for overcomplicating his tactics, there's no denying that he is perhaps the most able tactician of all times in the game of football. 

He is particularly a genius in winning league titles and his strategy and tactics will probably be enough to lead Manchester City to their third Premier League title in the last three years.
