When it comes to asking others to do something for you, or give you something, a distinction between demand and request is made in nonviolent communication. Begging is maybe a variation of demand. 
Request targets the spacious giving hearts of others, while demand resorts to triggering fear of punishment in others to make them do something. Begining taps into the feelings of sympathy and sometimes guilt in others to make them do something. Both can be classified as violence, or less conscious acts of meeting needs. 
Begging is a form of fraud as it uses unreal and false information to make people give. It can be addictive personally, settled in human mind as an strategy for feeding the craving for having more, regardlless of human real needs. It is  a  residue of highly stratified societies in human relations, where  poorer people used tricks to avail themselves a little bit of things the wealthier and more prestigious had. 
Those addicted to begging have difficulty to grasp, the joy of free and joyfull giving. Begging blocks the pathway connecting human hearts, instead it builds a seudo feeling of fulfillment and social prestige for the giver, and belittling satisfaction for the receiver. 
When you give and want it to meet needs without harming, make sure to connect and know the needs first, and make clear how your needs are met by giving, otherwise, giving creates destructive institutions and norms, and kills self-steems of individuals and nations.
