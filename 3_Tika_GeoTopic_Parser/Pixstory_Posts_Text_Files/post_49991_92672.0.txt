A Stranger came to the door at eve,
  And he spoke the bridegroom fair.
He bore a green-white stick in his hand,
 And, for all burden, care.

He asked with the eyes more than the lips
     For a shelter for the night,
And he turned and looked at the road afar
    Without a window light.
The bridegroom came forth into the porch
     With, ‘Let us look at the sky,
And question what of the night to be,
      Stranger, you and I.’
The woodbine leaves littered the yard,
   The woodbine berries were blue,
Autumn, yes, winter was in the wind;
   ‘Stranger, I wish I knew.’

Within, the bride in the dusk alone
    Bent over the open fire,
Her face rose-red with the glowing coal
   And the thought of the heart’s desire.
The bridegroom looked at the weary road,
   Yet saw but her within,
And wished her heart in a case of gold
  And pinned with a silver pin.


The bridegroom thought it little to give
    A dole of bread, a purse,
A heartfelt prayer for the poor of God,
   Or for the rich a curse;
But whether or not a man was asked
   To mar the love of two
By harboring woe in the bridal house,
   The bridegroom wished he knew.

Robert Frost's poems mostly represented rural life and its dilemmas. His poems are mostly in a Wordsworthian fashion. He brings in everyday subject matters through his poem analysing the existential crisis of an individual. This poem too portrays a similar conflict. The conflict between new found love and empathy towards a fellow being. The night the stories regarding the unsafety setting in offer make the protagonist reject the man who asked for a shelter. The poem also shows powerful imagery to justify the desire of the protagonist 'heart in a case of gold, pinned with a silver pin'. This possessiveness and passion made the protagonist turn his head on the stranger and dive into a social and philosophical dilemma.
