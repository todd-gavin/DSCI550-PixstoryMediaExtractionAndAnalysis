Considered to be a conservative player in the media and entertainment industry, Disney has surprised everyone with its aggressive bid on Day-1 of e-auction for IPL media rights. 

The way the India broadcast and digital rights are playing out, it is evident that the global content giant has locked horns with its former employee Uday Shankar who is leading the bid for Reliance-backed Viacom18. 

BestMediaInfo.com on Friday reported that Star, which built Hotstar riding on the IPL wave, is said to be set to put up a strong fight for digital rights this time. 

“With Walt Disney Chairman, International Content and Operations, Rebecca Campbell camping in India, the broadcast and digital player is again in the limelight as a strong contender,” the report said.

While the bid amount for digital rights has almost touched Rs 20,000 crore versus Rs 23,000 crore for the broadcast rights, the per match combined cost stands at Rs 105 crore. 

The bid for TV went up to Rs 57 crore per game from its base price of Rs 49 crore and India digital rights witnessed an unbelievable growth from its Rs 33 crore to Rs 48 crore per game.

The e-auction will resume on Monday.

Considering the auction for both the rights is still continuing, Disney does not seem to step back.

K Madhavan, President, The Walt Disney Company India and Star India, had earlier hinted that Disney will bid aggressively till the time it makes business sense for them. 

However, Campbell’s camping for the IPL media rights auction is a clear hint that the global entertainment conglomerate will not leave any stone unturned to defend the rights. 

If Disney blinks, not only Rs 5,500 crore (current revenue from IPL) will be wiped out from its annual revenues but the entertainment leader will also have to re-draw its plans for India market.
