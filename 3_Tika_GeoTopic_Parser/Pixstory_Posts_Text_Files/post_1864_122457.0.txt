"Girls in the Windows" taken by Ormond Gigli  on New York’s East 58th Street in 1960 is one of the most beloved pictures in photographic history. It achieves what a great fashion photograph has the potential to do. It effortlessly and gracefully merges the worlds of fashion and fantasy to create a photograph that transcends time and captures the imagination of collectors with its freshness, spontaneity, and uniqueness.

Gigli had received a notice that the building was due to be demolished. He hadn’t the money to pay for professional models – or an access to a budget for a picture that had no sponsorship. So, he contacted the foreman of the building and convinced him to clear a 2 hour period of time for him to work – and clear out the window jams. He reached out to a modeling agency that he had worked for, and asked for models to volunteer to be in his ‘dream’ picture. They were to wear what they wanted and show up over the lunch hour.

Since the building had been gutted of electricity and gas – there was a gaping hole on the sidewalk. So, unafraid to ask a favour, he contacted the city and asked for permission for the Rolls Royce to be parked on the sidewalk for the time necessary to set up the picture. He then placed the models, including his wife, trying to loosely coordinate their outfits into the 30 windows. Some were bold enough to stand on the window jam and some were framed by window. With three additional models – 2 on the street and one on the ground floor the picture was complete.

Ormond is cantilevered out on the fire escape of his studio – shooting with a wide angled lens. Here was a chance to realize his dream. In his desire of breathe to life and energy into a building that would soon be gone, he created a picture that 60 years later is as vibrant and original as it was when it appeared behind the ground glass of his camera lens.

The building was knocked down the next day.
