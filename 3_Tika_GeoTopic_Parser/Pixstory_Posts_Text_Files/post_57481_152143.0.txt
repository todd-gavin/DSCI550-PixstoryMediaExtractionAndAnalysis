I have savoured reading and writing all my life.
It's like therapy to me, a kind of detachment from the world.
I believe in profound reading, which can only be achieved through paper books.
Deep reading makes an emotional connection with books and the physicality of books; in other words, person-to-object relation adds more genuineness to the characters and stories.
Readers of print books absorb and remember more of the plot than e-books do. In an earlier study, print readers scored higher in other areas, such as empathy, immersion in the book, and understanding of the narrative. Scientists believe this effect is related to the tactile sensation of holding a book in your hands.
In other words, seeing and feeling how much progress you’ve made in the story, by the waxing and waning pages on either side of the book, can help readers feel like they’re unfolding the story—both literally and figuratively. Plus, with a print book, it’s easier to go back and confirm information you may be unsure of without losing your place and having to scroll or click back on your mobile device or tablet.
