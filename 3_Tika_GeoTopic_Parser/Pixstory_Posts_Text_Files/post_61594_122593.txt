There were rumors and reports going around early in the day today that WWE had considered bringing Karrion Kross back into the fold With Triple H now running creative it only made sense to think that perhaps one of his golden boys in NXT would get another shot on the main roster now that Vince McMahon who used him horrendously during his initial run on Monday Night Raw last year is out of the picture Kross made his return on this week s episode of Friday Night SmackDown and he s immediately getting in on the main event action While Drew McIntyre was confronting The Bloodline and seemingly about to brawl with Roman Reigns and The Usos he was stopped short by an entrance that looked oddly familiar A woman was standing near the entrance way and then McIntyre was attacked from behind It was Kross It was Scarlett Bordeaux right by his side this time She placed the hourglass in the ring turned it upside down and Kross stared down the current WWE Universal champion I guess everyone will now FALL AND PRAY
