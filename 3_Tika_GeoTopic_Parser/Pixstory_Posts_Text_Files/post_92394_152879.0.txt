Mother-son bonding by the pool.ðŸ¥°
After a whirlwind trip to Paris during fashion week, Kylie Jenner is back home in Calabasas and spending some one-on-one time with her new baby boy. On Wednesday, the makeup mogul shared a rare glimpse of her and Travis Scott's second child, whose name has yet to be revealed, in a series of family photos posted to Instagram. ðŸ“·
Captioning the content carousel "home," the 8-month-old's tiny baby feet were visible while resting his legs on his mom's as they lounged by the pool together. In the snapshot, Kylie wore a black bandeau bikini top and matching high-cut bottoms, however, she obscured both her and her son's faces. Meanwhile, a second photo showed Jenner's baby boy and his older sister Stormi Webster twinning in brown sneakers with red laces. 
Elsewhere in the fall-themed slideshow was a "welcome home" sign hung outside the garage door for Kylie after she returned from Paris Fashion Week, as well as a cute photo of Stormi petting a horse.
