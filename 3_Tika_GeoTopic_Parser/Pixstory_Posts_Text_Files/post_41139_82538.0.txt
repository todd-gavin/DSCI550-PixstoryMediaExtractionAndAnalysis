Legendary boxer Joe Louis was a revolutionary out of the ring. 

When it comes to civil rights leaders, Joe Louis is usually not top of mind. The son of sharecroppers in rural Alabama, Louis would go on to become the longest reigning heavyweight champion of the world. The first African American to achieve mainstream popularity during a time when discrimination, segregation and lynchings were part of everyday life, Louis’ quiet efforts influenced the entire nation.

Dominating the world of heavyweight boxing from 1937 to 1949, the Brown Bomber followed a strict code in order to discourage negative racial stereotyping. Known as the “Seven Commandments,” they were intended to carefully shape his media image. Taking those commandments even further, he refused to have his photograph taken with watermelon and in other racist situations. Consistently working to cultivate a reputation of respect and dignity, he effected social change and propelled the civil rights cause forward – even if that wasn’t his intention.

PBS tells us that years later, Louis was criticized for not speaking out on the subject of civil rights. Having become a symbol of African American power during a time when the community felt powerless, the next generation wanted him to help advance the cause. Not considering himself a spokesman, the quiet and seemingly passive man’s hero-status began to fade. As journalist Red Smith put it, “If heroes are supposed to take firm public stands on issues of the day, then who will cheer a reticent man who preferred to keep quiet around reporters?"
