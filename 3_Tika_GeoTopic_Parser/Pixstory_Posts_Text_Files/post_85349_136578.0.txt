Ram Gopal Verma makes shocking revelation about Bollywood's reaction to KGF 2.
The controversial king Ram Gopal Verma has made a statement on South superstar Yash's film KGF chapter 2 that might not be appreciated by the actors fans. In his latest interaction he revealed that the bollywood big names weren't pleased with Yash's KGFÂ  chapter 1 and chapter 2 and wondered why it was a massive hit . He even dragged Kashmiri Files and said, "Two films that have f**ked up everything are KGF chapter 2 and The Kashmiri Files. They are the opposite end of spectrum . The scary part of KGF chapter 2 is that nobody in bollywood liked it. When a film you didn't like and do so much in numbers, you'll be confused and you didn't know what to do."
Ram Gopal Verma even added that a very big director from Bollywood told him that he couldn't even watch KGF chapter 2 even for 20 minutes and he even tried to watch the film five times but never completed it. This isn't the first he has slammed the Yash's film, earlier too he had slammed the film over it's content and called it a dark cloud on his twitter .
