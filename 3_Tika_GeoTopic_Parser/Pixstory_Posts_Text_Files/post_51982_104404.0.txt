English cricket fans have paid an emotional tribute to Australian cricket legend Shane Warne during the team's test match clash with New Zealand at Lord's.

Players from both teams halted play at the end of the 23rd over and stood together to offer the leg-spin legend applause, as a video tribute played on the big screen. Warne wore the number 23 during his cricket career.

Warne's death in March at the age of 52 shocked the cricket world and left family, friends, and fans devastated.

Earlier, the Lord's commentary box was renamed in honour of Warne.

"To have a commentary box named after you at Lord's, where you tried to beat the old enemy, is a huge honour," former Australian captain Mark Taylor said.

"It wouldn't be lost on Warnie and certainly won't be lost on his family.

"We have lost a great mate and a guy that endeared himself to the English public.

"They probably started out hating him because he took too many wickets but, by the end, they absolutely loved him."

Tributes poured in across social media overnight, including from diehard English cricket fans the Barmy Army.

"At the 23rd over, a minute of applause is held for one of the greatest to have graced the game, Shane Warne," the group tweeted.

"There will never be another like him."
