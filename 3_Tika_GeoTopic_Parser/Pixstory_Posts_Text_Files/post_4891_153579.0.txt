NASA shared a beautiful picture of the Cosmic Bubble Wrap.
The featured image shows perhaps the most famous of all star-bubbles, NGC 7635, also known simply as The Bubble Nebula.
7,100 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cassiopeia lies the Bubble Nebula - a seven-light-year-across nebula - with a star 45 times more massive than our own.
The Hubble space telescope observed wide field camera depicts this nebula in visible light and shows off its brilliant colors: hydrogen is green, oxygen is blue, and nitrogen is red. The star is about 4 million years old and will become a supernova in 10-20 million years.
Image description: In the upper left of the image, yellow and gold clouds transition to green as they meet the blackness of space. At the center, a blue and green bubble emanates with a bright pink star with yellow clouds adjacent to it.
What a beautiful sight to behold!
