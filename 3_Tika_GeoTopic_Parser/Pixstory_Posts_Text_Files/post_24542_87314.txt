 Our Blues takes on an omnibus style drama which tells the story of diverse characters that are somewhat interconnected in one way or the other Kim Woo bin and Shin Min ah have been dating for over six years and there s much speculation that the two might just tie the knot this year We fans hopes to see both characters crossing paths atleast once in the drama I am so excited about this drama even if they are not a couple in it we will atleast be getting a interaction between them in drama press conference and photoshoots Also the teaser was really good and it gave me Hometown Cha Cha Cha vibes Click here to watch the teaser
