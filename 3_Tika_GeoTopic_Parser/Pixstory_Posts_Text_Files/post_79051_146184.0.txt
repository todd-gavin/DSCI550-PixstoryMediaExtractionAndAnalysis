Until recently, Granit Xhaka has always been a divisive figure amongst Arsenal fans. Certain people (myself included) have admired the player for years, whilst others were not in favour of the Swiss international, after a tricky few years at Arsenal. The past 12 months, however, has been nothing but success for Granit – and the way he has excelled in the new number 8 role he now occupies has won over those fans who were against him. It seems to be common belief now that he is a top professional, and a top footballer. We’ve always known that Arteta wanted to transform Arsenal into a 4-3-3 formation, and now that he finally has his players – we’re starting to see this in its completion. The use of an inverted full backs, and a 2-3-5 formation in the attacking phase, has given Xhaka far greater freedom to get forward and influence the game in the final third; something we’ve never seen from the club vice-captain. Now he is no longer required to cover the left defensive space, we are starting to see Granit further forward – in the half space. From everything we’ve been able to analyse of Xhaka in this new role, it seems to be the perfect position to play to his strengths. Being deeper in the opposition half, we’re starting to see the 29-year-old use that magical left foot of his to create goal scoring opportunities, as demonstrated by his assist for Gabriel Jesus’ goal against Brentford. An inch-perfect, clipped ball – and a great header past Raya. One stat I saw on Twitter today simply blew me away.  (via: @adamvoge) From live-passes, Granit Xhaka has the most shot-creating actions in the Premier League this season, alongside De Bruyne and Salah. Elite company for a player who has been simply elite so far this season. Oh yeah, and can we take a minute to appreciate the fact that this man simply does not get injured? In a team cursed with fitness concerns, this guy is always available. Ideal athlete.
