Spend time in a developing country during a heat wave and it quickly becomes clear why poorer nations face some of the greatest risks from climate change Most homes don t have air conditioning and even health clinics can get overheated These countries tend to be in the hottest parts of world and their risk of dangerous heat waves is rising as the planet warms In a new study our team of climate scientists economists and engineers found that the poorest parts of the world are likely to be two to five times more exposed to heat waves than richer countries by the s By the end of the century the lowest income quarter of the global population s heat exposure will almost match that of the entire rest of the world Capacity to adapt to rising heat is crucial Heat waves are often assessed by how frequent or intense they are but vulnerability involves more than that A key factor in the amount of harm heat waves cause is people s capacity to adapt with measures like cooling technology and the power to run it To assess how heat wave exposure is changing we analyzed heat waves around the world over the past years and then used climate models to project ahead Importantly we also incorporated estimates of countries ability to adapt to rising temperatures and lower their heat exposure risk We found that while wealthy countries can buffer their risk by rapidly investing in measures to adapt to climate change the poorest quarter of the world areas likely to be slower to adapt will face escalating heat risk Read full story at The Conversation Image Credits
