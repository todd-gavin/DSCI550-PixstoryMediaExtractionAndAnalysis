Street food, the mere mention of the word tickles our taste buds. It is affordable and is prepared within minutes. It has not only captured the food market but also has captured 
the heart of millions. Try these street foods to satisfy your cravings without compromising your health: 

Bhel puri

Hailing from Mumbai Nagariya, contrary to popular belief, bhel puri is actually not bad for health at all. It is made of puffed rice (murmura), which is not only a light snack, but it's also a good source of fibre, protein, and much needed complex carbs. Added to it are chopped veggies like tomato, onion, coriander, and potato, all of which are nutritious. Topped with lemon and green chutney, there is absolutely no unhealthy ingredient included in this street food.

Sweet potato

Potatoes are always wrongfully accused of being unhealthy and leading to weight gain. This is completely false, for potatoes, be it the regular ones or sweet potatoes, are good for health. Sweet potatoes are loaded with a number of nutrients like vitamins A, B, and C, and minerals like manganese, potassium, and iron, along with a good amount of fiber. Topped with lemon and chaat masala, there is nothing wrong with having sweet potato, even on a regular basis.

Corn on the cob

Corn is a naturally occuring grain, so there isnâ€™t much that can go wrong with it. It is low in calories and fat, a good source of protein and fiber, and it also contains antioxidants like Beta-carotene-alpha-carotene and ferulic acid. It is served with lemon, which itself is a good source of vitamin C, and bit of chaat masala, which is safe to consume in small quantities. Overall, corn on the cob is not just healthy, but it is one of the healthiest street foods in India
