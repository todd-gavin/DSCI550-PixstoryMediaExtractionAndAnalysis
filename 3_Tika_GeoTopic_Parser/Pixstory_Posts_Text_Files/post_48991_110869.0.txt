They say a lot of our choices is not exactly a choice, it's the years or maybe generations of conditioning manifesting itself. It is funny, confusing, bizarre all at the same time how we think caring about the lives of other beings is somehow extremist or not normal.

The significance of upholding ethical standards overcomes any conditioning that may exist with vegans, and even the temptations that may come with leaving something that was a big part of your life. It is more akin to how someone could feel tempted to beat someone but would resist since it is wrong. If I ate meat, it would feel as bad as committing any other guilt that injured an innocent someone. No matter how enticing it might have sounded at the time, it would have an impact on my conscience.

Extremism is not that. Vegans uphold their principles but without hurting anyone, in fact the opposite of that.
