Summary 

Background and Aims 

Motivational approaches may help target the psychological aspects of self-care, improving adherence to good practices in individuals with diabetes. The present study was designed to test the feasibility and effectiveness of a psychoeducational program for diabetic foot prevention or disease progression. 

Methods and Results 

Eighty-one subjects with or at high risk of foot ulcer development entered a program consisting of six 120-min group sessions, conducted by a podiatrist and an expert in psycho-education. Occurrence/recurrence of lesions in a 3-year follow-up was compared with 172 cases with similar risk score (IWGDF score 2019), receiving education at any 6-month podiatric visit (standard-of-care). Motivation to self-care and competence were assessed by specific questionnaires. The experimental program increased adherence to follow-up. The prevalence of foot lesions was higher at baseline and was remarkably reduced at any time-point in patients attending the psychoeducational program, whereas it remained relatively stable in standard care (around 10% of cases). The cumulative incidence was lower in the psychoeducational program (13.2, 95% CI 9.2-18.0 per 100 patient-year vs. 26.1; 95% CI 22.1-30.2); time to new lesions was increased (P =0.022). Cox proportional hazard analysis confirmed an overall reduction of lesions in the psychoeducational program (HR 0.34; 95% CI 0.18-0.66; P <0.001), after adjustment for confounders. The program was associated with significant changes in competence and motivation to self-care. 

Conclusion 

A psychoeducational approach is both feasible and effective to support patients with diabetes at high risk of first or recurrent foot lesions, increasing their adherence to self-care practices.
