For the longest time I suffered from stage fright I would do anything I could to escape presentations or if I had to give any then I would fumble My self confidence was naturally low because I felt insecure about how I presented myself on stage My breakthrough came when my cousin instructed me to practice a speech I was nervous about I practiced numerous times and everytime I fumbled he would ask me to begin from the start I practiced a minute speech for hours until he clapped and told me I was ready I presented the speech really well However that was because I had memorized the speech As a student of media and communication we have to deliver many impromptu presentations on short notice It is time consuming to memorize a speech and does not really help deliver an effective presentation Memorizing a speech deters you from engaging with the audience To deal with the problem I made use of mental cues much like mental flash cards I would remember certain keywords and loosely articulate a few paragraphs It didn t matter if I didn t remember the paras I would articulate and improvise on the spot in order to engage with the audience After several trials and errors these are some things I would suggest you can do to improve your presentation skills Practice but not too hard Just go through your speech twice or thrice to build confidence Visual cues Your audience will find it easier to follow you Try following the slides minutes font size method by Guy Kawasaki when making PPTs Engage with the Audience Interact ask questions get feedback It s important to sustain their attention Remember but don t memorize Do you also face problems with stage anxiety How do you overcome them
