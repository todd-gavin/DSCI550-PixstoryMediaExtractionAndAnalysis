Chicken Parmigiana is the best! Despite its Italian name, the “parma” is an Aussie pub classic that consists of a chicken schnitzel topped with tomato sauce, ham and melted cheese. Served with crunchy hot chips and a side salad barely anyone eats, the Chicken Parma is the ultimate comfort dish.

On the other hand, nothing beats fresh fish and chips, with a lemon wedge and some chicken salt, when you’re down by the beach. Try the popular Australian fish barramundi, named from the Aboriginal language meaning ‘large-scaled river fish’ or sample some calamari rings AKA squid rings coated in crispy batter.
