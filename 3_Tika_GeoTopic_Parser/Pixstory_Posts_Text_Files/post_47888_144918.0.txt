Ahmedabad: After the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) announced a raft of pre-poll promises in Gujarat, the big question is whether the ruling BJP, too, will follow suit with its own set of sops to woo voters and retain grip on power.
According to political analysts, parties are making big promises because they are not giving anything from their own pockets and these measures are eventually funded from taxpayers' money.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has so far taken the stand that it was not in the race of giving “freebies” to people and warned voters to be wary of the AAP’s promises.
The AAP is a relatively new entrant in Gujarat’s electoral politics and its entire campaign is rooted in making promises to a wide range of voters in a bid to upstage the BJP and put up a robust performance in the year-end Assembly polls.
Delhi Chief Minister and AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal has anchored his party’s campaign around a slew of sops like 300 units of free electricity per month, free education in government schools, unemployment dole, Rs 1,000 allowance to women and monthly stipend to new lawyers, among others.
In fact, Kejriwal has been making at least one new “guarantee” to voters every time he visits Gujarat.
In an attempt to checkmate the AAP, the Congress has come out with its own list of pre-poll promises to attract electors and end its long stint in the Opposition.
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, addressing a rally during his visit to the state a few days ago, promised that his party will give to people all the “freebies” offered by the AAP so far.
Besides, he also promised to provide LPG cylinder at Rs 500 (instead of around Rs 1,000 now), compensation of Rs 4 lakh each to the kin of COVID-19 victims and loan waiver of up to Rs 3 lakh to farmers.
