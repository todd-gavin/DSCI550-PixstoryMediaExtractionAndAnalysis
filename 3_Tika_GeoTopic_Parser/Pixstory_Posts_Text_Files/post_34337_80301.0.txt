Sri Lanka’s Foreign
Minister G.L. Peiris on Monday met his
counterpart S. Jaishankar in New Delhi,
as part of the ongoing high-level, and
increasingly frequent, bilateral
engagement between the neighbours.
New Delhi’s economic assistance to
Colombo in recent weeks has made a
“world of difference”, he told The
Hindu in an interview. After a year
marked by strain and a trust deficit,
recent developments signal a “fresh
energy” in Indo-Lanka ties, according to
Mr. Peiris. 

How is India helping? 
Beginning January 2022, India has been
providing crucial economic support to
the island nation in the grip of a severe
dollar crisis that, many fear, might lead to
a sovereign default, and a severe shortage
of essentials in the import-reliant
country. 
The relief extended by India from the
beginning of this year totals over $1.4
billion —a $400 currency swap, a $500
loan deferment and a $500 Line of Credit
for fuel imports. Sri Lanka is further
negotiating a $1 billion assistance from
India to help the near 22 million-strong
country as it faces an unprecedented
economic crisis.
