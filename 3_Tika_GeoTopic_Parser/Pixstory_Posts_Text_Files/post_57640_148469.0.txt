It would be an appropriate question to ask and discuss.
But apart from that, didn't we all become so interested in learning about Zeus or Apollo at one time in our lives?

 Well, here's the truth: we all have read and re-read the tales in greek mythologies with all our hearts and mind.
That's why it is still relevant today. Nevertheless, Greek mythology has much to say than just narrating exciting stories.
It has helped shape modern thinking because what it offers was important in ancient times and now.
And it is relevant today because of not what we like about it but also because we have adapted it so clearly in our lives.
If we look solely at the English language, it can be seen how it is filled with countless English words.
On record, more than 150,000 words have opted from Greek mythology to the English language.
Even classical novels have used greek terms to shape their essential characters and narratives.
Leave behind the books and literature, and even tech world have names from greek mythology. Like Amazon, Oracle and Olympus.
The thing is not about how often greek mythology has given its name to the modern world, but it has influenced the world by the lessons embedded in those names and stories.
