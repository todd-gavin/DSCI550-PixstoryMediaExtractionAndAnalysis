For the second consecutive year it is the Phoenix Suns who block the way to the stellar Lakers on the card of James Davis and Westbrook to name a few But if last year it happened in the first round of the playoffs this time the match against the Suns deprives the Lakers of even the mathematical chance of accessing the playoffs But between fights and deleted tweets, controversies with the fans and injuries, the yellow-violet season was all uphill and Lebron James was a great protagonist for better or for worse of the year, he wasn&#39;t even there last night on the parquet due to the re-emergence of ankle trouble The future foresees the farewell to coach Vogel and an inevitable rejuvenation for the glorious Californian franchise
