In the following article,we are going to discuss India's chances in esports at Commonwealth games 2022 Birmingham E-Sports are nothing but video games played on mobiles or computers. Here at Birmingham E-Sports are a pilot sport. Which means that medals given in the event will not be counted to the commonwealth medals table.but,the medals have a separate branding.

In Birmingham there are 6 Esports events happening. With 3 games being played in both men’s and women’s  categories.The games being played are Dota2, Efootball and Rocket league.

Dota2 is a 5v5 game. In the game each team of 5 has a fortification called ancient which the opposing team will try to destroy. Each of the players can select one of the 123 characters or heroes in the game during the pregame draft. The selected heroes cannot be changed midgame. There are two types of heroes namely core and support. Core heroes are those who do great damage and start slow. Whereas support heroes are those who help core heroes get to their full potential with abilities like level increasing and healing. The game is controlled using real time strategy controls and is played on a single map in three dimensional isometric perspective.

Rocket league maybe the most fun game of all 3 to play or watch. It is just like cars playing football but the cars have rocket speed supersonic abilities like jumping and destroying opposite cars. The version which is going to be used in commonwealth games is a 3 v 3 player version. It works just like a football game where u score by sending the ball into the goal area of the opposite teams. Matches  happen with a 5 minute time period. If the game is a draw by that time, the game goes into a sudden death mode and the one who scores the first goal wins.
