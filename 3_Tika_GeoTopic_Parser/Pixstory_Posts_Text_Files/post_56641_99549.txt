Cronulla have been whacked by the NRL match review committee with Will Kennedy and Jesse Ramien both facing significant bans for their high shots against the Warriors After Kennedy was sent off and Ramien sin binned in their win on Sunday the committee graded the incidents with level three charges It means Kennedy will miss two matches with an early guilty plea and Ramien three games given the centre already has a charge in If either were to fight their charge at the NRL judiciary and lose their bans would be extended by a week The charges leave the Sharks backline depleted for their Magic Round clash with Canberra as well as the following week against Gold Coast Nicho Hynes would be one option to revert to fullback but that would mean breaking up a successful halves combination with Matt Moylan Connor Tracey would be the other alternative but he would be considered handy in Ramien s place at centre The punishments come after the Sharks became the first team in years to win while they were a man down on their opponents from before half time They then spent part of the second half down to men when Ramien s shoulder made heavy contact with Euan Aitken s head but they did not concede a try in that period Sharks players rallied around Kennedy after the win with the fullback marched in the th minute when he coat hangered a stepping Reece Walsh and hooked him backwards to the ground Obviously he feels sheepish and very disappointed but he s proud of the guys coach Craig Fitzgibbon said afterwards We ll get around him this week Captain Wade Graham said Kennedy made an ill timed tackle He s come up as a defender and got beaten a little on the inside he hung out an arm It s never a nice feeling Graham said You feel like you let everyone down But we ll get around him and he ll bounce back On a positive note we rallied and got the result despite that He can keep his head up and move on
