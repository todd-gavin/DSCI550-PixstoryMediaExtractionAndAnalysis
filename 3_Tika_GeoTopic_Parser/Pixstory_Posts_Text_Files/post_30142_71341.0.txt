After a month at no. 1, Spider-Man: No Way Home has finally been overtaken at the box office. Paramount Pictures’ Scream reboot debuted with $30.6 million in ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.

Scream, a self-described “requel” that is both the fifth film in the franchise and a reboot introducing a new, younger cast, led all releases over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend. Paramount forecasts that it will total $35 million including Monday’s grosses. Scream, which cost about $24 million to make, added another $18 million in 50 international markets.
