You might have come across speeches of great and successful men telling you how they have achieved things Many a time it is by working till their body can t handle it And that might be true To become exceptional you ve got to do exceptional things but to what extent you can go It s a fact that nobody likes to work but still we do The thing about Indians is that they do more than what s needed And why do we do The biggest reason is the competition We are afraid that once we stop the others might overtake us And that worry is okay as long as it s motivating you to work But once this feeling starts to take hold of you in a way that you no longer care about your mental health then you must know that it s time to take a break It is proven that only healthy bodies and healthy minds can do the work most productively And you must understand this You don t have to indulge in this rat race just because everyone s in it You are a human not a robot designed to work tirelessly When the situation requires you to choose between work and mental health you should not think even a while before choosing the latter Health is wealth Yes you are growing but while growing up don t forget this age old adage you were taught in school and choose wisely
