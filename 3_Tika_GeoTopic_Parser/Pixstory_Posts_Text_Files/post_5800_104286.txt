Based on the life of Indian army officer Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan Major tells the story of Sandeep s life from his childhood to martyrdom in the attacks on Mumbai It s a tale of a patriot who from his very childhood dreamt of serving his nation in the armed forces Initially as per the movie he desired to be a naval soldier but after his rejection from the navy he went to join the Indian Army The movie shows his school years personal life and his journey of becoming a training officer in the country s most elite armed force the NSG national security guards The problem with this movie is similar to the majority of Indian films that is a lot of unnecessary melodrama it s almost cringey Major would have been a much more enticing tale if the makers have poured a little more realism into the movie That s where the second half of the movie scores better as the action scenes during the portrayal are captivating The action sequences and fights are a good watch much better than what we get to watch in Indian films The runtime is another problem with Major minutes which equals hours mins is way too much Under hours would have been better The thing I loved about Major is the lack of a jingoistic tone of storytelling which has become a norm today
