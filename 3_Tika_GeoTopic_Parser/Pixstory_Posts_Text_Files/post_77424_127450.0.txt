India drafted a constitution during the days of struggle with the Britishers and after independence it became applicable. In this constitution, the Indian citizen was given several fundaments right which is applicable to all citizen equally. More importantly, these right are the freedom that the constitution has given to every citizen.Freedom means giving equal opportunity to everyone for liberty and pursuit of happiness . Freedom refers to a state of freedom where you can do what you like without any restrictions. Furthermore, freedom can be said to be a state of mind where you have the right and freedom to do what you can think of. Also, you can feel freedom from within.But there are many such houses and villages where girls do not have complete freedom, due to which they are left behind at every stage in life. There are many such people who have a desire to do something in life, but due to lack of support from their family, they are all girls. They only dream, they all have a desire to study like people but they do not have freedom and family issues and financial problems. Because of which all those people are not able to give flight to their dreams. And it is the dream of many people that all of them also study in big cities like Mumbai and can achieve their destination. A city like Mumbai is also the dream of the people and Mumbai is known as a dream of city.Having freedom, all girls can think openly about their life ,And I want that everyone should get freedom so that he too can do something good in his life to become what he wants to be. And everyone should get the freedom to fill up and get the freedom to do so that they too can fulfill their dreams.And have the freedom to think openly so that we can take the right decision.Because there are many such places and houses where girls cannot take the decision of their own life, always they have to follow others' accord.And I want that everyone should get freedom to live and think freely.
