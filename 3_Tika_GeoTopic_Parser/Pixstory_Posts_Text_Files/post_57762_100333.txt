Just like the fact that there is good and bad in all of us what makes the difference is the choices that we make the same way there s good and bad out in the world for us what makes the difference is what we choose to let into our life So be good to yourself identify and let go You ll notice the difference Ask for help if you can t do it yourself No one says you have to do it on your own Keep fighting for the life you want to live
