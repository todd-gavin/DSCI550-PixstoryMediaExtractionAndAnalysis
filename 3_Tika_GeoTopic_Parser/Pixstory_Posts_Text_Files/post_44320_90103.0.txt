Josep Samitier

Samitier played for Barcelona from 1919 to 1932 before moving to Madrid for a few years. Later in his career, he would manage both Barcelona and Atletico Madrid.

Luis Suarez just put him into sixth place on the club's all-time scoring chart with his tally of 184 goals.

He earned the nicknames 'The Surrealist' and 'The Grasshopper Man' in part because of his playing style, and in part because he spent time playing football with close friend Salvador Dali. Carlos Gardel, a legendary singer of the time, dedicated a song to him.

Camp de Les Corts was created in 1922 as the pitch Barca played on grew too small for the fans that came to see the team built around him.

At Barca, Samitier is regarded as a legend, but he was not without controversy. He recruited another future star in Laszlo Kubala when managing Barca, but was accused of functioning as a double agent when Madrid thwarted their attempts to sign Alfredo Di Stefano (pictured L, with Kubala).

He eventually left Barcelona in the 1960s to work for Real Madrid, although he is still remembered as a Barca legend. He was accorded a state funeral after his death in 1972, and one of the routes going to Camp Nou was named after him in 1993.

Julen Lopetegui

Lopetegui played three years at Real Madrid and three at Barcelona, but only made six league games as a backup goalkeeper for both clubs.

He was a regular for Madrid's Castilla team, although he spent the majority of his career with Logrones, whom he joined after leaving Madrid, and Rayo Vallecano, whom he left after leaving Barcelona.

Despite this, Lopetegui made one senior international appearance for Spain and went on to lead the national squad.

He was famously fired on the eve of the 2018 World Cup after it was revealed he had planned to join Real Madrid after the tournament, but he was fired again a little over four months later after a poor run of play that culminated in a 5-1 loss to Barcelona.
