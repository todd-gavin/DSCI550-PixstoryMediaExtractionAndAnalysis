Almost everybody seems to be playing Wordle these days. In a matter of months, the word game has taken the world by storm, enticing even the New York Times to buy it out from its developer. Why is it so popular?

It was just in October that Josh Wardle, a software developer, created the simple and easy word puzzle for fun. All you have to do is figure out the word, with five letters and six tries. He shared it over his WhatsApp family group. In no time, it was boasting a fan base of 2 million. In January, he received an amount in “the low seven figures” from the NYT that has added Wordle to its popular bouquet of puzzles and diversions:  https://apnews.com/article/new-york-times-buys-wordle-c1e77bd65f21464f98f8cf4246457d6b
The newspaper says it will be free initially. (That means it will go behind the paywall after a while. Many enthusiasts are not happy.)

In explaining its popularity, then, its free availability should count as the first factor. Secondly, unlike ‘Spelling Bee’ of the NYT, Wordle is not a tough challenge which attracts only word-nerds. This is a family activity, everyone can join in. Another crucial difference between the two is that the former can take hours to crack, while people solve Wordle puzzles while waiting for a metro or in commute. It is, in short, democratic in it approach. 

Some commentators believe the pandemic is also a factor. The lockdown and social-distancing days were waiting for a diversion just like Wordle. Families forced to spend time together, with little outdoor activities, found their prayers answered in Wordle: https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/01/13/wordle-perfect-pandemic-game-together/
 
But people are always on the lookout for new diversions, new ways to kill time; and even without a pandemic wasn’t there the Sudolu craze that spread over the world in no time about two decades ago? The Wordle popularity may have more to do with our truncated attention spans, after so much scrolling and YouTube and Zoom now: https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/dec/23/what-is-wordle-the-new-viral-word-game-delighting-the-internet
