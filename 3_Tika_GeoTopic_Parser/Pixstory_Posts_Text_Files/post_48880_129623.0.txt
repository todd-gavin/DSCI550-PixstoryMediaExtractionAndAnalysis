Plant milks are honestly a better alternative to cow milk. It's not much hassle, it's healthy, it's tasty, it costs you a lot less if you make it yourself and most importantly, you don't participate in funding this cruel cruel industry.

There are a variety of plant-based milks available on the market these days, and they all offer different benefits.

One of the most popular types of vegan milk is soy milk. Soy milk is made from soybeans, which are ground up and then boiled until they form a thick liquid. It's easy to make at home by soaking soybeans overnight in water, then boiling them until they're soft. Soy milk also has a relatively low calorie count and is an excellent source of nutrients like calcium and vitamin D.

Another great option for vegan milk is almond milk. Almond milk is made from ground almonds, which are boiled with water until the almonds release their oils. These oils are then strained out, leaving behind a sweet tasting drink that's high in protein and Omega-3s. Like soy milk, almond milk is also cholesterol free and contains plenty of Vitamin E to help fight against inflammation.

If you're looking for a more varied option, hemp seedmilk is a great choice. Hemp seeds are ground up into a thick liquid and then mixed with water to create the desired consistency. Hemp seedmilk contains all 20 Essential Nutrients (including proteins), plus it's packed with Omega-3s and fibre to help keep you feeling full longer than other types of milks. Plus, it doesn't contain any dairy products or antibodies, so it saves you from tons of diseases.

All of these milks are delicious and versatile â€“ you can use them in recipes or simply drink them on their own! Allergic to one of these? Try another! The options are countless. Soymilk is especially ideal for making desserts or smoothies due to its sweet taste and creamy consistency. If you're looking for an affordable way to add more plant-based nutrients to your diet without spending a lot of money on groceries or supplements, then making your own vegan milks is the perfect solution!
