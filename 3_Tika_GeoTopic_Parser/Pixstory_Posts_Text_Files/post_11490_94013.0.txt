We all have been taking all measures to stay energized during this summer season. And this can be a healthy as well as a super cooler recipe for you. 

Jamun Ice Cream (Black Plum Ice Cream) is the perfect dessert you can go for during this scorching time. With an exotic flavour along with its bright colours of purple shade it can always be of great mood lifter. With its creamy, smooth texture with its richness in flavour it just tempts us more to it. 

Ingredients you will need 

• 180 grams of Jamun/Black Plum pulp 

• 250 grams condensed milk milkmaid 

• 250 ml cold fresh cream full-fat 

Instructions to follow 

• Jamuns contain seeds so first we need deseed it and cut them down and grind it into a fine paste and kind it aside. 

• In the blender, blend the ice cream for a minute. Now add the Jamun pulp in the blender with the other ingredient - milkmaid and blend it for 2 minutes. Keep 2 to 3 tablespoons of the pulp aside as we will need it for later use. The mixture you have got is now almost a shade of purple which has a creamy thick texture. 

• Now freeze the mixture in a container for 5 to 6 hours. Once this process is done take it from the freezer and beat it in the blender for a minute or till it gets smooth. Now again keep it in the freezer and continue the process until it gets smoother and creamier. 

• Now take the ice cream mold and add in the pulp that's kept aside and drizzle the pulp to all the sides of the mold. Next pour in the ice cream mixture and enjoy your ice cream.
