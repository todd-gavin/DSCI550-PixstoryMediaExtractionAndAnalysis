On March 21, the murder of a deputy pradhan in Bogtui village in West Bengal’s Birbhum district triggered a chain of events that resulted in at least eight houses in the area being attacked and set on fire, killing eight people, including women and children.

Against the backdrop of the Birbhum violence, a video is viral on social media, where burnt bodies can be seen lying on the road next to a bus. It is being shared with the claim that after the death of TMC leader Bhadu Sheikh, a Muslim mob burnt Hindus in their houses alive. It also asks PM Modi to impose the President’s rule in West Bengal. It also alleges that lakhs of Hindus have been killed in Bengal and many Hindu women have been raped during the Bengal election.

Another Twitter user shared the same video with a caption in Hindi, claiming that the victims of the Bengal incidents are Hindus.

Fact-Check
The viral post contains two misleading claims, the first one being that the victims of violence in Birbhum were from the Hindu community and that the viral video represents the violent event that happened in Birbhum, In this fact-check, we will examine both claims.

Were Hindus killed in the Birbhum incident?

The attempt to communalise the violence that occurred in Birbhum by suggesting that members of the Hindu community were brutally killed by a Muslim mob has been already debunked by Alt News. The accused and the victims are both from the minority community.
