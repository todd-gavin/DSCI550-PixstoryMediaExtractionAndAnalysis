I have been candid (which has made me uncomfy at times) about my lifelong struggle with depression. Many times, my episodes are short due to now noticing when they are coming on, and employing preventative strategies I have learned over the years. Still, it’s never easy. This image is SO POWERFUL because it shows that we didn’t choose this… that we aren’t making it up… that feeling like nothing is because our brain truly is not functioning the way it normally would.
The image on the right has less grey matter activation which means less control over movement, memory, emotions, and other significant roles in our daily functioning. It also may quite literally be smaller, as cortisol and stress encourage shrinkage of the brain impairing memory, and other key impacts. Lastly, the image on the right experiences a hyperactive amygdala which plays a key role in resilience, emotional regulation and more.

BASICALLY, the world would be a better place if we would stop asking people to “snap out of it”, and meet them with educated compassion that healing is a process.❤️💪🧠
