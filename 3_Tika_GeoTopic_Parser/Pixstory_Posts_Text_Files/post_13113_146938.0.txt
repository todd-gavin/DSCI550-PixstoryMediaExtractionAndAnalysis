Peace means freedom, I am not free, I have never seen peace. Is there peace?
I am Halima Elham. a 21-year-old polytechnic student, I heard the word peace, but I did not see its existence yet, until I got to know myself and the society, I never felt calm and peaceful.
Peace means feeling calm when we go outside.
Many programs have been held under the title of peace, but I did not see which action was taken and its effect. The Afghan government made a lot of promises, but it has not acted,¬† "it just said to imagine peace". Until now, I have not seen peace, and I don't know how they imagine peace. When we go to Shahr-e-No, on the advertising billboard is written¬† "Imagine peace." When in a country whose slogan is "Imagine peace," is there any hope for peace? has it?
Freedom and peace
Peace means freedom, inner and psychological freedom, when you walk in the society among people, have hope for freedom. Peace means spiritual and psychological freedom.
