Henry James was an American-born British author. He is regarded as a key transitional figure between literary realism and literary modernism and is deemed by many to be among the greatest novelists in the English language. 

He is best known for his novels dealing with the social and marital interplay between émigré Americans.

In fiction, "the Gothic" refers to a set of tropes first popularized in the next half of the eighteenth century. Gothic novels, which remained prominent well into the mid-nineteenth century, often featured some combination of the following elements: mysterious secrets, a threatened or persecuted young woman, and a villainous male figure (usually an aristocrat). 

By the time Henry James was writing, many of these Gothic elements had changed and evolved into different forms. For example, the "sensation novels" that largely dominated the British publishing market in the 1860s depended on some of these tropes of illicit secrets and the dark side of household life incorporated into seemingly everyday English households. 

James was well aware of both the history of Gothic tropes and the more contemporary literary taste for recognizable settings. He made use of both in The American, drawing on this literary heritage to accentuate the cultural gaps and tensions between Europeans and Americans.

James's fiction would be inscribed by an interest in supernatural and ghostly elements throughout his career, perhaps most notably in his novella The Turn of the Screw (1898). However, The American is the novel most closely allied with the Gothic, enabling him to link his contemporary criticism of European society with an earlier belief of similar doubts.
