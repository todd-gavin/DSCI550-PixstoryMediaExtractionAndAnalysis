The low carb, high fat keto diet remains quite popular, and many people find that they enjoy the diet and the results it provides. However, it may not be the right fit for everyone. Keto is extremely restrictive compared to some other diets, which may cause stress for some people.

Additionally, the keto diet may cause side effects, especially when you’re getting started. Some possible side effects are:
▪️dizziness
▪️fatigue
▪️digestive changes
▪️increased cholesterol levels

If keto isn’t a good fit, you may want to try other healthy eating patterns.
