You may have heard of some of the iconic Aussie cuisines, but have you tried them all? Some of them you will discover on board a Mojosurf tour! My personal fav the almighty Vegemite (pronounced Veggiemight), a delicacy only the finest of palettes enjoy.

Vegemite is the most common one that ‘foreigners’ discover, and more often than not, hate! No matter how many people tell you it’s disgusting you should try it at least once. I’m assuming it’s an acquired taste…

2. Fairy Bread

3. Tim Tams!

4. Meat Pies

5.Anzac Biscuits

6.Chicken Parma (AKA Chicken Parmigiana)

7. Pavlova

8.Witchetty Grub
