We all often talk about the importance of voting In my friend circle I have always encouraged everyone to exercise their right to vote But is voting too a privilege I know it doesn t sound like it but the problems faced by Native Americans make me think so However it seems that they might soon be rectified I have trust on Biden in this respect According to a White House study released Thursday local state and federal officials must do more to ensure that Native Americans who face chronic long standing and deep rooted hurdles to voting have equitable access to ballots U S News reported that native Americans and Alaska Natives vote at lesser rates than the general population but they have been a crucial voting bloc in close races and states with large Native populations In Arizona for example a rise in tribal voter turnout helped Joe Biden win in a state that hadn t voted for a Democrat in a presidential election since The report comes a year after Biden signed an executive order promoting voting rights and forming a steering committee to look at specific hurdles to voting in Indigenous communities State legislation and municipal practises that disenfranchise Indigenous people unequal access to early voting and reliance on an unreliable postal system are among them according to the research The White House statement said For far too long members of tribal nations and Native communities have faced unnecessary burdens when they attempt to exercise their sacred right to vote
