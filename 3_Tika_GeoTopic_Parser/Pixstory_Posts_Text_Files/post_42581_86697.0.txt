For the last 2-3 seasons, football fans and the media have always raised the question on the Ballon d'Or ceremony because they think that award was not given to the deserving player. 
For example, when Lionel Messi won the Ballon d'Or in 2021 (won Copa America with Argentina and Copa Del Rey with Barcelona), many questions were asked from fans and media that why Robert Lewandowski didn’t win the award even when he won every possible club-level trophy available which is 6. 

So, after noticing all the anger of fans and media, France football comes up with the new for choosing Ballon d'Or winner. 

New Rules to choose the Ballon d'Or winner are:- 

1. From now onwards, the award period will be the European football calendar which is (August to August). Previously, the awards are given to the footballer by considering their performance of the entire calendar year which is (January to December). So, 2022 Ballon d'Or will be given to footballers by taking their (2021-2022) campaign performance into account. 

2. Ballon d'Or will be given to a player after considering player’s individual performance, player’s performance which helped the team to win the match and last but not the least player’s fair play record, which means if a player scores 45 goals in a season but his team didn’t win a trophy, so chances of winning a Ballon d'Or of that player will decrease.

3. Award will be given after considering the performance of the player of only “this year.” The voting representative will not consider a player’s past performance before voting, which means if a younger player does miracles in the season then his chances of winning the Ballon d'Or will increase. 

4. According to new rules, FIFA representatives of the first 100 countries and FIFA representatives of the first 50 countries will be qualified to vote for Men’s Ballon d'Or and Women’s Ballon d'Or. 

Let’s hope after these changes, a perfect candidate for the Ballon d'Or wins the award.
