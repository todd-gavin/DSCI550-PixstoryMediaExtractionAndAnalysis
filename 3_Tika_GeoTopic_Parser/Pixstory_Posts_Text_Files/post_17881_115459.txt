Dressing for summer in New York City isn t the easiest of things to dress for in my opinion It can get very hot but it s also a big busy city and wearing what you might typically wear to say a pool party probably isn t going to be the most practical choice for walking around the city So what does one wear in the sweltering city in the summer Look no farther than Jennifer Lawrence Lawrence was out walking in New York last week in a low key white T shirt outfit that s a bit more unexpected than the typical white tee and denim shorts combination Instead she wore her tee with silky pants which look extremely lightweight and comfortable The rest of her look consisted of flat sandals a tote bag and Lu Goldie sunglasses So if you re in the market for a new way to style a white T shirt loose silky pants may be your golden ticket
