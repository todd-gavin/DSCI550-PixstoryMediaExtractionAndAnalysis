I visited the site of Kauwa-Dol in July, 2005 during my stay at Gaya. About 16 miles to the north of Gaya in Bihar, near Belaganj, there are several groups of granite hills, called Kauwa-Dol, Barabar, Nagarjuni and Dharawat. All of these possess several remains of the ancient times.

The Kauwa-Dol is a detached Hill separate from the main group of Hills and is quite inaccessible as is formed entirely of huge masses of granite piled precipitously above one another, and crowned with a single lofty block that commands over the plains below. It is said that this pinnacle was in earlier times topped by another block which was so delicately balanced that it used to swing even when a crow alighted upon it. It was from this peculiar block that the Hill acquired its name. The block is now untraced.

At the northern foot of the Kauwa-Dol there has formerly been a temple of hewn granite. A large village must also have existed on the north and east sides of the hill, as the foot of the hill, which is considerably raised above the fields, is strewn with broken bricks, hewn stones and fragments of pottery. Several Muhammadan tombs were observed on this mound by Cunningham, built chiefly of pillars and other squared and ornamental stones of some earlier temple. Â I could see several pillars lying on the fields, some exposed to the vagaries of nature, while others covered under earth.


On the rocks of the northern face of the hill, numerous figures have been sculpted. One of these is a figure of Ganesha, beside a lingam. Several of them represent Gauri Shankar; but the most common of these sculptures is the favourite figure of Mahishasur Mardini Durga. There are also figures of Buddha.
