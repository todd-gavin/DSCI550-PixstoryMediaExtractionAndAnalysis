A new hope for the treatment of more aggressive breast cancers arises from the research of a group of researchers from the European Institute of Oncology IEO coordinated by Salvatore Pece, full professor of General Pathology at the State University of Milan and Director of the Laboratory of Hormonal Tumors Dependent and Pathobiology of Stem Cells of the IEO The results of the study supported by the AIRC Foundation for cancer research have just been published in the journal Nature Communications The researchers have discovered an unprecedented molecular mechanism which, if activated, alters the metabolism of cancer cells favoring their uncontrolled growth and progression towards metastatic disease At the origin of the entire process is the CDK protein which, if expressed in an exaggerated manner as occurs in more than 1 of all human breast tumors, causes the cascade of events that make the aggressive tumor resistant to conventional chemotherapy and at risk of metastasis. Therefore, the presence of CDK at high levels on the one hand constitutes the driving force of the disease but on the other underlines Professor Pece it becomes a tumor biomarker and a point of vulnerability. of the energy necessary for their multiplication and essentially forcing them to starve It is a new strategy to fight cancer by attacking its particular metabolism explains Maria Grazia Filippone researcher supported by the Umberto Veronesi Foundation This interferes with the ability of tumor cells to elevated expression of CDK to exaggerate use of glucose to fuel the folate cycle metabolic pathway This in turn supplies the necessary constituents for DNA replication supporting cell replication and metastatic spread
