Yes maybe from next time this can be one of the reason you can use to have a cup of tea. 
A new research has suggested that depending on how much tea we may drink our risk of getting type 2 diabetes is less. 
The researchers from Wuhan University of Science and Technology in China referred the past studies on tea consumption and on type 2 diabetes and they found that people who drank at least four cups of green, black or Oolong tea a day were 17% less likely to have diabetes than non tea drinkers over a period of 10 years. 
But the research needs more in depth learning as in to know why tea drinking is linked with reduced risk of diabetes. It could be because some compounds in tea might help to lower down blood sugar, but other factors could also be a part of it. 
Dr. Shichun Bao, PhD MD, an associate professor of medicine and the Diabetes Technology Program Leader at Vanderbilt Eskind Diabetes Clinic in Nashville, Tennessee, said to Healthline that, “I think this finding is interesting, but I would be cautious about drawing a conclusion." 
“This was an observational study that shows correlation, not causation,” she continued. “To determine causation, you really need to have a well-designed, prospective, randomized trial.”
