The 29-year-old Senegal international scored for the Reds to create yet another record in the
away game at Estadio da Luz.

Sadio Mane, a Liverpool winger, denigrated the personal significance of his second goal in the
team's 3-1 Champions League quarter-final first-leg win against Benfica on Tuesday.

Ibrahim Konate opened the scoring in the 17th minute at Estadio da Luz, before Senegal's
Captain tapped home the second in the 34th minute following an assist from Luis Diaz.

Darwin Nunez got a goal back for Benfica in the 49th minute, but Diaz put the cherry on the
cake for Liverpool in the 87th minute.

“Like I always say, the team is winning – that’s more important [than me scoring]. I scored a goal
today; I`m happy but more important were the goals we scored. We’re waiting for the next game
and to get the job done at home,”

 Mane told reporters as quoted by the Liverpool website
“A great start [to the week]. We can't expect better than that and it will help us to prepare for the
next game.”

With Liverpool ready to face Manchester City in the Premier League on Sunday, Mane was
questioned if manager Jurgen Klopp will make any additional changes to the team.

“You’ll have to ask the boss! We are Liverpool, we have a deep squad. Sometimes we make
changes to benefit the whole team,” Mane concluded.

The 29-year-old Lion of Teranga has already scored 13 goals in the knockout stage, surpassing
Messi with 12 goals and partnering Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo for the most goals
scored in the Champions League knockout round.

Meanwhile, Mane's strike against Benfica was his 22nd goal in the Champions League, putting
him ahead of Steven Gerrard (21) as Liverpool's second-highest goal scorer in the competition,
trailing only Mohamed Salah (33).
