Here are some preventive things you can start today.

ResearchersTrusted Source have found that high blood pressure raises your risk for having a silent stroke.

The American Stroke Association recommends that you cut your sodium intake to lower your blood pressure and reduce your risk for stroke. 
ðŸ‘‰Lower your cholesterol levels. 
To reduce stroke risk, your overall cholesterol level should be lower than 200 mg/dL. Your HDL (good) cholesterol should ideally be 60 mg/dL or higher. Your LDL (bad) cholesterol should be under 100 mg/dL.
ðŸ‘‰Stamps out your smoking habits. 
If youâ€™re still smoking, you can cut your stroke risk by quitting. Smoking is associated with an elevated risk for heart disease and stroke.

Have five or more servings of fruits and vegetables each day.
