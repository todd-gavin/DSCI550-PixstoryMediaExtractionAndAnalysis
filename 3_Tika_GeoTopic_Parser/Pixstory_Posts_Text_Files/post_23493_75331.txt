We walk into the walled enclosure with the chhatris sitting back in a laid out rose garden The cenotaphs at Orchha are more imposing than any I have seen elsewhere Their plain facades rise up three tiers to give way to spires and cupolas where the vultures nest When they sit still they look like winged gargoyles but right now they are bickering with each other showing off their magnificent size as they swoop through the garden from one melancholic monument to the other We then head towards the fort and the other monuments More of that in the next installment of Outstanding Orchha Fact File There are entry charges for the park as well as the sanctuary Rs per head for the park and the sanctuary charges depend on the mode of transportation The cycles are available on hire at the ticket counter for about Rs Helmets are available with the cycles but one has to ask The entry ticket to the Orchha fort complex covers the entry to the walled cenotaphs too The historic town of Orchha nestled on the banks of river Betwa was founded in the th century by the Bundela Rajput Chief Rudra Pratap Here the river Betwa splits into seven channels also called the Satdhara Legend goes that this is in honour of the seven erstwhile Chiefs of Orchha Orchha lies on the Betwa River km from Tikamgarh and km from Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh It is about km from Bhopal the capital of Madhya Pradesh Concluded Picture by Mandvi
