After being closed since Wednesday night, a portion of the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway was opened to jammu-bound traffic on Thursday. 
The caravan of Amarnath pilgrims was stopped and lodged in SASB Yatri Niwas at Chanderkote and other lodging facilities set up by the district administration after it left Bhagwati Nagar base camp Jammu on Thursday morning for two base camps in Kashmir.
