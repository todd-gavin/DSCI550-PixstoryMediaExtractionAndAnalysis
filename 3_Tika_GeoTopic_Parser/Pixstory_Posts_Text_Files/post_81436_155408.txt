We weren t at our flowing best on Thursday away to Bodo Glimt but in the end we secured another victory to make it wins out of in all competitions so far this season Bukayo Saka s first half goal followed by a determined defensive display after the break maintained our place at the top of Group A and Mikel Arteta said despite a drop in quality he was pleased to return to London with all three points After the game the manager said It s a really tough place to come they ve won here the last games in European competition and that s not a coincidence we ve seen that tonight We had good periods in the game we had periods we struggled especially in the second half We didn t find enough continuity in some moments we were lucky not to concede a goal He added that he didn t want to use the artificial pitch or the conditions as an excuse for the performance It doesn t matter what it is he added We said you have to find a way to win every three days When it s snowing when it s raining when it s astroturf when the pitch is not good when it s long when you make seven changes like this You have to find a way to win and today I m really pleased because we found a way to win again
