The man of life upright whose guiltless heart is free From all dishonest deeds and thoughts of vanity The man whose silent days in harmless joys are spent Whom hopes cannot delude nor fortune discontent That man needs neither towers nor armor for defense Nor secret vaults to fly from thunder s violence He only can behold with unaffrighted eyes The horrors of the deep and terrors of the skies Thus scorning all the care that fate or fortune brings He makes the heaven his book his wisdom heavenly things Good thoughts his only friends his wealth a well spent age The earth his sober inn and quiet pilgrimage Sir Francis Bacon
