Even if the first quarter is affected by the particular weather and climate situation, the data from the smog measurement units confirm the need to intensify interventions on the two main emission sources, it is necessary to reduce emissions from traffic and in particular from diesel and those produced by too many intensive farming that dot the Po Valley, declares Barbara Meggetto, president of Legambiente Lombardia. On this last aspect, the main positive news is that represented by the revision of the IED industrial emission directive on industrial emissions which, by including large farms among the priority emission sources, will finally make it possible to put order in a sector which up to now has been exempt from the formalities necessary to limit emissions in the productive sectors The effect of the ongoing anti-cyclonic regime is evident above all in the data relating to the number of days in which PM levels have exceeded the critical threshold for human health equal to micrograms mc However, current standards are destined to become more restrictive with the implementation of the WHO recommendations, this level of pollution cannot be exceeded for more than a few days in the calendar year But things have gone decidedly worse in the winter season on calendar days days with air quality outlawed in Milan Bad also in the capitals of Mantua Cremona Monza and Brescia where already in the first quarter the number of polluted days tolerated in an entire year was far exceeded Only Bergamo Lecco Sondrio and Varese could confirm that a level of pollution considered tolerable according to current regulations
