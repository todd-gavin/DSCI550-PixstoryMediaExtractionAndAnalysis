Ilkay Gundogan - 6.5
Proved to be masterful in terms of helping the attackers carry the ball forward. Hit the post with a brilliantly taken free kick.
Bernardo Silva - 7.5
Brilliant bit of passing , runs and delicious crosses in particular proved to be the biggest threat for United. Provides the assist to foden for the opening goal and had a great game overall.
Phil Foden - 9.5/10
One of the best players on the pitch, his partnership with Erling Haaland in the attack totally thrashed United out of the game. Smashed in a brilliant hat trick besides bagging a couple of assists.Â 
Erling Haaland - 9.5/10
Was absolutely sensational as he smashed in a third hat-trick of this season. Never seemed in any sort of trouble whatsoever and was confident in each touch he had in United's box. Also helped Foden bag in a hat trick by assisting him on two ocassions.
Jack Grealish - 7/10
Performed brilliantly with the ball at his feet as he showed some good pace and managed to find his team mates at dangerous positions thereby creating good chances.
