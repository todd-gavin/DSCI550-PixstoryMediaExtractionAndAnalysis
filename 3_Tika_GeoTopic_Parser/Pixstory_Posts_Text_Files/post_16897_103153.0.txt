Kangana Ranaut’s action film ‘Dhakad’ has collected only Rs 4,420 on the eighth day of its theatrical release. The figures earned by the film have been reported by Bollywood Hungama. So far, the movie has managed to make around Rs 3 crore which adds to Ranaut’s list of underperforming films.

The budget for making the entire film was approximately between Rs 80 crore to Rs 90 crore. A separate report by Bollywood Hungama suggests that the film struggles in finding a streaming distribution because the producers did not crack a deal before the release.
