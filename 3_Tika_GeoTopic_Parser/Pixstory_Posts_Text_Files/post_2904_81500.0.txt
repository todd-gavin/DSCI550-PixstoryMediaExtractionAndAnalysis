It was a sensational debut for the fifteen-year-old Kamila Valieva last week when the Russian figure skater helped her team clinch the gold medal. But the joy was short-lived as two days after her performance, she was told that she had tested positive for a banned drug. 

There was finger-pointing against the International Olympic Committee for being lenient towards Russia after a significant drugs scandal broke after the 2014 Sochi Olympics. Russia has been banned from international sporting events since December 2017 as a punishment for running a systematic doping program during Sochi. But its athletes can participate in representing the Russian Olympic Committee.

On Valieva, even as the world was debating on her being tested positive, the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled on Monday that she could continue to compete even as her appeal would be heard. This has given rise further anger against the whole process. The Financial Times quotes Global Athlete, an advocacy group as saying, “It is blatantly clear that Valieva would have never been placed in this position if the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) had done their jobs and banned Russia from global sport.” (https://www.ft.com/content/de49236d-e720-4824-a6e9-1133003fcac4)

The arbitration court said that since Valieva was “protected person” under the World Anti-Doping Agency’s code as she was under 16 years old, the same rules don’t apply to her as adults. The court also said that since she was very young. It would be unfair not to allow her to compete even as the appeals proceedings would occur. (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60374485)

The decision has come in for much criticism by former athletes saying that it would mock the rules. Also, the effect on Valieva if she wins the gold in women's figure skating and then her appeal fails. She may end up losing both the medals and put a big question mark on her career.
