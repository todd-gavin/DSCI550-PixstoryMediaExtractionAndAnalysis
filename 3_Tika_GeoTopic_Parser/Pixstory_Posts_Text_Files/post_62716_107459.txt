I am currently reading the book Hellen keller THIS book is in three parts The first two Miss Keller s story and the extracts from her letters form a complete account of her life as far as she can give it Much of her education she cannot explain herself and since a knowledge of that is necessary to an understanding of what she has written it was thought best to supplement her autobiography with the reports and letters of her teacher Miss Anne Mansfield Sullivan The addition of a further account of Miss Keller s personality and achievements may be unnecessary yet it will help to make clear some of the traits of her character and the nature of the work which she and her teacher have done
