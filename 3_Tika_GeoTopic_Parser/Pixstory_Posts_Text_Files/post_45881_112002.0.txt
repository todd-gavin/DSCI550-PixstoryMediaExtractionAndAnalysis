In the Big Apple, Melania Trump wore her distinctive fashion sense. The former first lady was seen leaving a spa after travelling from Florida's Mar-a-Lago. 

FN News reported that Trump appeared in public wearing a green jacket with flower embroidery on the side, a belted waist, and slightly ruched sleeves. She wore the garment with beige jeans to maintain the summertime mood and showcased her basics in a cream handbag. 

The fashion icon let her shoulders be covered in her highlighted tresses. Her bright grey pointed-toe pumps were made more noticeable by the tight cuff on her jeans. 

The classic shoe design had a long pointed toe and stood on a tall stiletto heel. Due to its limitless versatility and sturdy construction, pointed-toe pumps continue to be one of the most popular shoe types.

Thanks to her former modeling career, the wife of Donald Trump can turn even the most casual outfit into a fashion moment, and she has done so consistently with her classic twist. Where shoes are concerned, the businesswoman is no stranger to a pointed-toe pump.  She can often be seen in the classic silhouette in hues of black and white by her go-to designer, Christian Louboutin. 

However, she also dons similar styles from Alaia, Roger Vivier and Dior. For bolder statements, Trump sports a pop of patterns like zebra, stripes or plaid or in the same silhouettes from luxury labels like Manolo Blahnik.
