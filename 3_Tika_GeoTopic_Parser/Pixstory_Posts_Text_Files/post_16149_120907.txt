Chulbul Pandey aka Salman Khan is someone who his loyal fans swear by and make all his movies big hits at the box office but one such film that particularly stands out is Dabangg It was clearly a movie that shouldn t have been celebrated at all And even though it should have stopped with just one movie the audience celebrated the two sequels that followed as well From the wrong portrayal of women to the lack of logic everything was either wrong or problematic about the film The first Dabangg has completed years and what appalls us is that people are still celebrating the movie on social media Let us give you five reasons why the audience should not have celebrated Salman Khan s Dabangg the way they did Portrayal Of Women Salman Khan hasn t really understood the meaning of the word feminism Actually the worst part is that many of us don t Sonakshi Sinha aka Rajjo was left with no choice but to marry Chulbul Pandey And then we have Malaika Arora who was reduced to a woman whose sole purpose was to be an eye candy for drunk men Lack Of Logic Salman Khan is a one man army and has the power to thrash all goons alone simultaneously In one of the scenes Salman s shirt gets torn by just him flexing the muscles There are many more such scenes that make us question our sense of logic Crass Item Number Well there might have been songs that were good in the movie but what put us off is the song Munni Badnaam Hui Bad Script Well the movie might have been massy but we wonder what the writers were thinking while glorifying a cop who s corrupt and chauvinistic at the same time Dialogues We wonder what was the brief that given to the dialogue writer who wrote such cringe worthy dialogues
