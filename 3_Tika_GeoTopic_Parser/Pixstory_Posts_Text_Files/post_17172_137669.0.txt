Teachers' Day is celebrated in India on the birth anniversary of India's second President, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. A teacher’s job is not just to educate students but also to teach them important life lessons. While all of us have had such influential Gurus in real life, there are portrayals in Bollywood that have driven home this point. 
Let's have a look at some of the best mentors on-screen.
