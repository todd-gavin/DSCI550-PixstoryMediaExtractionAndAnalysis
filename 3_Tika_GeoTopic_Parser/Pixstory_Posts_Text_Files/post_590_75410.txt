I feel I haven t watched a movie if I don t cry buckets while watching or otherwise laugh my heart out My reactions has to be dramatic And after a long time a movie touched my heart and welled up my eyes I happened to catch a Turkish movie MY FATHER S VIOLIN and loved it The Netflix movie which released on January Is about bond between an eight year old orphan girl Ozlem daughter of a street musician living in Europe and her successful famous violinist uncle After passing away of her father the child is handed over to the social services however the bandmates connect with her uncle to help them keep the child Forced to live with each other due to circumstances the two connect through their shared grief and love for music The movie is also a journey about healing of an emotionally scared man and his realisation that family and love requires understanding and sacrifice and ego and arrogance can only make things worse The protagonist accepts vulnerability of emotions and unselfishness of loving My Father s Violin Turkish Babamin Kemani is aTurkish film directed by Anda Haznedaroglu and starring G lizar Nisa Uray Engin Altan D zyatan and Bel im Bilgin The protagonist Mehmeet Mahir played by Ertugul fame actor and Turkish heartthrob Engin Altan Duzyantan to perfection equally supported by Gulizar It s from very early on when the father tells her child that every human has a melody that one realises music plays a beautiful part in the movie and we do get to hear some beautiful pieces of music through the film A few reviews highlight the lack of powerful dialogue as a shortcoming but I feel the emotions portrayed on screen are powerful enough to compensate for that I believe sometimes if the expression is subtle and not over board the emotion called love can be expressed better This is why language was no barrier I won t call it over simplification of emotions because I feel the movies simplicity is it s strength So do give it a try
