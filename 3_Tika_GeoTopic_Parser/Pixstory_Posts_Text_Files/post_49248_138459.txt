 Staring at the ceiling in the dark Same old empty feeling in your heart Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast Well you see her when you fall asleep But never to touch and never to keep Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep Well you only need the light when it s burning low Only miss the sun when it starts to snow Only know you love her when you let her go Only know you ve been high when you re feeling low Only hate the road when you re missing home Only know you love her when you let her go Only kmow you love her when you let her go That line has a lot of depth It is for someone who is unsure of the importance of a certain individual in their life and about how they feel about that person They is unsure if they truly want to spend their entire lives together He is caught up in all of the aforementioned issues He s singing that until he lets her go he won t truly know how much he loves her Until he lets her go he won t realise the effect that girl has on his life He will realise he loves her when she is gone because of the void she will leave in his life Sometimes you fail to value something until it s gone Another interpretation could be him letting go of his obsession with her and becoming selfless Because like they say there s nothing like tough love Love is soft it is selfless
