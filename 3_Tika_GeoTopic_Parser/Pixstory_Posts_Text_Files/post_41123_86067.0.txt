Imani Oakley, who is running a progressive primary campaign in New Jersey's 10th congressional district, has received yet another high-profile endorsement, this time from Black Lives Matter PAC, which aims to elect progressive community leaders, activists, and working-class candidates who are fighting for Black liberation. 

"To me, 'Black Lives Matter' isn't just a slogan," Oakley explained. "It symbolises the bare minimum in terms of respect for myself, my family, and my community. My platform includes specifics on how we'll combat white supremacy, such as a counterterrorism task force focused solely on white supremacist organisations, a plan to invest in the community while divesting from further police militarization, a National Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and checks for reparations for descendants of enslaved people.‚Äù

Insider NJ reported that the Senator Raphael Warnock, Georgia Gubernatorial Candidate Stacey Abrams, and Oakley's fellow congressional progressive candidate Nina Turner are among the other endorsees for this round of Black Lives Matter PAC endorsements (OH-11). 

Brand New Congress, Catch Fire, Elect Black Women PAC, the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund, Americans for Justice in Palestine Action Fund, West Orange Young Democrats, Harvard Dems, Building Bridges For America, Roadmap for Progress, FutureGen PAC, four local Sunrise Movement hubs, Black Lives Matter activist Zellie Imani, and Mt. Rainier Vice Mayor Scott Johnson have all endorsed Oakley's campaign.
