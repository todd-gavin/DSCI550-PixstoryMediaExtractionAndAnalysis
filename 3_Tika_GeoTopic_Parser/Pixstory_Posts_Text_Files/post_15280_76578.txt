A study conducted by researchers from the Bruno Kessler Foundation and Cnr Isti published in Scientific Reports analyzed the changes in daily behavior and the ability to adapt to precautionary measures following the onset of Covid, a decrease in visits to shops and permanence was found in the places visited What impact did the first year of the pandemic have on human behavior The study focused on this question The research published in Scientific Reports was based on the GPS data of thousands of anonymously processed cell phones in the United States from January to September during the study period, the number of visits to stores and other places of interest decreased, marking a comparison with the pre-pandemic period in New York State, and at the same time, the length of stay in the places visited decreased. The study also found that people maintained a protective behavior even in the reopening phase, continuing the trend to visit fewer places and above all to spend less time. From the observation and analysis of the data, it emerges that with the continuation of the pandemic, people have begun to pay less attention to the data on the number of cases and of deaths caused by the pandemic and their perception of risk has somehow changed This has changed their behavior as a consequence Another hypothesis that economic reasons have in any case prompted them to return to frequenting more places and to stay there longer says Lorenzo Lucchini, researcher at the Foundation Kessler Fewer precautions were found at home The analyzes also showed that while people have generally reduced social contacts to reduce the probability of contagion in places of interest, the same precautions have not been maintained inside homes concludes Luca Pappalardo researcher of Cnr Isti Within the domestic walls, then, we have not been so careful to reduce social contacts with non-cohabiting people and this despite the fact that contacts in that type of environment contribute significantly to the spread of infections
