Last year, on November 2 Jai Bhim was released and it created an uproar among the audiences as to how caste in our society are still lurking around even after more than 7 decades of independence and how the inhumane treatment against Bahujan and tribe community is still there. So after watching repetitive biopics and nationalism based movies it was an air of fresh breath after a long time and now the movie has been chosen for Oscar's.
