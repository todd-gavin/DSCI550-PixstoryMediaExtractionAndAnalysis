The global dairy industry is changing Among the disruptions is competition from food alternatives not produced using animals including potential challenges posed by synthetic milk Synthetic milk does not require cows or other animals It can have the same biochemical make up as animal milk but is grown using an emerging biotechnology technique know as precision fermentation that produces biomass cultured from cells More than of the world s population regularly consume dairy products There have been increasing calls to move beyond animal based food systems to more sustainable forms of food production Synthetic milks offer dairy milk without concerns such as methane emissions or animal welfare But it must overcome many challenges and pitfalls to become a fair sustainable and viable alternative to animal based milk Not a sci fi fantasy My recent research examined megatrends in the global dairy sector Plant based milks and potentially synthetic milks emerged as a key disruption Unlike synthetic meat which can struggle to match the complexity and texture of animal meat synthetic milk is touted as having the same taste look and feel as normal dairy milk Synthetic milk is not a sci fi fantasy it already exists In the US for example the Perfect Day company supplies animal free protein made from microflora which is then used to make ice cream protein powder and milk In Australia start up company Eden Brew has been developing synthetic milk at Werribee in Victoria The company is targeting consumers increasingly concerned about climate change and in particular the contribution of methane from dairy cows CSIRO reportedly developed the technology behind the Eden Brew product The process starts with yeast and uses precision fermentation to produce the same proteins found in cow milk CSIRO says these proteins give milk many of its key properties and contribute to its creamy texture and frothing ability Minerals sugars fats and flavours are added to the protein base to create the final product Reas more
