Fifteen days ago, few had thought of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in heroic terms. Now, the pendulum has swung to the other extreme. He is being compared with some of the greatest wartime leaders like Winston Churchill and Benjamin Franklin. There are, surely, some aspects in which Zelensky’s conduct is reminiscent of great figures, but, beyond that, it would be too early to tell.

It’s not for the genius of military strategy but for communicating with his people that Zelensky reminds many of Winston Churchill in inspiring Britons during the difficult phase of World War II. 

* When Rep. Mike Quigley (Democrat, Illinois) spoke to ABC News about the call between Zelensky and Congress members, he appreciated the “calm,” heroic” and “unprecedented” attitude of the Ukrainian president and said he was “like Churchill during the blitz”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDQ2Lft2mQA

* Andrew Roberts, who wrote the biography “Churchill: Walking with Destiny” (2018), said Zelensky’s courage and non-nonsense communication with Ukrainians about the Russian aggression were similar to Churchill’s: https://www.commentary.org/john-podhoretz/is-it-ok-to-compare-zelenskyy-to-churchill/ Also at: https://soundcloud.com/commentarymagazine/is-it-ok-to-compare-zelenskyy-to-churchill

*Churchill, of course, is remembered for great rhetorical powers – something Zelensky misses. But historian Kenneth Osgood feels both mastered the communication tools available to them and put them to the best use: https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-volodymyr-zelenskyy-entertainment-media-social-media-896ac1afc240fdf349c0d4c96d5e2afc

*To Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, Zelensky’s messages to the US are reminiscent of Benjamin Franklin seeking French support for the American Revolution – a move that changed history.

It is the circumstances plus his attitude that has made the former TV actor a hero to his people. Ukrainians might have shown the same resolve and all that was expected of the leadership was not goof up by, say, fleeing the scene. 

Are experts reading too much? If so, it might be because the European soil is witnessing a military conflict of this scale after a while, and it is a human tendency to make sense of what is happening by checking it against the templates found from experience, that is, from history.

Also, the story is still developing: Zelensky’s place in history will be decided by the outcome.
