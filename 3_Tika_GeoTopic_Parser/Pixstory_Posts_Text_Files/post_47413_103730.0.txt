In 38 games for the Red Devils in 2021-22, the 37-year-old scored 24 goals and added three
assists, including 18 goals and three assists in 30 Premier League outings.

In addition, Ronaldo scored six goals in seven Champions League appearances, propelling the
squad to the competition's final stage.

Despite missing the season's last game against Palace due to a hip flexor complaint, the Portugal international scored six goals in four straight league games and has two Premier
League hat-tricks this season, proving that he is still one of the top players in the world.

FLOP OF THE SEASON-JADON SANCHO

Flop is a harsh term to describe Jadon Sancho as a player, especially since he is only 22 years
old and is expected to grow with the correct management and system in place at Manchester
United.

Few can disagree, however, that Sancho's 2021/22 season was a tremendous failure.
Old Trafford paid Â£72 million for the 22-year-old in the summer, a price that seemed acceptable
given his recent success with Borussia Dortmund.

In 38 games for Manchester United this season, Sancho has only five goals and three assists.

In contrast, he scored 16 goals and assisted 20 for BVB in 38 games in 2020/21, 20 goals and
20 assists in 44 games the previous season, and 13 goals and 20 assists in 43 games in
2018/19.

CRISTIANO RONALDO (EIGHTEEN GOALS)- Top Scorer

Cristiano Ronaldo, despite his age, had 18 goals and three assists in 30 Premier League appearances this season. The Portuguese also scored six goals in seven Champions League matches, with his outstanding goal-scoring in the group stage being the only reason the Red Devils even advanced to the last 16.
