I apologize if it seems like I'm attacking Christianity, that was never my intention. 

But since when did we as Americans become so soft hearted that we lost our voice to call out a wrong??? Let's call a spade a spade. 

There is no generalisation of Christianity, Christianity has been institutionalized throughout the country with the help of government with schemes having malignant intentions. 

You talk of Christians being unsafe outside USA. Do you know that in more than 100 countries Missionaries of Christianity have been converting natives to Christianity by tempting them with hordes of money and powerful job titles. They prey on the poor when they are down and out to convert their religion for something as basic as food. 

So as far as persecution of Christians goes, they are the ones who are persecuting people around the world, converting them through corrupting them, or preying on their dilemmas. 

It's very easy to go and cry to the ref, what's difficult is to stand up and admit our wrongs and strive to make sure that we are doing better on those counts, and that is what is and should be expected of Christianity
