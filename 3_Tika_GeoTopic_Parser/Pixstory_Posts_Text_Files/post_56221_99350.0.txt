People are out and moving on with their activities. Public gatherings appear to be back to where they were pre-pandemic. Many restrictions have been lifted and most people are enjoying their freedom. How are the citizens of the UK going to live with the Covid-19?
‌
‌Covid is still deadly yet due to vaccinations, innovative treatment and drugs, the odds of getting seriously ill and not surviving are much lower than in earlier waves. It is best to be to stay off work or away from vulnerable people if you have symptoms - whether it's Covid or flu, there is a need to reduce the risk of infecting others.
‌
‌Introduction of two new variants.4 and BA.5 - are thought to have contributed to a new wave in South Africa- is a matter of concern. We cannot afford one more lockdown amidst this inflation, hence we need to be careful and strengthen our immunity.
‌
‌Long covid symptoms are another issue. Many after days after having covid might face, symptoms like weariness and shortness of breath. According to the ONS, about 1.7 million people in private households in the UK (2.7% of the population) had long Covid symptoms in March.

‌‌As most of the viruses become milder over time- we hope the same for Covid-19 too. As covid is becoming less lethal many have forgotten about masks. It was reported in 2020 that before Covid, failing to wear a mask in the region during the flu season was regarded as anti-social.
