After a formal opening ceremony at Birmingham's Alexander Stadium, the 2022 Commonwealth Games were declared open.

Manpreet Singh, the squad captain for the men's hockey team, and Olympic medalist PV Sindhu are the representatives of India. Neeraj Chopra was supposed to carry the Indian flag during the opening ceremony, however he got injured while competing in the World Athletics Championships, where he took home the silver medal. Because of the injury, he was forced to withdraw from CWG 2022.

At the Alexander Stadium, a section meant to highlight the variety of the city was introduced by drummer-percussionist Abraham Paddy Tetteh before being led by Indian classical vocalist and composer Ranjana Ghatak. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative influence on the Games, which are expected to be the biggest and most expensive athletic event in the UK since the 2012 London Olympics.

Prince Charles was present at the opening ceremony as its primary guest. On July 27, the Queen's Baton arrived in the Birmingham Games village. British screenwriter Steven Knight, who also wrote the popular crime drama "Peaky Blinders," has created the full opening ceremony, which is scheduled to stretch for roughly two and a half hours.

Speaking of the CWG, athletes have signed up for the multi-sport competition from over 72 different countries and territories. On the meantime, India won 66 medals at the previous Commonwealth Games, which were held in Australia's Gold Coast.
