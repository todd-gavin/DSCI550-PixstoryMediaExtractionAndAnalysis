Crime stories are real thrillers.  Read this CNN reportage if you have any doubts. 

It was November 25, 2019, and in the space of a few short minutes, some of the world's most valuable historic jewels had vanished.

A trial with the six men accused of carrying out one of the biggest jewel thefts in history has started in Germany on Friday, January 28. But the mystery of what happened to the treasures they are alleged to have stolen endures.

This is the story of a heist that stunned the world -- and the meticulous police work that led to the capture of six members of the family gang that police say are believed to be responsible for it.

Adorned with more than 4,300 diamonds, the treasures stolen from the Green Vault were worth at least 113 million euro ($128 million), according to the state prosecutor's office. However, the director of Dresden's State Art Collection, Marion Ackermann, said their material value doesn't even begin to reflect their "incalculable" historical and cultural importance.
