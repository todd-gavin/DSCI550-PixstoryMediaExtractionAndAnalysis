If you meet someone and they tell you that have finally started therapy;

❌  Don't say :

• You can talk to me instead, why need therapy?
• Don't ask, "Why? What's wrong with you?"
• Don't say only insane people go there.
• Dont say, "But you seem normal to me" 


✅ Try saying this instead: 

• I'm happy for you.
• Everyone can benefit from therapy. It's great.
• You are doing the right thing by taking care of your mental health.
• If you ever want to talk to someone, I'm here.
• I support you.
• I'm proud of you.


Mental health matters!!
