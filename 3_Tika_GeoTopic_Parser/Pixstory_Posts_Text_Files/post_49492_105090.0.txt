Everyday there's a new case. It's maddening! And everyday I see people still supporting gun ownership.

It's true that prohibiting civilian gun ownership wouldn't fully eradicate gun violence, but it would make it less likely. It would also save the lives of tens of thousands of people. There's a reason so many of these mass shooters wait until they're 18 to carry out these acts. And the reason is that America is allowing them to commit them when they're 18. If they had the power to illegally buy firearms they wouldn't need to wait until their birthdays. It's no rocket science!

Mass shooters are extremely unlikely to be stopped by an armed civilian or even cops, as we recently witnessed. My blood still boils just thinking about it. And why must they be stopped in the act of killing when they should be stopped from committing them at all??

Armed citizens may make the situation worse in the case of a mass shooting by misleading first responders and everyone around them about who the perpetrator is.
