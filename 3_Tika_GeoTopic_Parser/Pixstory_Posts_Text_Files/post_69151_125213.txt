The reason I stopped playing Table Tennis in was because I didn t have a proper source of income at that time and I wasn t earning any money by playing the sport So I left and took up a job in a school but the passion for the sport was always within me and that s why I started coaching in and I felt that I could still play the sport professionally That s why I made a come back I think although that the sport of Table Tennis is very famous throughout the country and many people play it for fun The main problem arises with the future prospects so I believe that the Government should increase the Sports Quota in Jobs so that more players are encouraged to take up the sport professionally and not play just to pass time These days only the top get the jobs even through this Quota the other players who don t win championships are left behind This was why I had left the sport when I did but then God had other plans
