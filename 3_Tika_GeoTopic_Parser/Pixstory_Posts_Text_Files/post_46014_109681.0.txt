It’s ironic how our politicians always conveniently leave our native Americans from every debate. And the same happened with Roe Vs Wade.

As per KHN, since Native American tribes are sovereign nations with their own laws, could they provide abortion services on Native land in states that may soon outlaw abortion? This is a question Rachael Lorenzo first started hearing a few weeks ago from random people on Twitter and journalists looking for interviews. 

The majority of the inquiries, according to Lorenzo and other Native abortion rights activists, have been from non-Natives. 

The proponents claimed they were unaware of any tribes or Indigenous organisations pushing for the establishment of abortion facilities on tribal property. The nation's largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood, said KHN that it is not looking into this possibility and that such decisions should be left to Indigenous people. 

According to the advocates, any such scheme would face numerous financial, political, and legal obstacles. 

“All of a sudden, this issue that’s going to impact white women too — or impact white women more broadly — now we’re being seen as the potential savior,” Lorenzo said. “It should not be on tribal nations to go above and beyond when so many tribal nations already have very limited resources.”

“I think people are throwing spaghetti at the wall and then suddenly remembered, ‘Oh, yeah, tribal sovereignty.’”

“It’s sort of a weird argument to say, ‘Oh can tribes help?’ Like, no, tribes are already in a worse position than you are,” she said.
