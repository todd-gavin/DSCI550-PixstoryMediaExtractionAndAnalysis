In what seems like a desperate attempt by the Mexican government to shift blame and refuse to take accountability for their failures to stop the proliferation of drug cartels and firearm traffickers decided to sue five US gun dealers, alleging that they are contributing to the rise in drug trafficking into the United States.Whatever the merits of this case may be, for decades, Mexico has utterly failed to reign in its drug and arms cartels, which has contributed to the normalization of cartels which have contributed to possibly millions of deaths, human trafficking, murder, and torture within both Mexico and the United States.Seeing a lawsuit like this, being filed by the country who is in the best position to end the drug and illegal firearms crises is shocking, to say the least, and it shows that Mexico is trying to make the problem seem as much as our problem as theirs.They’re not hiding this attempt too. As they said in a statement: “The lawsuit addresses a cause shared by both countries, whose citizens suffer from illicit firearms practices.”
