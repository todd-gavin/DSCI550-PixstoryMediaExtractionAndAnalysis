In the UEFA Nations League, the Republic of Ireland will face Scotland at the Aviva Stadium on
Saturday.

The Republic of Ireland comes into this match having recently lost 1-0 to Oleksandr Petrakov's
Ukraine. Ukraine won thanks to a goal by Dynamo Kyiv midfielder Viktor Tsyhankov.

Scotland, on the other side, recently defeated Joaquin Caparros' Armenia 2-0. Scotland's victory
was completed by goals from Celtic right-back Anthony Ralston and Nottingham Forest
center-back Scott McKenna in the first half.

Republic of Ireland vs. Scotland:Prediction

Despite their dismal Nations League record, the Republic of Ireland will hope to have a change of
fortunes at some stage. While that may not necessarily come on Saturday, we feel that the Green Army
will do enough to claim a hard-earned share of the spoils in a tight match.

Prediction: Republic of Ireland 0-0 Scotland
