Delhi: Two new studies have confirmed anecdotal evidence and data from older studies: that Adivasis, Dalits and Muslims live shorter lives than upper-caste Hindus—and even other backward Hindu castes—with the disparity between upper-caste Hindus and Muslims widening over the last two decades.



Compared to upper caste Hindus and other backward castes (OBCs), Adivasis die four years earlier, Dalits three years earlier and Muslims a year earlier, according to the first new study, published in March 2022 in the Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), a global scientific journal. 


The second new study, published in April 2022 by two US and Indian researchers in the Population and Development Review, a global journal, reported that the Muslim life-expectancy gap with upper-caste Hindus had worsened from marginal—2.1 years in women and 0.3 years in men in 1997-2000—to about 2.8 years in women and 2.6 years in men in 2013-16.


The differences between the life expectancy of higher-caste Hindus and the life expectancies of Adivasis and Dalits are comparable to the Black–White gap in the US in terms of “absolute magnitude”, said the PNAS study, released in March 2022 and conducted by three researchers from India and US.


The researchers of the PNAS study found the reasons for the disparities were not wealth alone, since economic status explained less than half the life-expectancy gap, which could not be accounted for even by environmental factors and urban-rural differences. 
The researchers said further research on causes of death, segregation, behaviours, and risk factors, such as occupational exposures in the social groups, may help understand the disparities in mortality and life expectancy.  
Marginalised social groups in India—Dalits, Adivasis and Muslims—compose a population of over 450 million, greater than that of the United States. Each of these groups are among the largest marginalised social groups in the world. The findings of the latest study are in line with other studies and data (here and here) that point to similar disadvantages for these groups
