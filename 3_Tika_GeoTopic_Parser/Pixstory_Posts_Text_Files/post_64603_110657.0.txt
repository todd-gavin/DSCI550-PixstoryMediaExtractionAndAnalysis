The most awkward moment that i feel in my life was when i wore my house dress on the day we have to wear our casual school dress. I was looking all different between whole school. Everyone was in their normal dress . I couldnâ€™t even change the dress . Felt little shame . But that was funny moment for me and my friends tooo . This was not a big awkward moment but for me itâ€™s a lot ðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒ
