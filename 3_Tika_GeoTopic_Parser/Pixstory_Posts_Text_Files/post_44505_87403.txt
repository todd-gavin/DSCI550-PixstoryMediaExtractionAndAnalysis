Premier League leaders City were held to a goalless draw at Selhurst Park making Palace only the second team after Manchester United in to prevent Pep Guardiola s side from scoring both at home and away in a Premier League season The stalemate brought an end to a run of Premier League games in which City had scored dating back to Palace s win at the Etihad Stadium in October It also meant that the champions who are four points clear at the top of the table despite having played one more game than Liverpool had failed to score for the fourth time this season In comparison to Guardiola Liverpool has only failed to score once all season with Neville noting Jurgen Klopp s plethora of attacking skill If Liverpool play that game at Palace they win that game because they have better strikers and finishers he told Monday Night Football They are more ruthless and there is more of them five players you would put your money on Whereas at City there are more wide players playing in those positions Phil Foden is a midfielder player but he s playing centre forward Jack Grealish could be a midfielder but he plays on the left of a three up front City have got outstanding players in that team fantastic players but for as brilliant as they are they are not the most ruthless or clinical in front of goal Luis Diaz Diogo Jota Roberto Firmino Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah are all at Liverpool and they will score goals City are a brilliant team and could still win this league but that could be the difference Liverpool are really dangerous I look at those five strikers they have got They go into the last part of the season knowing they can win an awful lot of football matches with those five up front City don t have the same luxury in attacking areas
