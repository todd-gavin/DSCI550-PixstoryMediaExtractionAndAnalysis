Liverpool were in desperate need for a big, physical centre back last summer. Ibrahima 

Konate presented as just the right option when it came to the English club's requirements and the two parties were quick to complete the deal within the window.


Fast forward 9 months into the new season, and the €40 million Liverpool spent on him at the time is starting to seem more and more like €40 million well spent.

 Konate isn't just a replacement for Virgil Van Dijk (who was injured when Leipzig sold Konate), he's established himself as a regular in Jürgen Klopp's side.


So much so that he's now on an impressive run of unbeaten games with Liverpool. That is correct, they haven't lost with the Frenchman starting.

 One should hope that Konate brings more of his good-luck charm to the pitch as his side enters the final stretch of a season, one in which they'll be competing for multiple trophies with the Carabao Cup already in the bag.


“I think the last game I lost that I started was with Leipzig in the Champions League against Paris Saint-Germain in November 2020. I also know that the last time I lost a league game I started was on January 19, 2019 against Dortmund!


“It’s a nice stat to have, but of course it’s not me – it’s the team.”


The central defender opened Liverpool's scoring against Benfica in the Champions League with a well placed header — his first in a Reds shirt.


“If we just think, ‘Oh, we will see’ then this is not the best mentality. We have to think, ‘Yes, we have to win, to win, to win’ if we are to have the chance to earn another trophy. If we think like that, we will be more focused.


Elite Mentality. Champion of a footballer. Chapeau bas — Ibrahima Konate!
