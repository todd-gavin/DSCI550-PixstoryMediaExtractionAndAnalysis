Anonymity on social media is a relevant discussion. Hiding behind a mask can give someone a right to say things without feeling intimidated by the consequences, as no one would know.
When you're under surveillance, there's a fear and doubt of getting caught or punished, but if that fear is mitigated through such options, then you're free.
No one to doubt you or penalize your actions.
Despite the existence of countless incidents of online abuse, there are no strict laws that can put an end to it.
Yes, there are laws, but most of the online abuse is left unseen. 
There are many reasons; firstly, people receiving such abuse are often reluctant to discuss and address it.
They read it and experience the trauma and impertinence of such acts but choose to keep their mouths shut.
So whoever makes it obvious and talks about it publicly needs to be applauded because by doing so, you're not only making it easier for those who don't speak but also letting the world know of the cruelty that exists and continues to harm people.
More work needs to be done here to acknowledge the online abuse and comments that make people suffer all their lives.
