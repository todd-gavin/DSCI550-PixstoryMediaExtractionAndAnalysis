“Only One Earth” was the slogan for the 1972 Stockholm Conference; 50 years on, this truth still holds – this planet is our only home. 🌍

World Environment Day is celebrated on June 5 each year, led by the United Nations Environment Programme, to raise awareness about the degrading environment and encourage people to take positive actions and help create a better future.🌳

#OnlyOneEarth advocates for transformative environmental change on a global scale. The campaign shines a spotlight on climate action, nature action and pollution action while encouraging everyone, everywhere to live sustainably.🌳🌴

While our individual consumption choices do make a difference, it is collective action that will create the transformative environmental change we need, so we can advance to a more sustainable and just Earth, where everyone can flourish.🌍♻️
