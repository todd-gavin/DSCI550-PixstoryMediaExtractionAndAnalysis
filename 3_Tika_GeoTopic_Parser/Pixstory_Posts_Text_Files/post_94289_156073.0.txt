Let's have a look at all of Barcelona's player ratings from their recent match against Real Madrid.
1) Ter Stegen - 6
Conceded three goals and was rendered helpless by flaws from his defenders.

Failed to execute his defensive responsibilities after being outplayed due to a lack of pace and precision.
3) Jules Kunde - 6
Failed to deal with the Real Madrid forwards and prevent the second goal from being scored.
4) Eric Garcia - 4
A terrible mistake which led to Real's second goal. Conceded a penalty in stoppage time as well.
5) Alejandro Balde - 5
Lost the ball at dangerous positions and was outplayed by Valverde in particular. 
6) Frenkie De Jong - 6.5

7) Sergio Busquets - 4
Failed to stop Kross who outran him to break the press and create the first goal on the counter.
8) Pedri - 5.5
Looked helpless in front of Madrid's midfield and was outplayed by Modric in particular.
9) Raphinha - 6.5
Created a few good-looking chances for Lewandowski but wasn't up to the mark against the press.
10) Robert Lewandowski - 5
