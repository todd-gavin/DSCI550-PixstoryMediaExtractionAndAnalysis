In the deliciously entertaining Knives Out Johnson goes back to his roots with an updated homage to the Agatha Christie whodunnits he loved as a child and to those cheekily self aware screen adaptations in which Peter Ustinov would lead an all star cast through a labyrinthine murder mystery The setting is a gothic pile in modern day New England where crime writer Harlan Thrombey Christopher Plummer has recently capped his th birthday celebrations by dying dramatically in his attic study It looks like an open and shut suicide but could one of Harlan s variously leechy family members witheringly described as a bunch of self made over achievers have slit his throat After all the old man spent the evening settling old scores and cleaning house As with the very best whodunnits everything is set up and sneakily signalled in the opening moments of the drama but it s only on second viewing that those early clues become evident There s real pleasure to be had watching Johnson wind the coiled springs of his steel trap plot yet none of it would bite if we didn t care about the characters who remain just on the right side of caricature Built upon a wittily verbose script that delivers more laugh out loud lines than most of the year s alleged comedies Knives Out retains a beating human heart into which daggers are regularly plunged Witness Linda delivering a stinging reminder that all this entertaining mystery is playing out in the wake of a family tragedy with Curtis s imperious performance capturing that balance between the arch and the empathetic that is the film s signature
