As Moscow's troops withdrew from Lyman, a crucial eastern city, Kiev declared it was in full control, raising more concerns about Russia's sputtering military operation in Ukraine. Al Jazeera reported that it is Kyiv's biggest combat victory in weeks and puts more pressure on the Kremlin by serving as a potential staging area for stepped-up eastward assaults. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president of Ukraine, declared on Sunday that his troops had taken control of Lyman after encircling it the day before. “As of 12:30pm (09:30 GMT) Lyman is cleared fully. Thank you to our militaries, our warriors,” he said in a video address.The Russian military remained silent on Lyman on Sunday after claiming the day before that it was pulling out of the area to go to "more advantageous positions."Russian forces have relied on Lyman for months as a key logistics and rail centre in the Donetsk region to convey troops, equipment, and other essential supplies. The loss of Lyman represents a serious setback for them.“Without those routes, it will be more difficult so it presents a sort of a dilemma for the Russians going forward,” US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said.
