Igor Tudor coach of Hellas Verona spoke to DAZN after the match against Fiorentina Today Verona came to Florence and played a great match In the first half we could have been them they scored with a rebound We had a good match the well deserved point If a team had to win it was ours We did interesting things because when I see Fiorentina play with the others at home I see that they are in difficulty We missed the last pass For me the number of shots on target has no importance If Lasagna arrives ahead of Terracciano and it doesn&#39;t shoot like this It&#39;s always a chance I don&#39;t care about the data let&#39;s look at the chances Lasagna moved a lot and well I only took it off because Caprari was no longer able to follow Torreira and I put Bessa on him For me Lasagna made a great deal race Kickest photo credits
