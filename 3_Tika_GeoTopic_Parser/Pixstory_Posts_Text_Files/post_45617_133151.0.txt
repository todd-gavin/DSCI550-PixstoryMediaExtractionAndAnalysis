Often the world thinks of us Americans as lazy. My international friends have told me that they think of an average American as lethargic individuals who just know how to eat junk food and drink. But is that really the truth? 

No. In fact, we Americans are most productive but most overworked individuals. We work long hours with minimal rest and holidays . I am not saying this but survey held over the years are testimony to this argument. 

At least 134 countries have laws setting the maximum length of the work week; the U.S. does not. According to BLS time-use surveys, full-time employed females in the U.S. work an average of 8.33 hours per day, while full-time employed males work an average of 9.09 hours per day.
According to OECD stats, U.S. workers work an average of 1,767 hours per year versus an OECD country average of 1,687.

I am sure many of you will relate to this! And honestly, itâ€™s time we do something about it!
