The Champions League? The best team don't always win. Real Madrid were not the best team this season, without taking away any merit because they are the Champions League champions and they are always there. 

Losing against Real Madrid in the UCL? The Real Madrid tie killed us. It killed me and the whole dressing room in general. We really wanted to win the Champions League.

"I know what Real Madrid is like, I've lived it for many years, all my life. They score a goal out of nowhere and they automatically change the game.

Against Real Madrid, if a strange play or a goal happens, it changes the game. I already knew it could happen [Real Madrid comeback] and it happened to us and to all the teams [Chelsea, City and Liverpool] and it's not the first time... 

I'm really eager to win the Champions League again.
