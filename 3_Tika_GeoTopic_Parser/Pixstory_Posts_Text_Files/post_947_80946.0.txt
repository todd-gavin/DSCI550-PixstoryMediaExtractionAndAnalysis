Since the end of cold war, the situation has never been so tense between the USA and Russia. 
In a bid to cool the situation down, the US President Joe  Biden spoke with Russian President Putin. The phone call comes after  a week of diplomatic efforts to avoid conflict with little or no success.

Multiple countries have urged their citizens to leave and evacuated embassies in Ukraine as tensions soar, CNN reported. 

A Russian invasion of Ukraine "could begin at any time," US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. 

So its all seems quite tensed now
