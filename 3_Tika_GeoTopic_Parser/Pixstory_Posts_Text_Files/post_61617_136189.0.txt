Fightful Select reported on Monday, 29 August that former WWE Superstar Braun Strowman could return to the company as part of a series of returns under the regime of Paul ‘Triple H’ Levesque. This will seemingly take place on next week’s Monday Night Raw broadcast.
Per PWInsider’s Mike Johnson, ‘The Monster Among Men’ will return to the organisation on next Monday’s Raw from Kansas City. It’s unknown what, exactly, Strowman will be doing there, though a return to the main event scene is to be expected.
Braun Strowman was cut from WWE last June, coming as one of the company’s most shocking releases. The former Universal, Intercontinental, and Raw Tag Team Champion had spent six years on WWE’s main roster prior to then after debuting on the Raw after SummerSlam 2015.
Since being let go from WWE, Braun wrestled as ‘The Titan’ Adam Scherr across eight matches. He’d been heavily linked to EC3’s Control Your Narrative, with the movement transforming into a promotion co-ran by EC3 and Braun earlier this year. It’s unknown what role Strowman will play in the company moving forward.
Braun’s last WWE match occurred during May 2021’s WrestleMania Backlash pay-per-view, challenging for the Universal Championship.
