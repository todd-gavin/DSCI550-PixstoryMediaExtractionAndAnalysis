Fancy designations, deadly workâ€”something that you would associate with journalists covering wars, alias War correspondents. 

Be it Clarissa Ward or Barkha Dutt, covering wars as scribes are the ultimate test as you could die in combat any minute, any day. 

Late Photojournalist Danish Siddiqui of Reuters and other Indian journalists won the coveted Pulitzer Prize along with Adnan Abidi, Sanna Irshad Mattoo, and Amit Dave for their images of death and despair faced during the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in India.

The scribe was killed last year while covering a clash between Afghan special forces and the Taliban.

Awarding Danish a Pulitzer is a befitting tribute to the departed soul as he was a man who focused on the job at hand. The photos he clicked of the bodies being cremated, represented the plight of Indians during what seemed like a never-ending nightmare worldwide.

Danish's legacy shall live on forever! 

Though this award may not bring back the departed soul we lost, but this award shall ensure that he is never forgotten.
