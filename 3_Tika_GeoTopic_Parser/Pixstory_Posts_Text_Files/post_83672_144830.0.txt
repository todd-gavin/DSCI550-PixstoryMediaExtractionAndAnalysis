I used to believe that if I gained enough muscle and shed enough fat. I would be happy, content, and satisfied, but the truth is that I am happy but not content or satisfied. I am constantly trying to be better than I was yesterday. That is one of the most unexpected benefits of exercising. And one of my favourite benefits, because the mindset shift to always look for ways to improve every day. Regardless of whether you have already achieved a level that you used to look up to, speaks volumes not only about your health and fitness goals, but also about every other aspect of your life, and it's pretty awesome.
