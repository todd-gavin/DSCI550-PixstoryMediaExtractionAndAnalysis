One of the biggest dangers of meat is that it blocks your arteries. This happens because meat contains high levels of saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium. These fats, cholesterol and sodium build up in your arteries over time, leading to heart disease and other health problems.

Studies have also shown that women are particularly at risk for these problems because they tend to have smaller arteries than men and they're more likely to develop heart disease later in life. In fact, one study found that women who ate the most meat were almost twice as likely to die from heart disease as women who ate the least meat!

And funnily enough, this is not even touching the tip of the iceberg. Health risks associated with meat are endless.

If you want to improve your overall health, then it's best to ditch the bacon and beef jerky and switch to a vegan diet instead. You'll be sure to stay healthy and avoid any dangerous side effects associated with meat consumption.
