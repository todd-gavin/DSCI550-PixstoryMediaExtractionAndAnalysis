Due to its original topic, premise, and subject inside the film's plot, Anek will undoubtedly generate buzz across the nation. The central government on the mainland has disregarded Northeast India for many years, which eventually led to an identity problem for the region's residents. People on the mainland generally view them as foreigners from nearby nations like Nepal, Thailand, China, Myanmar, or even Tibet.

We are grateful to filmmaker Anubhav Sinha for using popular film to highlight this important subject. 
As Joshua, an undercover police officer tasked with dealing with the militants in this less-traveled hilly terrain, Ayushman Khurana looks fantastic. The role of aspiring and conflicted boxer Aida, played by stunning supermodel Andrea Kevich√ºsa, is incredibly amazing and outstanding. Strong hearty applauses are due for even the roles played by the other cast members. 

Everyone should watch this movie, which is highly recommended.
