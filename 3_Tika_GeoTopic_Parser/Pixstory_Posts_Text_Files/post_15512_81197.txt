The Marmore waterfall formed by the Velino river near Terni in Umbria almost at the mouth of the Valnerina is the highest controlled-flow artificial waterfall in Europe and among the highest in the world, being able to count on an overall height difference of m divided into three jumps. name derives from the calcium carbonate salts present on the rocks similar to white marble It is part of the Nera river park There are only a few well-defined times in which you can see the waterfall at full capacity so if you decide to visit it, aim well to be able to admire it in all its power and splendor An important warning the site is not accessible to people with disabilities or motor problems at least as far as I could see except perhaps by accessing only from the lower part of the waterfall otherwise you have to take a path that counts in total between flights and stairs steps
