By Niraj SharmaNew Delhi: Seeking its seventh consecutive term in Gujarat, the Bharatiya Janata Party is trying hard to improve its performance in the forthcoming state Assembly polls. The party has finalised a strategy to improve its reach and vote count, leading to a better seat tally in the elections likely to be held later this year.This has been necessitated after instructions from the top central leadership of the BJP which wants to avoid a 2017-like scenario wherein the party could only secure 99 seats, its lowest ever show in two decades, slipping to two digits in the 182-member assembly. Though the BJP's tally finally rose to 111 due to bypolls that were necessitated after the resignation of Congress MLAs.Party sources stated that the saffron unit will aim to garner voters amongst additional communities, which aren't considered its stronghold in an effort to improve its reach.As a part of this outreach programme, the BJP will aim to garner more votes from the marginalised Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities. While the SC community is about 7%, the ST community has about 15% of the population of the state. Together, these communities can affect the outcome of polls in over 100 Assembly seats. Hence the requirement for a targeted approach, a senior leader said.The 2017 performance by the state unit of the BJP wasnâ€™t appreciated by its central leadership, forcing the top two, PM Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, to take charge of the situation and workers being instructed to reach out to voters well in time to avoid mistakes of past polls.The two senior leaders and BJP chief JP Nadda have been visiting Gujarat regularly over the past several years and regularly seek information and strategize with local leaders to ensure a sweep for the saffron unit.Read more: https://www.newsdrum.in/national/bjps-gameplan-for-best-ever-performance-in-gujarat-avoiding-a-repeat-of-2017-95809.html
