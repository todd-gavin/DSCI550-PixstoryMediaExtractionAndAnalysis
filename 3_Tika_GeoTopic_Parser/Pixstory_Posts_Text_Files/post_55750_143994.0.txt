According to police, an Australian man was killed when a kangaroo he had been keeping as a pet attacked him. BBC reported that on Monday, a relative discovered the 77-year-old man at his home in Redmond, which is around 250 miles (400 kilometres) south of Perth, with terrible injuries. The kangaroo stopped the ambulance staff from treating the man when they got to the remote farm. According to the police, they had to shoot the marsupial to death so that paramedics could attend to him. Man passed away there and then.Around 50 million kangaroos, which may weigh up to 90 kg and reach heights of 2 metres, can be found throughout Australia. Attacks that are deadly are uncommon, and this is the only one that has been reported in Australia since 1936. According to Graeme Coulson, a kangaroo behaviour expert, kangaroos have "a lot of weaponry" including sharp teeth, claws, and strong legs. According to Associate Professor Coulson, "it can be pretty deadly if they're cornered or in some form of distress." The issue with kangaroos and people is that both are erect, two-legged creatures, and a male kangaroo finds an upright stance challenging.Therefore, Aussies should know better and stay away from kangaroos!
