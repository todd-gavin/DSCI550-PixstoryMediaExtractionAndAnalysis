Forever 21 launched its first-ever brand campaign designed to emphasise where it started in Los Angeles and its evolution as a clothing brand. The rebrand will share L.A.’s multicultural ethos across the country with a more focused and inclusive marketing approach to expand the brand’s platforms through the campaign, from e-commerce and retail to social media and its first foray into the metaverse with a virtual store.

As part of the campaign, Forever 21 released a two-minute spot titled “A Little L.A. in All of Us.” The site is a love letter to L.A., celebrating the energy of the city and the people who drive its vibrant culture. Directed by L.A. native directors PHAM and John Merizalde, the campaign is inspired by the different lifestyles found in L.A. neighbourhoods. The modified brand logo highlights six distinct parts of the city: Downtown L.A., Koreatown, East L.A., Malibu, Hollywood and Venice. The work also spotlights cultural creators such as China Anne McClain and Madison Pettis across TikTok, Instagram and YouTube, reflecting each person’s unique style.

“Our birthplace is the inspiration and muse for our sense of style. From the beaches of Malibu to the skate parks of Venice to the streets of DTLA and the lights of Hollywood, Los Angeles is the ultimate destination for tourists, immigrants, and culture. LA is truly multicultural and a centre of innovation for music, cinema, the arts and fashion,” said Winnie Park, CEO.

To further emphasise the power of creativity in Los Angeles, Forever 21 partnered with Boys & Girls Club of America and Art Bridges The Gap to create four murals between Hollywood and Venice.
