Chelsea has made a name for itself as one of the top teams in the world. The team hasamassed a devoted fan base outside of the field and achieved considerable success on it.Under Roman Abramovich's ownership, the club gainednotoriety after a mediocre 20th-centuryexistence.
Chelsea will aim to capture their third European title this year when the 2022â€“23 Champions
League gets underway. The Blues will be aiming for their third European championship, andwith their current roster, they have a good chance of succeeding.

Unquestionably, Chelsea is one of the most evenly matched teams in all of Europe. Star players
from every position on the roster make up the team. The Blues have accumulated 10 points
from their six Premier League games so far this season, which puts them in sixth position
overall.

Here are three factors as to why Chelsea may win the Champions League yet again:
1. Strong defensive structure 
For any club, defense is the cornerstone of success. A strong defense wins you the championship, while a strong attacker wins you games. In recent years, Chelsea hastransformed into a defensive force. The team's primary strength is their strong defense.

They normally use a 3-4-2-1 formation, which is extremely adaptable. In such a system, thewing backs are essential since they offer options for both defense and offense. When defending,the wingbacks dig in and make it very difficult for the opposition's attackers to get through.
Kante and Jorginho form a potent midfield partnership that helps the defense. Despite the factthat both superstars were crucial to Chelsea's victory the previous season, their skill sets are
very different. While Jorginho aids in tempo and speed control, Kante serves more as a holding
midfielder who supports the side regaining possession.

Chelsea have a very formidable goalie to go along with all of this. In his four Premier Leagueoutings this season, Edouard Mendy has only allowed one goal. Chelsea is a serious UEFAChampions League contender.
