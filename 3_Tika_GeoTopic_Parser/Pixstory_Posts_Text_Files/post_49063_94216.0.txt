Many people regret getting rabbits, but the animals are the ones who suffer.
Bunnies are frequently abandoned at animal shelters, confined to an outside cage, or simply releasedâ€”despite the fact that they are vulnerable to harsh weather conditions, injuries, infections, parasite infestations, and predators. Shelters and rabbit rescues are overflowing with abandoned rabbits bought on the spur of the moment by people who didn't know caring for a bunny takes a lot of time, money, and effort.

One of the most compelling reasons to never buy a bunny for Easter and otherwise is that it contributes to the heinous cruelty of the pet trade. Despite regularly notifying the manager to sick and injured animals, no veterinary care is provided. Hundreds of animals, including rats, gerbils, guinea pigs, and a rabbit, are crammed inside a feces-strewn cooler and gassed with carbon dioxide. Their screams can be heard from the other side of the room.

Before discarding the animals' bodies in a garbage can or putting them in plastic bags to sell as "feeders," workers do not check for signs of life. Some sick or emaciated animals, such as rabbits, languish in cages for days without being cared for. They have less than a square foot of "living" space in some cases.

Bunnies are not toys, they are just as much of a commitment as a dog. They deserve love and proper care. It is vile to advocate for their exploitation just because it brings you joy. Toys bring children happiness, chocolates do, picnics do. You don't need to exploit a living being for it.
