A new video of the abducted child, Abdul Rauf Ebrahimi, has reached the media, showing that he is still alive.
In the video, which was apparently recorded on the first day of Ramadan, Abdul Rauf expresses his hope that he will be with his parents until the tenth of Ramadan, by paying the money requested by the kidnappers.

In this short video, Abdurrov talks about the pain and suffering he endures and asks his parents to release him from the clutches of the kidnappers before it is too late.

Abdul Rauf's father, Mohammad Nabi, contacted Afghanistan and asked the Taliban to help his family rescue their son.

But the Taliban appear to have been unable to find the perpetrators of Abdul Rauf Ebrahimi's abduction.
The previous Afghan government, despite much fanfare, could not find a clue to the abduction.

Abdul Rauf was nine years old when he was abducted by unknown individuals in Mazar-e-Sharif in mid-2016.
The kidnappers have repeatedly sent video and audio recordings of the child's torture to his family, demanding money.

The issue of Abdul Rauf's abduction is one of the most complex kidnappings in Afghanistan, which has not yet been resolved.

Earlier, the Taliban said they had arrested several people in connection with the child abduction, but no further information has been released.
