Today is Birth anniversary of The Great Comedian, Mehmood. Think of Mehmood and we remember the quintessential comic of hindi movies. Mehmood started his life with odd jobs that included selling eggs and chicken and some small roles as a child.  It was his stint as the driver of PL Sanoshi, well known film director, where he got noticed as a comic. Rest is history. 300 films, 25 filmfare nominations and the credit of having given Amitabh Bachchan to bollywood. Mehmood also left some great song sequences that we continue to cherish.
