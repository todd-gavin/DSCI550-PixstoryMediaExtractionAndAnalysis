There is no question that the media can have a very negative impact on one s self worth We compare ourselves to the perfect people we see on social media but we have to keep reminding ourselves that in reality these people are far from being perfect they still have problems just like you and I do They feel bloated they have acne they have bad hair day and so much more They re just like us We constantly read articles and news reports telling us that we are overweight underweight too old too young and so on There has been a lot of targeted advertising so there is a good chance that the constant ramming of this amazing product or that other one down your throat is making you feel inadequate It takes a lot to make good use of social media without letting it affect us negatively It s a great place to be as long as it is filtered Taking measures to make sure if doesn t have adverse effects on your own mental health is always a good start
