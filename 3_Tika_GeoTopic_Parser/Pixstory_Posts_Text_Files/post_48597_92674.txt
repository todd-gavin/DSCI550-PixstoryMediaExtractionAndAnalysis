There are two games left in this season Friday s duel for th place in Washington and Sunday s Garden finale against Toronto The Knicks are games under and fighting for a lottery spot much like in the old days However Knicks president Leon Rose must make the most of the final minutes this weekend by calling the shots on rotations The Knicks need Immanuel Quickley to start at point guard for the final two games and integrate with Evan Fournier and RJ Barrett s starting unit If the Knicks are unable to secure a real starting point guard for next season Quickley could be a fallback option Despite a sloppy performance against the Nets Quickley has been probably their greatest player since the All Star break for Allow him to run the show for minutes every night No one wants to see Alec Burks the current starter Burks should be placed in a cab bound crosstown by Knicks adviser William Wesley Quickley s biggest admirer so he can see the Mets play the Washington Nationals Burks scored points and added one assist in minutes against the Nets The Knicks have seen what he can accomplish when he s not in the starting lineup and it s not good enough
