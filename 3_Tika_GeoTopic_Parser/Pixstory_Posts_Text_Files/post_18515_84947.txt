In five days Chelsea&#39;s future looks completely different In just a few weeks they went from winning the Club World Cup to being run by a charity belonging to the club and now even being put up for sale the Russian oligarchs cornered by the international community and the patron Roman Abramovich has announced that he wants to step aside for the good of society I would like to address the speculation in the media in recent days in relation to my ownership of Chelsea, writes Chelsea in a statement signed by Abramovich I have always made decisions with the interest of the club at heart In the current situation therefore I have taken the decision to sell the club as I believe it is in the best interest of the club the fans the employees as well as the sponsors and partners of the club Abramovich it&#39;s all about money The sale of the club will not be expedited but due process will follow I will not ask for any loan to repay It&#39;s never about business or money for me it&#39;s pure passion I have also entrusted my team to set up a charitable foundation in which all net proceeds from the sale will be donated The foundation will benefit all victims of the war in Ukraine This includes providing essential funds for the urgent and immediate needs of victims as well as supporting long-term recovery work
