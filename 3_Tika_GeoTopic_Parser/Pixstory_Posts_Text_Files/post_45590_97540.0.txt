The time of Batwoman in Gotham has come to an end. 

After three seasons, The CW has cancelled the DC Comics drama. Caroline Dries, the showrunner, announced the news on social media on Friday. 

Dries tweeted, "Just got the awful news that Batwoman will not be seeing [season four]." "I'm disappointed, but grateful." It's a privilege to be a part of 51 episodes." 

Hollywood Reporter said that the cancellation comes less than a month after the network broadcasted the third season (and now series) finale of Batwoman. It also comes as The CW's owners, Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Global, are considering selling the network, with local TV giant Nexstar being a potential buyer. As a result, there has been speculation that the network will reduce its scripted series lineup.

The first season of Batwoman premiered in the fall of 2019 to positive reviews. The title character, aka Kate Kane, is a cousin of Bruce Wayne who takes up the mantle of Batwoman when he departs Gotham City.
