If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee A wave to pant beneath thy power and share The impulse of thy strength only less free Than thou O uncontrollable If even I were as in my boyhood and could be The comrade of thy wanderings over Heaven As then when to outstrip thy skiey speed Scarce seem d a vision I would ne er have striven As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need Oh lift me as a wave a leaf a cloud I fall upon the thorns of life I bleed A heavy weight of hours has chain d and bow d One too like thee tameless and swift and proud Percy Bysshe Shelley
