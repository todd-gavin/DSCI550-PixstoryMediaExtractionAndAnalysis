Antony - An intriguing signing 

Man United are set to complete their 2nd signing from Ajax, with Antony coming to Old Trafford for a steep fee of €100m. 

Now, initially I thought to myself, why on earth are United spending such extortionate figures on someone who’ll have to be a level raiser?

But then I thought, sure the money (is) extortionate, but that’s how inflated the market is, and the clubs incompetency to wait so late in the window, (which will have further adverse effects on United’s future negotiations).

Anyways, back to the point, avoiding the fee. Antony is a young, fearless, direct, incredibly skilful left footed right winger, a position United have not had for a good while. 

In todays market, the profile is incredibly rare let alone good right sided wingers. Olise, Gnabry, Diaby, Pino are a few names, but it was clear Antony was Ten Hag’s number one man since the off.

Antony can hold the width on the right, which is ideal for buildup, but without the biggest burst, an over/under lapping fullback (Dalot) along with a 9 to occupy players will be essential.

I think the signing of Antony also adds for a lot more fluidity & versatility along with much needed balance in United’s front line. Sancho currently has been used on the right, being left 1v3d a lot without a burst to escape, while Elanga/ Rashford occupy the left winger spot, which prevents Sancho playing in his best position.

I also like the Sancho central concept as a 10 - Antony off the right with Elanga/ Rashford off the left. A lot of interchanging, an exciting prospect while maintaining a runner. 

If United do utilise a Sancho Antony pairing however, I’m not a big fan of the dynamic as it’s very reliant on being a very dominant ball side (which United aren’t yet), and 2 ball to feet wingers, which becomes quite predictable. 

Ultimately, Antony’s success is very dependent on an effective supporting Dalot, to allow Antony to isolate his opponent where he’s most efficient.
