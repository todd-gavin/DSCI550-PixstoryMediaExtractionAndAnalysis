Scout Report - Young U19 Players taking the World by Storm
Verdict
Florian is one of the best-attacking midfielders. With his talent expect him to see playing at the top talent for at least a decade. He is a player who won’t take time to exploit the team’s weaknesses. However, he needs another season or two to develop before moving to big clubs outside Europe. He will be a talent to watch out for. 
Jude Bellingham 
BVB has been known for nurturing young talents like Jadon Sancho, and Erling Braut Haaland and selling them to big clubs Manchester United and City for a huge sum. They took young Bellingham for a reported fee of 25 million, making him the most expensive 17-year-old in history.
The position of Bellingham is very versatile. He has been deployed as a defensive midfielder, attacking midfielder, right midfielder, and left midfielder, and has also been used as a right-back when his team has been short of players in that position. Jude owns the midfield position.
Looking at his season heatmap, we can see that he was deployed mostly as a left-midfielder but he played in other positions too. It’s where he made most of his actions like passes, defensive work, touches, and other actions.
Passing 
Looking at his passing, we can see that he has made a total of 2834 passes out of which 1298 passes he completed. He has made 42.98 completed passes per 90.
He was moved on to a deeper role, but progressing with the ball became his utmost priority. Despite his attacking play dipped, he had a high amount of possession-based play. He progressively carried the ball at 4.90 per 90, and he was good at making progressive runs as he could carry the ball at 6.18 per 90. He excels in carrying the ball to the penalty area. He carried the ball 0.59 times putting him at 96 percentile.
The Englishman excels in sending risky and smart passes to his teammates as he made 1.18 key passes per 90. Bellingham made 34 key passes.
