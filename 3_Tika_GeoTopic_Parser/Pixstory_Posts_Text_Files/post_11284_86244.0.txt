Physical fitness has been related to a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but new research suggests that even moderate levels of cardiorespiratory fitness provide some protection.

In a news release, study investigator Edward Zamrini, MD, of the Washington VA Medical Center in Washington, DC, said, "One intriguing result of our study is that as people's fitness increased, their risk of Alzheimer's disease dropped â€“ it was not an all-or-nothing scenario."The findings will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) 2022 Annual Meeting in April. Between 2000 and 2017, the researchers identified 649,605 veterans (mean age, 61 years) who were free of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) when they performed standardized exercise treadmill tests using the Veterans Health Administration database.

Based on peak metabolic equivalents (METs) achieved during the treadmill test, they categorized participants into five age-specific fitness groups: lowest-fit (METs, 3.8), low-fit (METs, 5.8), moderate-fit (METs, 7.5), fit (METs, 9.2), and highest-fit (METs, 11.7).Veterans with the lowest cardiorespiratory fitness acquired ADRD at a rate of 9.5 cases per 1000 person-years in an unadjusted analysis, compared to 6.4 cases per 1000 person-years in the most fit group (P.001).
The findings show a "inverse, independent, and graded" relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and ADRD risk, according to the researchers' conference abstract.

"The thought that you can reduce your risk of Alzheimer's disease by just increasing your exercise is really hopeful," Zamrini said in the news release, "particularly because there are no adequate medications to prevent or stop the progression of the disease."

"We intend to establish a simple, personalized scale so that people can recognize the benefits that even little gains in fitness may provide," he said.
