Man United A sinking Ship If you are a Manchester City fan you are going to enjoy reading this even though it comes from a Manchester United supporter It is abundantly clear that there are some clear issues with Man Utd camp Be it the sacking of Ole the problems with Greenwood or the statements Ronaldo made in regard to the behaviour of the players Man United have well and truly become a sinking ship Even in their victories United have not been convincing take their victory against Norwich or even Chelsea Both games were instances where United were nothing but lucky that they did not drop points This would be a very hot take i know but according to me United s season was dead the moment they sacked Ole He was without a doubt our last hope to salvage this season No new manager was going to come and wave their magic wand and save this club from its epic downfall Ole could have saved the season with the grimmest hope but he could have Ragnick s methodology has to be asked especially after the Etihad humiliation and his decision to not include Ronaldo Varane and Cavani Ronaldo is being seen as a literal god who has to come in every game score goals save the team while the others sit and watch as apparently it is only the duty of the legend to save the team United have been nothing but a bad decision making machine this season starting off with Ole s sacking then letting Martial and Donny Van De Beek go on loan dropping Ronaldo at the crucial times but most importantly letting Harry Maguire start and lead the defence of United Nothing left to be said someone else could have a different opinion than mine but the truth remains Manchester United s team is a sinking ship which is making it pretty hard to believe that the glory days would ever come back
