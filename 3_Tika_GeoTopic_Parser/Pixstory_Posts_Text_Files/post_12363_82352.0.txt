📍Mental health is especially important during childhood and early adolescence. One in every eight children and young people (5–19 years old) now has at least one mental health problem and half of all lifetime MHDs begin before the age of 14. 

If left untreated, they can lead to a variety of problems that can last a lifetime, such as poor health, academic, and social consequences. This means that early discovery of problems and fast expert assistance is critical for preventing the development of these conditions. 

📍While there are effective, evidence-based therapies for MHDs in young people, only about two-thirds of individuals who are having problems seek professional care. From the viewpoint of parents and practitioners, demographic characteristics (such as age, gender, and race) that predict service utilization and barriers to seeking professional support have been discovered. However, there has been no clear understanding of the reasons why young people do not seek treatment from their own point of view. This understanding is essential if we are to properly address these hurdles and close the gap between high MHD rates and limited treatment options. 

📍The PRISMA guidelines were used to perform this systematic review. Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Web of Science Core Collection were all used to conduct searches.

📍There were four key ideas covered in the search terms: 
1) barriers/facilitators, 
2) help-seeking, 
3) mental health, and
4) children/adolescents and parents.

📍Studies focusing on child and/or teen reports (mean sample age up to 18) and participants' reported barriers and/or facilitators to seeking and getting professional care for mental health concerns were both eligible.

📍There were 3,682 studies published since October 2014 that were found. Only 53 studies were included in the review after screening; 30 were qualitative, 22 were quantitative, and one was a mixed-methods study.
