The Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) has awarded more than $100,000 in education scholarships to 41 athletes from 19 sports and 19 tertiary institutions, including five Paddle Australia competitors, to help them succeed in sport, education, and life. 

As per paddle Australia, the AIS Education Scholarship programme, now in its second year, has awarded more than $320,000 in scholarships to 118 athletes representing 30 sports and 31 academic schools. The programme is made possible by the John and Myriam Wylie Foundation's generous sponsorship.

John Wylie, former Chair of the Australian Sports Commission, said: “I’ve been inspired to see how hard athletes work to chase their sporting dreams, but it doesn’t need to be at the sacrifice of their other ambitions in life. Sport and education is a winning mix.

“It’s fantastic to see more sports and more educational institutions take the opportunity to join this program, this  time we’re adding athletes from rugby, netball and boccia. We have seasoned Olympians and Paralympians who have competed at the highest level, through to emerging athletes starting out on their sporting and education journeys. That’s the wonderful opportunity Australian sport provides.”
