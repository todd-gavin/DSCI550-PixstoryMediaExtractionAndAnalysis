Tuesday saw the resignations of UK Finance Minister Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid, throwing Prime Minister Boris Johnson's administration into disarray.
In his letter, Mr. Sunak expressed his sadness at quitting the administration but also his conviction that "we cannot continue like this."

"The public is entitled to expect proper, competent, and serious government operations. Recognizing that this may be my final ministerial position, I am quitting because I feel that these values are important enough to fight for.

After a slew of scandals, Mr. Javid claimed he could "no longer continue in good conscience" and that he had lost faith in Johnson's ability to lead in the interests of the country. He claimed that the public and many lawmakers had lost faith in Johnson's capacity to rule in the best interests of the country.
