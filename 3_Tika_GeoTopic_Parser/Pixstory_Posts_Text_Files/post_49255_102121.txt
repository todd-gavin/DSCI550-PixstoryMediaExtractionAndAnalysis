I have met a lot of people who don t like country music I personally enjoy it not all the time but when I m particularly in some mood for it I like the depth in the lyrics Many times though I don t like the subtle sexist elements it can have But I definitely don t feel any issue with the music itself A lot of people can go a little classist when talking about country music in my opinion Somebody once told me it s for the poor which just doesn t make sense does it Anyway do you like it And why is that
