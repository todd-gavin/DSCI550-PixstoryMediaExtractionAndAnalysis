It was as if my mother had cried that night
That night when I was in pain and the sperm was formed
That night when I became the bride of Aqaki clusters
That night when Kabul was full of blue tiles
And that person who was half of me had returned to my seed
And I saw it in the mirror
which was clean and bright like a mirror
And suddenly she called me
And I became the bride of Aqaki clusters
It was as if my mother had cried that night
What a vain light passed through this blocked hatch
Why didn't I look?
They knew all the moments of happiness
that your hands will be destroyed
And I did not look
until the hour window
It was opened and that sad canary played four times
Played four times
And I ran into that little woman
whose eyes were like the empty nests of Simrghan
And as she moved her thighs
As if the virginity of my glorious dream
She takes it to bed with him

Will I comb my hair in the wind again?
Will I plant violets in the garden again?
And the candlesticks
Will I put it in the sky behind the window?
Will I ever dance again?
Will the doorbell ring again for me to wait?

"It's over," I told my mother.
"It always happens before you think," I said
We have to send our condolences to the newspaper.
