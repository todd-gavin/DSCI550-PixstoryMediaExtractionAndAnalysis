D.J. Augustin’s short stint with the Los Angeles Lakers didn’t go as planned with L.A. failing to qualify for the Play-In Tournament.

Augustin added extra 3-point shooting to the Lakers roster, making 42.6% of his triples in the 21 games he played for L.A. The 34-year-old averaged 5.3 points and 1.6 assists during his time with the Purple and Gold.

Despite having little time to settle in, Augustin said he tried to make the most of the opportunity to represent the Lakers. And although they ended the season without playoff basketball, he will still look back at his time in L.A. with fondness.

“For me, coming in I heard the noise before I got here but my only job was to come here and try and help make the best of the situation and try to fit in,” Augustin said. “That’s what I tried to do for the month that I was here. It’s not a long time so I didn’t have a lot of time to really do a whole lot but when I was here, I just tried to make the best of it, help the guys on and off the court, and just tried to reach our goal. We came up short but everybody was great, everybody had a great attitude and things like this happen.

“I know it’s not normal for the Lakers organization but I know from my experience when I look back on this, I’m glad I made the decision to come here no matter what happened.”

Augustin added he felt welcomed by the Lakers and praised the camaraderie within the team, highlighting the chance to play with NBA veterans Wayne Ellington and Kent Bazemore. The guard commended Ellington and Bazemore for their professionalism despite limited playing opportunities.

“That’s one thing I can definitely say about this team, the group of guys that we had were great guys,” Augustin said.

“You mentioned two of my favorite guys right there in Wayne and Baze, I’ve been in the league with those guys and played against them for the longest time and they definitely can still play at a high level.
