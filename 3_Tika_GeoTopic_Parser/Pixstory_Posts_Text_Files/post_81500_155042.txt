Mikel Arteta faced the media shortly after landing in Norway ahead of our Europa League group stage clash with Bodo Glimt on Thursday night The boss was asked about the challenge of playing on an artificial pitch rotating his squad and the importance of us finishing top in the group What we think about is how we are going to win the game That s it How we win every three days in different conditions in different contexts in different weather in different competitions and that s the only way we are approaching it We don t know a player can get injured on an artificial pitch he can get injured in a training session Obviously we do what we have to do to protect the players as much as we can but at the end of the day tomorrow for sure we are going to have players on the pitch We felt that with everything he s been through in the last few weeks that it would be better for him to stay at home I think I mentioned it before the home game that what this team and this coaching staff has done in the last few years is remarkable Especially in Europe because it s got more headlines to the rest of Europe but without a question of doubt the scores that they ve had here explain themselves They were really loud really passionate and I spoke to Martin about it He mentioned to expect a great atmosphere here and it s great That s why you travel into Europe as well I don t know how other coaches play their games against us obviously Gaby Jesus is a player who gets involved in a lot of physical contact That s in his nature and its down to the referees to protect the players
