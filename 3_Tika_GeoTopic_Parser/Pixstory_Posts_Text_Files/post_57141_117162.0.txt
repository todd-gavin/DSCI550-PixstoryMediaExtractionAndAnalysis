Direct-to-consumer advertisements are similar to any other advertising that promotes their products. 
Furthermore, people should have a free choice to seek these drugs as they know what would harm them.

And I think most drug advertisements tell you about what they need to.
According to the FDA( Food and Drug Administration), the drug should make these claims,
 -At least one approved use for the drug
-The generic name of the drug
-All the risks of using the drug
-Under certain circumstances, ads can give only the most important risks.

If these guidelines are followed appropriately, advertising a drug does not harm. 
FDA also claims that "Ads must present side effect information like that used for the benefit information."

Moreover, direct-to-consumer drug ads educate, inform and empower patients to take charge of their health; instead of relying on health care providers, they would seek some extra information from these ads. These ads also encourage a person to contact a clinician, sometimes more necessary than avoiding the health condition.
Also, these ads benefit patients who are hesitant to speak about specific problems to their doctors; they educate them to seek the help of doctors whenever necessary.
So there's no problem in promoting direct-to-consumer drug ads when done correctly.
