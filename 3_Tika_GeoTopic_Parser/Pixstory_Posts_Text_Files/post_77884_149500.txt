Why Bangalore Why Why are you so beautiful Your sky your greens and even buildings are making me fall for you I m getting attached to you day by day and at the same time feeling sad that I have to leave here by the month end Both places and people made me feel home I wish I could stay here Thank you for the love and warmth I will miss you
