71 centuries for Kohli in all International cricket across formats - 27 in Tests, 43 in ODIs and this being his maiden three-figure score in T20Is. Only Sachin Tendulkar with hundred centuries in 782 innings has scored more in all International cricket than Kohli's 71. Kohli is tied on the second spot with Ricky Ponting who took 668 innings to score as many.
Kohli became the fourth Indian player to score hundreds in all three formats after Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, and KL Rahul. Overall, this was his sixth hundred in all T20 cricket with all five previous three-figure scores coming for Royal Challengers Bengaluru in IPL.
He went on to dedicate this century to his wife and daughter.
