Give me the long, straight road before me, 
A clear, cold day with a nipping air, 
Tall, bare trees to run on beside me, 
A heart that is light and free from care. 

Then let me go! â€“ I care not whither 
My feet may lead, for my spirit shall be 
Free as the brook that flows to the river, 
Free as the river that flows to the sea.
