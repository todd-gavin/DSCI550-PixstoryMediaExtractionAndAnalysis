Providing the rhythm of the music, drums provide almost a galloping sense of feeling when in tandem with the other music instruments. While frontmen and guitarists get a lot of the glory in rock bands, drummers are very much a driving force behind the music, especially when it comes to hard rock and heavy metal.
 
The drummer is the heartbeat, and while good time, good dynamics, good technical chops are all important, what truly matters is the drummer’s sense of musicality. A great drummer should not just hear, but listen and understand the music beyond just their own instrument. That is very important for any musician, no matter what you play.
 
 A good drummer needs to be creative, and thus they need to have the flexibility to go with any changes that arise, adding their own tasty fills during the song while not messing up all over the place.
 
A drummer’s ultimate job is to support, complement, and accompany the vocalist and the instruments while keeping up the groove. Most importantly, a good drummer needs to always be on time.
