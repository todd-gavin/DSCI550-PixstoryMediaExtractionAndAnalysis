It seems like my childhood  is returning with all the animated movies I watched back in the day are getting sequels or being rebooted. 

Jack Black is returning as Po in Kung Fu Panda: The Dragon Knight. The series will premiere on Netflix. Here are the images that were posted with the announcement. I'm too excited to see which characters will return. The cast in the movies included Jackie Chan, Angelina Jolie,  Seth Rogen ... Well, I hope that they all return to the series. I remember playing the Kung Fu Panda game on Xbox. 
Following is the official premise that has been released by DreamWorks and Netflix,  

"Jack Black returns to Kung Fu Panda in the new series Kung Fu Panda: The Dragon Knight. When a mysterious pair of weasels set their sights on a collection of four powerful weapons, Po must leave his home to embark on a globe-trotting quest for redemption and justice that finds him partnered up with a no-nonsense English knight named Wandering Blade. Together, these two mismatched warriors set out on an epic adventure to find the magical weapons first and save the world from destruction â€” and they may even learn a thing or two from each other along the way."
