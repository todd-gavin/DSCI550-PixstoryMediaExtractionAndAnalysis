With a new TV and WWE Network rights contract announced on Tuesday, sports entertainment business WWE has strengthened its long-standing partnership with Australian pay TV juggernaut Foxtel Group, making Foxtel the only home for WWE in the nation. Hollywood Reporter said that Foxtel is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp to the tune of 65 percent, and Telstra, the dominant player in Australian telecommunications, to the tune of 35 percent. For more than 20 years, Foxtel has been the official TV partner of the WWE in this nation. However, the sports entertainment company's independent service WWE Network has only been available in Australia so far. Now, WWE Network material will only be accessible through Foxtel's streaming service Binge, just like how WWE Network content is housed on NBCUniversal's Peacock in the United States.The new multi-year partnership in Australia, financial terms of which weren’t disclosed, “will see Foxtel Group’s portfolio of entertainment brands become the home of WWE in Australia,” the companies said. The new agreement will “deliver the biggest line-up of WWE’s live and on demand content to Foxtel Group’s 4.5 million subscribers on Foxtel, as well as the rapidly growing streaming services Kayo Sports and Binge.”
