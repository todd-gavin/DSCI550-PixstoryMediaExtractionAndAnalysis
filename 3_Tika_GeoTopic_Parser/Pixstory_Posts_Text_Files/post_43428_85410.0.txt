We cannot stress enough on the importance of proper sex education in India. I remember the long classes back in school which felt like they last forever expect that one time when our biology teacher had to teach us ‘chapter 8 : how do organisms reproduce’ It was the shortest lesson by our teacher ever,Leaving all the kids with curiosity and making something like sex seem so unnatural and intriguing. In this globalized and technologically connected world where information travels at the speed of light, it has become increasingly important to address issues like Sex Education. Especially in a country like India, along with the growing adolescent population and evolving attitude towards sex due to the influence of mass media, conservative views on sex are becoming redundant day by day. 
As a result of ignorance, young people are ill-equipped to make healthy sexual choices and form healthy relationships. This results in girls missing school once they begin menstruating, strict gender stereotypes, child marriages, LGBTQ discrimination and sexual assault. Despite all of this, the public discussions on sex and sexuality education are fuelled by religious and cultural values in India, with little to no regard for scientific attention. 
because of the non-existent curriculum on Sex Education in most cases and teachers unwilling to take up the topic despite the curriculum being present in others, most of the adolescents turn to gather information about sex and sexuality from other resources like the internet, magazines, pornography etc. This can be harmful in several ways because of these mediums of information being highly unreliable. Misinformation, unrealistic body image, normalization of objectification (as made apparent in the recent ‘Boys Locker Room’ case), violence, abuse, unsafe sexual practices and disregard for consent – to name a few.
