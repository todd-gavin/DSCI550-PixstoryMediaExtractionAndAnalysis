During the promotions of the movie “Attack,” John Abraham always said one thing to the media and that thing was “Attack will be the game changer movie for Bollywood” and after watching the movie I’ll also say that ‘Attack IS a game changer’ movie for Bollywood.

The movie starts with the scene of a Surgical strike where Arjun (John Abraham) is on a mission to capture Rehman Gul (terrorist) and he succeeds in that mission.

After the mission, Arjun takes leave and on his way back home, he met Aisha (Jacqueline Fernandez) at the airport because she is an air hostess. Then a very nice song helped audience to show their love story in around 3 minutes.

One day when Arjun went to airport to pick up Aisha, a group of terrorists attacked the airport and during the fight, Arjun nearly got killed and Aisha take a bullet in her heart. Is she alive or dead? The filmmaker didn’t tell anything about that.

After the attack, Arjun’s body below the neck portion got permanently paralyzed and now Arjun is dependent on his mother, beautifully played by Ratna Pathak.

But one day, the Indian Army got to know that Hamid Gul is in India and looking forward to attacking somewhere in Delhi, and from here, Saba Qureshi (Rakul Preet) give the ‘Suoer soldier’ idea to the Indian Army and Subramanyam (Prakash Raj) meets Arjun and convince him to become a super-soldier.

What happened in this movie after this incident will be a spoiler from my side and I am not here to give spoilers because I want you all to enjoy this movie on your own.

Action, Emotion of all characters, humor, Background music, songs , VFX, training sequence of Arjun, and the last chase sequence of the movie are top-notch. The strongest part of the movie is its villain which makes the movie more thrilling.

The attack is 2 hours 3 minutes long, so you will never get bored. “Attack” has all the ingredients to become a blockbuster movie.

I hope people watch this film and encourage innovative stories like this.
