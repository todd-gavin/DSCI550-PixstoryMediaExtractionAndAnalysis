Frank Martin was hired as the next coach of the UMass men's basketball team on Friday. 

US News reported that Martin, 56, succeeds Matt McCall, who was sacked earlier this month following a five-year tenure in Amherst that saw him finish 58-81. 

“It is evident that there is tremendous alignment in place to win and do it the right way,” Martin said in a statement. “Let’s all get on this ride together, let’s dream big and let’s be relentless at making our dreams a reality.”

Martin joins the Gamecocks after being fired from South Carolina last week after ten years and one NCAA appearance with the Gamecocks. But it was that appearance at the end of the 2016-17 season that led to South Carolina's first Final Four participation. During his time at the school, Martin went 171-147.

From 2007 to 2012, he was the head coach at Kansas State, where he led the Wildcats to four NCAA tournament appearances, including an Elite Eight appearance in 2010. Overall, he placed 117th out of 54 competitors.

Martin's wife, Anya (Forrest), a 1998 UMass alumna who ran track for the institution, will be returning to her alma mater. 

Martin's appointment by UMass came just one day after former Chattanooga coach Lamont Paris was named Martin's replacement at South Carolina.
