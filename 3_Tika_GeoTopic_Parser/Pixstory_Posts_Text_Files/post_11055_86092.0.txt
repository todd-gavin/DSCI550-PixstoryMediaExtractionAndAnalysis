In 1988, a relative of a man who died in the custody of the Bihar police appealed to human rights activists to help him get justice. The relative’s name was Nitish Kumar, Bihar’s current chief minister. But little has changed in Kumar’s administration, as police violence against detenus is rampant, medical treatment delayed, cases fabricated against families of victims, whose bodies are often buried by force.

On a December afternoon, seated on the mud floor of her home that was particularly cold after unexpected winter rains, Parmila Devi, 48, recalled the last day of October 2021. Her husband had promised to bring fish on his way home, but instead, word arrived that he had been taken to the police station.
 
Parmila, 48, rushed to the Rosera police station in Samastipur district, in the heart of Bihar, to find her husband unconscious. Her husband was only pretending, policemen told Devi, asking her to slap him to wake him up. 

Ramsewak, about 55 years old, and more than 400 other men employed as sweepers with the Rosera nagar panchayat (an urban local  body), were protesting four months of unpaid wages. According to the family, he was picked up by policemen from the site of the protest.  

“They beat him up so much,” Parmila said. “He couldn't open his eyes or speak or move.”

It was their son, Deepak, 24, also a municipal sweeper, who got the call. According to him, after a first information report (FIR)—the starting point of a criminal investigation—was filed against Ramsewak, he was taken to an unknown place and beaten, allegedly by policemen and elected and administrative representatives of the municipality. 

“There were injuries on his chest, they hit him on the head, his nose was bleeding," said Deepak, who uses one name.
