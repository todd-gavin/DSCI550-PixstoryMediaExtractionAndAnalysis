Under Croatian coach Igor Stimac India won three back to back matches in the Asian Cup qualifiers recently to make it to the final rounds of the continental championships After a series of poor results India finally tasted some success Stimac should have been happy with the way things are moving Instead he is an angry man today In more than one interaction with the media the Croatian has lambasted almost every stakeholder in Indian football and demanded a complete overhaul of the system if the national team has to do well in near future A bronze medallist in the World Cup Stimac ripped apart India s domestic structure especially the Indian Super League run by the marketing partners of All India Football Federation ISL is not good for the country and its future The problem here is people are busy with their own projects India needs a longer season with more games Like for months Young players need to be nurtured and players should get a six weeks holiday That is enough for them if we want to become the best team in Asia The calendar of football should not depend on broadcast and other things Our players need to play at least matches The ISL has to be bigger There should be at least teams with promotion and relegation There is too much of comfort here for the footballers they should face much more challenges Nothing can get better with such a short league If we compare us with bigger footballing nations in Asia then we are lagging eight to years behind he said Stimac is currently having a contract with the Indian football federation till September His chance of getting an extension is in limbo now since the AIFF is now run by the Supreme Court appointed committee of administrators CoA Igor is not happy with CoA s apparent lack of pace while dealing with his extension and said an elaborate plan should be chalked out immediately if India have to do well in Asian Cup
