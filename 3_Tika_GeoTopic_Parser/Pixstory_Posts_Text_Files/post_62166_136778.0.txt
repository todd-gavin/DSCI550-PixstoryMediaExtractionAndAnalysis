Following an unceremonious departure from Arsenal, Aubameyang returned to the Premier League on deadline day after signing a two-year contract with Chelsea. He has taken on the No.9 shirt which has historically proven to be a weight on the shoulders of big names at Stamford Bridge.
 "I have some unfinished business with the Premier League so it’s good to be back and really exciting," stated the former Arsenal player, referring to his troubled time at the Emirates.
Meanwhile, Chelsea chairman Todd Boehly was delighted to get the striker on board and said: "Pierre-Emerick is an elite striker with a proven track record in the Premier League. We are thrilled to have Pierre-Emerick on board with us in the new era at Chelsea and we’re really looking forward to working with him."

He has previously worked with manager Thomas Tuchel at Borussia Dortmund and should should be well versed with his methods, which will help him to settle quickly in west London.
