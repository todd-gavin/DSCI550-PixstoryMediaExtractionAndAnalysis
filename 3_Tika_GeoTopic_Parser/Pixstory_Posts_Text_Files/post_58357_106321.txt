Everybody s racing or is in the race And I am unable to catch the pace Trying to do a lot But finally wanna abort Yes there are dreams to chase But I am lost in haze Maybe I look chill out But fear is trembling inside so loud Fear of not catching Fear of being left behind Fear of losing Fear of my dreams shattering Fear that trembled my mind Fear that really wanna come out But how could I let it show Yeah the fear grows Now I am leaving everything in god s hand Hope s he listen and respond Yeah I know I can trust the God Cause s he s listening and helped a lot Helped to cope up With stress and panic By letting me trust the gut Atlast leaving it now I know I ll manage somehow
