Sharing an article which appeared in The Times of India Defensive medicine Doctors protecting themselves They are being forced to manage patients very guardedly but this is hardly an ideal equation When I returned from the US two decades back a friend told me You should learn to drive again in India Use defensive driving so as to protect yourself on Indian roads where people may damage your car or even kill you I did not know that nearly years later the term defensive medicine would be apt for Indian physicians where physicians need to protect themselves from disrepute and physical harm
