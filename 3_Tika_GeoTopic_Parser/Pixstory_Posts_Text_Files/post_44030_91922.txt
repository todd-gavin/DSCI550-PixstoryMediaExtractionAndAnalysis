Michael Dawson a former Tottenham captain feels the North London derby between Arsenal and Spurs would be make or break for both clubs at the end of the season The rivals are currently slugging it out for a place in the Champions League with nothing to lose Antonio Conte s side is now in fourth place in the rankings level on points with Arsenal but with a better goal difference and two more games played Mikel Arteta has put his team in a strong position to finish in the qualification spots but with games against Manchester United Chelsea and West Ham yet to come it might be a difficult final stretch That s not to mention the rescheduled North London derby which will be critical for both clubs Tensions between the clubs are already high but throw in the squabbles over the first game being postponed due to a number of injuries and one covid case and it might erupt While a definite date for the rescheduled match has yet to be determined it is expected to take place near the end of the season with the winner potentially securing Champions League status Last month Arteta expressed his anxiety about the postponing saying Yes I am concerned about the rescheduling because I don t know and it is going to be significant It has nothing to do with me the club has to arrange those conversations Hopefully we have a say I would doubt it but hopefully A bit like the upcoming Manchester City and Liverpool game will these be the points that make or break teams seasons It s a massive game I really think it is When you listen to Antonio Conte in his press conference after the West Ham game he spoke about nine cup finals and he s right Spurs probably need to win pretty much every one of them and they will need Arsenal to slip up too as they re in a good vein of form
