As per the Mirror, Gary Neville and Micah Richards debated about a combined Manchester XI before the derby. But Neville made it clear that he would not be adding Cristiano Ronaldo to his combined XI. 

The former Manchester United captain said "You can't put Cristiano Ronaldo in at the moment. Who are you dropping? "Foden? Sterling? Mahrez? De Bruyne?". Hence, making it clear that the Portuguese footballer won't be in his combined XI. 

Gary Neville would not stop there. The Manchester United legend would go on to debate if any United player could be included in the combined XI for now. To this, Micah Richards replied with a firm no. 

This would certainly ring alarm bells for the Manchester United fans before the derby. Manchester City comfortably won the reverse fixture at Old Trafford as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer didn't have an answer to Pep Guardiola's tactics. 

Pep Guardiola's side is once again the favourites going into the Manchester derby. But the Red Devils are unbeaten in their last eight Premier League games. Hence this should give confidence to the players and the supporters. 






Should the 37-year old have moved to Manchester City instead? 

As per reports, Manchester City were looking to sign Cristiano Ronaldo from Juventus in the summer of last year. Manchester United got involved only when they felt that the Portuguese striker was close to a move to their rivals. 

Legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson reportedly contacted Cristiano Ronaldo and changed his mind at the last minute. Following this, the five-time Champions League winner snubbed City and moved to United instead. 

Cristiano Ronaldo has 15 goals in all competitions for Manchester United. But Micah Richards believes that the Portuguese would have already scored 25 if he was at Manchester City. Nevertheless, Ronaldo would have the opportunity to show what he has left in the tank when he takes to the field in the derby on Sunday.
