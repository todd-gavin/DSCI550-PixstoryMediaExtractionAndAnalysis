Lindsay Jacobellis has made history for USA in Winter Olympics 2022 by breaking the long jinx of no gold. This is the first gold for the country in Beijing 2022 with hopefully many more to come. 

CBS sports reported: Lindsey Jacobellis, competing in her fifth Winter Games, won gold in the snowboardcross competition Wednesday. Her previous best finish was winning silver at the 2006 Olympics.

In other news, on a dimmer note, things are not looking good for the American skiing Mikaela Shiffrin. Shiffrin who got defeated in women’s giant slalom on Monday was a fan favourite and many were taken aback by this event. 

USA Today reported on Tuesday that expected to contend for multiple medals at the Beijing Olympics, several of them gold, Shiffrin lost an edge on the fifth gate of the first run of the women’s giant slalom and skied out. It’s the first time she’s failed to finish a GS race since January 2018. 

However, she has not lost hope. She gave a statement saying that she is not going to “cry about it” but keep her eye on the goal and work harder. 

So far, the Winter Olympics have proven to be bitter sweet for the US contingent and fans are hoping that things will start looking up after Lindsay Jacobellis’ remarkable win of the gold.
