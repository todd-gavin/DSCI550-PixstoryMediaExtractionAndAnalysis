Returning from the dead almost fifteen years later American progressive metal veterans Zero Hour are back and are whipping out another fine dish of their melodic virtuoso technical metal For those unversed with the band Zero Hour plays a blend of heavy dark melodic technical progressive metal with a strong focus on instrumental skill atmosphere and tight creative skilful technical arrangements Agenda is loaded with groove melody ear popping skill breath taking arrangements brilliant vocals and a tight but big production with Zero Hour simply proving themselves to once again be a powerhouse in the progressive metal genre Sonically the band s sound is a mix of prog metal veterans like Fates Warning Dream Theater and Symphony X sounding like all of them and yet like neither of them as their tone matches Fates Warning though the sheer focus on instrumental skill borders on what is classic Dream Theater with some neoclassical symphonic metal touches of Symphony X but has a big creative splinter sticking out to identify Zero Hour as something else entirely Agenda features some badass heavy riffs and tight metal grooves alternating between clean ambience sexy arpeggios and complex chord progressions The end result is a beautifully paced and dynamic record comprising a sound that is mesmerizing and audacious in its construction dynamism and complexity though is somehow accessible enough for most people if they are willing to give the time Agenda is strong inspired passionate and original with definite signs of being a technical marvel What holds the album back is that at many points barring Democide and Memento Mori the album goes off an a rather linear path structurally and sonically sounding the same at some points which can at repeat listens even make it boring On the whole Agenda is a strong return to form showing that Zero Hour is still going out strong and fresh and ready to unleash a power house of sexy prog metal that will knock you flat out Highlights Democide Memento Mori Stigmata Patient Zero Score
