Anil Kapoor is gearing up for his next film JugJugg Jeeyo to hit the theatres this weekend. As the actor is experimenting with his work by making offbeat choices, he recently revealed that he turned down a major global movie franchise offer. Speaking to Anupama Chopra's Film Companion, Anil revealed that he was offered a role but he decided to not take it up due to a few reasons. 

Speaking on the show, Anil revealed, "The biggest franchise in the world, I can't name it, has been offered to me; but it had just two days of work. So, I read the scene. Ek toh mere ko scene samajh mein nahi aya kya tha.Then the director of that franchise called me up, and said that 'I want you to do it'. The entire foreign set of friends of mine said that 'if you can have this film in your resume, then that's enough'."
