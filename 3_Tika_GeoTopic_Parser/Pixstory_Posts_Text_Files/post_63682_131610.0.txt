Whenever we see the trailers for the upcoming sequels for one of our favourite movies there is always an underlying feeling of emotional discomfort, uneasiness and pessimism in our minds, and this is because good sequels are hard to come by and therefore dime a dozen. A sequel’s job is to continue the story of its predecessor by expanding upon the existing lore, honing in the potential of the created universe while being able to stand as both its own product as well as the part of an interconnected whole.
There is often a level of existing confusion when it comes to the differences between a sequel, remake and a reboot. A sequel merely continues on from the events of the existing lore while a remake basically as the terminology goes, remakes the whole previous thing with some changes depending on the time period, story needs and director’s vision. A reboot on the other hand entails restarting an entire concept and universe.
Sequels tend to have an outstanding reputation for being automatically bad and ruining the original concept and in today’s movie industry which is filled to the brim with sequels, remakes and prequels, it is easy to see say that the push for making sequels is a half hearted cash grab.
But film sequels aren’t bad, just a highly tough art to master. Making a follow-up film is a unique challenge which is laid with its own very specific set of difficulties and comes with some tough decisions. If a director has an understanding of the original concept and a clear vision, then sequels can be even better than originals.
