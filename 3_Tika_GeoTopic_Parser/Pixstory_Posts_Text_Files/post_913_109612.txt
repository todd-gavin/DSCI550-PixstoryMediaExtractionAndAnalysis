The US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade Friday holding that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion Going forward abortion rights will be determined by states unless Congress acts Read the court s opinion here In early May Politico had obtained what it called a draft of a majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito that would strike down Roe v Wade From Justices Clarence Thomas Amy Coney Barrett Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch who concurred with the majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled The Constitution makes no reference to abortion and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision including the one on which the defenders of Roe and Casey now chiefly rely the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment Roe was egregiously wrong from the start Its reasoning was exceptionally weak and the decision has had damaging consequences And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people s elected representatives
