I tried the famous death by chocolate desert and honestly the amount of chocolate in that desert was actually DEATHLY Then we went to the top tier dosa joints in Bangalore Vidyarthi bhavan Central tiffin room Shanti sagar Out of which I d happily argue that Bangalore s sweet sambhar is better than other South Indian tastes of sambhar I had also developed a never ending love for the famous street food pani puri or gol gappe Not a day would go by where I wouldn t miss eating a quick plate of this amazing Indian creation In fact I liked pani puri so much that while eating a pani puri I would still crave it Does that make sense to anyone else All in all exploring food and developing new favorites was an absolute delight and something I wouldn t get enough of While being a student studying nutrition the death glances were difficult when we ourselves indulged in guilty high caloric foods But we would get ourself out of it by the famous YOEO you only EAT once
