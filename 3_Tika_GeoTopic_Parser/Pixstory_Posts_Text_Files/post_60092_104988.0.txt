Joe Root's century in the fourth innings of England's first Test against New Zealand at Lord's on Sunday made him just the second Englishman after Alastair Cook to achieve 10,000 runs in the longest format of the game. Root happened to be the same age as Cook when he arrived. When Cook reached the milestone, he was 31 years and 157 days old, and Root was 31 years and 157 days old on Sunday. They are the two youngest people to reach the milestone.

He also became the quickest England hitter to reach the milestone, beating Cook to it. Cook took 229 innings to reach the milestone, while Root took 218 innings. He is the 14th player to reach 10,000 Test runs and the 10th fastest to reach the milestone in terms of innings played.

England beat New Zealand by five wickets to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series thanks to Root's 26th Test century.

Root came in to bat with England chasing 277 and the score at 32/2. Soon after, they were 69/4, but Root and new skipper Ben Stokes helped to rebuild the team.
