Liverpool has reportedly rejected an opening bid of 21 million euros plus 4 million in
add-ons from Bayern Munich to sign Sadio Mane. The Senegalese striker has been
heavily linked with a departure from Anfield this summer and recently gave the clearest
indication yet that his days at the club are numbered.

With just a year remaining on his current contract, Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich have been tipped as Mane’s next destination.

According to the Times, Liverpool has rejected the opening bid being placed by the
German giants for the Senegalese forward.

The offer is said to have been rejected last week and it included an add-on of 4 million
euros providing Bayern Munich with the Champions League in the future.

Liverpool didn’t entertain the bid as they believe Mane, who has won every trophy possible with the Reds is worth more but they haven’t set a price on the player.

The report also claims that Jurgen Klopp’s side holds an interest in Benfica striker
Darwin Nunez but they will not pursue him at any cost.

In the build-up to Senegal’s African Cup of Nations qualifier clash with Benin, Mane
said, “60 to 70 per cent of Senegalese want me to leave Liverpool? I will do what they
want.

The 30-year-old went on to score a hat-trick in a 3-1 win- becoming the country’s
all-time leading goalscorer and clarifying his previous statement, claiming he was
‘joking.’

“I spoke yesterday while joking with a bit of humour and it was everywhere. I think we
will stop there.”

“Liverpool is a club, I respect a lot. The fans adopted me since the day I came.

Regarding the future, we will see.”

Bayern wants to play Mane alongside Robert Lewandowski- provided he doesn’t leave
for Barcelona after stating his desire to exit. Paris Saint Germain is also looking at
Mane’s situation.
