Spirituality does not mean any particular practice It is a certain way of being To get there there are many things to do This is like a garden in your house If the soil sunlight or stem of a plant is in a certain way it won t yield flowers you have to do something You have to take care of those things So if you cultivate your body mind emotions and energies to a certain level of maturity something else blossoms within you that is what is spirituality When your rationale is immature it doubts everything When your rationale matures it sees everything in a completely different light An atheist cannot be spiritual But you must understand that even a theist cannot be spiritual Because an atheist and a theist are not different One believes there is God another believes there is no God Both of them are believing something that they do not know You are not sincere enough to admit that you do not know that s your problem So theists and atheists are not different They are the same people putting up an act of being different A spiritual seeker is neither a theist nor an atheist He has realized that he does not know so he is seeking The moment you believe something you become blind to everything else The whole conflict on the planet is not between good and evil as they are trying to project it It is always one man s belief versus another man s belief The need for belief is more psychological than spiritual You want to cling to something you want to feel secure you want to feel like you know it all That is coming from a very immature mind What is the problem if you don t know anything about this existence You actually don t know anything It s beautiful And you see how to make yourself beautiful and joyful within yourself which is within your hands
