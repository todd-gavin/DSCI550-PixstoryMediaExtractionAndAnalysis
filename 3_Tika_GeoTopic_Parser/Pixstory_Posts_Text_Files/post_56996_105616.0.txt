Sylvia Plath was an admired American poet and novelist. Her works explore themes such as self, death, and nature closely tied to her personal experience.
Plath showed early promise as a writer and published her first poem at eight. Her remarkable talent allowed her to enter and win a series of literary contests and later become a renowned author for works such as Daddy, Lady Lazarus and The Bell Jar.

During her undergraduate years  Plath began to suffer the symptoms of severe depression that ultimately lead to her death.
These quotes manifest the beauty and essence of Plath-

-I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experiences possible in my life. And I am limited.

-Remember, remember, this is now, and now, and now. Live it, feel it, cling to it. I want to become acutely aware of all Iâ€™ve taken for granted.

-I must get my soul back from you; I am killing my flesh without it.

-What horrifies me most is the idea of being useless: well-educated, brilliantly promising, and fading out into an indifferent middle age.
