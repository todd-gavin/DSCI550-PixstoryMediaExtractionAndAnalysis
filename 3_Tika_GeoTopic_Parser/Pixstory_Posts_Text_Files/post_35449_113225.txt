With Mourinho we know each other well and I&#39;m happy to find him here I&#39;m here for him but I&#39;m happy to be part of this great club attractive for players and status for me I&#39;m trying to beat Lampard as Mourinho&#39;s most capped player I think the team has great quality players with young players who could be important in the future I can&#39;t wait to get started This is how the press conference of the new Roma signing Nemanja Matic begins The negotiation was quick because the ambitions of the club and the coach are the same as mine The victory of the Conference did not affect my choice because it was an easy choice When I make a decision nothing changes my mind From my experience with Mourinho he can change his system based on the players he has I played three and two in midfield I will follow Mourinho&#39;s indications I won&#39;t there will be problems in this sense With these words the midfielder introduced himself in front of the new fans
