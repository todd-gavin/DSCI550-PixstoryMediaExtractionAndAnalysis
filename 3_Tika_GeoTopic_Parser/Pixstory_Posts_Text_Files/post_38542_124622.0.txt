We will see how he will fare against both of these players. 


We have compared Rabiot with Fred and McTominay. We can see that against McTominay he ranks good. But if we compare him with Fred, we can see both are nearly equal, with Fred coming up higher in the goal department. If Rabiot makes his move, he’ll be slotted into the first team, and McTominay might be benched in favor of the Frenchman.

Now, they have been reignited with the Reluctance of Frenkie De Jong to come. They are looking to replace him, though FDJ is still a priority. 


Operating in advanced attacking midfielder the Serbian has been nicknamed ‘The Sergeant’. He was deployed mostly in the right side of the midfield. We will look at his seasonal heatmap and try to deduce he fared over these years. 


Season Review


Operating on the right side of the pitch, we can see that he has gone forward. When United approached the Serb, he used to operate in small spaces which was tricky and Unorthodox, and didn’t fit in natural mould. 5-6 seasons forward, nothing has changed, only his game became more refined and polished. There he made touches,passes,scored goals which we will know in details.
