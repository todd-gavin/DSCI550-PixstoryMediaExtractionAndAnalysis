Donald Trump on Friday criticized former Vice President Mike Pence as lacking “courage” for refusing to carry out a plan to overturn the 2020 election results, echoing a tweet Trump sent on Jan. 6, 2021 as the country’s second-in-command sheltered from a violent mob attacking the U.S. Capitol.

In a keynote speech at a conservative Christian political conference in Nashville, Trump delivered a lengthy speech against what he calls a “ludicrous narrative” and “witch hunt” as a House committee continues its investigation into Trump’s role in the Jan. 6 attack. 

Former Trump aides and staff testified on Thursday of Trump’s efforts to pressure Pence to illegally reject the 2020 election results. A former Trump assistant testified Trump called Pence a “wimp” in a heated Jan. 6 phone call. 

“I never called Mike Pence a wimp,” Trump said. “Mike Pence had a chance to be great. He had a chance to be, frankly, historic, but just like Bill Barr and the rest of these weak people, Mike did not have the courage to act.”

The bipartisan committee on Thursday alleged Trump's actions endangered the vice president's life in his pursuit of a legal theory that Pence could overturn the election. Pence refused to do so. Republican U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, vice chair of the Jan. 6 committee, called the strategy "illegal and unconstitutional.
