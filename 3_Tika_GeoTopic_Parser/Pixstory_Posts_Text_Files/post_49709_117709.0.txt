Republicans have sided with Democrats in the US House of Representatives to pass a bill that would strengthen the legal protections for same-sex marriages. At the same time, some Republican critics dismissed the bill as a gimmick.
America's high court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015. Some 47 Republicans joined all Democrats in voting for the measure by 267-157 on Tuesday after Republican leaders enabled party members to vote with their conscience.

More than three-quarters of House Republicans opposed the bill on an issue that has long been a political purity test for social conservatives. Critics warned the vote was a Democratic trap to force Republicans on the record with midterm elections 

Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Minority Whip Steve Scalise voted against it, but number three House Republican Elise Stefanik voted in favor.

Also voting yes was prominent Republican Liz Cheney, whose past opposition to same-sex marriage once caused a fissure with her gay sister. The bill would also provide legal protections for interracial marriages.
