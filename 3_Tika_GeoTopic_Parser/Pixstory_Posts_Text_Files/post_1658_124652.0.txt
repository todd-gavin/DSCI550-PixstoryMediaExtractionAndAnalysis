Rifleman Chinta Bahadur of 5/5 Gurkha Rifles went missing in 1944 during World War II operations at Burma (now Myanmar) fighting for the British. He was never to be found. 

Rifleman Chinta Bahadur continues to live for this Army battalion

Today Naik Chinta Bahadur of 5/5 Gurkha Rifles is a male sheep. His horns painted green and black, in the colours of his unit, he is escorted by two of his colleagues, who ensure that “Naik Chinta Bahadur” eats only fresh, green grass.

"The World War II operations at Burma in 1944 was one of the most fiercely fought battles for our regiment. Rifleman Chinta Bahadur was one of the brave soldiers who went missing in Burma in 1944. After days of search, he could not be located. But a sheep appeared there and started following our unit. Since then, a sheep with the same name is raised by our unit in memory of Chinta Bahadur. The sheep gets a proper rank, attends PT sessions in morning and his attendance is marked. He is well taken care of by the entire unit. For us, he is not merely a sheep but the incarnation of a colleague who was never found"
“Knowing that a sheep usually lives for 8-10 years, Chinta Bahadur mostly reaches the rank of a havildar, and when he dies, we get a new sheep, who gets the name of Chinta Bahadur and becomes a part of the unit. This tradition has been going on since 1944. It is our way to keep Rifleman Chinta Bahadur alive in our unit,”
