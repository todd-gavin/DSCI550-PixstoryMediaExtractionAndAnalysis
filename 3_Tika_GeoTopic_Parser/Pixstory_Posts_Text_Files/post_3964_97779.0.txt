The place gives many unique spiritual experiences. And to start with the days trip one should leave before sunrise from Assi Ghat on the banks of the Gange. 

From the Ghat one can see boats that take thr tourists and the local fishing people across the river. While other group of people will be waiting on banks of the river with hands in prayer to the Sun god. As the time of sunrise comes, the Assi Ghat would be crowded with worshippers, musicians chanting the songs. 

There are numerous ghats or steps that leads to the river, to the north of Assi Ghat almost 87 ghats are there. Some will be taking a bath and others would be reciting their prayers. There are two ghats that are the cremation sites - Manikarnika Ghat and Harischandra Ghat. 

Manikarnika Ghat is a well known burning ghat and is one of the holiest sites. Many Hindus believe that this is their last stop as the cycle of death and reincarnation will end in Varanasi.Â  On the riverfront steps the bodies are cremated all day long on top of the pyres. The bodies are taken through the streets then to the ghats and their ashes are then sent to the river. 
The Aarti is one of the most eye catching rituals. It's a ritual that involves traditional lamps practiced in the evening at the Dasaswamedh Ghat by a group of priests standing on a platform next to the river.
