Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality rates have been steadily decreasing over the globe as immunisation rates against COVID-19 rise. Despite this, many nations still confront difficulties in getting and providing sufficient vaccines. Vaccine reluctance and the introduction of new SARS-CoV-2 mutations capable of bypassing protection might further hamper global immunisation efforts.

All of these elements point to the need of finding effective therapies for COVID-19. According to a study published in the journal Communications Biology, researchers at John Hopkins University have proposed using the drug sulforaphane (isothiocyanate) to treat SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43 illnesses, which are both caused by the same virus.
Prior to inoculation with either the HCoV-OC43 or the wild-type strain of SARS-CoV-2, the VeroC1008 cells were treated for one to two hours with SFN. Both coronaviruses were shown to be efficiently inhibited by SFN in a dose-dependent manner. Both HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 had median inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 10 micromolar (M) and 12 micromolar (M), respectively.

The same test was carried out in human diploid fibroblast cell line MRC-5 with just HCoV-OC43 to corroborate these results. A slightly higher IC50 of 18 nM was found in this experiment, but the findings were almost identical. As with the cytotoxicity, the cytotoxic dosage (TD50) ranged widely over the whole range of concentrations tested.

SARS-CoV-2-infected Caco-2 cells infected with SFN showed a dose-dependent decrease in viral RNA, with an IC50 of 2.4 M for SFN treatment. For SARS-CoV-2 strains with the well-known D614G mutation, SFN is equally efficient in Vero C1008 cells against the Delta and Omicron versions, with an IC50 of 5.56 and 3.33 microM, respectively.
