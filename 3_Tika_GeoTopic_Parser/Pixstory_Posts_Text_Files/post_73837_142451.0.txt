Not many people have listened to this song , but it is an absolute masterpiece! 
Song Naam Ada Likhna from the film Yahaan . Sung by Shaan and Shreya Goshal , lyrics by Gulzaar and music by Shantanu Moitra . 
It will give you a peaceful and tranquil feeling and make you feel calm . The sweet , soft voice tone of the singers and soothing music transport you into another world. You will as if you sitting in the mountains enjoying, cool windy breeze . The lyrics are a cherry on top .
