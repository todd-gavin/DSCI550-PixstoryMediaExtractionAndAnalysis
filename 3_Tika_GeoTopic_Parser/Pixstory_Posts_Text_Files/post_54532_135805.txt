A recently announced export agreement between Canada and Germany offers Canada an opportunity to export hydrogen to Europe The Hydrogen Alliance proposes a transatlantic Canada Germany supply corridor to start exporting hydrogen by This target could be reached sooner with the export of hydrogen from Western Canada The transportation of hydrogen is more problematic than its production Hydrogen can be transported as a compressed gas or as liquid hydrogen but it is most economic to convert it into anhydrous ammonia which liquefies at much lower pressures for shipping The supply chain proposal is to ship ammonia from Alberta to Europe in specially designed ammonia freight containers via the Port of Churchill in Manitoba Ammonia containers shipped from Alberta would connect with the Hudson Bay Railway for delivery to a container terminal at Churchill From Churchill the ammonia could be delivered directly in a container ship to Europe or proceed via a feeder service to Halifax to be loaded onto larger container ships to cross the Atlantic Ocean While a few regulatory barriers need to be addressed like cabotage the movement of domestic freight by foreign shippers or trucks restrictions on feeder transport routes the project has minimal financial and market risk Blue vs green hydrogen At the heart of the alliance is a disagreement about the kind of hydrogen that should be produced Germany wants to import green hydrogen but Canada wants to keep producing blue hydrogen Just last year the Alberta and federal governments agreed to a billion blue hydrogen production investment that could result in a hydrogen plant being built in Edmonton Blue hydrogen is hydrogen produced from the removal of carbon from methane natural gas Instead of the carbon being released into the atmosphere it is captured and stored permanently underground Green hydrogen is produced with renewable or zero carbon energy but it is expensive and is expected to remain so until at least In the cost of producing blue hydrogen was to per kg versus the cost of green hydrogen at to per kg Read more
