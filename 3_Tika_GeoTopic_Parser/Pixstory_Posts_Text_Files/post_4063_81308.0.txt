As a representative of the younger generation, I would love to share my outlook towards relationships on this Valentine's  day. I experienced a great change from being a clingy teenager to somebody who would place her freedom over anything in the past years. 

Any relationship; let it be of a love-interest, parental, sibling, friends, casual anything always remember to give and take respect. The 'space' or the 'me time' is very important in a relationship. 

Always remember there isn't a forever! The only thing you have from your birth to death is yourself. So always place yourself; your needs, ambitions, opinions, choices with prime priority. If you can't love yourself you can't love anyone else. Just because you are broken and in need of help please don't get into a relationship. It could be toxic, you could be toxic! you could not even realise it. Don't give anybody control over your life. There could be mistakes, but mistakes are one to learn from.

And in love, love abundantly, love anyone you want, also be ready for rejections. Please don't force anybody to love you or harm them if they don't love you. 

Discuss everything including financial, sexual expectations with your partner. Talk about politics, ideologies, fears, strengths, ambitions. Make efforts, give them a surprise, communicate how much they mean to you, appreciate them for their good deeds, talk openly about their habits that you might find awkward. Communication is key in any relationship. 

Most of all, be in a place wherein you are a very healthy relationship built upon trust. You needn't tolerate any toxic behaviour, manipulation because you love them.

 Always have the courage to find love, take risks and at times let go. Always choose happiness and be with people who make you happy. Happy Valentine's day ðŸ’œ
