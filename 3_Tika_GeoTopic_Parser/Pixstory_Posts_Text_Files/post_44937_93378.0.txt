Nobody thought we'd ever see the day when Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo were being
questioned with the year's Ballon'dor favourite, and it not be one of the two. The usual
suspects for the title of 'Best player in the world' aren't having up to par seasons.

By any means, this is both upsetting (to see their decline) and exciting for other players in
the lead. The likes of Xavi Hernandez, Andres Iniesta and Franck Ribery have some
gruelling memories of the award ceremony that was once hosted by FIFA. Now though, It's
time for stars of the current to make their name. "And who might that be?" I hear you ask.

Cristiano Ronaldo has just one name in his mind.

"For the European Cup, Real Madrid are the favorites,” Ronaldo told Sky Sport Italia. "Then
they have Ancelotti on the bench, who is one of the best in the world.

The Portuguese believes the 13 time winners will lift this year's UCL trophy, with a 2nd leg
versus Chelsea impending.

"Benzema? He deserves the Ballon d’Or, I’ve been saying it for years and they’ve criticised
me, but he deserves it, he’s a great striker."

Ronaldo and Benzema, along with Gareth Bale formed one of the most formidable trios in
world football at the time. While both Ronaldo and Real struggled after going their own ways,
both have now had very decent seasons. Cristiano Ronaldo's numbers remain, for a 37 year
old — impressive.

The likes of Robert Lewandowski and Kylian Mbappé were also in the running for this year's
Ballon'dor, but now have been relegated to mere bystanders given Benzema's recent form.

Brazilian teammate Vinícius Júnior also entered the selection of players tipped to win, but
obviously is no match for the Frenchman who right at this moment is playing his best
football.
