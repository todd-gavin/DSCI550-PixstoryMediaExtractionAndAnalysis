When it was announced that director Todd Philips upcoming Joker was going to be a musical it raised a lot of doubt and surrounded the movie in a bubble of controversy Funnily enough we have all seen the Clown Prince of Crime doing the song and dance routine when surrounded in the blood of some poor bloke in almost all Batman media Joaquin Phoenix is all set to make his comeback as Joker in the upcoming sequel Joker Folie a Deux Furthermore Lady Gaga would be serving as his infamous partner in crime Harley Quinn Zazie Beetz who starred in s Joker as Arthur Fleck s love interest Sophie spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about her thoughts on the sequel being a musical She said I actually think it makes wonderful sense I wasn t really surprised by that Todd Phillips has always had a creative approach to the character I love musicals and I think of them as the characters are feeling and experiencing so much that they can only sing and dance about it whether in sorrow or in joy Beetz added I can actually see that within myself as well because singing and dancing is quite a cathartic experience for me I was going through a really really difficult time at one point in my life and I just started dancing and crying by myself And that was an expression that matched where I was at that moment And so I can see Arthur who is feeling and experiencing so much dancing and singing about it He s the Joker so I think it makes sense to me Perhaps a musical may after all further serve to enhance the portrayal of the true extent of Arthur Fleck s madness For the unversed Joaquin Phoenix s Joker not unlike the comic Joker has a tendency of getting lost in his own head putting himself in stories and creating elaborate scenarios which are either fully false or made up of half truths Injecting music may very allow Todd Philips to better explore Joker s methods of reality distortion and his other dark psychological mess in Folie Deux
