The Rise of BCCI

India kept on rising in terms of winning and hosting the matches. We won the T20I world cup 2007, ODI world cup 2011 and Champions Trophy 2013, this marked the golden era of Indian Cricket. Adding to this, we have also reached all the semi-finals in all the formats from 2007 T20I world cup till 2021 Test Championship. This amazing journey gave a boost to the council and the BCCI could cash in a lot of revenue which they have invested in developing infrastructure and giving the right platforms to players so that they can become world-class talent.

The Boom for BCCI

Indian Premier League, the revolutionary step in India’s cricket journey, changed the world’s perception towards BCCI at a whole new level. It was after 2008, with the commencement of the first ever domestic league in T20 format, that the world saw a totally different view of any tournament. IPL has become a crucial revenue generating source for BCCI. They earn the maximum from IPL sponsorships and media rights. If they sell the media rights for even five years, BCCI could still earn 50,000 Crores. IPL is the most sought-after event for companies in terms of sponsorship. No company wants to miss the opportunity to associate its brand name with IPL. During the pandemic time, BCCI still managed to have a net worth of 16000 Crore and maintained themselves as the richest cricket board in the world.
