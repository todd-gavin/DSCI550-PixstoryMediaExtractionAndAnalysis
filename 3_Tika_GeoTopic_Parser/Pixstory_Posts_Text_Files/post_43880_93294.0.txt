After being accused of assault by Roma, Bodo/Glimt coach Kjetil Knutsen said that the situation in the aftermath of the Europa Conference League given him a lot to think about. 

The Norwegians' 2-1 success over the Italians in a Europa Conference League encounter last week was tarnished by claims of a post-match brawl between coaches.

After the game, Roma captain Lorenzo Pellegrini claimed that Knutsen had attacked the Serie A team's goalkeeping coach. But, as Knutsen told Avisa Nordland, the encounter gave him a lot to think about:

"It is on a level that I have considered whether I should continue with this.

"It is so far from my, the club's and Norwegian football's values.

"You have to get in and gather strength in yourself to solve the situation in the best possible way.

"Such things can make me want to do something completely different.

"For me, the most important thing is to be able to see myself in the mirror. If it's at the expense of it, I have to consider whether it's actually worth it. This game costs a lot."

During their Serie A match against Salernitana on Sunday, Roma got embroiled in yet another scandal. A member of the capital club's staff was involved in a brawl with the bottom team of the Italian top flight.

 Jose Mourinho, the team's manager, apologised for the incident, acknowledging that one of his assistants taunted members of the opposing bench, implying that they would be demoted shortly.

At a press conference, the Portuguese coach stated: â€œI tell the truth, not like some clubs or the police. Someone on my bench told the Salernitana staff they were going to Serie B. I went to apologise for the lad who said that."
