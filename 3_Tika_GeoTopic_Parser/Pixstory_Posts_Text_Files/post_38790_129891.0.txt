Man Utd lost two consecutive matches at the hands of Brighton and Brentford, which highlighted United's lack of depth in the squad. United's frontline with Sancho,Fernandes, Eriksen and Ronaldo and Rashford look toothless. As a matter of fact, the first team needed a whole reboot. United jumped to make signings, and along with Cody Gakpo and Frenkie De Jong, Matheus Cunha was also discussed as a target.


Cunha is a Journeyman who spent his time with Swiss side Sion, before moving to Germany to play with RB Leipzig and later Hertha Berlin. After his impressive performance, it earned him a move to Atletico Madrid. He’s an Olympic gold medalist as his three goals and one assist saw him get recognised by top clubs at Tokyo Olympics 2020. 


Deployed as a versatile right-footed player, he could play forward and as well as  when deployed wide. Looking at his seasonal heatmap, we can see where he made passes, where he made touches,defensive duels and so on
