Black Eyed Peas and J Balvin are two of the latest acts to be confirmed to perform in Qatar during the Fifa World Cup.
Star-studded event World Stage, organised by Qatar Airways and Qatar Tourism in association with Alchemy Project, will bring superstars from across the world across six nights of music as part of the Qatar Live 2022 series.
The World Stage will kick off at the Doha Golf Club on November 20 with a show by Grammy Award-winning Los Angeles trio Black Eyed Peas — made up of will.i.am, apl.de.ap and Taboo — who recently performed in Saudi Arabia and at Expo 2020 Dubai.
On November 24, Colombian reggaeton star J Balvin, one of the world's best-selling Latin music artists, will take to the stage.
“We are proud to bring world-renowned music artists to Qatar," said Mac S Far, chief executive of Alchemy Project. “Extraordinary vibe, breathtaking atmosphere, unity of nations — Alchemy Project is excited to show you the power of music during these vibrant nights of the first and the only star-packed World Stage in Doha, which will give so much room for inspiration for everyone.”
Other acts and ticket prices for World Stage have yet to be announced.
This comes on the back of a flurry of announcements of music festivals taking place in Qatar throughout the world's biggest football event.
Last week, it was announced that Egyptian singer Amr Diab and EDM star David Guetta will perform at Aravia, which will take place in Al Wakrah, a city north of Doha, featuring up to 45 artists performing daily from November 21 to December 18.
