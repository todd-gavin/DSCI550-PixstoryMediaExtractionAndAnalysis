Far away from home and in the captial, Delhi for an internship in a hospital, i definitely missed all the onam vibes and so did my friends, we did bring in our Sarees, but were still unsure if we would and could drape  ourselves in it. 
But thankfully saree got draped well and you can see the result. 
But the surprising part was, this onam was much more eventful, 
Each floors of the hospital had a bed of flowers "Pookalam" and the best part of Onam that's the Sadhya was our lunch, the unexpected ❤️. 
It was indeed a surprise filled and a memorable onam  that I had till now. 
Also, Happy Onam Peeps ❤️🌸. Hope you had your sumptuous sadhya meal and have passed that sound nap.
