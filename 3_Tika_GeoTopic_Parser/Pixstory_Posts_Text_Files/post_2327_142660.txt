Oath means nothing for lawmakers in Goa On February this year Congress leader Rahul Gandhi led a loyalty pledge of election candidates of his party and three of the Goa Forward Party GFP This was ahead of the assembly elections in Goa on February The candidates swore loyalty to their respective parties and pledged not to defect after being elected to the assembly The Congress candidates had been administered an oath by priests in a temple a church and a shrine on January While the first pledge was taken with God as a witness the pledge of loyalty was on an affidavit They swore allegiance to the Indian Constitution In their pledge of loyalty in Konkani they said that if elected to the legislative assembly from the Congress party in they will complete their five year term as legislators of the Congress party according to the rules laid out in the Indian Constitution pledge loyalty to the Congress party and serve the people honestly absolutely not defect to another party not resign as an MLA and join another party and will not contest election from any other party Cut to September eight of the Congress legislators defected to the ruling BJP The defectors included former chief minister Digambar Kamat leader of Opposition Micheal Lobo his wife Delilah Lobo Kedar Naik Rudolfo Fernandes former Goa power minister Aleixo Sequeira Rajesh Phal Dessai and Sankalp Amonkar With eight in number they have avoided disqualification as members of the legislative assembly The anti defection law is not applied to legislators if the two thirds of the strength of a legislative party defect to another party So the oath clearly didn t mean anything for these lawmakers It was just a formality that they had to do before the elections Many of these Congress legislators are also facing allegations of corruption against them To avoid any action they have defected to the ruling party It seems a smart move but at the same time they have betrayed not only their party but the voters as well There is a need for a stronger anti defection law to avoid such betrayal
