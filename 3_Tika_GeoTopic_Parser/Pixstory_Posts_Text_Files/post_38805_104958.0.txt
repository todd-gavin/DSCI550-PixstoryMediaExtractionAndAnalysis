João Palhinha started his football career at the youth academy of Sporting CP in 2012, and he made his professional debut with the B team. He made only 2 appearances that season.


In 2017 he was loaned to Primera Liga side  Moreirense and Belenenses, respectively to get some experience and play in the first team. 


Palhinha returned to Sporting again and then was loaned out to Braga the following year. He returned to Sporting CP after failed negotiations with CSKA Moscow and Al Nassr. 

The Portuguese plays in the middle half of the pitch as a defensive midfielder but he has no problem transitioning to play as a centre-back.

Looking at his season heatmap we can see that all his actions have been in the middle third with his play sprayed over to defensive and attacking third.


Strengths

Standing at a towering height of 6ft 3inches, having physical strength, the midfielder is very powerful. His strength would be useless in a football match if he didn’t have the motivation to make it up for it. He is like a fast track bully trying to cover every blade of the pitch, stopping the attackers from moving forward and threatening his team.


He is a danger from free-kicks and corner-kicks as he knows where to position himself, and takes advantage of his 6’3 frame to score headed goals. 


He is not known for playing from the back, but he is known for moving to his defensive half to help his teammates. 


Weakness


He is a complete footballer so it's hard to pick a fault on him. 


Passing


Looking at his passing range, he has made 34.6 passes per 90 which is 88%. He has created 1 big chance for his team. His long passing range is also decent which comes to approximately 70%. He is not big on passing but he does enough to help his team. He sends accurate chipped passes over the opponent’s head to attackers for them to have goal scoring chance. He ranks 71% in it.


In the pass cluster, we can see that cluster 1 is the culmination of 2 clusters.
