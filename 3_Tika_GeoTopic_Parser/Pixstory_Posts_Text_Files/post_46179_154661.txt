Why do we see so many Indian men with pot bellies That is because men genetically have a tendency to store fat first on their stomach and only when they run out of space there does it get stored elsewhere in the body There are types of fat Subcutaneous fat the one that you can pinch on your tummy lies under the skin Visceral fat lodged deep in your stomach around the intestines liver and kidneys This keeps growing to give you the pot belly Reasons why Men have pot bellies Eating too many simple carbohydrates Stress from a bad workplace an unhappy relationship or a difficult academic life Lipoprotein lipase an enzyme necessary for fat storage men have higher concentration of this enzyme in the abdomen and hence are pot bellied Drinking alcohol especially whiskey and beer which are notorious for storing fat Eating the wrong food or at the wrong time or both Jobs that demands sitting for longer durations At this point I have a bad news and a good news Bad It s next to impossible to actually target and spot bust fat pockets Good However the upshot is that since visceral fat is metabolically active it s the first type to burn off if you exercise regularly But for those who can t take time out for work outs making Dietary changes can do wonders for their body Don t overindulge and give the carbs a miss at night Eat small meals every two hours six seven times a day Eat more veggies fruit and probiotic curds to stay light Include beans and spinach as they make you feel full Get a healthy diet plan from a professional Share this with someone you know a pot bellied
