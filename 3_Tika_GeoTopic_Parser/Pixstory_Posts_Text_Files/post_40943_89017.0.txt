Pro-Trump musician Kid Rock has claimed there are "a ton" of prominent people in Hollywood who are "closeted" supporters of the former president.

Kid Rock, known offstage as Robert James Richie, was speaking during an interview with far-right Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Monday night.

Asked by Mr Carlson whether there were others in showbiz who shared his views, Mr Ritchie said that during the 2020 election Trump aides would often privately name “Hollywood people” who were “in the closet”.

“I’m like, ‘those people are all gay? That’s nuts!’”, said Mr Ritchie. “They’re like, ‘no no no no, they’re closet Trump fans!

“That was kind of mind-blowing. I'm not going to talk out of school on these people, they obviously don't want to be out in the open for whatever reasons they have, but yeah there's a ton of 'em...”

He further added that "Me and Trump talk about them a lot. They have no idea how many of us they are. The vocal ones, sure, you know who you are,
you see 'em, but they have no idea how many of us there are out there that are either Trump fans or just more conservative."
