Stormé DeLarverie was an American woman known as the butch lesbian whose scuffle with police was, according to Stormé and many eyewitnesses, the spark that provoked the Stonewall uprising, spurring the crowd to action.

 She was born in New Orleans, to an African American mother and a white father. She is recollected as a gay civil rights icon and entertainer, who performed and hosted at the Apollo Theater and Radio City Music Hall.

 She worked for much of her life as an MC, singer, bouncer, bodyguard, and volunteer street patrol worker, the "guardian of lesbians in the Village." She is known as "the Rosa Parks of the gay community."

Before she participated in Stonewall, DeLarverie was a phenomenal drag performer whose publicity snaps show affinity towards zoot suits and black ties. 

The gender-fluid dressing has become a major force in fashion over the past few seasons, but DeLarverie’s approach to style is an early, striking example of it.

She enticed the attention of legendary photographer Diane Arbus, whose 1961 portrait of her, “Miss Storme de Larverie [sic], the lady who appears to be a gentleman,” has occurred in multiple Arbus retrospectives.

She was a regular at the gay pride parade. For decades Delarverie attended to the community as a volunteer street patrol worker, the "guardian of lesbians in the Village.

In addition to her work for the LGBT community, she also governed and performed benefits for battered women and children.

In June 2019, DeLarverie was one of the inaugural fifty American "pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes" inaugurated on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City's Stonewall Inn.

 The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, and the wall's unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.
