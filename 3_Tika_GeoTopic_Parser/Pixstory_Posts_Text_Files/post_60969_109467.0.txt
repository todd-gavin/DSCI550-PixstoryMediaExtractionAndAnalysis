I remember my first stage experience. I froze like a deer in front of headlights. When I look back to it, it always makes me laugh. However, I know that is now how I felt that time. I was very conscious and nervous. Stage fright is what I had; no matter how much I rehearsed, I used always to blank out when I got on stage. My dad then took the initiative to send me to a public speaking cub: Toastmasters. I was reluctant to join, knowing that I would have to stand on a podium and speak to an audience. However, I am glad that my dad made me join the club. I was not only able to overcome my fear of stages and public speaking, but I also became a four-time national champion in Toastmasters. I found out how I wanted to express my thoughts and views on life, but my fear held me back. Speaking became my passion, a way to connect with people and express myself.
