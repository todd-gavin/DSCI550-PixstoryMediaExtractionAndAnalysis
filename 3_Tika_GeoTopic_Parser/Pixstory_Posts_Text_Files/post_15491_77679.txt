An international research group coordinated by the Institute of Chemistry of Organometallic Compounds of the CNR of Sesto Fiorentino has synthesized for the first time a crystalline arsenic nitride from the reaction of arsenic and nitrogen at high pressure and high temperature. The results of the study are published in the journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition Arsenic As and molecular nitrogen N do not react spontaneously at ambient conditions Generating conditions of very high pressure and temperature times atmospheric pressure and about C obtained by means of instruments called diamond anvil cells in combination with laser heating techniques researchers of the Institute of Chemistry of the organometallic compounds of the National Research Council Cnr Iccom of the European laboratory for non liner spectroscopy Lens of Sesto Fiorentino of the European synchrotron radiation facility Esrf of Grenoble and of the Departments of chemistry of the University of Florence and Pavia have managed to induce a chemical reaction between arsenic and molecular nitrogen in the absence of solvents or catalysts and to synthesize for the first time a crystalline arsenic nitride with chemical formula AsN The crystal obtained has characteristics similar to those of a form of nitrogen called cubic gauche nitrogen cg N consisting of a crystalline lattice of atoms of nitrogen cg N considered one of the highest energy density materials and has attracted considerable interest in the energy field for potential applications as an explosive or propellant both in aerospace engineering and in the field of sustainable mobility with low environmental impact since the release of energy takes place through the decomposition into molecules of N which naturally constitute about 1 of the earth&#39;s atmosphere To date it has not been possible to recover this material at ambient conditions neither in a metastable form nor stabilizing it with the presence of other elements The structure of the crystal of arsenic nitride AsN which we have synthesized was determined using XRD X-ray diffraction techniques with a synchrotron source at Esrf explains Matteo Ceppatelli, Cnr ICcom researcher who coordinated the research This has allowed us to discover how characteristic structural motifs are present in the AsN crystal with important implications for the stability of the system
