Well, if you speak of eccentrics as people with mental health issues, then I think you need to correct your facts.

And I think it is rightly said that most people tend to follow conventions and never lead a happy life. But eccentrics don't have to deal with all such issues.
They are the most carefree people in the world and would never think of anyone before choosing to do what they do.
They basically tell us that sticking to non-conformities can have health benefits and make you better as a person.

People who don't repress their inner nature in the struggle to conform suffer less. As a result, they're happier, and their immune systems work more efficiently.
David Week, the Edinburgh psychiatrist, in his book 'Eccentrics: A Study of Sanity and Strangeness' found that the people who care less about the correct behaviour that most others follow tend to visit doctors 20 times less often than most of us. They're more optimistic about their lives. 
And eccentrics have a childlike curiosity and drive to make the world a better place to live. 

David also enumerated some points about these people that make them better human beings; the lingering pursuit t find happiness all the time by doing everything carefree makes them perfect in other fields of life as well. They're more creative and find innovative solutions that never blindly follow the majority. 

So it is rightly said that people who don't have the constant urge to follow the conventional rules tend to stay happier, and eccentrics are the epitome of such carefree people.
