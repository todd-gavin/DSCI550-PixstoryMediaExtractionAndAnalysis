In an recent interviews with katrina kaif amidst her release of “phonebooth” a horror comedy movie . Katrina told “she always chooses films based on how engaging the story is”.✔️“As you said Merry Christmas, working with a director like Sriram Raghavan, he is one of my favourite directors. I love the kind of thriller stories he tells. Working with a phenomenal actor like Vijay (Sethupathi), and then says Katrina. 💯✔️She further adds, “Working again in that franchise that I have so much regards for because Adi (Aditya Chopra, producer) gives Zoya’s role (her character in the movie) that kind of prominence and importance in the action, and I love doing action. Ofcourse, working with Salman again is fantastic✅.” Katrina Kaif informs that she felt the same thing about Phone Bhoot. “The minute I heard the story, I just immediately said yes. I didn’t even tell Ritesh (Sidhwani, producer) that, ‘Okay, let me see, give me a few days’, because I felt that this concept and story was something unique enough to be told,” she shares. ✅
