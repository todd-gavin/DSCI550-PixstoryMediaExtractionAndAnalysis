After nearly spending a whole year limited to online interactions only, we were stoked to finally meet our seniors after campuses reopened. We got only one year together but we made the most out of it, making memories to the fullest.

To celebrate these memories, and bid a bittersweet 'Alvida' to our lovely seniors, we organized a grand Bollywood Themed Farewell Party.

And as the theme suggests, this event had it all- Naach Gana Dhammal, We all danced to the beats of iconic Bollywood songs for the DJ Event. For snacks a full too Bambaiya style chaat corner was set up by the likes of Pani Puri counter was which was a total crowd-puller. 

The Highlight of the event was A.V with glimpses of their memories through the 3 memorable years, which had our seniors in priceless reactions. 

Dear Seniors,Aapki badi yaad aayegi.Par khete hai na...Kahin pohochne ke liye kahi se nikalna bohot jaroori hai....
