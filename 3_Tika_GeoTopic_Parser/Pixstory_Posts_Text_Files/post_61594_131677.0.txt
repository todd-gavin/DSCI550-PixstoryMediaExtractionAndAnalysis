Johnny Gargano shocked the wrestling world on Raw when he made his WWE return and now a new report has shed more light on his comeback.
Gargano walked away from WWE when his contract with the company expired following the NXT War Games event that saw NXT 2.0 pick up a victory over the old guard of the black and gold era of the brand.
While the speculation grew over Gargano’s wrestling future in the past nine months, ‘Johnny Wrestling’ himself kept quiet until Monday Night Raw in Toronto, Canada.
The former NXT Champion made his entrance to a rapturous reception and addressed the crowd in attendance. Gargano spoke of wanting to become a champion in WWE and wanting to show his young son that dreams can come true. However, he was soon interrupted by his old ally in The Way, Theory.
Theory spoke to Gargano about all of his accomplishments while Gargano was out of the company but still offered Gargano the chance to do their old high five. Johnny Gargano replied with a super kick to Theory’s face.
Fightful Select reported that Gargano’s return to WWE was kept a closely guarded secret and that his name was kept off run sheets for Raw. The report continues to say that WWE kept in contact with Gargano during his time away from the company and that the chances of a return drastically increased when Triple H took the reins off the company from Vince McMahon.
