The time was about 5 am with clear light as we entered the village and noticed routine activities going on with some people freshening up in the fields and others collecting water or engaged otherwise. 

The school was in the middle of the village with houses around at a distance. As my vehicle took a turn to approach the main gate of the school from its boundary, it reached the gate within no time and I could notice a man standing with a 7.62mm Self Loading Rifle (SLR) pointed at us. The distance between him and our vehicle was hardy 6 to 8 feet and had he fired we may not have survived to share the experience. 

But destiny had it otherwise. We were deep inside the so called liberated zone of the Maoists with virtually no communication with the outside world for a distance of not less than 20 kms on either side and had met them. Seeing the armed Maoist cadre looking at us unaware at such a close distance came like an unexpected surprise since it was a school building that was planned to be visited, and Maoist presence in a School was unthought of. For a fraction of a moment on seeing the SLR, I felt as if it was a police constable on sentry duty guarding the premises. 

But it did not take much time to realise that we had encountered the hostile enemy and had to immediately take recourse to tactics if we were to survive.
