One of the most populated, pristine, serene, and beautiful cities in Europe is Zurich. A trip to this charming town gives you the chance to experience the urban bustle, the beautiful landscape, dance parties, drinking beyond midnight, and the rich culture and traditions of the region. You should make sure to visit Zurich when in Switzerland. While the entire city is as if a love of God himself, the nerd in me personally loved being at these four places:

1) Altstadt (Old Town)
Much of the city's culture, nightlife, and shopping are focused on the mediaeval and early modern streets of the Altstadt. Squares, cafes, oddball boutiques, and a variety of historical landmarks, including the Town Hall from the 17th century and the four ancient churches.

2) Lake ZÃ¼rich
The wooded peaks of Pfannenstiel to the east and the Albis chain to the west are both passed by this long, crescent-shaped lake as it curves.

3) Beyer Clock and Watch Museum
A fascinating museum detailing the development of timekeeping and the craft of watchmaking may be found underneath the Beyer jeweller and watch store on Bahnhofstrasse.

4) Museum of Art
A collection that stands out for having the world's greatest collection of works by Swiss 20th-century artist Alberto Giacometti includes works from the 1200s to the 2000s.
