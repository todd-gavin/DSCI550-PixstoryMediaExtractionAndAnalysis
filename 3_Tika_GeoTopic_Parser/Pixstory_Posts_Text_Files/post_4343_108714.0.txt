I read below message today morning , thought provoking suggestion 
I like it hence sharing with you all. 
“
I propose that a scheme similar to Agniveer should be introduced for our dear MPs and MLAs too. MPs may be named Karmaveers and MLAs Sevaveers once they have completed 5 years of service to the nation. During the 5 year tenure, they would receive training for 1 year and would be paid a consolidated salary plus allowances. On completion of 5 years, only 25% of them would be eligible to seek re-election based on their performance and the rest would receive a one-time severance package. No pension or other privileges/benefits will be paid. Those who have served as cabinet ministers would receive a citation describing him/her as Param Karmaveer or Maha Karmaveer or Param Sevaveer , Maha Sevaveer etc. I am sure this proposal would receive 100% support”
