In an absolutely enthralling game of football, Liverpool came up trumps against Crystal Palace at Selhurst park, beating them 3-1. 
               It seemed like smooth sailing for the Reds after Virgil Van Dijk and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored in the first half, and it seemed like they'd have more. But going 0-2 down stirred something in the eagles and they came out all guns blazing, cutting the Liverpool defence into ribbons, with young sensation Michael Olise leading from the front. Every time he had the ball, he made things happen, and repeatedly torched left back Andrew Robertson. One of the best left backs in the league was made to eat dust each time Olise ran past him, with hhim just not able to keep up with the dynamic young Englishman. 
                The attacking verve of the eagles was so intense, it finally told off as Palace got the goal they deserved through Odsonne Edouard, and kept on banging on the door for more, and would have had it if not for Alisson. The Brazilian was sensational between the sticks, thwarting multiple shots and covering the box with regal authority. 
             It would have been a nail-biting end, if not for a controversial penalty that was awarded to the visitors which Fabinho duly dispatched, Making sure the 3 points came to Merseyside. This is a Massive boost to Liverpool, who know all well about the nightmares of the January period. This win puts them in a position to catch up to Man City and actually give them a run for their money.
