Sonam Kapoor and Anand Ahuja on Saturday were blessed with a baby boy, and with this Sonam's parents Anil and Sunita Kapoor became 'Nana and Nani'. Several wishes for Sonama and Anand poured in, and amongst others, Karan Johar also reacted to the news during his Instagram Live last evening. Though Karan gave all his best wishes to the couple, he also added a twist to his message for Sonam and Anand.❤️❤️

At first, Karan congratulated Sonam and Anand for the good news and also talked about Sonam embracing motherhood. 

Later, the filmmaker talked about Anil Kapoor, and his wife Sunita are now grandparents. He said, “I can’t believe Sonam is a mother now. I don’t think Anil will like being called a nana because he is jawan as hell.”🔥😂
