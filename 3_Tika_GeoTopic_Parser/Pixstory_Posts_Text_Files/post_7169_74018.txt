Salim the Disposable Tracing the absconder Salim Kurla continues As we came closer we found to our surprise the doors of the ground floor flat all wide open A brightly lit room appeared before us with loud Hindi film music playing from a stereo system Surprisingly there was no one in the room We walked in and found ourselves in the middle of a large and reasonably well furnished living room After a few shouts of Koi hai Is someone there a ten year old boy appeared Strangely he was not in the least surprised or startled on seeing us We asked him for his parents who too emerged from an adjoining room almost simultaneously most unfazed by the presence of so many strangers When we introduced ourselves as CBI officers they asked us to sit down and offered refreshments We politely declined On being asked whether the landline number xx was installed in their house their response was in the affirmative When asked if any outsider used the phone occasionally they again said yes They further disclosed that the occupant of the second floor flat namely Ahmad used their phone once in a while Inspector Raman Tyagi showed the photograph of Salim Kurla to the flat owner R K Rathi who confirmed that indeed it was the same person On checking the second floor flat it was found locked A huge lock hung at the door Rathi and family the occupants of the ground floor informed that Ahmad Saheb as Salim Kurla was known to them had left the same morning with his wife and three children in a Fiat car They gave us the car s registration number color and other description As a routine response we asked the Hyderabad Police officers accompanying us as support staff to have the details broadcast over police wireless Nothing further was left to be done at the spot Satish and I decided to leave for the Police Mess To be continued
