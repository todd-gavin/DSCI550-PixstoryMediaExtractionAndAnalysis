Ariel is not black, making her so would not demonstrate equality. It just transforms a well-liked character in an unrecognisable way. It is not unique, it's not "inclusive". It's just changing a white character to a black one.
Imagine if they suddenly changed a well-known black character to white. The public would go crazy over it! Why not create new black characters instead and release a new film? That would be acceptable to everyone. A lack of inspiration, perhaps?
Ariel is white. She is allegedly Danish. She loves the color of her red hair, blue-ish eyes, and very light skin. It's just not realistic to show her black! This story was written long ago, many people have their sentiments attached to it so it should be respected enough to cast the right actors are would work in those characters.
