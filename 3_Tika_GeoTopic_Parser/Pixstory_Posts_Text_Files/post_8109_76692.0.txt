Ministry of Public Health of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan announced that they have administered 3.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines since the Taliban regained power.

The Ministry said that they still have 3 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines at their disposal and that 5 million more have been pledged to arrive in Afghanistan.
Spokesperson of the Ministry Javed Hazheer said that they are distributing the vaccines in schools, universities, government administrations, mosques, and other places apart from health clinics across Afghanistan.

“We have 1064 vaccination centers in Afghanistan among them 124 in Kabul and 911 in other provinces. We administer 21 thousand doses of COVID-19 vaccines on daily basis.” Said Hazheer.
Afghanistan has been receiving COVID-19 vaccines from the US, China, India, and COVAX international program.

It comes as the pandemic is no longer a threat in Afghanistan as the positive cases are rarely reported in the country.

In the meantime, Afghanistan has not reported any case of the Omicron variant yet.
