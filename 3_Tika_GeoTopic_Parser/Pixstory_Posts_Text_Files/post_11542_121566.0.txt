Try to eat a balanced diet of fruit, vegetables, grains, protein foods and diary each day. 

👉Drink plenty of liquids.
Your body needs lot of fluid (about 6-10 glasses a day) especially if you are breastfeeding your baby. Drink mostly water, milk, and fruit juice.

👉Eat foods that have protein.
Proteins such as milk, cheese, yogurt, meat, fish and beans. Protein rich foods are important to help you recover from childbirth and keep your body strong. 

👉Take prenatal vitamins. 
If you are breastfeeding, it is a good idea to continue to take your prenatal vitamins

👉Limit junk foods. 
Soda pop, cookies, donuts, potato chips and french fries are okay sometimes, but don’t let them take the place of healthy foods!

👉Avoid Caffeine
Caffeine is a stimulant that passes through breast milk to the baby and may affect growth. Caffeine is found in tea, coffee, chocolate, many soft drinks and over-the-counter medicines.
