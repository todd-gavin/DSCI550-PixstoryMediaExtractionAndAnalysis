Antony This transfer should be taken with a grain of salt Many top clubs are after this Brazilian He plays as both right winger and left winger In ETH s Ajax he usually played as an inverted right winger This season he has goals and assists to his name The Dutch boss would do everything in his power to get him and Timber to the Old Trafford But they would need to battle for his signature because it is rumoured Liverpool and other European clubs are after this pacey left footed winger How will Ten Hag Use Cristiano Ronaldo Ten Hag needs to sit with Ronaldo and ask him if he can play high up the pitch at He will demand that to give him at least min on the pitch Having scored goals this season Ten Hag would want him in his team Ten Hag s Style Of Play Eth will set up a system with players but it ll be a highly fluid and mobile system with players interchanging their positions Taking his Ajax side when they have the ball we see their wingers high up and wide stretching the pitch a No Bruno Fernandes in the attacking midline while another midfielder is joined by left back and right back creating back in the centre back this shape resembles formation but as a proprietor of positional play it resembles formation A big part of positional play is to maintain horizontal and vertical lines with a maximum of or players in each line at a time Rigidity in the team is what makes the positional rotation so frequent to retain the structure while using off the ball movement to manipulate the opponent the attacking structure also provides a start point for ETH s counter press which sees his players swarm the opposition to regain the form The formation will switch to or or depending on the scenario Expect ETH to implement his formation in the United team
