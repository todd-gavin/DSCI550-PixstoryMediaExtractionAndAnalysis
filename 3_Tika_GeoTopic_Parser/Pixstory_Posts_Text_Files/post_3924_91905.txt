I look at you as if the doors of my eyes just opened to the roads that were never taken Dry branches upon you have taken rest but still stands as a beauty in my frame Your beauty stands as an awe to me and shows me the paths that I have never thought about You give me comfort while I look at you You make me look around one last time to cherish your unfathomable nature You give me relief and comfort and a chance to run back to your waves Salty water sand on my hair with a castle build on the bed of sand I stand with my eyes wide open to your waves of blue beauty You pull me back every time I look at you and I will return to you soon
