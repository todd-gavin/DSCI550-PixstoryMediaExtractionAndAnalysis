In Indonesia, a stampede following a soccer match between Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya resulted in 129 deaths and 180 injuries, making it one of the deadliest sporting tragedies in recent history. Unfortunately, such tragedies are prevalent in sports, with stampedes causing as many fatalities as terrorist attacks. Over 80 people were killed during the 1996 World Cup qualifier between Guatemala and Costa Rica. Nearly 40 people were killed at a soccer game in South Africa, in 2001. Many blame the police for aggravating the stampede and causing the deaths by firing teargas into densely populated areas, making people to flee for safety with impaired vision and breathing. Tragically, several children were reported to be among the victims.
