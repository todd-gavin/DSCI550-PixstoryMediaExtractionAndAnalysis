So Erik Ten Hag joins Manchester United. After much deliberation between Erik Ten Hag and Paris Saint Germain coach Mauricio Pochettino, the board decided to go with the ex-Ajax boss, who concluded this season by winning 3 Eredivisie champions 3 times in 4 years. Man United also had a change in management with chief executive Edward Woodward stepping down, and he was replaced with Richard Arnold. John Murtough has been bought as director of football for Man Utd. Mitchell Van Der Gaarg joins the boss as his assistant. United also managed to bring in Steve McLaren to join United as a coach. Man United interim manager Ralf Rangnick bought on to steady the ship after the Glazers fired Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but could not do much as United are poised to finish in sixth place and well out of the Champions League spot. The Red Devils were unable to adapt to his high pressing style, also known as ‘gegenpressing’. However, Ralf had jotted down players as there will be a massive exodus this summer. The likes of Paul Pogba, Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic are expected to leave. Plus there are players who were not up to the mark and are also expected to be sold. 


The boss has been given a transfer kitty of 150 million, which could rise to 200 million after sales of underperforming players. He has a list of players he wants to bring with him to Old Trafford and start a new era. 
Defence


United defence has been worrying. The United trio of Victor Lindelof, Raphael Varane and Captain Harry Maguire have looked out of place. Man United conceded a shocking 56 goals this season, which has forced the board to look at the defensive reinforcements for the new manager.
