U.S. Republicans in Congress are targeting the rights of transgender people by setting a playbook for action on a divisive social issue should they take control of Congress this fall.

 So far there have been issues with transgender rights on the state level and this would extend to a federal level according to NBC news.

There are a set of bills. Republicans in the House of Representatives have introduced a bill that would block federal funding to colleges where transgender women are allowed to participate in sports with cisgender women. 

A separate bill would allow transgender people to sue medical personnel who helped them transition as minors.

Another bill would block allocation to schools that disobey state laws regarding “materials harmful to minors,” mimicking state laws that have been used to remove books discussing history around race and LGBTQ themes.

The bills have support from key Republicans in the House and Senate. Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has promoted the sports bill at a press conference and in a conservative newspaper. It is backed by 127 of 211 House Republicans.


They might put forward the bill if they win the midterms so vote for those who protect your rights as well as of others. Vote wisely America!.


“I hope these are legislative initiatives that we can pass when we get the majority back,” said Rep. Jim Banks, who sponsored the medical provider's bill and represents a district in Indiana, which banned transgender students from playing on girls’ sports teams at schools this May.
