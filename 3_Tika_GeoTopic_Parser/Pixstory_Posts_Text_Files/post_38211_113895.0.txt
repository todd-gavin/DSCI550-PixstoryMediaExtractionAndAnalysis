Matthijs De Ligt looked to be firmly in the sights of Chelsea Football Club. But reports are now suggesting that Bayern Munich have entered the fray and are very confident in their pursuit of the Juventus defender.

German news agency Sports11 even suggested that  Matthijs De Ligt and Bayern Munich have agreed personal terms. Owing to this, the Bavarians are now favourites over Chelsea to sign the defender in the summer transfer window. 

Bayern Munich have already started the summer transfer window positively. The Bundesliga champions signed Sadio Mane from Liverpool in a major transfer bid as they look to improve their chances of winning the UEFA Champions League next season. 

As stated earlier, Chelssa did make an official bid for De Ligt but Juventus are yet to reply to the said bid of €69m, which is considerably lower than their expectations. 

It has been consistently reported that Juventus want in the neighborhood of €100 million for de Ligt and have made it rather clear that they want it to be straight cash. While Bayern aren’t exactly coming in with any sort of massive offers right off the bat, according to previous reports, there’s a general feeling that they want to close this quick. It has to be seen if Bayern would pay up anywhere close to that or would Chelsea make another bid to improve their chances.
