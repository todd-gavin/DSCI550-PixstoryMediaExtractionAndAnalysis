The beaches of Esperance are rated among the best in the world – and Twilight Bay is one of the town's most loved.

Here, impossibly white sand meets unbelievably clear turquoise water creating a beautiful vista and perfect swimming conditions.

Gently rounded granite cliffs and the deepening blue ocean make this area of coastline one of Australia’s most scenic.

Twilight Bay is a few minute’s drive from Esperance.

It takes a day to drive to Esperance from Perth or you can fly there in one-and-a-half hours.

One of the cleanest and most amazing beach around the world. It should definitely be on everyone's travel Iteniary
