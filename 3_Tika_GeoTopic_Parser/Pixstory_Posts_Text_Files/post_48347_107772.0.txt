Happiness can be a person. It can be many people that you love who share your vibe. Those groups accept who you are without judgement. Those groups that don't exhaust you. Those people who understand you give your space and make you comfortable. Its holding hands, laughter, eye contact, hugs, smiles, smirks and everything sweet.
