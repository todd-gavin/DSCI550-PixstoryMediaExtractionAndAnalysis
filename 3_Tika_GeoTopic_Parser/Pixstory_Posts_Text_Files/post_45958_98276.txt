In recent years native mascots have become the topic of heated debate In February the Washington football team which previously had a Native mascot introduced the Commanders as their new mascot signalling the end of one Native mascot on the national stage However the local Native American population is unsure when that change will be implemented in Massachusetts schools and towns The primary goal which was a goal when I was a student is to humanize American Indian people said David Shane Lowry a member of the Lumbee Tribe and a distinguished fellow in Native American studies at MIT Lowry argues that a big part of the problem is that Native people aren t deemed human enough to be included in significant or even everyday discussions According to Lowry this may be evident in a variety of areas of life but especially when watching sports Our humanity has been so removed that now we become an animalized non human character on a football field The Chiefs played the Lions The Chiefs played the Bears right he said It s high time we stop talking about rights of Native Americans and actually take some action to advocate for their rights
