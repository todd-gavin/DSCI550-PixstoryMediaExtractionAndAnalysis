The Value of the rupee declined from 63.33 against the dollar on December 311, 2014 to 79.41 on July 11, 2022, the government said in Parliament on Monday.

The finance ministry told Parliament that in 2014, as per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the exchange rate was Rs.63.33 to a dollar. By July 11, 2022, it had dropped to Rs 79.41.

But WHY is the Rupee value dropping against the Dollar?

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stated in the Lok Sabha that global aspects such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, soaring crude oil prices and tightening of the global financial conditions were the major reasons for the weakening of the Indian rupee against the US dollar.

The finance minister, yet, told that the decline of the Indian currency is not an isolated phenomenon and currencies such as the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Euro have weakened more than the Indian rupee against the US dollar and as a result, the Indian rupee has strengthened against these currencies in 2022.
