 Thor Love and Thunder directed by Taika Waititi is a superhero comedy action adventure film This is the first time that any MCU character has gotten his own standalone film four times The standard is what you can expect of all Phase MCU content The story is simple enough it features Christian Bale as Gorr the God Butcher who seeks to destroy all the gods with the power of the Necrosword an artifact that empowers its users to slay gods and Thor Chris Hemsworth Valkyrie Tessa Thompson Mighty Thor Natalie Portman and Korg Taika Waititi seek to stop him The movie reunites Thor with his old love interest Jane Foster who is now wielding the Mjolnir Thor s old hammer which was shattered by Hela in the previous film thus becoming Mighty Thor in the process One of the highlights of the film is its focus on the former couple s relationship which is done really well Both seem to feel awkward around each other and there are some clearly unsaid things between them Plus it is nice to see that Jane is clearly a newbie at her job who constantly seeks instruction from Thor Visually this movie is exceptionally good from the sets designs colours and the VFX it is all top notch and while the entire cast is great Christian Bale s performance as Gorr is the biggest standout Not only is his acting brilliant but the way his character is designed and handled is amazing For one there is no useless comedy during his scenes making them even better But apart from Gorr nothing really stands out much Essentially a sort of rock comedy with a great GNR soundtrack Love and Thunder takes the humour too far with the entire movie falling short of its predecessor Love and Thunder takes Ragnarok s entire formula and stretches it way too much and turns it from dumb fun to just outright dumb and annoying at times with its overdose of humour On a whole this is a dumb but entertaining movie ending on an unsatisfactory note Score
