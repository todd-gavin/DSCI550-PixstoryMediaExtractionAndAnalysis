The festival of Holi is one of the most important in the Indian subcontinent. It happens on the full moon night of the month of phalgun, or spring.
Holi, also known as the festival of colours, the festival of love, and the celebration of spring, ushers in the harvest season and brings an end to a long winter.

It’s been around 5 years since I last played Holi with my friends. I still get nostalgic looking at these pictures. While some enjoy it, I don’t always . The colours the sweets and Ghandi every bit of it is very fascinating on it’s own yet I have my own way of celebrating this occasion.


Cook
For a Bengali family we call it Dol not Holi, we do love the sweets and any occasion that calls for special food preparations just fascinates me. I did prepare the Gujiyas but also we have this tradition of preparing Malpua. 
 The scorching heat does require rehydration as well so who says no to a Thandai, I means Thandai.

Cleaning
For Hindus New year is upon us and defiantly calls for a cleaning of house and as winters end replacing all your woollens with summer clothes, I would say that’s a task we all have to do yet don’t don’t want to do. My mother, as all mothers (respectfully ) has the OCD for cleaning so, fastening my belts and breaking my lower back by brooming the cobwebs around house because I am tall. It’s fun and quite how I love to spend this quality time.

Plan a movie marathon
Coping up with studies, work and  future planning, We try to take these occasions to just sit together and watch all the movies and OTTs we missed. Staying on bed with AC on what more relaxing the that.

Without colours Holi is still very colourful for me
