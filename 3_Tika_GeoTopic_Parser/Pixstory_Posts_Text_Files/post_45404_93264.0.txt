Group E 

Teams: Germany, Spain, Japan and Costa Rica/New Zealand


This is one of the glamor groups of the FIFA World Cup 2022. The group consists of European heavyweights, Germany and Spain along with Asian giants, Japan. Germany and Spain have not lived up to the hype in Euro 2020 and World Cup 2018. Both teams will look for redemption when they go up in Qatar. 


On the other hand, Japan will not be happy about the draw and the group they are in. Japan have never qualified for the knockouts and their chances look slim this year again. The question will be can they outlast the European heavyweights? 


Expected Group Winner: Germany

Surprise Element: Japan


Group F 


Teams: Belgium, Croatia, Morocco and Canada


This is the last chance for the Golden Generation of Belgium. After bottling the FIFA World Cup 2018, Euro 2016 and Euro 2020, they will focus on landing a trophy atleast once. However, they will be up against Croatia, Morocco and Canada who are on a great run in their respective confederations. 


Croatia made it to the finals of FIFA World Cup 2018 but France were too hot to handle. They will look to avenge the defeat but the aging side will do no good. On the other hand, Canada are the hottest prospect in world football after they topped the qualifying stage. One cannot take Morocco out of the equation as well. 


Expected Group Winner: Belgium

Surprise Element: Canada
