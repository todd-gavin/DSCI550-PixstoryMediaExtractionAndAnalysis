It's an oldie, but it's a goodie. Andrew Barton Banjo Paterson is the author of that dusty book that makes you smile when you read it in op shops and secondhand bookshops. He was a bush poet first and foremost, as well as a journalist and author. He penned ballads and poetry about the beauty and simplicity of life in the outback of Australia. 

The classic Waltzing Matilda is his most well-known poem. He also authored The Man from Snowy River, a story about a valiant pioneer who fights off a horde of brumbies in order to save a prized racehorse.

The Man from the Snowy River relates the story of a horseback chase to recover the colt of a prizewinning racehorse that has escaped from its paddock and is now living among the mountain ranges' brumbies (wild horses). The collected riders give up the pursuit when the brumbies descend an apparently impossible steep slope, save for the young protagonist, who spurs his "pony" (little horse) down the "awful fall" and catches the crowd. 

Moreover, Clancy of the Overflow" and Harrison from "Old Pardon, Son of Reprieve" are two characters referenced early in the poem who have been in prior Paterson poems.
