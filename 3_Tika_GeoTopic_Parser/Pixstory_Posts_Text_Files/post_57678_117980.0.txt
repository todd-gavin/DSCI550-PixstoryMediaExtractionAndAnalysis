Lying in your bed in the middle of the night, there pops a thought of what you did in the morning and how it was not fine.
Entering that state of rumination, you'll tend to overthink everything with a negative mindset.
Yes, overthinking is real, and it exists for everyone in this world, not just for you or me.
Research suggests that 73% of 25- to 35-year-olds chronically overthink, along with 52% of people ages 45 to 55.
The only difference that has occurred because of our changing lifestyles and constant use of social media is that the age difference has come down to 20-25 or even the teens.

Basically, people overthink a lot about everything. 
But have you ever thought about why people entangle themselves in this process of thinking and rethinking?

Most people overthink because of some stress or anxiety. But, apart from these, it could be the imbalances in their lives, either issue with self-esteem or self-doubt.
It is also likely that sometimes people tend to yearn for certain things. Still, when they don't achieve it or are unhappy about how things are happening in their lives, they tend to create a constant negative mindset for everything, leading to over-rumination.

Also, overthinking can be associated with conditions or depression, eating disorders and substance use disorders. 
For most people, overthinking never ends because it has become a habit.
However, we need to understand how malignant it is to overthink everything; people tend to make a belief that everything happening in the world is against them and this harmful.
So people should try to find ways to stop overthinking or at least work on it slowly.
