The Sydney Opera House is located on Bennelong Point (formerly known as Cattle Point), a peninsula on the harbour's south bank, immediately east of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It was named after Bennelong, one of two Aboriginal men (the other being named Colebee) who functioned as liaisons between Australia's earliest British settlers and the locals. The land was formerly occupied by the modest building where Bennelong resided. Fort Macquarie was erected there in 1821. (razed 1902). Eugene Goossens, the permanent conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, recognised the need for a musical facility in Australia's largest metropolis in 1947, not just for the symphony orchestra but also for opera and chamber music ensembles. The New South Wales government provided official assent and created an advisory body, the Opera House Committee, to find a site in 1954, saying that the city should aim to prominence as an international cultural centre. Bennelong Point was approved by the committee early the next year.
