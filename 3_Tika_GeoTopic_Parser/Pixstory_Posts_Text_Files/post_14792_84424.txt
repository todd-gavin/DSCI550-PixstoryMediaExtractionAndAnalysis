The study of the intestinal microbiota, i.e. the set of microorganisms that populate our intestines, can improve the efficacy of anticancer immunotherapy treatments. This is confirmed by the largest international research ever carried out on the interaction of immunotherapy microbiota financed by the Seerave Foundation coordinated by the Metagenomics Research Group Research of the Cibio Department of Computational and Integrated Cell Biology of the University of Trento and the European Institute of Oncology led by Prof Nicola Segata in collaboration with other research groups in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom The results of the work are published today in Nature Medicine Preliminary studies on a very limited number of patients have suggested that the intestinal microbiota, due to its function as director of the immune system, plays a role in the response of each patient to immunotherapy against cancer and in particular against melanoma. The aim of our study was to seek confirmation of this role which can have a big impact for oncology and for medicine in general declares Karla Lee researcher at King&#39;s College London and first author of the work The modulable microbiota and there are strategies to be able to modify it ranging from a specific diet up to new generation probiotics and faecal transplantation, consequently also modifying its action on the immune system. Therefore, by understanding which are the characteristics of the microbiota that make a patient responder to treatment, it could be possible to act on the modification of the patient&#39;s microbiota before starting therapy, observes Andrew Maltez Thomas researcher at the Cibio Department of the University of Trento and first signature together with Lee It should be remembered that immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of advanced melanoma more than the patients who receive it increases their survival by at least one year Unfortunately for this positive response to treatment occurs in less than of patients Hence the importance of finding strategies to increase the number of responders and the action on the microbiota is one of the most promising ways concludes Lee
