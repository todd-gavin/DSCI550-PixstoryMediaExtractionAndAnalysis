The Scream an Edvard Munch marvel has drawn crowds and even horrified some The tale of how this painting came to be is fascinating Munch was walking through the city streets with his friends one day when he got the idea for this painting He suddenly came to a halt and gazed up at the sky which was turning blood crimson as it was setting From beneath the city he also heard a slight creaking noise He had the impression that there were endless screams coming from nature because of the location He went on to paint the picture after that experience colouring the skies blood red Edvard Munch later spoke about the painting s personal turmoil He claimed that he had been nearly insane for several years The Scream his picture depicts how he was pushed to his limits and eventually lost up all hope of ever being able to love again
