People with incorrect vision know the struggle of wearing spectacles. Foggy and dirty glasses with scratches and loose frames are some common problems that spectacle wearers face. Plus, watching a 3D movie is definitely a nightmare for them. They can't even wear sunglasses to protect their eyes from the UV rays. So, to rescue them from this problem, contact lenses acts like hero.
Contact lenses, or simply contacts, are thin lenses placed directly on the surface of the eyes. 
Leonardo da Vinci is frequently credited with introducing the idea of contact lenses.
Contact lenses are ocular prosthetic devices used by over 150 million people worldwide, and they can be worn to correct vision or for cosmetic reasons.
