Snakes make excellent pets considering they are fascinating and interesting creatures They are not the same type of pet as a dog or cat since they operate on a more instinctual level A snake is not for you if you desire an animal that enjoys companionship likes to be touched every day is constantly on display and can have a strong emotional bond to its owner But If you like an animal that is relatively low maintenance given its environment is set up correctly only needs feeding once a week or even longer however it s usually smelly mice or rats so hold on there and is fascinating to watch when it decides to explore its environment a snake might be the animal for you In my very personal opinion unless it s a rescued snake that cannot survive without human support you should probably let it live in the wild And if you do decide to have one as your pet be very careful on how you treat the cute little guy
