F1 fans are divided when it comes to Netflix Drive to Survive series as some fans think Netflix adds and fabricates drama to gain viewership on some instances making more of an occasion than it is. Nonetheless, Drive to Survive has driven a massive surge of fans into watching F1 races and is pretty popular among fans.
