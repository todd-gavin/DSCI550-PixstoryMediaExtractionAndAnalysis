Like Jessica mentioned in her first challenge kids cannot comprehend being better in a place that s violent You say what if a child is inherently evil But the fact of the matter is that most children aren t Most juveniles aren t monsters They re just kids who made mistakes A kid who s a bully is fully capable of being a better person once he grows up if given proper care and environment You talking about complete sociopaths does not take away from the fact that kids put in adult facilities for the same crime as them is likely to make them more violent and there is a bigger chance that they ll come out of it as criminals than there is that they ll come out of a Juve facility as criminals Are we forgetting just how much prison messes up a fully functional adult How do you expect a child coming as a better person out of that Be serious Adult trials and treatments are not okay for kids They re barely okay for adults
