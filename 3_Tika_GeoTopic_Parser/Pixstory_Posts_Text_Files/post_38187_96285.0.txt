The Sky Blues have been interested in Erling Haaland ever since news first broke out about his availability. Manchester City have since become the favorites to sign the striker. 

But why would Erling Haaland prefer Manchester City? Well, the question should be Why Not! The Sky Blues have arguably become one of the best teams in Europe under Pep Guardiola to add to this, they are reportedly ready to pay the striker £500,000-per-week.

Apart from this, One of the biggest reasons for Manchester City being the favourites is the fact that they have made Haaland a priority, unlike other clubs. Pep Guardiola has even gone on to state the importance of the player in recent interviews.

At Manchester City, Erling Haaland would directly slot into the starting XI. The Premier League champions failed to replace Sergio Aguero last summer and hence are looking to fill the void with the Norwegian. 

Another bonus for Haaland would be City's consistency. The Sky Blues are regularly winning Silverware. To add to this, Champions League football is almost guaranteed at the club. Hence these factors certainly make Manchester City the favourites to sign the striker.  




Will the other clubs fall short? 


Real Madrid are the biggest rival to Manchester City's bid for Erling Haaland. But Los Blancos are not as serious about the move as Karim Benzema is in the form of his life at the moment. 

To add to this, Real Madrid are trying to make Kylian Mbappe one of their marquee signings in the summer. Hence, this could discourage Haaland as Los Blancos are preferring Mbappe over him.

Barcelona and Manchester United are also interested. But both the clubs have an uncertain future ahead of them as they are not the "European Giants" that they once were. Hence it has to be seen what Erling Haaland decides to do in the summer.
