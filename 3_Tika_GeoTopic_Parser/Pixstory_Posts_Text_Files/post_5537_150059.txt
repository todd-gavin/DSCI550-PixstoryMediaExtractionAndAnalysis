Mahubuliya the festival of children and flowers came to an end last Sunday The origins of this festival may lie in Hindu tradition but over the years Mahubuliya has become known as a fortnight of festivities for children to forage in their backyards and bring flowers to decorate an idol made out of twigs and thorns This earthy flower idol is taken to the river bank in a song and dance procession by children who gather their pocket money at the end of the festivities and throw a wonderful picnic for themselves Laal phoolon me kya bal hai Jisme maiyyan magan hai Suraj magan hai Chanda magan hai Taaron me Aisa kya bal hai Jisme maiyyan magan hai
