Today I feel honoured to stand here and have the opportunity to express my gratitude to our teachers on behalf of all the students Dear teachers words fail to describe how much effort you put in each day so that we could learn something You are a part of making us better each day We know you might be facing a lot of problems some of you might have to travel a lot everyday sometimes you might be very disturbed somedays you might be ill but whenever you come to teach you put everything aside and start the class with a smile You not just teach us what is in the syllabus but also give us the knowledge for our overall development that will help us to face the real world You might scold us a lot but we know that there is love and affection behind your scolding that there is a desire to make us better and you scold us because you treat us as your children only You always try to enhance our ability to think more to question more Thank you for always guiding us for always motivating us to do hard work and to always stay determined for our goal Teachers Thank you for always being there to support us to understand us for making us feel comfortable to share our problems with you and we are also very sorry if we have ever made you feel disrespected and we just hope that this beautiful bond between us stays forever
