To add to that, Jurgen Klopp voiced his criticism on the matter too. Certainly not the first time him or Pep Guardiola has been involved in a war of words with the FA over a venue/scheduling issue.

"It's one of the most ridiculous stories I have ever heard. I heard that they know it since 18 months. I'm not sure what the FA thought. No club from the north west will be part of the semi-finals? I really can't believe that things like this can happen with all the information you have out there.

"I heard the FA - probably we'll do it as well - put on some coaches on the road, but what is it, usually four and a half hours to London, it will be then 12 probably because all the coaches are in the same direction. It makes absolutely no sense.

With the Mayors of Manchester and Liverpool also signing a joint letter to the FA, asking for the game to be moved, a rescheduling/change of venue wouldn't be unlikely. 

"I'm not sure when they had to decide when is the semi-finals. I think there would have been probably another weekend between the Champions League games. At least then all the fans could have gone to Wembley and now they can't, or it's more difficult.

"On the other hand, how I know our people, they will find a way. I'm just really not happy that somebody made it complicated for them. It should be easier to go and see your football team in a semi-final." Klopp commented, making it clear why he thinks stadiums should be accessible to fans across the country for a game of this magnitude.
