Maria Guadalupe Lourdes Maldonado López, a reporter shot and killed outside her home in Tijuana on Sunday (January 23), was the third journalist murdered in Mexico in less than a month.  

In protest, journalists and other media workers held a nation-wide protest, vigils and demonstrations on Tuesday.

Human right activists claim nine Mexican journalists were killed in 2021 and the number is over 50 ever since populist leader Andrés Manuel López Obradors came to power in 2018. According to data culled by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Mexico, along with India and Afghanistan, is one of the deadliest countries in the world for journalists. Mexico and India also feature on CPJ’s Global Impunity Index which focuses on countries where press workers are “singled out for murder and the perpetrators go free”.

Shortly before López was killed president Obrador had called for a “more humanitarian society”, but tried to shift blame for the series of murders to the “neo-liberal legacy” he inherited which he believes is responsible for most of the crises in current Mexico.

The president, however, is quite combative towards the media and regularly singles out any journalist who criticizes him. Last year, he even started hosting a weekly news conference—titled “Who’s Who in Lies of the Week” -- to specifically attack what he thought was falsehood.

Senior journalists and rights activists say such a hostile head of the state naturally encourages assaults or attempts to murder on journalists. Most murderers go unpunished and an environment of impunity emboldens the criminals.

Obrador features among a growing number of populist and authoritarian leaders who are out to throttle honest journalism across the world. They want the media to turn into their personal propaganda machines and refrain from making any criticism of their moves.
