In connection with an assault on MP Hanuman Beniwal and Union minister Kailash Choudhary that occurred in Rajasthan's Barmer district over three years ago, a charge has been filed against Congress MLA Harish Choudhary, his brother, and others.
The case was opened as a result of a complaint made on October 10 by Beniwal, the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) leader and MP from Nagaur.
In addition to 100-150 unidentified people, the FIR lists 26 people, including Congress member Harish Choudhary from the Baytu constituency and his brother Manish Choudhary.
In response to the accusations, Harish Choudhary claimed that the filing of the FIR was a component of propaganda.
The FIR states that on November 12, 2019, Manish Choudhary and between 100 and 150 armed assailants attacked Beniwal and Minister Choudhary's vehicle near Falsund with the intent to kill them. They were en route to Baytu to attend a programme. The attackers also started firing.
Beniwal had already brought up the issue before the Privilege Committee of Parliament. Police representatives were then brought before the committee and instructed to file a complaint.
