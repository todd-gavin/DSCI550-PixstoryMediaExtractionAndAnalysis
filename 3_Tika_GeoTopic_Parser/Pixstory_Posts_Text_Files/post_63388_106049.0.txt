Strength training is important. If you want to build muscle then you probably know you've
got to lift weights.
But strength training is also crucial if you're trying to lose weight or if you're goal is just to be more healthy overall.

You should know by now that a calorie deficit is absolutely necessary if you're trying to lose weight.
Strength training not only burns extra calories while you're doing it, but your metabolism is much higher afterwards while recovering and while trying to maintain your muscle
mass.
All things that make that calorie deficit much more attainable. Not only that but you'll feel more energetic and just better overall which will motivate you to keep working hard and
keep pushing towards your goal.

If you've done a good lifting session before then you know how much better you sleep - and good sleep is another major factor in weight loss.

Don't worry about your muscles getting "too big" - You have to train and eat A LOT to get to that point.

Here are a few reasons why strength training is good for
you.
* Burns calories while you're doing it
* Burns calories after doing it
* Makes you stronger
* Makes your muscles more defined and toned
* Helps you sleep better
* Strengthens your immune system
* Reduces your risk of injury
* Increases your energy level
* Reduces depression & anxiety

There are many more benefits but I think you get my point. Lifting is important.
