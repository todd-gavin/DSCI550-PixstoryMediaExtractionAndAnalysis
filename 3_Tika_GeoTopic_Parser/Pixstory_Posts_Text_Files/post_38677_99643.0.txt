Next we see Fati’s carries into dangerous areas and ( into the penalty area and six yard box) we see that he ranks 2.8 which is in the first quadrant

Next metric which we have compared is goal/Shot On Target. We can see that Fati falls into the first quadrant with 0.25. 

Next Metric which we have measured is his Key Passes. We can see that he falls way short in key passes with 0.8. It is due to his selfishness to not pass the ball but to go for the glory.
