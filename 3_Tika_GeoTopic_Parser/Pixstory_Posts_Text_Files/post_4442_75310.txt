In our lives we all plan things We have plans for our future we shape our world in our own head and we want to see that from our glasses We have everything planned in a particular manner We are astonished and why not because that was never planned Maybe we meet someone or we lay an eye on that special person and our world turns upside down We associate ourselves so much with them that they become an important part of ourselves And that unexpected Love is the most beautiful thing that could ever happen to us People say Loving someone hurts I think love is not meant to hurt us it s meant to help us discover how powerful our emotions are and how much we have in our hearts to shower on others That unexpected Love rings the chords of our soul soothes the skin like the brightest sunshine and pours like heavy rain on the barren heart We find ourselves doing things we have never thought we would do we are just submerging in a sea of Love with a hope to find a Mast We cling to them we adore them we are there for them we become a better version of ourselves We learn that everything in this world cannot be focused on ourselves and sometimes giving feels so divine Seeing someone else happy renders more joy to our jovial heart And then that unexpected Love stays for some of us and for some of us it just fades away with time We learn to deal with whatever turns out next but one thing which always stays with us is the intensity with which we felt our heart beating and our eyes twinkling The rush of emotions the blazing heat of passion and the urge to swim across the sea to just be with our beloved We know that our heart is the master of our lives That unexpected Love is always there buried in the closet of our heart and it keeps reminding us about the beauty and uncertainty of this life
