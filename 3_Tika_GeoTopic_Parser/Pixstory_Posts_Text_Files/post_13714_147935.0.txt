Kabul soulless city or ghost city? Maybe both and maybe neither. What is the soul of the city? I do not know. But I know that Kabul has a soul and its soul is deeply wounded. People who do not always see the soul. Have you seen the soul of a man? No, you haven't seen it. So how do you believe that there is no soul in the body? Let me answer myself. When we see that a smile does not form on our lips, when we see that a hand is unable to move, when we see that there are no more tears for an eye, when we see that a heart does not beat, we understand that a body has become soulless. Kabul has not had a healthy body in the past twenty years, and its soul has been scarred like its body. But what we remember from the stubborn spirit of Kabul was standing and resistance. Kabul never lost hope for the future. Even though his slopes were wounded thousands of times by digging graves for a student, a student, an athlete, a doctor and a journalist, but it still, after a rain and sun, grew flowers on the graves of thousands of his innocent citizens and laughed again. Kabul was still a hopeful city no matter what. hope for the future Hope for morning and sunrise again. Now, however, despair has dried up Kabul's grove of hope There is nothing worse than disappointment. It was hoped that we would plant flowers in the house pot. It was hoped that we would paint our boots every morning. It was hoped that walking to school would be beautiful in our minds. It was hoped that it would make Kabul's polluted air bearable. It was hoped that we had a desire to throw paper. It was hoped that it would create a passion for writing. Hope, hope and hope Did you think I mentioned trivial things?To be continued…….
