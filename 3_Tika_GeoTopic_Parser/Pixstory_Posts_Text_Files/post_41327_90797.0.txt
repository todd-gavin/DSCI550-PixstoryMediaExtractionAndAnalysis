Despite the fact that Biden's ad-lib of nine words at the end of a major foreign policy speech has sparked controversy at home and abroad, as reported by US News. He said he had no remorse about telling a worldwide audience over the weekend that Russian President Vladimir Putin should not be in office. 

â€œI'm not walking anything back," a defiant Biden told reporters after delivering remarks on his 2023 budget proposal. "I was expressing the moral outrage I felt. I wasn't articulating a policy change."

Last week, Biden spent four days in Europe, planning with friends on how to respond to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, visiting with US troops stationed in Poland and humanitarian organisations, and having an emotional encounter with Ukrainian refugees. The visit was topped with a passionate and dramatic speech on the issue, in which he characterised it as a historic war between tyranny and democracy, hailing Russian protestors and promising Ukraine that "we stand with you."

However, as Susan Milligan points out, the president's talk, which was warmly applauded by the hundreds who gathered inside and outside Warsaw's Royal Castle walls, took an unexpected turn at the end, when he reportedly went off script and said, "For God's sake, this man cannot stay in power." 

The words would be typical of someone in a lower position, such as a United States senator, which Biden held for 36 years. They have considerably more extensive and consequential connotations when spoken by a president who has the power to launch an attack that could force Putin out of office.
