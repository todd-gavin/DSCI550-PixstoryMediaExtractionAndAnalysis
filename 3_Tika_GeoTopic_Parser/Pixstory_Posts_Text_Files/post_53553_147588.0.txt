In a landmark speech to the United Nations (UN), the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, demanded that Russia and other aggressors should be stripped of their veto power in the UN security council.Echoing his calls for UN reform earlier this year, Zelensky lamented that much talk about UN reform in the past has led nowhere. He called for an expansion of representation to those who remain unheard.Also speaking before the UN general assembly yesterday, the US president, Joe Biden reaffirmed the US commitment to UN reforms. He said: “The time has come for this institution to become more inclusive so that it can better respond to the needs of today’s world.”Vetoes in the UN security council should only be used “in rare, extraordinary situations, to ensure that the council remains credible and effective”. He went on to suggest that permanent and non-permanent seats in the council should be given to “countries in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean”, among others.International survey on UN reformIn a recent article, published in International Studies Quarterly, my colleagues and I explored what citizens around the world thought about such proposals for UN reform as have been made by Zelensky, Biden, and others for decades. My co-authors Mathias Koenig-Archibugi (London School of Economics), Luis Cabrera (Griffith University) and I surveyed people in six countries: Argentina, China, India, Russia, Spain, and the United States.We found widespread public support for increasing – or at least maintaining – UN authority over member states and for making its structures more directly representative of citizens around the world. Our findings thus show that citizens support decades-old calls for a more powerful and democratic UN.In our survey, we asked respondents to choose between different combinations of UN design features. These include decision-making procedures, the question of how binding UN resolutions should be, and to what extent the UN should be able to enforce them.Read more: https://theconversation.com/calls-by-zelensky-and-biden-for-un-reform-are-supported-by-people-around-the-world-new-survey-191108
