(Continuation) 

I cannot understand this politics, If an all-knowing ultimate source of power would segregate men and woman how could the phenomenon be called God. Please understand all these rituals customs are man-made like the temples, churches, Gurudwaras. But nothing is important than human life and rights. Education and religion has no connection and please not put these two together. I see younger generation talking nonsense, using 'we' and 'you', I lose all the hope. Beliefs are always a choice. I am trying to unlearn and still have a fear of touching religious topic as I see the vigour in the eyes of the receiver. 

Always remember it's your life, do anything upon your own likes and dislikes not upon something conditioned upon you. Read, learn to realise the conditioning as this world is a mess.
