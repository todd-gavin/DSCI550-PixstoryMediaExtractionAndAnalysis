In the grim darkness of the future…there is only war!”
 
 
 
In Gamescom 2022 we have been getting a bunch of trailers for new upcoming games. One of them also includes Warhammer 40k Darktide, a brutal bloody co-op game developed by Fatshark, previously known for their work on the Warhammer Vermintide series.  
 
Players can clearly select from a wide variety of visual and vocal presents, each with unique styles, to design their own custom “Reject” character. Rejects are convicts recruited by the Inquisition, a secret police of the Imperium of Man operating in the dark.
 
The Imperium of Man is an oppressive theocratic human empire whose reach extends to over a million occupied worlds, who worship the Emperor of Mankind as their god. Like the Suicide Squad from DC, the rejects are tasked with undergoing tactical operations deemed too high-risk for standard Imperial forces.
 
Unlike in Vermintide, players will be able to create their own character from the game’s several playable classes which include Ogryn – massive humanoid creatures, Psykers – magic wielding warriors, a  holy ‘Zealot’ warrior, a seasoned ‘Veteran’ and more. Players can freely customize their characters within the confines of their class and, from there, master the use of both melee weapons and ranged weapons alike. 
 
 
As one of the game’s Rejects, players will find themselves amongst the last of the defenders of the hive city of Tertium, an Imperial city under siege from a massive horde of the forces of Chaos. Players will need the skills and strategic thinking of their squad members to ensure they can beat back the incoming threat.
 
Warhammer 40K: Darktide launches on PC via Steam and the Microsoft Store on November 30. Pre-orders are available now. A console release for Xbox Series X/S will follow at a later date with no specific release dates for console announced.
