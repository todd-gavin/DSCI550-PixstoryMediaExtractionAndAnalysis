The project Bundelkhand expressway was launched in April 2017 by the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath. 

Today Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Bundelkhand expressway in Uttar Pradesh, which is expected to boost connectivity and industrial development in the region.
The 296 km four-lane expressway was constructed with a total project value of Rs 14,850 crores.
 
Work on the creation of an industrial corridor in Banda and
Jalaun districts, next to the Expressway, have already started.

"This expressway will not only give speed to the vehicles, but
will also accelerate the industrial progress of the entire Bundelkhand" stated PM Modi.

PM Narendra Modi tweeted, "The state-of-the-art Bundelkhand Expressway passes through 7 districts. The local economy will benefit tremendously due to it. There will be great industrial development in the region, and this would bring more work on the creation of the industrial corridor in Banda and Jal."
