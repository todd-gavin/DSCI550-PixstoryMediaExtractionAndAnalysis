Will Smith hit Chris Rock in the face on stage at the Oscars after the comic made a joke about the actor's wife Jada Pinkett Smith.

Referring to Pinkett Smith's shaved hairdo, Rock said: "Jada, can't wait for GI Jane 2."

Smith walked up on stage and appeared to strike Rock before returning to his seat and shouting: "Keep my wife's name out of your... mouth."

Smith later apologised in a tearful best actor acceptance speech.
