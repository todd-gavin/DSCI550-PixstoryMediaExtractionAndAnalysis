Imagine the situation where you know that you won't be able to meet your better half for a long time it would be just calls, texts and feelings that you have when you are alone thinking about him/her. 

A boy and a girl, good friends from school. One day the boy developed feelings for the girl but few days later he got to know she's going abroad for further studies. Co incidentally the girl called up and asked the boy to meet her before she leaves.
The day comes, boy kept looking for hint if the girl is intrested or not, unfortunately there wasn't any.

After getting back home, he couldn't resist and told everything to her and surprisingly she replied back with more feelings and here begins a new phase in their lifes. 

The distance is huge but efforts from both sides are much bigger.
