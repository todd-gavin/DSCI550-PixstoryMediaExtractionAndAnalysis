Where do you start when you’re looking at a massive wine list, or one where the wines you recognize are not wines you want to drink? Ask for the sommelier. They can tell you what the restaurant specializes in, help you find good values on the list, or even recommend special wines that are not printed on the menu.
A sommelier is usually a  steward for wine, or a trained and knowledgeable wine professional, typically found in fine restaurants and across the hospitality industry. Sommeliers know which wines a restaurant has both on and off the wine list, and can help you find the right wine for your meal or occasion.
A sommelier’s wine education has typically been accredited through professional organizations like the Court of Master Sommeliers or the Wine and Spirit Education Trust/WSET
How Much Do Sommeliers Earn?
The different levels of certification make a huge difference when it comes to sommelier salary. A Master Sommelier earns an average salary of $164,000 per year, while an Advanced Sommelier earns an average of $87,000—about half as much, despite being just one level below.
The three-year master sommelier examination for the Court of Master Sommelier is famously demanding. The pass rate is less than 10%. That explains why since 1969, there have been less than 300 people who have attained master sommeliers status across the world.
There are three parts to the master sommelier exam:
Blind tasting. The examinee must identify key characteristics of six wines—grapes, region of origin and vintage year—in 25 minutes.
Oral exam. Examinees take an oral exam with two masters, involving discussion of wine theory for 25 minutes.
Service portion. The examinee practices serving instructors as mock restaurant patrons. Instructors might act as difficult customers to test the applicant’s customer service skills.
