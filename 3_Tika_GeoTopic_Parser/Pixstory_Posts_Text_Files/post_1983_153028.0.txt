The purpose of the cut, according to OPEC officials, was to stabilize the fall in global energy prices.U.S. officials and believe that this decision was made in part to aid Russia’s war efforts in Ukraine. Russia would benefit in their ability to charge a higher price for oil.The Biden Administration rebuked this move by OPEC, stating “The President is disappointed by the shortsighted decision by OPEC Plus to cut production quotas while the global economy is dealing with the continued negative impact of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.”
