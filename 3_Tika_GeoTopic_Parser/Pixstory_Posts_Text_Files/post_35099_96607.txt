He speaks little but when he does it always makes the news Donnarumma has just won his first championship title with PSG and to the microphones of Sky he said and reiterated that his future in Paris regardless of the many rumors that circulated was a great satisfaction For me It has been a year of settling in but I am really happy with how it went We are sorry to have disappointed our fans in the Champions League but we will try to make up for it His first season in France was marked by turnover with Navas goalkeeper playing in league matches while Donnarumma those of the Champions League An alternation that did not benefit either of the two extreme defenders He had his say on this too I&#39;m here to be the owner As I said before, for me it was a year of acclimatization it was not easy to change language and habits With Navas I have an excellent relationship but as he also said it hasn&#39;t been easy living this competition Things certainly have to change With the championship won and the celebrations underway, the bitter taste remains in my mouth about how it went in the Champions League and the elimination at the hands of Real Madrid A bitter defeat criticized by the fans We were also very sorry because they always supported us and were our twelfth man on the pitch We understand them too we wanted to do well in Europe we suffered in the dressing room after the elimination but the goal in this match was to win the title and in future we will try to make up for it in the Champions League too
