Do not let the behavior of others disturb your inner peace . We can't control what other person thinks but the thing we can control is the way we think. We should always think positive and be good to ourselves and others. Unfortunately we live in a world where there are people who will lash out at others in jealousy or greed or plain old meanness.  And no matter how good a person you are, there will always be those who try to tear you down as best they can.  But always remember that regardless of what anyone else does or says, we can always choose to take the high road – we can always choose to continue to act with integrity and kindness.  And at the end of the day it is taking that high road that will bring us inner peace, even amongst the turmoil that others may try to create. 
Peace ✌ is important.
