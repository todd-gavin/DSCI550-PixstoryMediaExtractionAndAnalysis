Emmanuel Petit an Arsenal veteran believes his former team should not make a move for Wilfried Zaha since they already have a top class player in his position Gabriel Martinelli has been a revelation on the left wing for the Gunners this season establishing himself as one of the league s most promising young players Zaha shone in Crystal Palace s win over Arsenal at Selhurst Park on Monday and it wasn t long before rumours of a move to the Emirates appeared again Petit on the other hand believes that signing Zaha will put a stop to Martinelli s rise I adore watching Zaha he stated in an interview with Genting Casino He s a dynamic performer With his provocations he may be weird on the pitch at times But I really liked his reactions against Arsenal he controlled his reactions he was smiling he was very confident It should be like that for every game Of course he would fit in well at Arsenal But my question would be what do you do with Gabriel Martinelli Martinelli has been very good since his injury and he s following in the same footsteps of Emile Smith Rowe and Bukayo Saka This is the next generation of Arsenal players and if you brought in Zaha then he d play regular football and Martinelli would be on the bench So he is not quite sure about that Arsenal need competition in their squad for sure but when you see the prospect of young players you have to be very careful with the players you bring into the club
