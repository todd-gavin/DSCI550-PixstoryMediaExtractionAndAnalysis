Enter the Dragon: Chinese Invasion 
of Tibet continues...

The future of the Tibetan people and of Tibetan culture in Tibet appears bleak. The Dalai Lama’s statement issued on March, 10, 2008, the 49th Anniversary of the Tibetan National Uprising Day, states it best. Extracts are given below:

On the occasion of the 49th anniversary of the Tibetan people’s peaceful uprising in Lhasa on 10 March 1959, I offer my prayers and pay tribute to those brave men and women of Tibet who have endured untold hardships and sacrificed their lives for the cause of the Tibetan people, and express my solidarity with those Tibetans presently undergoing repression and ill-treatment. I also extend my greetings to Tibetans in and outside Tibet, supporters of the Tibetan cause and all who cherish justice.

For nearly six decades, Tibetans in the whole of Cholkha-Sum (Ü-Tsang, Kham and Amdo) have had to live in a state of constant fear, intimidation and suspicion under Chinese repression.

Nevertheless, in addition to maintaining their religious faith, a sense of nationalism and their unique culture, the Tibetan people have been able to keep alive their basic aspiration for freedom. I have great admiration for the special characteristics of the Tibetan people and their indomitable courage. I am extremely pleased and proud of them.
