Today he plays for Inter Miami but his name is linked to a past first in Spain with Real Madrid with whom he did little much more he did and won in Italy first with Napoli and then with Juventus Gonzalo Higuain spoke about his experiences to TyC Sport also recounting his transfer from Campania to the Piedmontese capital, a gesture not digested by the Neapolitan fans who had elected him their absolute idol after the league goals and the Scudetto The farewell to Naples was difficult, Higuain said it was very difficult for me to take that decision because I knew all that it would entail but I never had any doubts I had love and happiness I had no reason not to go because something happened in the year of the league record for goals I scored goals we had a very strong team playing great football but not we managed to win the Scudetto I felt a strange feeling in my body what else could I do The move to Juventus was not taken well by his former fans They paid me millions of euros it was an honor And then I had the chance to play in the final of Champions League in the first year the only one of my career The reaction of the Napoli fans In life evil everything comes back I suffered insults and a lot of hatred from the Napoli fans but then in matches I scored goals against them
