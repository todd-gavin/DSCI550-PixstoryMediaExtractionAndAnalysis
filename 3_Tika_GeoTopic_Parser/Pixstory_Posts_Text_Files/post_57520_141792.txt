As mentioned in earlier posts forgiveness is not about making others happy but more about making yourself comfortable Taking a burden of anything can pressurise your mind which will eventually cause health problems as well So letting it out is fine Holding a grudge against anyone can Bring anger and bitterness into every relationship and new experience You become so wrapped up in the wrong that you can t enjoy the present Feel that your life lacks meaning or purpose or you re at odds with your spiritual beliefs Getting another person to change their actions behaviour or words isn t the point of forgiveness Think of forgiveness more about how it can change your life by bringing you peace happiness and emotional and spiritual healing Forgiveness can take away the power the other person continues to wield in your life
