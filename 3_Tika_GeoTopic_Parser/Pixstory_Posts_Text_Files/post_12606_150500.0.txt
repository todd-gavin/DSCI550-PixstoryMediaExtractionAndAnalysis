Social isolation and loneliness have been linked to increased risk of coronary heart disease.
Meaningful social interactions and support may act as a preventative measure for the heart by reducing chronic stress and unhealthy coping strategies, which are often associated with loneliness.
If you are looking to reduce social isolation and increase your social support you can try:
👉Developing a new hobby.
👉Volunteering in the community.
👉Joining a community or neighbourhood group.
👉Joining a book club, gardening club or hiking club.
👉Enrolling in a course to learn a new skill.
👉Joining an exercise class or sports team.
👉Connecting online with family and old or new friends.
