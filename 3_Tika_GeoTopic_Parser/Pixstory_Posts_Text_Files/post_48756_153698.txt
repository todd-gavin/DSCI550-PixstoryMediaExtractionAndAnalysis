It s easier to compartmentalize individual views and feelings about good officers but properly comprehending a severely dysfunctional system takes a lot more effort When activists talk about defunding the police they re not talking about getting rid of officers entirely rather they re talking about dismantling and rebuilding a system in which cops have been able to serve as judge jury and in many cases executioner for far too long The police s key purpose is still to maintain the status quo They do it by showing up at every protest and making a large number of arrests People many times say Not All Cops but when we argue in favor of individual police officers morality we are undercutting a protest of the broader issue the unjust policing system in the United States Being against the police force does not say they are all killers it essentially implies that while individual cops may live honorably they all work for an inherently oppressive organisation that must be eliminated in order to reinvest in transformational justice
