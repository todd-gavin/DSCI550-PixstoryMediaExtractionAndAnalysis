Deciding to end a marriage isn't an easy decision for parents. These bundles of thoughts hover around their mind and battle until one chooses to settle everything.
As hard as it is for parents, what will it be for a child? 
Separation is awful, and to witness your parents separating would be the most intimidating nightmare for a child.
The emotional turmoil they go through would eventually become the reason for their inappropriate behaviour and imbalanced life.
Accepting the fact that their parents no longer love each other or not going to remain the same as they were earlier is unsettling and confusing.
This can affect a child more when they have to accept that there would be two different roofs for them instead of one.
It can rise from behaviour problems to even mental health problems for children.
There might be the chances that they get triggered by the adjustment disorder making it difficult for them to mitigate their thoughts and eventually leading to anxiety issues and even depression.
Irrespective of age, their professional life is equally tormented. They're unable to perform the activities, making them more inclined toward risk-taking behaviours like even substance use.
The dilemma and confusion always grow and never wanes, even if they become a little calmer than earlier.
