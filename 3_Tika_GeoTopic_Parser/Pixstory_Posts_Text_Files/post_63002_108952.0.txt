Victoria was William IV's niece and the only living heir. She was only 18 when she was anointed queen in 1837. Victoria, despite her adolescence, was well-prepared for the job of monarch, having been groomed and educated for it from an early age.

Victoria's ascension to the throne was first greeted with rapturous applause. Little was known about the new queen, and her acts were widely discussed throughout the first few weeks of her reign. Her early public appearances drew large crowds of well-wishers.
