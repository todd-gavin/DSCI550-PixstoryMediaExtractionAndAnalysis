Cactus is a plant which has been worse affected with hearsays Over the years I have heard it too shouldn t be kept at home they bring bad luck and what not BUT the truth is depending upon the correct placement cactus can protect people from the negative energy Some even believe that cactus represents endurance protection and motherly love Though I am a non believer as far as plants are concerned and I simply follow my heart Whatever might be your reason own a pretty cactus and you will fall in love with its simple and non demanding nature PS no intention to hurt anyone s sentiments
