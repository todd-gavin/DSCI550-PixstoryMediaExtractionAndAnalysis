Putting others before ourselves is a motto we live by every day The motto we live by each day is to place others before ourselves And the problem lies with this mindset this can build resentment anger and frustration in ourselves We feel like we re trapped and we don t have the power to change the reality And then eventually it becomes closely impossible tl find lasting happinwss when our tanks go empty because we have ignore the internal voices or the hints that our bodies gave us on what we need Instead what we do is just get through the day and get the to do lists done and attend to whoever else needs us while neglecting ourselves First we need to understand that this doesn t mean that we are being selfish Selfish people only think about themselves without considering others around them Putting yourself first means you take into account your own needs and feelings as well as that of others but you do what s best for you without hurting someone This is important to practice because no one else is going to do it for you and you will have to do it for yourself Taking care of you physical and mental health is your responsibility Building up the life of your dreams is your responsibility And in order to get what you need or desire you must ask for it because no one else will do it for you Sources Instagram
