This the shot taken while playing with friends.U know playing evening time basketball with friends is more peaceful moments u will in get in life.. Yeah u forgot ur age and just chilling with little and bigger ones there and the bond you create with the ball, friends and the court. And the game you play you will be mindful on playing it where your stress and sweat gone simultaneously..For me basketball sounds when its directly hits the net is the best ..
