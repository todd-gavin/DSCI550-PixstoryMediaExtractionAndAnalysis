Maurizio Sarri spoke to journalists on the eve of the match that his Lazio will have to play against Sassuolo After the derby lost, the anger and disappointment have not yet passed and the Biancoceleste coach does not hide it at all We had an inexplicable match against Roma not so much in result but for the attitude You can lose but with another type of reaction I&#39;m pissed off with the players and also with myself I had the feeling that the emotional charge wasn&#39;t the right one I tried to intervene but I probably didn&#39;t do it right Losing against Roma hurt morale but also hurt the standings Europe is now further away but Sarri prefers to play all the games to the end before thinking about it I want to shoot for having high-level players available The professionals know there are no games who are worthless I start from this type of assumption, we have professionals who will give us the criticisms from the press and the fans I spoke to Immobile about it ed and told him what I think He is becoming the scapegoat for the national team and he knows very well what is behind it I would know what to do in his place now let&#39;s see what he decides If I intend to leave the National It&#39;s useless to tell you that my choice counts for Ciro
