Social media can be a magical thing. In the microcosm of football, it provides creators like myself a platform to share our thoughts and analysis on football. As with everything, this comes with downsides. Social media can also be a place of hate and criticism - where people speak with no filter, no respect, and no identity.

I started writing and creating content at just 15 years old. Over the years, I’ve been lucky to have gained a platform to share my views, and I relish in the opportunity to engage and interact with all kinds of people over our mutual love for football.

Hate is intoxicating. Whilst I have been quite fortunate with the support I’ve received - every day we see users with any range of following receive pretty vile abuse for what they tweet or say.

Pixstory are a powerful tool to combat this. Arsenal’s partnership with this app is a statement - a step in right direction, away from toxicity and abuse, and towards a social media climate where everyone can feel safe and respected.

Let’s not get it wrong, social media has a net positive on football discourse. We all deserve the right to speak our minds, connect with other football fans, and consume content on the Beautiful Game. With some refining, social media can become even better - less toxic, more engaging and more enjoyable for fans.

If we didn’t know already, the ‘All or Nothing’ documentary highlighted how even professional footballers can be affected by the messages they receive on social media. The series spotlighted the hate that the likes of Bukayo Saka, Aaron Ramsdale and other Arsenal stars experience on a daily basis - and the real-life effect this has on people. After all, they are human beings before footballers.

A move towards a more healthy social media landscape is needed. Here’s to a future of hate-free social media, with Arsenal and Pixstory as a catalyst.
