The Guardian newspaper wrote in a report titled "Taliban don't know how to rule" that a group of Afghan women in exile are finding ways to deal with the political and humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. Sarah Douglas, from UN Women, said we call these women the "Group of Six".
Fawzia Koofi, Naheed Farid, Maryam Safi, Asila Wardak, Sofia Ramyar and Anisa Shaheed are among those whom the Guardian named as the group of six.
 The Taliban's return to power last year prompted an exodus of politicians, academics and journalists, but for a small group of Afghan women, the work of running the country hasn't stopped even in exile.
Nahid Farid, one of the members of this group of six, said that I had lost all hope after the Taliban took over. But watching Afghan women and youth march in Kabul, Herat, Mazar-e-Sharif and Jalalabad demanding their rights gave me the strength to restart my advocacy.
