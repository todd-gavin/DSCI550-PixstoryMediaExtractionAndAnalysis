The Hollywood Reporter has verified that Ryan Gosling is negotiating to work with Margot Robbie in the Ocean's Eleven remake for Warner Bros. 

Jay Roach will direct the upcoming Ocean's film, which Robbie will produce alongside Tom Ackerley and Michelle Graham. The script was written by Carrie Solomon, and while specifics are being withheld, it is known that it is an original Ocean's Eleven story set in Europe in the 1960s. The first person to mention Ryan Gosling's interest in the movie was Puck. 

Although the project has not been approved and is still in active development, a spring 2023 production is the target. Along with Warners, Gosling is working on the live-action Barbie with Robbie.
