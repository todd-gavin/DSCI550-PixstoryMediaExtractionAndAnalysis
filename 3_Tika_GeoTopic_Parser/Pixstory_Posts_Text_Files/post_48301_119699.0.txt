According to Healthline, up to 15% of couples struggle with infertility. There is mixed evidence when it comes to a whole variety of foods that increase fertility in females. However, you can improve your fertility by changing your diet and lifestyle. 
Hereâ€™s a list of foods that have the potential to increase fertility in females:

*1. Food rich in antioxidants:*
Antioxidants such as folate (folic acid) and zinc may help boost your fertility. They help to neutralise free radicals in the body, which can harm the egg cells. Antioxidants include vitamins C and E, folate, beta carotene, and lutein. Antioxidant food that can boost fertility includes fruits, vegetables, nuts, and grains. 

*2.  Switch your protein sources:*
The use of vegetable protein sources (such as vegetables, beans, lentils, nuts, beans and seeds) to replace some animal proteins (such as meat, fish, and eggs) has been related to a lower risk of infertility.
According to one study, consuming 5% of total calories from vegetable protein instead of animal protein reduced the incidence of ovulatory infertility by more than 50%.

*3. Avoid trans fat:*
It is critical to consume healthy fats on a daily basis in order to improve fertility and health in general. However, because of their negative effects on insulin sensitivity, trans fats are linked to an increased likelihood of ovulatory infertility.

*4. Complex carbs:*
Consume complex carbs (whole grains, legumes, veggies, and fruits) rather than refined carbs whenever possible (white bread, white rice, refined cereal, sugary treats of all types). This is because carbohydrate intake can be linked to increased fertility. 

*5. Berries:*
all berries are considered very very good fertility-boosting food for females, especially raspberries and blueberries. Berries are high in antioxidants and protect your body from cell damage and ageing, which includes cells in your reproductive system (aka your eggs).  

*6. Fibre:*
Fertility foods for women include fibre that aids in eliminating excess hormones and maintaining a healthy blood sugar level. Whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and beans are excellent sources of high-fibre foods.
