â€œI pray each day that every human being, indeed every sentient being, should be happy. So, if you come across individuals facing problems, help them. Share their problems and try to bring them peace of mind. Wherever you live, try to create a happy community," His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. #MondayMotivation #MotivationalQuotes #DalaiLamaQuotes
