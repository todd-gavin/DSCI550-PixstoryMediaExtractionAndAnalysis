 A five-year-old girl in the United States is struggling for her life after being diagnosed with an incredibly rare cardiac ailment. Born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Katherine Lange. Her parents had been informed by doctors about the disease, which includes breathing problems among its symptoms. The left half of the heart is underdeveloped as a result of the cardiac condition. In the hope that she may be healed, her parents are currently striving against all obstacles.
The girl's father, Gary Lange, was reported by the publication as stating, "We got diagnosed at 20 weeks pregnant and found out we were going to have this cardiac issue and they gave us some options." "Well, you'll have to go to Colorado or somewhere else since nobody in New Mexico can conduct the operations".
The young girl also has liver leakage in addition to her heart issue.
Her albumin is leaking because of a condition known as protein-losing enteropathy, which is caused by the lymphatic system seeping into the liver and blood pushing down on the organ as it travels through resistance-filled passageways, according to Mr. Lange.
The patient's family is hoping the medicine will be effective. She will require a heart and live transplant if all else fails to preserve her life.
