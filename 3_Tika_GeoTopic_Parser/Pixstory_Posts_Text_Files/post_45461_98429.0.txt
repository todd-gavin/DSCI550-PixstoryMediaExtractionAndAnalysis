The 72 old year former Gunners manager praises the African duo for their contribution as the Red floored Yellow submarine reached another UCL final. 
Former Arsenal manager Arsene has described the performance of Mohamad Salah and Sadio Mane after they helped Liverpool reach the Champions League final on Tuesday as “monstrous.”

The two African players were in action at Estadio de la Ceramica as the Reds came from two goals down to beat the yellow submarine 3-2 in the semifinal return leg contest and reach the final under a 5-2 aggregate result. 


It was Villareal who took an early lead courtesy of Senegal international Boulaye Dia before former Arsenal player Francis Coquelin doubled their scoreline for a 2-0 lead at the halftime break. 


However, Liverpool came back rejuvenated and reduced the deficit courtesy of Fabinho, who finished off a cross from Egypt’s Salah; Diaz then made it 2-2 then Senegal’s Mane won the tie with a cool finish. 

The two giants of African football once again faced off in the World Cup qualifying playoffs six weeks later the African Cup of Nations where Senegal clenched the victory. 

Wenger has picked up the two players for praise after they helped Liverpool reach another final this season.
 
Liverpool already reached the Carabao Cup final where they beat Chelsea on penalties and are in the FA Cup final to be held on May 14 at Wembley.

“Look at Salah and Sadio, what they have become after the African Cup Of Nations. They have become monstrous.” 

Mane’s goal against Villareal saw him shatter Didier Drogba’s record to become Africa’s highest goalscorer in the Champions League knockout stage.
