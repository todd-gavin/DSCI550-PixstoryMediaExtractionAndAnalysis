If you’re like us, then you’re completely and utterly obsessed with Netflix’s Bridgerton .
“Prepare for another social season"
Season two will focus on Daphne’s older brother. “We left Anthony Bridgerton at the end of the first season at a bit of a crossroads, “so I’m looking forward to jumping in and see how he fares in the marriage market.” 
In the second book, The Viscount Who Loved Me, Kate Sheffield is the older sister of the woman Anthony (Jonathan Bailey) is set to marry, Edwina. But when she decides Mr. Bridgerton isn’t good enough for her little sis, it kicks off an enemies-to-lovers plot that readers love.
so it’s not just about the glamour of the balls but also a deep delve into her heart. You’ll see a lot more of the yin to her yang. I just love that she’s such a complex character; she’s mischievous, dedicated to the Crown, dedicated to the gossip and the pomp and ceremony. 
In the new season, things will get even trickier.
Whistledown will continue to wreak havoc on the Ton without qualms. “She’s morally excused herself from certain things to barefaced lie to her friend and make it okay, but she also wants to impress Eloise,” Coughlan reflects. and I think a lot of Whistledown is to impress Eloise.
My hope is that you’re able to get beyond those things, even if they are huge. But when you are that age and they have been ride-or-die for that long, you can imagine that it would be shattering.”
How many of you are excited ? 😍
