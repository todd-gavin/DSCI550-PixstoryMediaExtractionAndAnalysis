The charm of Sita Ramam is Noor Jahan alias Sita Mahalakshmi played by Mrunal Thakur. Earlier, I liked her composed acting in Jersey. She can easily shift roles. Good thing, she doesn’t end up a simple, elegant figure on screen in a classic romance. She was given a character who led the entire film. Beautiful layers of this character stay back in us though Ram (Dulquer Salman) has a lengthier role to play. Even Ram is penned well as a charming, patriotic young hero in the Indian Army. And the pair looked enchanting on screen and did justice in imparting their chemistry to the audience.The backstory of this period film is the cross-border politics of India and Pakistan. More than this context I am impressed by what love endures in war and separation. An intense love story is portrayed convincingly backed by a thorough romantic script and Sita and Ram soaked in their love. When Ram was featured for his patriotism, the journalist also reveals his inner feelings as an orphan. Love and affection pour out to him in letters from across India. This opens a fascinating entry for Sita Mahalakshmi, the unknown love who addresses herself as his wife. Mysterious, captivating, romantic lines of love, hope, and dreams in Chinmayi’s voice – truly voiced to perfection bond Sita and Ram forever.. we too fall under their spell. Beautiful songs and other sequences laced with the luring chemistry of Mrunal and DQ make it a classic love story.Sita Ramam has a beginning and end, its purpose is to propagate love in place of hate. Fragments of the story collected by Afreen – liked Rashmika Mandanna’s unglamorous role and performance – are not something new but Hanu Raghavapudi could retain our interest in this love tale. Something is refreshing in his direction.I was moved by the last scene when the much-awaited letter reaches Sita Mahalakshmi after long twenty years! Destiny had something in store for them. Sita Ramam is not a film for all, it just serves melting hearts…
