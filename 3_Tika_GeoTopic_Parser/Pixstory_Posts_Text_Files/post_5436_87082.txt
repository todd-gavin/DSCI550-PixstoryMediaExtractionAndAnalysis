I enjoy watching award shows and it irritates me that Dolce Gabbana is not creating a personalised costume for you But may God preserve us from the beautiful grace of these beautiful people who are making me leap or on set but something new and affordable Few red carpet look that won t leave my mind till critics choice award Kristen Stewart in Dolce Gabbana Selena Gomez in Louis Vuitton HoYeon Jung in Louis Vuitton as well Andrew Garfield in Saint Laurent Jamie Dornan in Valentino jasmin Savoy Brown in Prada Elizabeth Olsen in Armani Priv and Cartier jewelry Lady Gaga in Gucci and Tiffany I wish I could bring the entire red carpet here because each look was unique and gorgeous in its own right but these are the few red carpet styles that will always have a special place in my heart
