Marvel has released a great new featurette for its upcoming series Moon Knight that offers some new insight on the story and the characters, and it also features some cool new footage! I’ve also got three posters to share with you that feature three of the personalities of Oscar Isaac’s character. In the featurette, the tone of the series is said to be like David Fincher’s Fight Club meets Steven Spielberg’s Indiana Jones, which I thought was very interesting and exciting. That’s a fun combination of style and themes and you can see that in the footage we’ve seen from the series. The show is described as "a new globetrotting action-adventure series featuring a complex vigilante who suffers from dissociative identity disorder. The multiple identities who live inside him find themselves thrust into a deadly war of the gods against the backdrop of modern and ancient Egypt."

The synopsis goes on to say that the story follows Steven Grant, “a mild-mannered gift-shop employee, who becomes plagued with blackouts and memories of another life. Steven discovers he has dissociative identity disorder and shares a body with mercenary Marc Spector. As Steven/Marc's enemies converge upon them, they must navigate their complex identities while thrust into a deadly mystery among the powerful gods of Egypt.”

The series also stars Ethan Hawke as the main villain, a cult leader named Arthur Harrow. Moon Knight was created by Doug Moench and Don Perlin and appeared in the August 1975 issue Werewolf by Night #32. Jeremy Slater (The Umbrella Academy) and Beau DeMayo (The Originals and The Witcher) writing the series. Mohamed Diab, Justin Benson, and Aaron Moorhead are directing.
