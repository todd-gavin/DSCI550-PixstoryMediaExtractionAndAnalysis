What's the deal with PCOS? 🤨
PCOS (formerly known as PCOD) is a condition in your ovaries.
Your ovaries are like the egg basket of your body. You know how your fridge has a little tray for eggs? Yeah, your ovaries are kinda like the fridge egg drawer of your body.🥚
Okay so whatever, but like what happens in it ? 
Well your ovaries are prime real estate. Think of it like a really prime peice of land that all the land mafia want to grab and dominate over.
The ovary locality is full of baby eggs. These baby eggs all grow together to become little egg gangsters.
So, all these tiny little egg gangsters keep fighting amongst themselves to become victorious and claim all that prime land .
Only one become the Godfather Egg.🕶️🥚
So like every area has on prime mobster, so does your ovary.
Every month, all these little egg gangs fight with each other to become Godfather Egg of the area for that month. This Godfather is the one that 'ovulates' every month; if it can manage to secure a meeting with prince sperm, then they can make a baby !🍼👶
If the Godfather Egg can't manage to get a meeting with precious prince sperm, there is... Well, there is bloodshed! The Godfather Egg losses its power and THERE COMES ALL THE BLOOD. 
This bloodhed comes in the form of your period. 🩸🩸🩸 
Okay, but that's what a period is. What does this have to do with PCOS? 
So, in PCOS, the Godfather Egg is never formed. It's just those tiny little egg gangsters fighting amongst themselves to become the Godfather, but of course, nothing really happens. Your body kepps growing multiple eggs, but none of them become big enough to become the main egg.
Now if there are so many little gangsters constantly fighting, peace and prosperity in the ovary locality is obviously disturbed. This causes all your symptoms from PCOS.
It's all these little eggs that end up looking like "cysts" on an ultrasound... hencez 'poly' (many) 'cystic' (cyst like) ovarian syndrome... 
And that's our Godfather PCOS story! ✨
