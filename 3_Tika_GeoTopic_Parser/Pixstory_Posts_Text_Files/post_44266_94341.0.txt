Rowley joined Arsenal in 1980 and rose through the ranks to become chief scout before leaving
in 2017. Steve Rowley, Arsenal's former top scout, died following a brief illness, according to the
club.

Rowley joined the club in 1980 and rose through the ranks to become chief scout during Arsene
Wenger's tenure as manager. Before departing in 2017, the 63-year-old was a major component
of the club's success under the Frenchman.

What's been said so far?

"Everyone at the Club is deeply saddened to announce the passing of our former Chief Scout
Steve Rowley after a short illness," a statement on Arsenal's website read.

"Steve, 63, had been associated with the Club since January 1980, when he began a part-time
role in our youth scouting operations in Essex.

 Notable early successes in the identification of
talent - including Tony Adams and Ray Parlour - led to a full-time position during George Graham's time as manager.

Arsene Wenger named Steve as Arsenal's Chief Scout upon his arrival in 1996, a post he
retained until 2017. Steve and his network of scouts were responsible for finding and obtaining
numerous players critical to the Club's on-pitch success during his four decades with the club.

"Our thoughts are with Steveâ€™s family and friends at this time.

"Rest in peace, Steve."

The Arsenal striker Lacazette hasn't scored in open play since December, and he's only scored
four Premier League goals so far this season. At the time, it appeared to be a dangerous option.

Arsenal opened themselves up to criticism as soon as they opted not to bring in a replacement
after allowing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to join Barcelona in January.

 Mikel Arteta, for one,
was well aware of this, but he remained obstinate.
