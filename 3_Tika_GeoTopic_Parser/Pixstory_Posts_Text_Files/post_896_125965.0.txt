Harley-Davidson introduced their famous “WLA” model during WW-II for the United States Army. It was mass produced and shipped across Europe and Asia. It brought such success to the company that it earned the Army-Navy “E” award in 1943.
However, the advancement of automobile technology post WW-II sounded a premature death knell for the WLA model. The new design and advanced engines made the WLA redundant. Most of the owners sold them cheap.
