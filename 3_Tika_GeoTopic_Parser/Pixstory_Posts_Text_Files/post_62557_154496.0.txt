Australia has a reputation for being teeming with predatory animals. The funnel-web spider, which contains venom that can kill a human in 15 minutes, is one land-dwelling species that can back up those assertions.
15 minutes.
There are 35 different funnel web species, some of which can be found along Australia's eastern coast, from New South Wales to Queensland, but only one is the world's deadliest spider.
Sydney Funnel-Web. The deadliest spider on the planet.
They are enormous spiders with large, rearward-facing fangs capable of piercing fingernails. One male, lovingly christened 'Big Boy' by the Australian Reptile Park, measured 10cm stretched out. They are aggressive spiders that are black in colour, the front of their bodies shiny and hairless and their abdomens black or dark plum in colour.
Females are sedentary, staying in burrows with their entrances framed by the species' distinctive 'funnel' webbing, which is typically seen behind rocks or logs in suburban gardens and wilderness.
Males become more active following summer rains, when they start wandering in search of females, and this is when most people come into contact with them. Males are nocturnal and extremely sensitive to sunlight, so they wander at night. If they are unsuccessful in their search for a mate, they will seek shelter for the day, which is when they end up in people's shoes or houses.
This little creature holds the power to kill a rabbit? Nope. Dogs? No. Any other mammal? No. It's just humans and other primates. And they are not uncommon in its habitat country. Feel any better about living in America?
