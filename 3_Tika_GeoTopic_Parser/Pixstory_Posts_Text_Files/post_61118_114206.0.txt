Global Forgiveness Day is a day to celebrate the power of forgiveness. Forgiveness is important not only in our personal lives, but also in our relationships. It can help to heal wounds and create stronger ties between people. It is important because it can help solve global conflicts. By forgiving someone, you are sending a message that the conflict is no longer worth your attention. This can help to resolve the conflict peacefully and prevent further violence. Forgiveness also has a positive impact on individual mental health. When we forgive others, it helps us to feel better about ourselves. It can reduce our feelings of anger, resentment, and guilt. In turn, this can have a positive effect on our overall well-being.

The stupid neither forgive nor forget; the naive forgive and forget; the wise forgive but do not forget. ~ Thomas Szasz
