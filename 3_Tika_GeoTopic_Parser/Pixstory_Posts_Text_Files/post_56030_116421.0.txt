The PM hopefuls according to BBC were asked to acknowledge their greatest weakness! Here are some interesting answers.

Kemi Badenoch said in the past, her sense of humor has occasionally suggested she's flippant about issues and her jokes may have offended some people. She added she had worked on this and now is very careful when she uses words because people need to know that politicians are serious in this end. 

Rishi Sunak says he has a reputation for working hard but has understood the perfect should not be the enemy of the good. He adds he's spent many hours getting across the detail, but sometimes that time is better spent elsewhere.

Liz Truss admits being "excessively enthusiastic" in the past but adds she now realizes she should not try to do too much. So she'll focus on "getting the economy going".

Penny Mordaunt quips that her greatest weakness may be her Burmese cats, who may not get on with Larry the Downing Street cat. She adds that she's realized to delegate to be more effective - and the party needs to use all its talents across the Cabinet table; it shouldn't just be about the top job.

Tom Tugendhat says he talks about his time in the Army too much… and then talks about it a bit more, saying it was "incredibly formative". But he says he recognizes that many other organizations businesses and communities do great jobs and can help to restore the country's trust.
