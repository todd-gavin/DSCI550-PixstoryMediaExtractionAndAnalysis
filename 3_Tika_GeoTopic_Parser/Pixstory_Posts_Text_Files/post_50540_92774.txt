Naked Mole rats can live for an incredibly long time and have an exceptional resistance to cancer as they have unique conditions in their bodies that stop cancer cells multiplying according to new research They are very unique as being the only cold blooded mammal lacking pain sensitivity to chemical stumili in their skin and being able to withstand very low levels of Oxygen hypoxia Recent research suggests that the environment micro environment of naked mole rat s body prevents the cancer from developing contradicting previous studies suggested that an inherent feature of naked mole rats cells stopped them turning cancerous in first place A potential mechanism that averts cancer is an over crowding gene p which prevents cell division once individual cells come into contact contact inhibition The cells of most mammals including naked mole rats undergo contact inhibition via the gene p which prevents cellular reproduction at a much higher cell density than p does The combination of p and p in naked mole rats is a double barrier to uncontrolled cell proliferation one of the hallmarks of cancer In scientists reported that the reason naked mole rats do not get cancer can be attributed to an extremely high molecular mass hyaluronan which is over five times larger than that in cancer prone humans and cancer susceptible animals Naked mole rats have ribosomes that produce extremely error free proteins In a report was published that recorded the first ever discovered malignancies in two naked mole rats in two individuals However both naked mole rats were captive born at zoos and hence lived in an environment with atmospheric oxygen compared to their natural which may have promoted tumorigenesis
