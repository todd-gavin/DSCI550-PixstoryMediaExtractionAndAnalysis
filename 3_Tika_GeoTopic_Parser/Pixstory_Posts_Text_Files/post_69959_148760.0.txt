The best exercises for PCOS! 🥳
Lol, JK. There is no single miracle exercise for PCOS.
Infact, PCOS management requires dedication and it requires consistency over perfection. 
You basically have to get regular exercise say 30 minutes every single day and this is the thing that will help you manage your PCOS.🤸‍♀️🏃‍♀️⌚
Now obviously it can be quite frustrating because you know PCOS management does require so much commitment, so much effort to your end and unfortunately it is because of this that we fall prey to these nonsense tricks that don't really help us in the long term.
Well so don't get trap in these so called quick treatments either you can get a planned workout and diet form your gynec or Regular exercise is the best way to ensure good health :)
