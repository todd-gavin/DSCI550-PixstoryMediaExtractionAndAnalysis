Capitalism was a system that allowed humans to purchase their identities, which was much more convenient than building one from scratch. Humans fetishized their comforts, and this left them feeling empty. As Edward Norton says, he has a “house full of condiments and no food.” Human lives were full of ornamentation, yet had no substance. It is Tyler Durden who shows Edward Norton a way out of his wretched existence. By subjecting their feeble bodies to pain the characters are reaffirming their humanity in the most visceral way possible. One time Tyler puts the lye on Edward Norton’s hand, resulting in an ugly scar. In the face of a society that makes them feel nothing, Tyler is offering rebirth through pain. And with rebirth comes new life. Durden’s Project Mayhem is about destroying the false comforts of American society. They crush capitalist symbols, like the coffee shop and the computer store. At the end of the film, we see the successful demolition of several important buildings. The people have gotten what they wanted: to be free of their capitalist overlords. And yet, at the end we see a shot of a male private part. For even the film itself, a capitalist product after all, must be corrupted. Either that, or the filmmakers just made a mistake.
