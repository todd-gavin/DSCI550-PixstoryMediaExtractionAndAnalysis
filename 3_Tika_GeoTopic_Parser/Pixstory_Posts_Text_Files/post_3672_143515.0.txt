The new season of ‘The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City’ will be available to stream on Hayu from September 29.
Returning for season three are Housewives Lisa Barlow, Heather Gay, Meredith Marks, Whitney Rose and Jen Shah.
Joining this season as friends are Danna Bui-Negrete, Angie Harrington and Angie Katsanevas.
The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City is produced by Shed Media (a division of Warner Bros. Unscripted Television) with Lisa Shannon, Dan Peirson, Lori Gordon and Luke Neslage serving as executive producers. Andy Cohen also serves as an executive producer. 
Coming up this season:
Amid an ongoing legal battle, Jen Shah is leaning on her friends and family for support more than ever. When the group’s dynamics shift, Jen’s new alliances cause a divide among the women. Jen and her husband, Sharrieff, downsize their house as they face the uncertainty of their future together.
Still dealing with the hurt that came from Lisa’s salacious rant, Meredith Marks is standing by her new, unexpected support system and is leaving friends-turned-foes in the past. Although tensions in the group are bubbling over, Meredith is focusing her energy on causes close to her heart as she hosts a fashion show to raise awareness around mental health.
After a hot-mic moment landed her in hot water, Lisa Barlow’s relationship with one of her dearest friends is changed forever. Despite many of her friendships hanging in the balance, she finds an implausible ally in the group of women. As unflattering rumours about Lisa fly around Salt Lake, she turns her attention to focus on her husband, her children and her business.
