With just 4 wins in the last 11 league games, Chelsea found themselves in a spot of bother. Having already dropped out of the title race, it seemed as if Chelsea's top four hopes were in jeopardy too.

However, Thomas Tuchel's Chelsea delivered a fitting response on Sunday, as the Blues saw off London rivals, Spurs. The reigning European champions won by score-line of 2-0 to hand Antonio Conte's Spurs first league defeat. Tottenham have played one of the fewest matches in the league, on account of several games being postponed due to covid-19 pandemic.

Hence, Chelsea were placed in a must-win situation in order to maintain a grip over their top four berth. The first 30 mins of the game was a pretty dull affair, as both sides refused to take any risks and were solid defensively. It seemed that Harry Kane had broken the deadlock in the 42nd minute, before his goal was ruled offside. The second half ended with a fascinating 15 minutes of play, and left a lot more to be desired in the second half.

Eventually, Chelsea's moment came in the 47th minute, when Hakim Ziyech scored an absolute stunner to give the hosts a lead. The Moroccan magician scored a goal from outside the box with such precision, that Hugo Lloris did not even move an inch. 

Thiago Silva doubled the hosts' advantage in the 55th minute, as the European champions clung onto the 2-0 lead and saw off the rest of the game very professional. With this win, Chelsea move onto 47 points in the league table, and are placed third on the table. Meanwhile, Spurs are placed 7th in the league with 36 points, but do have 4 games in hand over Chelsea.
