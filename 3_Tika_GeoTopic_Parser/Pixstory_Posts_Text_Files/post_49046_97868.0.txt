Silk isn't the most animal-friendly material on the market. It's a high-end fabric that's also one of the most expensive on the market. However, today's silk industry is just as exploitative and cruel as it was centuries before.

Silk is still regarded as one of the most luxurious fabrics in the world of fashion. Mulberry silk is the most expensive silk, as it is made from the cocoons of caterpillars who eat mulberry leaves for several weeks when in the pupal stage.

Hundreds of thousands of sensitive silkworms are killed each year to extract silk from their cocoons, making silk production very harsh to animals. To preserve material quality, thread length, and value, they are destroyed in boiling water during their pupal stage.

Bombyx mori females can lay up to 500 eggs. In a warm environment, silkworm eggs usually hatch in 7-14 days. Unfortunately, many hatchlings perish from dehydration or starvation before they reach adulthood.

Silkworms are fearful creatures who are sensitive. They are not mammals, but they are still alive entities who desire to live. They desire to live in a natural, tranquil environment.

Cruelty to animals has no place in today's society. Life is more valuable than stuff in whatever form.

Commercial mass-farming and animal slaughter are not only unethical, but also environmentally harmful. The majority of silk is manufactured with very low social and environmental standards.

There are plenty of non-cruel alternatives to silk that I have mentioned in a previous post. You can check that out if you want!
