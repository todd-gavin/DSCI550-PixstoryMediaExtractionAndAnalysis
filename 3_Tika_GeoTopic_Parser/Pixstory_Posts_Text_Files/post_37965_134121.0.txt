Gameweek 4 of the Premier League season brought about some crazy results. Here are some key talking points...
1) Top Six Register Wins as Arsenal make it four in four! 
Chelsea, Man City, Man United, Liverpool, Arsenal, and Tottenham Hotspur registered important wins in the gameweek. The results pushed all the potential title challengers to the top half of the PL table. 
Arsenal are currently leading the standings with four wins in four games. Mikel Arteta's side surely look like the team to beat. It would be interesting to see how they perform against the fellow "big boys" as this was their Achilles heel last season.
2) Liverpool hit nine past Bournemouth! 
The Reds beat Bournemouth 9-0 at the Anfield stadium, equalling the Premier League record set by Man United and Leicester City. Roberto Firmino was the star of the game as the Brazilian scored 2 goals and assisted his teammates thrice. This was also the first win for Liverpool in the 2022/23 Premier League season.
3) Kudos to Brighton & Hove Albion! 
The Seagulls are currently unbeaten and occupy the fourth spot in the Premier League table. Brighton's defence has been airtight as they have kept three clean sheets in four games, conceding just one. It has to be seen if  Graham Potter's team can finish in one of the European places come the end of the season.
