Agniveer protest was not the first of its kind. 6 months back it happened against railway recruitment. One year back before that on teachers recruitment in UP. The job market is pathetically down. Unemployment rate is howevering around 8 %. The worker participation ratio- how many are loking for jobs from the eligible lot- is just 41 percent. The rest 59% are not even looking for jobs. Have left the job market out of desperation. We are referring about crores of youth who are not even in the job market.

Thus military recruitment becomes the only shot many millions have for a job. Its that dream the govt has blown away. Every year there used to be military recruitment for about 60000 posts. Since 2019 it hasn't happened. Almost 4 years. 4x60000= 2,40,000 posts. And now a short term recruitment for 46000. 2,40,000-46000=1,94,000. This is the number of posts Modi has cancelled in the name of a fancy title!!
