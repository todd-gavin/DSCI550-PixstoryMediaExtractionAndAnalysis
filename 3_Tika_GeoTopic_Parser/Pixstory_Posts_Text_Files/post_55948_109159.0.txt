‌If she is confirmed by the Senate she would be the first woman, immigrant, or person of color to be the head of OSTP.
‌
‌Biden has spoken highly of her calling her a brilliant and highly respected physicist.  Biden said, "I share Dr. Prabhakar's belief that America has the most powerful innovation machine the world has ever seen."

if confirmed to lead OSTP, Prabhakar would become the third Asian American, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander to serve in President Biden's Cabinet, joining Vice President Kamala Harris and US Trade Representative Katherine Tai.

According to the White House, she served as director of DARPA from 2012 to 2017. At DARPA, she supervised teams that prototyped a system for detecting nuclear and radiological materials before a terrorist can build a bomb, developed tools to find human trafficking networks in the deep and dark web, and enabled complicated military systems to work together even when they were not originally designed to do so. She also established a new office to spur novel biotechnologies. This is indeed a moment to rejoice for the Indian American Community
