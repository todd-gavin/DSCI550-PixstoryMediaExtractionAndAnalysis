Comedy is the number one content type bringing young consumers to all their favorite platforms, ranking at the top of the list for everyone from Facebook to TikTok. It’s not a huge surprise that they’re looking for boosts and smiles on their feeds. YPulse data shows that Gen Z and Millennials are even more likely to say that they are using TV shows and videos as medicine to treat their different moods during this time, with 74% now reporting they do so compared to 65% in 2019. In fact, Adweek reports that young consumers are obsessed with “feel good short-form content.” According to a TheSoul Publishing study, 69% of consumers in the U.S. spend 30 minutes to three hours watching short-form content (videos that are less than 10 minutes long) every day. Many of the videos being streamed include cooking, comedy, DIY, and craft videos to “fill in those extra hours of the day that are no longer spent commuting to work or going out with friends.” Our data shows that comedy is the top content type attracting young consumers to social spaces.
