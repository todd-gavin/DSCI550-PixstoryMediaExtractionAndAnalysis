It’s been almost two years since the deadly pandemic, but do we have health reporters doing a routine round of medical colleges, hospitals, or fanning across the district primary healthcare centres or the offices of the Ministry of Health? Since the onset of the pandemic, have we seen public health reportage come from specialised health beat reporters?

In a country with a constant barrage of data, it is very important to get news in a contextualised form from specialised beat reporters. But this beat reporter is slowly vanishing in Indian journalism. Because of media explosion and growing competition between media houses, coupled with the need for newspapers to dedicate more resources to cover crime, politics, entertainment and sports – areas where the money is, and the eyeballs are – the beat reporter has become the biggest casualty.

The public health correspondents of ‘The Guardian’ of London have been at it since the virus attack. They have a special section for day-to-day coverage, with blow-by-blow accounts of not just what is happening in the UK but also in the rest of the world. They also have a daily special series deconstructing climate change and global warming, with experts like George Monbiot, author of the acclaimed book, ”Heat”, pitching in on the op-ed pages with critical insights.
