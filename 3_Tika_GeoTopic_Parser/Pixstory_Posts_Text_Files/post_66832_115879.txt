Cristiano Ronaldo is a egotistical soccer player who should be grateful to Sir Alex Ferguson without whom he wouldn t find a place in this Manchester United squad He is years old and a shadow of his former self there is a reason why Bayern and PSG don t want him His ego and ball hogging would be problematic for all the teams It s high time that he starts looking at some second tier clubs His days of glory are behind him and the whole world has accepted that except him
