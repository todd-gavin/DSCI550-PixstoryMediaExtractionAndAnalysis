Children are her/his stories. They describes their childhood with their stories, not only that, but they searches for their true identity through their stories.
Stories should have a chance to be told, because among other things, children's stories are also the history of their past and current wars. They are also reproducing important life events and fighting wars with their stories. Staying in the story keeps wars alive, but peace happens beyond the stories told and narrated.
