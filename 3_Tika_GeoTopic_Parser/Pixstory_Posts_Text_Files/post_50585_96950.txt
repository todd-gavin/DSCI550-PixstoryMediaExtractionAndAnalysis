I stopped blaming other people for my problems I realized that as cliche as this may sound if I was going to have the kind of life I wanted I had to make it happen myself and I am glad I realized it very soon in my life It wasn t easy and to be honest it s something I used to still struggle with it But I also realised that through these small efforts I was becoming a better version of myself Blaming others is so very tempting because I m usually right I m surrounded by imperfect people who rarely do things as well as they should But that s never going to change Yes try to surround yourself with high caliber people but they will let you down say something stupid do a half baked job etc Everyone makes mistakes but do also remember that this is how you will learn and will build your moral You can influence people but you only have control over you Make better decisions Don t procrastinate I had somehow developed the habit of Procrastinating a lot in my class th Board and had seen its harsh effects So the very moment you decide to do your work just do it Work towards a goal that you want to achieve you have to work on it otherwise just don t expect anything Do that for a year and you ll find that you struggle very very little with self esteem Since I believe if you put your efforts and work on it then you will be surely getting some good results and this will boost your confidence and will lower down your self esteem Hope this is helpful for you
