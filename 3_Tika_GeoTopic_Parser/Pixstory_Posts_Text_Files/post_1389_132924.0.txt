On this Women's Equality Day, I have to be thankful for one thing - the fact that I come from a line of strong, tough, and loving women. They haven't necessarily always been empowered in the ways that I would wish them to be - my great grandmother was married off very young, and became a widow young. My grandmother was too. Neither of them got to pursue their education, like I have. They grew up in an extremely patriarchal, old-world Chennai Hindu society that insisted they keep to the home, and focus on cooking and raising children instead of becoming financially independent. This meant that they had to carve out whatever agency they had for themselves - an often brutal task. 

I take so many things for granted today- the fact that I am educated, I am able to earn my own living, that I have the same rights as any free man. I never stop to think about these things, because i have benefited tremendously from the feminism movement. But it was just a mere fifty or so years ago that I would have had none of these things. 

Both my grandmother and my great-grandmother are dead now, and I wish I would have had more time with them. They were never anything less than optimistic or cheerful, and they deserved to have more choices in their own life. May women everywhere have more choice, now and forever.
