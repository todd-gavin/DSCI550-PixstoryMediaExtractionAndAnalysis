Richa Ghosh brought up her fifty off just 26 balls and as a result, she registered the fastest fifty by an Indian batter in Women's ODIs but New Zealand took a 4-0 lead in the five-match series. 

Chasing 192, India got off to the worst start possible as the side lost Shafali Verma (0), Yastika Bhatia (0) and Pooja Vastrakar (4) in quick succession and they were reduced to 12/3 in the third over. Soon after, Smriti Mandhana was sent back to the pavilion by Hayley Jensen as she scored just 13 runs and India was in a tough situation with 19/4 on the scoreboard in the fifth over. 

Richa Ghosh and Mithali Raj then got together at the crease and the duo revived the Indian innings. Ghosh brought up her fifty off just 26 balls and as a result, she registered the fastest fifty by an Indian batter in Women's ODIs. However, the 18-year-old departed after playing a knock of 52 in the 13th over and India was reduced to 96/5.

Amelia Kerr's all-round show handed New Zealand a thumping 63-run win in the rain-reduced fourth One-Day International at the John Davies Oval in Queensland on Tuesday.

It was the in-form Amelia Kerr who was impressive with the bat. She scored 11 boundaries and a six to remain unbeaten on a 33-ball 68 to help the hosts to 191 for 5.
She also picked up 3 wickets and helped New Zealand win the 4th ODI as they went 4-0 in the 5 match ODI series.
