 My own belief system is smart and sound I don t fall for those conspiracy theories only loony folks do Trouble is everybody thinks so It would ve been funny if the matter was not so grave What is it that makes conspiracy theories so sticky After a survey a research team offers some clues to their hold on our reasoning capacity But hold on how different conspiracy theories are from new thinking in science and society that challenged received wisdom but came to be accepted afterwards The team of political scientists computer scientists and literature and culture critics made a list of well known beliefs like those about the Kennedy assassination G cellular wireless technology Obama s birth certificate Covid and climate change They surveyed a representative sample of Americans in March and in October Their finding Nine out of Americans believed in at least one conspiracy theory which are proven wrong with incontrovertible evidence For explanation they turn to two dimensions the first regards partisan and ideological identities while the other is composed of anti social orientations such as narcissism Machiavellianism psychopathy and acceptance of political violence Among other interesting findings Republicans or democrats nobody is especially proof All fall for it provided the theory shows the other side in bad light or supports your notions about them Some conspiracy theories are about the kind of topics in which only experts know the right from the wrong like health or science and therefore the rest of us are not in position to debunk them Many such theories are like astrology a fun diversion that remains harmless The rest can be outright harmful to some individuals groups businesses or nations Powerful people are usual targets Sometimes it s worth analyzing theories not in terms of the target say Obama but who the theory could be helping who could be the source Since conspiracy theories are no longer about UFOs and Elvis Presley but deal with and impact elections outcomes the subject should be taken with utmost seriousness Enthusiastically debunking others is welcome but subjecting your own blind spots is more important Try this
