The US supreme court has favored Republican-led states to jeopardize the federal government’s ability to tackle the climate crisis this was due to a ruling which will have implications for the regulatory power of the government. 

A 6-3 decision will seriously make disturbances the ability of America to stave off global heating as the supreme court has opted to aid a case brought by West Virginia that demands the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) be constrained in how it regulates planet-heating gases from the energy sector.

The case, which was supported by a host of other Republican-led states including Texas and Kentucky, was highly rare in that it was based upon the Clean Power Plan.

 The Biden administration sought to have the case dismissed as foundationless given the plan was dropped and has not been resurrected.

It also implicates two legal doctrines that are not mentioned in the constitution, and that most scholars agree to have no basis in any federal statute. Not only was this case about a regulation that does not exist, that never took effect, and which would have committed obligations on the energy sector that it would have met regardless. 

However, the supreme court has sided with West Virginia, a major coal mining state, which argued that “unelected bureaucrats” at the EPA should not be authorized to reshape its economy by limiting pollution. 

But the ruling could also have widespread consequences for the federal government’s ability to set standards and regulate in other areas, such as clean air and water, consumer protections, banking, workplace safety, and public health. It may prove a landmark moment in conservative intentions to take apart the “regulatory state”, stripping away protections from Americans across a wide range of areas.

The supreme court is becoming more republican than the non-partisan state it should be. They are bringing in conservative ideas and favoring the republican party's notions.
