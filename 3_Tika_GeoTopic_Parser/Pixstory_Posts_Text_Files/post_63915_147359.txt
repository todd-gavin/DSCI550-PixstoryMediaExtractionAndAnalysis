Finnish melodic death metal band Brymir s fourth album Voices In The Sky is a symphonic melodic death metal album marked by a strong folk influence that truly aims to reach the sky Ferocious ravenous diverse and intense this album is everything a modern metal album ought to be Relatively straightforward the album is also very creative and highly enjoyable comprising an almost cinematic landscape that really gives you chills Brymir perfectly combines folk classical melodic death metal bringing with it some amazingly massive production grooves heavy riffs and awesome technical instrumentation In some ways this album can be considered a blend between Wintersun Soilwork and Ensiferum possessing elements of all three This is perfectly demonstrated from the opening title track which starts off from a folk guitar and escalates into awesome death metal consisting of both heavy riffs tight grooves and melodic hooks From there the album pummels you into the ground with a strong show of heaviness with Forged in war From there the album is unrelenting in its fury to dominate showcasing a massive surge of sonic energy that never lets up throughout the course of this minute headbanger Fly With Me really lives up to its title making you feel like you can take your feet off the ground Herald Of Aegir is a grand song packing some power metal sensibilities feeling a bit adventurous The mid paced synthesizer based Rift Between Us is a good change of pace going in a bit slow it packs with it a sense of melancholy reminiscent of Eternal Tears Of Sorrow Now whether it is Landfall Borderland Far Frome Home or Seeds Of Downfall each track is simply brilliant though it is All Is One which is perhaps the ultimate winner fully showcasing the band s talents to its peak Jam packed with amazing riffs incredible solos vocals and hooks Diabolus Interium is the only weak track here Full of energy and purpose Brymir sound like no one else except themselves with Voices In The Sky being a worthy successor to their previous album Wings Of Fire and just as good Score
