Anime might be a fun world to explore, but it is not all chocolate and rainbows. In reality it is a really mixed world, with some truly unsightly horrors at the other end which are an insult to all creation itself. Not every anime is Death Note, there are plenty of bad anime out there. But only a few shows are downright unwatchable. Sometimes it is ugly animation, trashy brain-dead plots, horrible music and boring characters, but few have it all in such an overdose. While, good or bad are all a subject of viewpoint, sometimes things are objectively so bad that they must be avoided. While there are anime/manga beyond this list that are also just as bad, few can ever match these for the abominable eyesore they are. These anime signify everything wrong with anime today.
