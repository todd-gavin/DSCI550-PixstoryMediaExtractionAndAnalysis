Patients suffering thalassemia have fewer red blood cells and may have symptoms of a low blood count or anemia Patients might feel tired or weak and experience dizziness shortness of breath a fast heart beat headache leg cramps and difficulty in concentrating and occurrence of pale skin The type of treatment a person receives depends on how severe the thalassemia is The more severe the thalassemia the less hemoglobin the body has and the more severe the anemia may be One way to treat anemia is to provide the body with more red blood cells to carry oxygen This can be done through a blood transfusion a safe common procedure in which you receive blood through a small plastic tube inserted into one of your blood vessels Some people with thalassemia usually with thalassemia major need regular blood transfusions because their body makes such low amounts of hemoglobin People with thalassemia intermedia not as severe as major but not as mild as trait may need blood transfusions sometimes such as when they have an infection or an illness People with thalassemia minor or trait usually do not need blood transfusions because they either do not have anemia or have only a mild anemia
