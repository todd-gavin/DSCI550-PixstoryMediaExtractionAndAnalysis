Women's health AND healthcare for people
with a V

How are these terms different?

Women's health' refers to the health and wellness of all
people who identify as a woman, regardless of whether
they have a vagina. We include the term 'people with a V as a colloquial way to refer to folks who have a vagina, but do not identify as a woman. These people often face the same challenges as cis-women in the healthcare system as well as some that are unique to being non-binary or trans.

Why do you use both?

We use these terms very intentionally to communicate
exacty who we are speaking to or about.

When do you use 'women's health'?
An example of a time we might use the term 'women's
health' or just 'women' is when referring to a medical
study, statistic, or article which refrs to only cis-women.

When do you use 'people with a V'?
An example of a time we might use this term is when
talking about Gynecological procedures or vaginal health. This information is typically only relevant to folks with a vagina, regardless of whether they identify as a woman or not.

Which term is better?
Neither term is better or worse than the other. They serve different purposes. While 'people with a V' may sound like the more inclusive term, it excludes trans women and some people with certain medical conditions. It's important to consider exactly who your audience is before choosing a term. If you're not sure, it's ok to ask for help or consult a reliable source.
