Pravettoni Director of IEO Psycho-Oncology Viviana Galimberti Director of Breast Surgery Emilia Montagna doctor of the Medical Breast Division From the Manzoni stage in person or on video they support the campaign Caterina Balivo Orietta Berti Maria De Filippi Mara Maionchi In Italy about women have been diagnosed with cancer breastfeeding and a high percentage over there clinically cured after years declares Paolo Veronesi Yet after overcoming the most difficult obstacle these women often encounter another barrier because society considers them cancer patients forever IEO therefore launches a campaign because the roles and rights of women affected by breast cancer are not strongly determined in some cases by their disease We join first of all the associations of doctors and patients in favor of a law which, in the event of recovery, recognizes the right not to declare information about one&#39;s disease or right to oncological oblivion Basically today those who have had cancer find it difficult to adopt a child or take out a mortgage to buy a house as if their illness can never be forgotten Our campaign is active so that there is no discrimination at every stage of the disease not only after recovery Today there are more and more women who live with breast cancer for a long time For the majority of them, physical, cognitive, psychological and social recovery is possible which allows them to reintegrate into life before the cancer There is therefore also a right to social reintegration of women with breast cancer that needs to be talked about I like to repeat that for every cell that goes mad and turns into cancer a woman suffers We still don&#39;t know how to prevent that cell from going mad but we can cure women Today we ask that the law also recognize this new and extraordinary reality
