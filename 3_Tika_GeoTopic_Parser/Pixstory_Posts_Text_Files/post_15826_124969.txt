Abstract Type diabetes T D is characterized by hyperglycemia and insulin resistance Cocoa may slow T D development and progression This study employed male and female BTBR Cg Lepob ob WiscJ ob ob and wild type WT controls to assess the potential for cocoa to ameliorate progressive T D and compare responses between sexes Mice received diet without WT ob ob or with cocoa extract ob ob c for weeks Acute cocoa reduced fasting hyperglycemia in females but not males after weeks Chronic cocoa supplementation weeks ameliorated hyperinsulinemia in males and worsened hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia in females yet also preserved and enhanced beta cell survival in females The underlying mechanisms of these differences warrant further study If sex differences are apparent in subsequent preclinical studies clinical studies will be warranted to establish whether these differences are relevant in humans Sex differences may need to be considered when designing human dietary interventions for T D Sources
