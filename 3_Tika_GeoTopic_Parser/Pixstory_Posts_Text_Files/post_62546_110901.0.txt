The wolf is one of the planet's most intriguing and magnificent animals. The vicious predator exhibits expert hunting techniques as well as devotion and care within the pack. People are still unable to fully understand this majestic animal.

They are the largest member of the dog family. But they are so ferocious that their staple food is....a dog. While they do belong to the same family, wolves love to hunt stray dogs and munch on them.

The earliest images of wolves date back to 20,000 B.C. and are found in caves in southern Europe.

Wolves are brave animals but they are instinctively terrified of the strange and will rather not mess with it. They will run away from intruders rather than barking at them, which is why wolves do not make ideal guard dogs.

Wolves run on their toes to avoid wearing down their paw pads and to aid in fast stops and turns.

In a single session, a wolf can eat 9 kg of flesh! They do not eat sparingly once they get their kill.

The hierarchy in wolf packs is fascinating. Even though the scavengers could have to wait another three days for their next meal, the highest ranking wolf will eat first and everything that cannot be consumed is left for them.
