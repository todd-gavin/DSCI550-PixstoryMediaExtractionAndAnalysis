Real Madrid and Adidas Football just launched the new jersey for the season 2022-2023.

This year, Real Madrid brings back the collar in the jersey and the colour of the jersey is white and purple.

As a Real Madrid fan, I can’t wait to buy this jersey and to wear it before every match with Real Madrid.
