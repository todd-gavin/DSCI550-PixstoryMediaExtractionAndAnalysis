Move over Rapunzel My boy Eugene has a new mate , the coolest most bravest horse in the kingdom Maximus. Maximus and Eugene are my favourite , the such a comedic , entertaining duo . Both of them form a great bond . Eugene and Maximus radiate sibling energy , they keep fighting each other , stand on the opposite sides of the law . Heck there is even a scene of Eugene fighting Maximus with a frying pan while maximus holds a sword with his mouth ðŸ˜‚ . 

Tangled is a great film , it is a joy to watch. But it is so underated ,Go ahead and watch it ! It is perfect to enjoy on a weekend.
