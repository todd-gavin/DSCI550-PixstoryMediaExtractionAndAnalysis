The United States and Ukraine have thwarted Russian President Vladimir Putin's efforts to distort the narrative of his horrific conflict, but they are still working to present the Russian people with a more honest picture of the Kremlin's invasion. 

US News reported that Putin is expanding his two-decade crackdown on information while the Russian military loses thousands of lives and fails to conquer key cities. The Kremlin has shut down Russia's remaining three independent media sites, blocked key social media platforms, enacted new rules punishing journalists who oppose its propaganda, and insisted on referring to the conflict as a "special military operation."

As a result, the Russian people has limited access to information that contradicts Putin's anti-Ukraine, anti-Western narrative. It's a safety net for Putin in the event of a reaction against the war and Western sanctions, which have ravaged Russia's economy. 

For Ukraine and its Western friends, breaking through Putin's media bubble is a critical strategic goal. They've tried a variety of overt and covert tactics to reach regular Russians, ranging from encouraging the use of software that bypasses internet filters to holding government briefings for TikTok influencers. Independent voices still working in Russia, as well as voices from the West and direct appeals from Ukrainians, are hoped to persuade the populace that the war next door is being lied to them.
