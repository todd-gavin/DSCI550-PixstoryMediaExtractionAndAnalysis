The consensus regarding Kylian Mbappe's future is he will join Real Madrid this summer, after years of negotiations between Spain and France.

However, Mbappe's decisive goal against the Spanish giants in the first leg of Paris Saint-Germain's 1-0 Champions League win over Los Blancos has sparked the possibility of whether the 23-year-old could actually stay in France.

Rumours of PSG going all-in to retain Mbappe have gained traction recently, with a potential new one-year deal which will see the forward earn one million euros per week being offered.

This would give Mbappe the chance to shine at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and if he shines on the world stage again, PSG may decide Mbappe is the player to lead the team forward in the future.

Mbappe doesn't want to get tied down with rumours about his future before PSG and Real Madrid's Champions League tie comes to an end on March 9.

He wants to still be loved by the fans, which is why he pointed his finger towards the grass at the Parc des Princes, perhaps gesturing that this is his place.

Mbappe has always been part of a team which is full of stars, but according to L'Equipe the French star wants a team that's built around him.

With Neymar and Lionel Messi in the same squad, it's difficult to see how Mauricio Pochettino could build a team around Mbappe. PSG would have to explain to Mbappe that this move could be possible from next year.

The likes of Gareth Bale, Eden Hazard, Rodrgyo and Vinicius Junior don't have the same status so it would be easier for Mbappe to be a leader at Real Madrid.

As mentioned earlier, PSG may offer a short contract to Mbappe so he doesn't miss out on a Real Madrid team which are the team to beat in LaLiga Santander.

Mbappe's salary would be doubled from his current 25 million euros, with a release clause that would enable him to leave in June 2023.
