Two years after taking up the sport, Rosy Paulraj sets the pole vaulting national record.
The 25-year-old, who has only been competing in the sport for two years, nearly missed the competition when she missed her train.
Pole vaulter Rosy Meena Paulraj may have set a new record on Saturday, but just the day before, she wasn't even sure she would make it to the competition. Due to a mix-up with timetables, the Tamil Nadu vaulter missed her train from Chennai after clearing the bar at 4.20m and breaking Sureka Renjit's 8-year-old record.
following her victory on Saturday at the Gujarati facility of IIT Gandhinagar, she said, "I thought the train was at 10:30, but when I reached there, it had already left." Rosy nearly abandoned her intentions to travel to Gujarat since she couldn't book a train later that day.
To let her father, Paulraj, a Thanjavur music instructor, know about the missed train, she contacted him. He didn't scream or become angry. He only asked whether I still wanted to go. And within minutes, he had arranged for a journey for me and taken out a loan," adds Rosy.
Rosy could not control her tears as she sat down during the award ceremony while wearing the medal around her neck. Even though she only started vaulting recently, she has set her sights on breaking the country's record. The 25-year-old did some gymnastics and even javelin, but it wasn't until 2019 that she found her real passion.
"A young vaulter who had trained in Chennai visited our house while I was in my second year of college. I had never seen how the sport was performed before. I had no idea the pole could bend and provide enough force to launch a person into the air," she claims.
Most people did not think it was a good idea to start a whole new sport at 23. Even her current coach Milber Bertrand Russell wasn't keen on the notion when they initially spoke because she is just 5 feet 2 inches tall. However, Rosy doesn't give up lightly once she sets her mind to anything.
