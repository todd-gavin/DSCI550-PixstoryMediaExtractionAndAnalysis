EXTENSION OF ENTRY AGE : AGNIPATH SCHEME
 
​
Consequent to the commencement of the AGNIPATH scheme, the entry age for all new recruits in the Armed Forces has been fixed as 17 ½  - 21 years of age.
 
​Cognizant of the fact that it has not been possible to undertake the recruitment during the last two years, the Government has decided that a one-time waiver shall be granted for the proposed recruitment cycle for 2022.
 
​Accordingly, the upper age limit for the recruitment process for Agnipath scheme for 2022 is increased to 23 years.
