Lorenzo Insigne recently shocked the world when he completed his move to Major League Soccer Toronto FC from Napoli on a free transfer in this transfer window. The news turned a lot of heads for very understandable reasons. Firstly, Lorenzo Insigne is still at the top of his game and he is just 31 which is definitely not an age when European footballers tend to consider a move to MLS. Secondly, this is the first ever time that Insigne is playing in a club outside of Italy. 

Insigne is a Napoli youth academy product. He had been sent out on 3 loans but since the 2011/12, he has been in integral part of their senior squad. It thus marks the end of a great spell at the city for him. 

Recently Lorenzo Insigne revealed that he had gone to MLS with very few hopes to be honest. He had expected them to be at a much lower level compared to Serie A but he was in for a surprise when he reached USA. 

“I was surprised by the MLS because there are all very good facilities, new pitches and very nice stadiums," he said in an interview. 

“On a physical level it is very demanding because you run so much. It’s a good league and I hope it grows more and more to approach the prestige of the European leagues.

“I’m doing well in Toronto and I’m starting to study the language. It’s right that way, to understand people, my teammates and the coach.

“I miss everything about Napoli and as soon as I have time I will definitely come back to find friends and family and follow Napoli closely.”

So far, he has played 3 matches in the Major League Soccer scoring 1 goal and providing 1 assist.
