It's impossible to eat just one plate of Bun Maska. The aroma of freshly baked soft bread covered with gently melting butter makes the mouth water and make the desire for another dish to be dipped in a steaming hot cup of creamy Irani Chai grow stronger. At Mumbai's famed Irani cafés, the modest and comforting Bun Maska has become legendary, evoking generations of wonderful memories. Chequered flooring, tattered seats, grandfather clocks, instruction boards, and the charming 'Uncle' behind the counter are all frequent sights in Irani cafés that first opened in what was then Bombay. These increasingly fading Irani cafés still occupy a distinct role in Mumbai's bustling social life as a centre of food, culture, and socialising.
"An Irani café cannot do without bun-maska," says Ali Irani of Mumbai's Koolar & Co. Iranians arrived in Mumbai in the early 1940s, when the British were dominating, and started tiny cafes for the locals. Back then, Kadak Brun Maska was one of the most popular dishes. However, it was a touch bland and lacked flavour, so Iranians began preparing bun-maska, a sweeter version with butter, cheese, honey, or jam, which was mostly for the elderly and children. Adding a lot of pure ghee to the dough is the key to making a soft bun. Bun maska is, and always will be, a particularly special meal for Mumbaikars.
With the opening of Irani cafes in Mumbai, the concept of bun-maska and chai was born. Irani cafes sprang up all throughout Mumbai in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and they formed an important element of the city's social history. What is the appearance of an authentic Iranian café? Vintage furnishings, marble-topped tables, bentwood chairs, glass jars full of sweets, and a large group of folks chatting over bun-maska and tea. Another variation is the Brun Maska, which has a crusty bun rather than a soft and silky one. It can be used as a low-cost breakfast or teatime option.
