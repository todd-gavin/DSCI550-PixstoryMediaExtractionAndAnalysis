Shareef O'Neal who wouldn't have been more than 6 months old when his father, the laker great Shaquille O'Neal, teamed with "The Black Mamba" Kobe Bryant to win the first of three championships together for the Los Angeles Lakers. Today the same Shareef is 24 year old and is aiming to be one of the draft prospects of the upcoming season. 

The elder O'Neal aka Shaq went on to have his No. 34 jersey retired by L.A. in 2013 as Kobe played for lakers that night, Shaq was also enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016.

However interestingly enough when the younger O'Neal reported to the Lakers practice facility for a pre-draft workout on Tuesday, it wasn't with his father's blessing.

Turns out the relationship between Shaq and Shareef is on the rocks as the parent son duo didn't see eye to eye on this decision. While Shaq wanted Shareef to stay in school, the youngin thought being an adult he knew better, and it was time for him to join the Lakers in the pre-draft workout session
