Journaling is something we often overlook as a tedious task. But trust me, it's more of a take-pressure-off-my-chest task. Writing your ideas, thoughts, and rants down always works.

Developing a healthy habit of writing down would help to devise plans for your visions in life. And that's what I'm trying to do as well. It's like you affirm it when you write it down. It's like a verbal idea becomes an official idea when you pen it down.

From then, voila, you can begin working out how to go about setting goals over time!
