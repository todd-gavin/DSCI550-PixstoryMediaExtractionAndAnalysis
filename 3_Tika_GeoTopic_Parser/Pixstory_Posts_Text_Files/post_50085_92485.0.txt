Margret Atwood is indeed a splendid writer whose narratives and imagination go beyond time. Yet her feministic concerns are a bit too conservative. 

Recently she posted an article asking whether the word “woman” was being eliminated out of concern for trans women’s feelings – a gender-critical view – followed by a post reassuring her followers that the writer “is not a terf”, a derogatory term for gender-critical women meaning trans-exclusionary radical feminist which is very confusing. 

Handmaid's Tale does discuss women being used as machines for bearing children by a totalitarian state. But the same criticises the feminists! it also states that feminist concepts alone don’t offer protection from male domination. The novel shows feminists as oppressive feminists with their quotes on empowerment! She even in her interview with Guardian talks about good and bad feminists! I don't think a division should be encouraged. Those who believe in and propagate equality and fight against patriarchy, are feminists regardless of their gender. That's a straight yes or no and no in-between. 

Handmaid's Tale even though dealing with the oppression of women does not offer a solution. She portrays that in one way or another women will remain oppressed in this dystopian world. Her Handmaid's Tale is a novel on Social Realism, not Feminism!
