A usually glossed-over part of Black history is spotlighted in HBO's new series "The Gilded Age." NBC News tells us that textbooks about this period in history would have you believe that Andrew Carnegie, J. P. Morgan, and Cornelius Vanderbilt were completely responsible for the era's remarkable economic and social growth. In reality, individuals of colour made enormous contributions to the 19th-century American economy and its vast wealth accumulation. 

"The Gilded Age," with its modest cast of remarkable Black characters, depicts a period in history when African Americans did more than merely flee to New York to grasp their freedom - they made history.

The fourth episode of the new series (created by Julian Fellowes of "Downton Abbey") delves deeper into this ignored element of history through the character Peggy Scott (Denée Benton). The episode takes us away from the white elite's gold-lacquered neighbourhood and into the vibrant African American community where Peggy was raised and her family lives. Peggy's parents are educated and business-minded, and they own a gorgeous Brooklyn brownstone (complete with staff). They exemplify their surroundings, in which African American men and women created social groups, held lavish parties, and thrived. Arthur (John Douglas Thompson), Peggy's father, operates a pharmacy, and Dorothy (Audra McDonald), Peggy's mother, is a pianist. 

The Scott family's appearance in the new film is significant in many ways. Speaking to TODAY, Benton explained that the show brought on a new understanding of people of color during this time.

“There’s so many limiting perspectives for Black people and Black artists, what we take in from the media, from our history books about what we can and can’t be,” Benton said.
