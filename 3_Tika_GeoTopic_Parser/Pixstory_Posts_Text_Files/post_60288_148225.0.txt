An army soldier in Arunachal Pradesh was detained by Punjab police on Saturday in connection with a girl student who was allegedly caught on camera in the college dorm bathroom at Chandigarh University in Mohali. The soldier was accused of "blackmailing" the student. She was previously taken into custody along with two other males from her own state of Himachal Pradesh.
When the situation was made public last Saturday, there were sizable protests on the private university's campus, which is located approximately 20 km outside of Chandigarh. On WhatsApp, there were rumours that other girls' recordings were being shared, but the police claimed the arrested girl was simply sharing her own video to her buddy. Since then, the net has grown.
Today's Punjab police head said the SIT had tracked "forensic and digital evidence" acquired from gadgets belonging to the girl and two other individuals who had been caught before Sanjeev Singh, a soldier, was detained. With the assistance of police from Arunachal Pradesh and Assam as well as the army, the army member was arrested by a Mohali Police squad from Sela Pass.
The official stated, "Mohali police received a two-day transit remand from the district court and will now produce him before a magistrate in Mohali."
A three-person, all-female Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by Additional Director General of Police (ADGP) Gurpreet Kaur Deo was established by Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann.
