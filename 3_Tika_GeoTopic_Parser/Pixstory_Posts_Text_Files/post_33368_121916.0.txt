During the last 1400 years or more after its construction, the temple had undergone additions, renovations, restorations and repairs of which the following are more important and are referred to in the inscriptions from the temple viz.

1.   By a monk named Prakhyata-Kirtti, belonging to the Sri Lankan royal family, who did the new coating of plaster and paint in the 7th century

2.   By King Kyanzittha of Pagan, Upper Burma (Myanmar), who got some repairs done between 1084-1112 AD.

3.   By King Letyaminnan of Arban who, sometime in the 12th century caused certain repairs to the temple and perhaps the railing also.

4.   By King Bodawpaya or some other King of Ava (Mandalay) in early 19th century AD.


5.   Thorough repair and restoration by Cunningham and Beglar in 1880. The fallen spire was completely restored and the corner turrets added at the four corners.

In addition to the sacred tree and the ancient railings and the temples there are numerous votive stupas, chaityas, remains or traces of other shrines and another tree, now sacred to the Hindus, inside the premises of the Great Temple. Numerous sculptures, carvings and inscription slabs were also found in course of repairs and other excavations in the court-yard and debris of the temple. Some of them were shifted to the Indian Museum at Kolkata, while others are seen in the Archaeological Museum nearby. Several other items are also seen in the temples nearby and in the Math, which seem to have originated directly from the premises of the great temple.
