A man from Florida pleaded guilty to threatening Ilhan Omar in district court. According to a plea agreement, David Hannon, 67, a supporter of former President Donald Trump, sent an email to Omar in July 2019, after Omar and three other members of Congress held a news conference criticizing then-President Trump.

The charge carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years and a $250,00 fine.
He send an email threatening her and two of her collegues of colour and called them radical rats. He called them so because of Omar's comments at a news conference that “specifically repeated quotes containing curse words from then-president Trump regarding social issues involving women and minorities,” according to the plea agreement by NBC News. 
The man said that he was inspired by the curse.

 The man in the email addressed her with her religion and threaten to shoot her. Omar was sworn into office in 2019, making history as the first African refugee elected to Congress after she fled conflict in Somalia in 1995. Omar is also the first woman of colour to represent Minnesota and one of the first two Muslim American women elected to Congress.

Where is this country heading, so much hate in the minds of the citizens? Are those spreading hate on Black Minorites, LGBTQ Communities think about what they inspire in the citizens. They inspire deaths. When will many of the citizens including Congresspeople come to sense that America is not the property of Rich-White Males! In a democratic country threatening someone based on their  ethnicity is a shame and completely against the fundamental values
