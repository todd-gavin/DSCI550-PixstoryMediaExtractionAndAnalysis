*my inner voice*
Does it hurt that people judge you everyday on the basis of what you wear 
WHATEVER YOU WEAR 

Growing up with the realisation that everyone's eyes speak for themselves. If you're wearing shorts, people will look at you and judge you, and there will be many creepy eyes staring at you. 
However, if you wear a suit, people will still judge you, and if you wear a hijab, people will still judge you. 
And you won't believe it when I tell you that even in school uniform, people will look at you and judge you. 
It makes no difference what you wear.

Being stalked on a daily basis seems insignificant. 

Being at ease in a public setting? Perhaps in another life. 

So I just want to say that if they notice you and don't realise how uncomfortable it makes you, God send them to hell because I know that in India, if you stare them back, that's a signal.

 Ouch !!

Samantha Ruth Prabhu retaliated against her critics who mocked her clothing. On Saturday, the actress posted a long essay about how women are easily criticised based on their clothing choices.

We all have been in a spot where people judge us on the basis of what we wear
