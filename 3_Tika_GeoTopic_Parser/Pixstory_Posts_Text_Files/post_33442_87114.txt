Even as I do retain some faint memories of my first visit to the site which happened in early childhood days I have very fond memories of a visit with other school mates on an organised picnic trip in when I was in the th standard The place then had a substantial population of monkeys many of whom were quite mischievous being habitual snatchers of food items or other belongings carried by the visitors My parents too once had an adventure with these simians when during a visit a naughty one snatched away my mother s bag and actually teased her from the branches of the tree above before finally releasing it Our school group too had similar adventures with the teeming simian population as we offered prayers at the temple After the rituals it was time for a cricket match followed by lunch which was cooked right there Everyone then moved around the place and tried to explore whatever was visibly interesting while some collected either snail shells or flowers from the lake as a sort of remembrance I well remember that as the day ended the temple and adjoining mounds had left me very curious and I wanted to learn more about them and their antiquity since they seemed to have been quite important in the distant past However as I started enquiring from friends and relatives I soon realised that there was a complete dearth of information about the site and even such people who made repeated visits for ritualistic purposes did not have much knowledge Years passed on but the curiosity within my mind to know more about the history of the site kept increasing and still exists To be continued
