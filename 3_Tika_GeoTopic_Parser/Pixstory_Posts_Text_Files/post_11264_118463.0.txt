China’s hot foot soak and sleep-inducing fruit

1 Foot soak

If you like spa pedicures, give this one a try.

This nighttime custom has roots in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and it’s a great way to wind down, soothe your tired tootsies, and reap the benefits of a little hot water therapy.

All you need is a bathtub or small plastic basin. You can dress up your hot water with different soothing ingredients, like:

1 Epsom salt
2 skin-safe essential oils, like lavender and rose
3 fruit peels
4 herbs like mugwort

According to TCM, this can help reduce the amount of vital energy, or qi, in the mind.

“The warm temperature will help draw the qi down from the head, leaving you more relaxed,” says Debbie Kung, a TCM doctor and licensed acupuncturist. “It relaxes the limbic system and signals to your brain and body to relax, preparing it for sleep.”

2 Jujube fruit

The jujube fruit (suan zao ren) is used in TCM to calm the mind and emotions, encouraging a relaxed mood and deep, restful sleep.

“Jujube contains two chemicals, saponins and flavonoids, which suppress feelings of stress while also promoting relaxation,” says Jamie Bacharach, a TCM practitioner and licensed acupuncturist.
