I first visited the site of Deo Markandeya on the 30th of September, 2008. It lies in the Karakat Police Station area of Rohtas district in Bihar. The visit was inspired by a mention in the Shahabad District Gazetteer. The Gazetteer had mentioned about the visit of Buchanan to the site in1812-13 during his tours in the district. From a reading of the Gazetteer it was clear that the occupation of the site was quite ancient, and I was inspired to locate the present status of the ancient site.


After the first visit, I researched through several works in order to get more details about the site in the earlier times. The details from the documents referred by me are also being shared here for better appreciation. I referred to the Gazetteer of Shahabad (1924, 1966), the Journal of Francis Buchanan (1812-13), The Antiquarian Remains of Bihar (Dr. D R Patil, 1963), the ASI Reports Vol XVI (A. Cunningham and H.B.W. Garrick, 1880-81) and Vol XIX (H.B.W. Garrick, 1881-82).


Though I could not find any photographs of the earlier days, I could find a beautiful sketch as drawn by Garrick in 1881. The sketch drawn by Garrick below shows the site as it existed in 1881. The Photograph below was taken by me during the visit. The site plan was also found in the ASI Report of 1880-81.
