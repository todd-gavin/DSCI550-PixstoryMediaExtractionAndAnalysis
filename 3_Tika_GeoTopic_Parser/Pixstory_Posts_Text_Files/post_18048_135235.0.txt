Some legends never die.
The Sanderson Sisters are back in the first teaser trailer for Hocus Pocus 2, and they’re as child-hungry as ever.
The sequel to the classic Halloween movie reunites Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy as Winifred, Sarah and Mary Sanderson, respectively, and takes place 29 years after the original.
The teaser opens on a scene of three high school students played by Whitney Peak, Belissa Escobedo and Lilia Buckingham, who are discussing their plans for that night.
“Birthday ritual: scary movie marathon, same as every year,” Becca (Peak) tells Cassie (Buckingham), as clips play of Becca and Izzy (Escobedo) visiting a magic shop and reciting a ritualistic prayer — only to realize the chanting works, and the Black Flame Candle is officially lit.
The sequel hits Disney+ on Sept. 30. In the film, it's up to three high school students to stop the witches before dawn on All Hallow's Eve.
