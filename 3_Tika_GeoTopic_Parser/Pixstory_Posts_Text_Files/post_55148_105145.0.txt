You heard that right! Contrary to assumptions you can see snow in Australia!

Australia is known for its scorching heat, but visiting the Australian Alps in the winter will show you a different side of the country. Each year, roughly 35 inches of snow falls on these lofty peaks. You may experience the entire spectrum of snowy activities, including skiing, bobsledding, and snowboarding, if you visit during these dates. 

Fine dining, pub fare, and fireside socialising are just a few of the apr√®s ski activities available, as well as a variety of year-round activities. Horseback riding, trekking, mountain biking, and photography are all popular activities in the Australian Alps, which cover 13 nature areas.
