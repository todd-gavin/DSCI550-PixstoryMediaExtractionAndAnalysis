The trailer of the upcoming Game of Thrones prequel 'House of the Dragon' has arrived. It's full of politics, wars, action and offcourse, 'Dragons'.

The original Game of Thrones based on George RR Martin's high fantasy novels ' A Song of Ice & Fire' ended in 2019 with it's eighth and final season. It left most of the hardcore westerosi fans heartbreaken. The quality of the series plummeted over the final two seasons. A sudden ending to the story left behind a string of story arcs, waiting to be told. 

Long time fans were annoyed & regretful after investing for years in the epic drama. 

Now, HBO is ready to take us back to RR Martins high fantasy world of Westeros and beyond, filled with politics, drama, betrayal, gory violence and magic.

The trailer looks enticing, something which wasn't expected out of the new series. It will be a prequel to the story of GOT and will focus on house Targaryen and the politics within. This time the enemy won't be from across the sea or beyond the wall, it will be inside the house.

The story will be the scuffle between Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D'Arcy) and Prince Daemon Targaryen (Matt Smith) as they claim the 'Iron throne', succeeding King Viserys 1, former's father and later's older brother.

Now, whether this time HBO holds it till the end or will it become a mess on the road to it's conclusion, that we have to see. 

The show will premiere on Disney plus in India on 21st August.
