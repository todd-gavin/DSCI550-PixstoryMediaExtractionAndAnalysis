PGDAV college is one of the premiere institutes of Delhi University. 

We are guided by the vision of Swami Dayanand Saraswati where culture and discipline are given utmost importance. The title 'Anglo-Vedic' is an indicator to the fact that we are an active part of the global world while upholding and practicing all that is best from our own civilization. As we believe in following our traditions with utmost sincerity, college welcome students with a chandan tilak and a rose after every semester break to show the true indian culture to the students of pgdav college. The college grounds resound with the chants of the 'havan' hymns on important occasions.
