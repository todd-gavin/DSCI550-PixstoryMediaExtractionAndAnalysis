Plastic prevails, SUP ban fails.
Central Pollution Control Board issued a public notice dated 4 February 2022, notifying the ban on the manufacturing, sale, purchase and use of 19 Single Use Plastic(SUP)Â  commodities effective from 1 July 2022. 
The second quarter of this financial year has seen a nationwide ban on nineteen single-use plastic commodities. However, not only are these items reportedly still in circulation and distribution, especially in metro cities, but also the items covered in the list of banned commodities are questionable causing the single-use plastic ban to fail in India. 
Are the right items chosen to be banned?
Reports from India Spend and Scroll criticize the ban stating that the effect of the ban is minuscule and the implementation aggrieves the vulnerable segments of the industry. According to these reports, the share of the now-banned single-use plastic is as low as 2%-3% of the 3.5 million tonnes of plastic India generates. 
The nineteen items covered in the ban are earbuds with plastic sticks, plastic sticks for balloons, plastic flags, candy sticks, icecream sticks, polystyrene (thermocol) for decoration, plastic plates, cups, glasses, cutlery such as forks, spoons, knives; straws, trays, wrapping or packing film around sweet boxes, invitation cards, cigarette packets, plastic or PVC banners less than 100 microns, and stirrers. Experts have pointed out that the ban does not cover all single-use plastic items.
