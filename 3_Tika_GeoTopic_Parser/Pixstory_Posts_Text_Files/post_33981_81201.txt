With the success against Sampdoria, Milan flies to the top of the standings with points, overtaking Inter and Napoli in one fell swoop. A goal from Le o was enough for the three points. We were good at creating the right environment well absorbing the energy that the fans give us You have to give yourself a few breaks you can&#39;t always play at a thousand per hour and today we managed it well We could have closed it earlier but we completed a positive and important week In first half we contented ourselves with managing too much in the second half we pushed and didn&#39;t find the right conclusions Today I have to say that we left almost nothing to our opponents it means that growth is reaching a good definition There is a positive air with great confidence and conviction We know very well what could have happened with a different result in the derby We know that we can&#39;t give up anything also because for now we have only obtained two points more than last year We always try to improve our level
