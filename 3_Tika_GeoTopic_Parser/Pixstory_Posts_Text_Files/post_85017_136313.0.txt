Armando Broja has signed a new deal with Chelsea that will see him stay in the Premier
League until 2028.
Several sides like West Ham, Newcastle and Everton were interested in acquiring the services of the promising striker this transfer window. However, a conversation with manager Thomas Tuchel led Broja to change his mind and dedicate himself to the club for the long term.
Speaking to Chelsea's club channel after completing the deal, Broja said: "I’m lost for words
really just thinking about it. It’s the club I’ve dreamed of playing for my whole life, the club that I support and the club that I love. I’ve been here since I was a boy so it’s a surreal feeling for me and my family."
"To be able to put on the blue shirt with the first team is a dream come true. It's amazing every minute that you get to play on the pitch because this is one of the biggest clubs in the world.
The 20-year-old forward, who went to Southampton on loan last season, had an impactful campaign as he netted nine times in 38 games across all competitions. He has made three
appearances for the Blues so far this season, all coming as a substitute from the bench.
New owner Todd Boehly also expressed his joy after Broja's contract saying: "We are delighted Armando has committed to Chelsea. He is a young and exciting striker and a big part of our plans moving forward."
Chelsea will next lock horns with West Ham on Saturday (September 3) at Stamford Bridge. With Kai Havertz going through a rough patch, Broja might be handed a start this weekend.
Chelsea are currently ranked No.10 in the Premier League points table, with two victories in five games to their name.
