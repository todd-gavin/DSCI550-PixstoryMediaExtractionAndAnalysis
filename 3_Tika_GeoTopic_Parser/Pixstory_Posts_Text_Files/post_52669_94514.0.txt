They are not just metal balls strung together and worn around your ankels to look pretty, they are the rhythm for a performer, they give guidance to a performer, they are the expressions of a performer....they are a part of a performer. Even before it touches the ground, we bow to them and give our respect to our guide, our music, our partner......our ghungroo.
