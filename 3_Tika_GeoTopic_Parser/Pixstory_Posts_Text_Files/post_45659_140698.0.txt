The launch of Artemis I into space is scheduled to take place on either September 23 or September 27, according to NASA. 

News 18 reported that NASA's unmanned flight test, code-named Artemis I, will lay the groundwork for manned space travel while also showcasing the agency's commitment and capacity to take human habitation beyond the Moon and beyond. 

NASA attempted to launch Artemis I on September 3, but the launch was aborted when a liquid hydrogen leak was discovered. The Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket has a fuel leak that the crew is attempting to fix. 

Engineers are patching the leaky section even though the rocket is still on the launch pad. They have built an enclosure that resembles a tent around the the work area to protect the hardware and teams from environmental conditions.
