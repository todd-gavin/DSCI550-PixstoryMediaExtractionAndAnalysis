‌Corruption rules politics and one more is on the list as Representative Jeff Fortenberry was convicted on three felony charges that he was lying to federal authorities about having received an illegal campaign contribution from a foreign citizen according to New York Times. 
‌
‌According to the federal indictment in the case; he received a $30,000 bounty to his re-election campaign at a fund-raiser in 2016. Foreign citizens are restricted from donating to U.S. election campaigns.
‌
‌One of the prosecutors said to NY Times: "The lies, in this case, threatened the integrity of the American electoral system and were designed to prevent investigators from learning the true source of campaign funds,” this is a huge forgery.
‌
‌The charges came after prosecutors said Mr Fortenberry refuted knowing that the donation, that had been channelled through a middle-person, were from A Nigerian Gilbert Chagoury — even after the congressman told a cooperating witness, a fund-raiser referred to in court filings as Individual H, that the donation “probably did come from Gilbert Chagoury.”
‌
‌Meanwhile, Fortenberry told the reporters that he will appeal; he also told in the trial that the prosecutors realized that the congressman didn't know about the contribution, but directed an informant to feed him the information in a 10-minute call to try deliberately to prosecute him.
