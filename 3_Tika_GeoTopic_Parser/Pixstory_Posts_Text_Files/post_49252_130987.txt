St Buchard Church in Germany has been hosting a year performance based on avant garde composer John Cage s As Slow as Possible since September Cage is also the composer of a piece that comprises of four and a half minutes of complete rests or to put it another way silence The automated organ s performance is so slow that visitors must wait months for a chord change and it is slated to end in The performance is so slow that the organ on which it is performed was not even finished when the concert started In pipes were added to keep the music consistent So if you want to listen to the full piece you might actually have to wait more years for that
