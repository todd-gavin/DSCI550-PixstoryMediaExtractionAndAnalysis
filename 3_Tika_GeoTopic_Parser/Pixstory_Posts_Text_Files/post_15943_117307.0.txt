The effect of 12 weeks aerobic, resistance and combined trainings on peripheral vascular disease in type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy in men

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes is caused by more complications. One complication that occurs in some cases is peripheral vascular disease. Early diagnosis is very important to assess peripheral vascular disease.

Material and methods

44 men with type 2 diabetes were randomly divided into four groups of aerobic, resistance, combined and control. Intensity of aerobic exercise was 70–75 percent of maximum heart rate for 25–45 min, Resistance training consists of two to three sets with 8–12 repetitions and combined training consists of both aerobic and resistance training, three times a week for 12 weeks. Ankle brachial index (ABI) measurements and blood samples were analyzed before and after intervention. The collected data were analyzed using ANOVA.

Results

The resistance and combined training groups showed a significant increase in the left ABI compared to pretest (P 
Conclusions

The resistance training group was more effective than aerobic and combined training program in reduction the peripheral vascular disease.
