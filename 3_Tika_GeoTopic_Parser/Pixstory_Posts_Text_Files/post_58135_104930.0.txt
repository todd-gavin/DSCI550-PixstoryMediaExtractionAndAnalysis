Zero waste packaging essentially refers to a system of packaging where all materials are utilized, reused, or recycled, so there’s no waste product.

While any type of packaging is going to involve some kind of leftover component, there are innovative ways to make the process of packaging into a zero waste endeavor.

 Innovators are trying different things to achieve zero waste, from creating packaging that serves its own separate purpose (such as “plantable packaging”), to designing edible containers or nontoxic “films” that can protect items without any excess material.
