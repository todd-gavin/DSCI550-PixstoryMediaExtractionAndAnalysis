The students of Prime Academy School (ICSE), Andheri East, Mumbai, Maharashtra learnt composting where biodegradable waste from the school kitchen was used. Awareness was created about wasting less food during breaks by collecting the waste and measuring it on a daily basis. Students were also shown how to recycle trash, such as tetra paks, that are collected in specific bins situated on the school campus.
