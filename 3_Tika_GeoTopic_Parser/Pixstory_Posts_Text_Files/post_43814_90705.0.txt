Following the suggestion of Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick, referees might train with Premier League teams next season in order to enhance connections.

Concerns about the calibre of refereeing in the Premier League have been raised this season, and Rangnick has proposed a plan to improve the relationship between players and referees.

If the plan is approved, referees might be given access to Premier League clubs' facilities, while officials could referee training ground matches.
Rangnick's concept is now being reviewed by referee’s organisation PGMOL, according to the Mail, and may be implemented as early as next season.

Details are still being worked out, but it's expected that officials will be able to utilise club facilities and perhaps take charge of training-ground matches as part of an effort to improve their grasp of the role.

The need for dedicated VAR officials, who will undergo intense training following a number of disputes this season, was also highlighted at a summit between referee chief Mike Riley and Premier League managers.

There's also a desire to revisit the 'clear and evident' phrase, as well as the contentious practise of delayed offside flags.
Following calls for managers to be permitted to communicate with referees after games, the chance to speak with officials 30 minutes after the final whistle will be reinstated.
