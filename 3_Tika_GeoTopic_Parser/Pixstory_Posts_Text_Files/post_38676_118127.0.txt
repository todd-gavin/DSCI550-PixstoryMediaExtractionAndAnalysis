Martial Under Erik Ten Hag


After 3 goals in Pre-season in Thailand and Australia, the boss seems to have changed his mind and did a U-turn to stop the board from selling Martial. With Cristiano Ronaldo's uncertainty, Martial is expected to lead the attacking line-up. Plus, Martial is the senior most attacking figure in the squad. 


He seems to be rejuvenated by the change of leadership, and new signings, and it is a fresh chance to redeem himself.


He scored 3 goals this pre-season which he managed more than his last season(2). This season is a make and break for Anthony Martial. Will he show the world his old form when he made fans chant his name or will he be sold after another poor  season like last season? Only time will tell.
