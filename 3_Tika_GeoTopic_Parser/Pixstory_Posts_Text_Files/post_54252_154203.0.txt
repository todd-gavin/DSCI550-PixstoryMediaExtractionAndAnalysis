The flu seasons of 2020 and 2021 were mild, mostly thanks to measures people took against COVID, such as wearing masks, social distancing and using copious amounts of hand gel. 2022, however, looks like a whole different kettle of fish.The southern hemisphere – where flu season starts – has been hit hard. Australia, for example, has had the worst flu season in five years, and it has been hammered by COVID, too. This year has been the first real opportunity for both viruses to circulate freely as all COVID restrictions have now been lifted.It’s strongly advised that people in the UK get the flu vaccine and ensure they are up to date with their COVID vaccine boosters. Scientists aren’t sure how these viruses will dovetail, but evidence suggests that being infected with both viruses simultaneously greatly increases the risk of severe disease and death.About 33 million people in the UK are eligible for a free flu vaccine, including those aged 50 or older, pregnant women, people in residential care, and frontline healthcare workers. There is also a nasal-spray vaccine for children aged two years and older, with many vaccine rollouts delivered in schools.Great pressure on the NHSFlu usually has an “R number” between one and two, meaning that, on average, each infected person will infect one or two people. This level of flu transmission is significant.In the UK, across the winters of 2017-18 and 2018-19, there were 46,215 and 39,670 flu-related hospital admissions respectively. And, as of early September 2022, there were 590 daily hospital admissions with COVID, with those numbers on the rise.NHS trusts are usually under greater pressure during the winter. Yet already in the autumn, several health services report that their capacities are limited. Derriford Hospital in Plymouth had waits of up to 72 hours for admission from A&E, while the East of England Ambulance Service recently came close to declaring a “major incident”.Read more: https://theconversation.com/flu-is-set-for-a-big-comeback-now-covid-restrictions-are-lifted-heres-what-you-need-to-know-191520
