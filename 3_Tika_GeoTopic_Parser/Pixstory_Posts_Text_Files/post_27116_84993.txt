See Season Apple TV s second in line is Jason Mamoa s See While the cast may primarily sound unrecognisable watch out for the brilliance in their performances See is by far according to me Apple TV s biggest venture in terms of risk taking and colossal production The show follows a post apocalyptic world where a deadly virus has killed most of the humanity but for those who survived came out as blind and are now making a way into the world A dialogue from the series says that Some say sight was taken from them by god to heal the earth This may sound just like a social commentary about how humans have degraded the earth but it is much more than that There are elements in the series that get you hooked to the screen Even though the narrative could have been better the first season does justice to it s plot and the scope of it Jason Mamoa shines as Baba Voss with brilliant supporting performances from the cast The plot thickens over as the episodes progress and the season ends on a glorious note If you have a yearning to explore Apple TV s shows feel free to try out the first season of See
