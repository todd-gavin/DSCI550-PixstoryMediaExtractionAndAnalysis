Until now, no one had beaten both Nadal and Djokovic in the same tournament on red clay. This was done by the year-old Carlos Alcaraz who, as the icing on the cake, also beat Zverev third in the world in the final of the Masters tournament in Madrid An incredible triumph for a boy who seems he is already a veteran His complete tennis and personality in facing and beating tennis legends is not lacking in Nel he has already won two Masters and two Masters earning the sixth position in the ATP standings In short, these are champion numbers The Madrid tournament tired him a lot and so he has decided that he will skip the Internationals of Italy to concentrate on Roland Garros the most famous tournament on red clay and the one in which the Spanish legend Nadal has won times Moreover there is a similarity between the two on his first participation in Nadal he got there by winning two Masters and two exactly like Alcaraz but unlike him he was already first in the world If Alcaraz will certainly be among the favorites in Paris there will be a Djokovic in much better shape than in Madrid given that he will have more matches on his legs which he has been missing until today having missed several tournaments for not getting vaccinated
