At the time of writing there is just hours until the transfer window slams shut pm London times marks the end of a long summer of transfers that has seen Arsenal sign players The signings we have made so far are all very logical from the outside and I ll explore this in more detail in a transfer review blog but there is still work to be done With Thomas Partey and Mohammed Elneny both out Arsenal have been somewhat forced into exploring options for defensive midfield Where the priority was in the role and the right wing it is now clear that Arsenal want a new number and several targets have emerged Arteta confirmed Arsenal s plans to sign a new number in his post match interview last night We are a bit short in that position midfield we are looking at options in the market If the right player is available and we can do it we will try The main target that has emerged this morning is ironically the player who scored against us yesterday Aston Villa s Douglas Luiz is our deadline day priority and a bid of million has been submitted according to Sami Mokbel The player wants the move and he s pushing for it according to Fabrizio Romano I ve seen a lot of criticism on social media regarding the rumours potentially because it s not a flashy signing but it makes perfect sense for me Premier League experience only good engine can pass well and more Little downside and a lot of upside Aside from Luiz it looks like Arsenal will be fairly quiet on deadline day Despite wanting a Bukayo Saka understudy all summer there are no firm links to anyone at the moment This is disappointing especially with the heavy fixture run coming up Hector Bellerin is close to a move to Barcelona and Ainsley Maitland Niles is on his way to Southampton Let s hope for a couple surprises from Edu today eh
