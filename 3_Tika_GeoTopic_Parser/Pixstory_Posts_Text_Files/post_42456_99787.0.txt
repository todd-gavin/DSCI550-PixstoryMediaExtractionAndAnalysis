Today when Real Madrid will face Levante at the Santiago Bernabeu, one thing Carlo Ancelotti (Manager of Real Madrid) will focus on to bringing the senior players back in rhythm because Carlo Ancelotti used a young team against Atletico Madrid and faced a loss.

Real Madrid’s main motive is to win the Champions League final on 28th May against Liverpool and to keep players motivated, Manager will field the best playing 11 today and hope that team will win the match by big margin.

According to the press conference, Benzema, Vinicius, Modric, Valverde, and Rodrygo will play today’s match and will help the team to secure 3 more points.

As a Real Madrid fan, I want my team to win the match and keep a clean sheet as well because conceding a goal against Levante will be unacceptable.

Let’s hope for a good match and may the best team win.
