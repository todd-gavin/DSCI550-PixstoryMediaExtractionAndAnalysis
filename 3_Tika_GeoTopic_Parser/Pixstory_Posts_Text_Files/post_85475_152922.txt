My reactionMikel Arteta gives starts to Granit Xhaka and Martinelli with Vieira Marquinhos and Nketiah completing the front line Reiss Nelson is on the bench so he ll be expected to come on during the second half Ramsdale gets a rest meaning Matt Turner gets another start in the UEL Excited to see how Marquinhos gets on who scored and set one goal up against Zurich Mikel Arteta will aim get a victory wrapped up early so he can rotate the players around Score predictions
