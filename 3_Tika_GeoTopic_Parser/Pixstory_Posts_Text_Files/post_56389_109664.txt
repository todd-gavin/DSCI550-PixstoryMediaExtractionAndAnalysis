What kind of trauma has the women of America had to endure despite the already misogynistic society have showered upon us for years Taking our human rights away and protecting gun rights Women Trans men and gender non conforming persons need access to abortion and this is mandatory Those who don t have a uterus should fight for the choice of others as it s a give and takes It feels violated when somebody else s has the right to decide over your body To pro groups do you care about a fetus more than the human flesh and blood in front of you It s hard to believe and does the ones who make the law will look after the children born forcefully Forcing things upon humans isn t the right form of democracy Don t ever even think of putting it on the population as many women wish to have babies at the right time by varying methods and many women don t Coming to religions I don t know when did they stand for women and I don t think dragging religion into this issue of basic human rights is feasible We are humans and we needn t beg anyone for our rights America is practically forcing women to have babies and forcing them to pay unaffordable bills at the same time not letting you have time off birthing and looking after children What is the name of progress is America up to Recent laws and rulings are going against lgbtqia community and yeah right we can t talk about our identity it promotes racism
