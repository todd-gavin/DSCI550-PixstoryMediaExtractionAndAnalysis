 Alberto Aquilani Alberto Aquilani s Liverpool career in retrospect was a microcosm of the club during their banter years when the Reds had their worst run of form in recent memory Aquilani arrived at Anfield in with some promise and was anticipated to take over from Xabi Alonso who had left the club Not only did he embarrassingly fail to fill the Spaniard s shoes but his performances frequently disappointed the Anfield crowd In the Italian was sold to Fiorentina for just after three years and no notable performances Sean Dundee Sean Dundee is ranked fourth on this list due to his transfer cost which was still reasonably significant in and his brief one year stay Otherwise he may have easily been in the top two Don t worry if you don t remember Dundee from Liverpool His time there was as forgettable as Liverpool s season a memory that the Reds have decided to forget Dundee was signed as a replacement for Robbie Fowler who was injured although he had a smaller influence than Fowler would have had with one foot Dundee only played five times for Liverpool and did nothing noteworthy during that time due to fitness and confidence concerns Christian Benteke Liverpool didn t require a target man at the time They needed a more fluid striker who could generate opportunities for his teammates and move around the field easily Benteke was none of those things and he would never fit into Jurgen Klopp s system which he had taken over from Brendan Rodgers in the middle of the season Klopp decided that the Belgian international was no longer needed after goals in games and he was sold off A pricey experiment that failed miserably
