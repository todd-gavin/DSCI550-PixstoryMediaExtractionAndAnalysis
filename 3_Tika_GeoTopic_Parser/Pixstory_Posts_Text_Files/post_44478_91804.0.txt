On Sunday evening, the 70-year-old made the admission while promoting a new documentary
about his life on the Dutch television show Humberto.

Van Gaal said of his players: "They don't know. They see a blush on my cheeks and think, 'what
a healthy (person) that is'. That is of course not the case."

He added: "I've been through a lot with illnesses, including with my own wife. So that's just part
of life.

"(I) as a human being have probably become richer because of all those experiences. I thought
that should also be in the film."

Van Gaal was named manager of the Netherlands for the third time in August 2021, after
leading them to a third-place finish at the 2014 World Cup.

He took over from Frank de Boer after the Dutch were eliminated in the last-16 at Euro 2020,
and he will now manage his team at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar later this year. They were
drawn in Group A of the tournament, which begins in November, alongside hosts Qatar, Africa
Cup of Nations champions Senegal, and Ecuador.

Van Gaal was the manager of Manchester United from 2014 until 2016, before returning to the
Netherlands. Despite leading them to FA Cup victory in the final game of his tenure, he was
fired by the club and replaced by Jose Mourinho.

United posted a message of support on their Twitter feed that said: "Everybody at Manchester
United is fully behind our former manager, Louis van Gaal, in his battle against cancer. Sending
you strength and courage, Louis."

Van Gaal has previously won league titles with Ajax, Barcelona, AZ Alkmaar, and Bayern
Munich. He also led Ajax to Champions League victory in 1995.
