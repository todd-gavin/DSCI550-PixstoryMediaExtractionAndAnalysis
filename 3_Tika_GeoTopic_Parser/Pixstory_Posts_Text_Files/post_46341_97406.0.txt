When I say it’s "hair-mask day" I automatically believe it’s a long self care day , and self care can be many things but rushed.🧡

Hair masks are my best friend when it comes to nourishing dry ends and damage repair ! 💇

But , do we really know how to use them ? Let me tell you the dos and don’ts of hair masks :

*Do's* ✅
1 Do apply it on damp scalp for better absorpy .
2 Do Cover your hair with a shower cap for deeper penetrations .
3 Do comb the hair before applying the mask and not after .
4 choose a hair mask that is right for your hair type.
5 Leave your hair mask for 15-30 minutes.

*Don'ts* ❌
1 Don't wash it off with hot water , use Lukewarm water .
2 Don't Forget to gently Massage while washing off .
3 Don't comb the hair after Application .
4 Don’t: leave your hair mask on overnight.
5 Don’t: Use it everyday

Before, while & after applying a hair mask, there are some common mistakes we all do and some important steps we miss ✨

I'm very much protective when it comes to my hair ! I never allow any Random person to touch my hair ! I comb them myself only ! Earlier i was too not knowing about These Do's and don'ts ! But then i got to know about them ! And trust me , it helped me alot !
Now , i always wash my hair with lukewarm water ! I cover my hair with shower cap . I never apply hair mask overnight ! and I'm satisfied with the results ✨✅

Tell me in notes which one of these you didn’t know ? 🤔
