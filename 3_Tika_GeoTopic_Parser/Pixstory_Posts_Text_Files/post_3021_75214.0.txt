Who betrayed Anne Frank to Nazis? A team of sleuths headed by a former FBI agent has attempted to answer it; a new book details their six-year-long investigation. But historians are not impressed, saying there’s no new direct evidence.

Teenaged Anne Frank’s journal during the dark years of Fascism was compiled into ‘The Diary of a Young Girl’. Translated into 70 languages, it has reached over thirty million readers. 

In Amsterdam, her family and four other people hid in an attic, concealed behind a bookcase, for about two years to protect themselves from persecution. A police raid on August 4, 1944 found them. Anne was taken to Auschwitz and later to the Bergen-Belsen camp. She and her elder sister died there in 1945, barely months ahead of the end of the war. 

How did the Nazis found them? In spite of a lot of research, the question has not been answered conclusively.

Retired FBI agent Vincent Pankoke and a team of investigators pored over tens of thousands of pages of documents and interviewed scores of descendants of people familiar with the Franks. Utilizing methods developed by the FBI, the ‘Cold Case Team’ painstakingly pieced together the months leading to the Franks’ arrest.

Their conclusion: The most likely scenario was that Arnold van den Bergh, a Jewish notary, tipped off authorities. Unfortunately, they don’t have direct evident, but they believe van den Bergh could have known who was hiding where (he worked with the city’s Jewish Council). He might have tipped off Nazis to protect his own family.

Sullivan told The Washington Post that it was “likely” that van den Bergh was the “informant,” adding that we shouldn’t judge him too harshly. He too was a “victim”: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/01/18/anne-frank-betrayed-investigation/ 

The historian community is unanimous in criticism. “The evidence is far too thin to accuse someone. This is an enormous accusation that they made using a load of assumptions, but it’s really based on nothing more than a snippet of information,” said Emile Schrijver, the director of Amsterdam’s Jewish Cultural Quarter: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/18/books/anne-frank-betrayal-arnold-van-den-bergh.html
