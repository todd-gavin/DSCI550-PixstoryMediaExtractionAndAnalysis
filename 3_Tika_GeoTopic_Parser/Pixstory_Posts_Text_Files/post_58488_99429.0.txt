Kerala is a so-called progressive space. There has been a decades-long struggle in the queer movement and the numerous changes that the trans policy has made, have been beneficial. 

But it comes with gaps that are impacting nonbinary people, and it's important to think about how intersectionality works over here. 

I am from the North Kerala, and I am Muslim, so when I go to a health practitioner who's Muslim, I am faced with different kinds of discrimination: I'm not accepted by men, I can't talk to a man. Even women doctors have a problem with touching or looking at someone who looks like a 'man.' So these intersectionalities of religion and caste also comes into play.

In current healthcare systems, chosen families and friends are not considered official or legitimate, which puts us at risk in emergency situations, exacerbating inaccessibility while cutting of resources.

Anannyah Kumari Alex, a trans radio jockey in Kerala, died by suicide because of medical negligence. This institutional murder was a huge, and still is a huge loss for all of us.

There is a lack of fact-finding practice, and this has to be addressed in the larger scheme of things when it comes to these kinds of murders. We need the concept of psychological autopsy, where we have to look at how important mental health is, and how one comes to a stage where there doesn't seem to be any other possible route.
