The country's strife has rendered the rest of the campaign unusable.

Due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Premier League has been halted for the
remainder of the 2021-22 season.

On Tuesday, a video conference was used to hold a general meeting of the teams in the
Ukrainian top flight.

The season had been put on hold since December due to the winter vacation, which was meant
to expire in February but was postponed due to the ongoing violence.

The Ukrainian Premier League issued the following statement: "The Ukrainian Premier League's
football teams backed the request to cancel the VBET League's 2021/22 season, citing the
championship's inability to be finished due to Ukraine's prolongation of martial law.

The standings on February 24, 2022, will be the final rankings for the 2021/22 season, with no
winners.

"The Executive Committee of the Ukrainian Association of Football was asked to approve the
related decision."

FC Shakhtar Donetsk led the standings with 47 points until the season was called off due to the
winter break. Dynamo Kyiv was second with 45 points, while Dnipro-1 and Zorya Luhansk were
third and fourth, respectively. Prior to the league's start in February, Russia invaded Ukraine,
prompting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to declare martial law.

Zelensky has now
prolonged martial law, making it nearly impossible to resume the UPL.

In addition to terminating the campaign, "a working group was formed to analyse the questions
surrounding the present operations of the Ukrainian Premier League and the start of the next
season," the UPL said.

In addition, at the UPL General Meeting, a working committee was formed to look into the
issues surrounding the Ukrainian Premier League's present activities and the start of the next
season. The UPL clubs backed UAF President Andrii Pavelko's idea of having a face-to-face
meeting to discuss the concerns that the working group would address, "added the statement.
