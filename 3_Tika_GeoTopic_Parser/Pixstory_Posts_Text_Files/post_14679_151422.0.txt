Allergy prevention in children is an active area of research. Findings to date indicate that:
ðŸ‘‰Prenatal â€“ there is no conclusive evidence that avoiding allergens in pregnancy will help prevent allergies in your child.
ðŸ‘‰Postnatal â€“ exclusive breastfeeding during the first four to six months appears to protect against the development of allergies in early childhood.
ðŸ‘‰Introducing solid foods (including those considered to be allergenic) around six months (but not before four months) is recommended, preferably while continuing to breastfeed
breastfeeding â€“ avoidance of a food (including foods considered to be highly allergenic) by a woman while breastfeeding is not recommended
ðŸ‘‰Soymilk formula â€“ studies have shown that using soymilk formula does not prevent the development of allergies in children.
ðŸ‘‰Partially hydrolysed cowâ€™s milk-based formula (commonly referred to as HA formula) is not recommended to prevent the development of food allergy.
