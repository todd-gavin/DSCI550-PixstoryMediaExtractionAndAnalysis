Amarnath yatra remained suspended for the second consecutive day on Sunday, as rescue operation was going on near the Cave Shrine to locate the missing persons.

About 3000 pilgrims were waiting at Baltal camp, awaiting official orders to move towards the cave shrine for Darshan as the yatra temporarily remained suspended for the second consecutive day today from both sides.

More than 1.13 lakh pilgrims had darshan at the holy cave shrine of Amarnath till Friday, officials said.

A huge cloud burst near the Cave Shrine of Amarnath on Friday evening, triggering flash floods, which washed away many tents of pilgrims and community langers, leaving at least 16 people dead and 35 injured, besides several missing.

A massive joint operation by Jammu and Kashmir Police, Army, CRPF, NDRF and other agencies was underway near the Cave shrine to remove the debris and locate the bodies of missing persons if any.
