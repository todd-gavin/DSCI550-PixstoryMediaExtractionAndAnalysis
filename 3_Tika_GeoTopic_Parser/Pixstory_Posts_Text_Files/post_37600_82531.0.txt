West Indies won the toss and opted to bowl first at Eden Gardens, Kolkata.
Indian openers could not do so well but India had Virat Kohli who is known for his calm and composed batting under pressure and stepped up and steadied the ship brilliantly. Kohli scored a half century (52 off 41 balls). The match was set for a low total but Rishab Pant and Venkatesh Iyer had other plans. Rishab Pant smashed a quick half century, 52 off just 28 balls and Venkatesh Iyer scored 33 off 18 balls both played at a strike rate of over 180+.

It was time for West Indies to chase a big total of 187. The Indies openers tried building a solid foundation but were not a match for the Indian spinners yet again as Chahal and Bishnoi got both the openers out early on. 

Indian fans expected a easy victory after this but West Indies power hitters Nicholas Pooran and Rovman Powell were ready to break the hopes of the Indian fans. Both of them started in their usual power hitting ways as Pooran scored 62 off 41 balls. 
When West Indies needed 24 off just 5 balls most Indian fans thought this was a clear and easy victory. Powell on the other hand had other plans, he hit Harshal Patel for 2 back to back sixes, it reminded everyone of Carlos Braithwaite hitting 4 back to back sixes at the same venue in the final over to help West Indies clinch the t20 world cup.
Harshal Patel may have scared every Indian fan but came in clutch in the last two balls conceding only 2 runs but pretty sure that didn't stop everyone from biting half of their fingernails off.
