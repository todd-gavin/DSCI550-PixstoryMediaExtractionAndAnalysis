Legislators from four states are voting to pick 16 Rajya Sabha members, while party leaders keep a close eye on the proceedings. With more candidates than seats up for election in Haryana, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, the high-stakes campaign for the Upper House has gained urgency. The polls opened at 9 a.m. and will close at 4 p.m. At 5 p.m., the votes will be counted. 

Elections for 57 Rajya Sabha seats were just announced. Last Friday, all 41 candidates were declared unopposed in Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Telangana, Jharkhand, and Uttarakhand. 

The most tense battles are taking place in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan, and Haryana, where political parties have dispatched their legislators to resorts to avoid poaching.
