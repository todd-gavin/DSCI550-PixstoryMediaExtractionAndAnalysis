This was an amazing read by Greer Rivers yet again I think all the books in her Conviction Series are masterpiece in their genre In Healing Conviction Rivers rather have Nora and Drake fight through their traumas and their deeply emotionally draining pasts to actually embrace their love for each other Overly protective and possessive Draco is certainly the man for the good hearted endearing Nora who hides her pain and self doubts under her sass and humor He feels an intense need to climb behind the protective walls of Nora to embrace her in his arms forever The dirty talking and the spicy bantering between the couple lead to smoking hot chemistry that made me swoon all day One of the best parts of the book is that the Healing Conviction is not just a dramatic love story It has a great sub plot and several intense action scenes that keep your heart racing and mind guessing A definite one click for me
