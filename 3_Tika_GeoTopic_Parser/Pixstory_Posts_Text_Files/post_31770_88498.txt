The Gargano also known as the spur of the boot of Italy, the only mountainous system of a certain importance for Puglia, occupied almost entirely by a mountainous mass with large lands ending in steep escarpments that are lost with hills or slope down towards the sea. The Gargano promontory that juts out in the Adriatic for a length of about km and for a width of km it joins the peninsula along the banks of the Candelaro stream which separates it from the Tavoliere plain It is almost entirely occupied by a compact mountain mass which is completely independent from the Apennines the geological formation made up of stratiform calcareous masses of the Cretaceous and Eocene periods with different phases of uplift and erosion to which correspond the large rather undulating terrains and terminated at the edges by steep escarpments. To the north these escarpments are lost with easy hills around the lakes of Lsina and Varano o they degrade to the sea on a slight slope between Rodi and Peschici Instead on the south-eastern side they descend steeply and jaggedly and towards the Tavoliere they descend steeply and imperviously The geological nature of the typically karstic Gargano has caused widespread erosion phenomena everywhere it is superficially with imposing and very interesting landscape aspects both in depth, giving rise to sub-horizontal caves, chasms, sinkholes, basins, etc. To mitigate the harshness of the mountain there are the fertile and millenary woods which today, despite the deforestation, manage to preserve the sumptuousness of the past. Among the wooded areas we recall the Umbrian state forest which counts presence of the beech, the Turkey oak, the oak, the pine, the holm oak, etc. Where the land has remained devoid of woods, there are areas affected by the typical Mediterranean scrub and pastures, while cereal cultivation is limited to the basins and some plateaus Source city to discover Touring club italiano
