I’ve loved Delhi more than any other city in India, for as long as I can remember. I’ve lived in different cities of India but Delhi takes the crown. The rich history of the city and the amalgamation of all cultures it hosts is what makes it so endearing to me. Even to enjoy this aspect of my city, I’ve always used some vehicle, car, bus or scooter. It wasn’t until recently that I started walking to get to places.If I could change something about Delhi then it would be the roads and sidewalks. There are so many roads here beside which there’s no sidewalk making it dangerous to walk with incoming traffic. Even if there is one, it’s most likely to be filled with homeless people sleeping or dirty with garbage. There are also times when there’s a small park beside the same which has been turned into a dumping ground turning the area into a breeding ground for diseases. Apart from this, it is also necessary to install street lights and surveillance cameras for overall security purposes. I’m not saying that this is the case everywhere in Delhi. The current Delhi Government has worked tremendously in ensuring better road facilities around the city but there’s always scope for more especially in the form of further maintenance and probably educating citizens not to pollute communal spaces.
