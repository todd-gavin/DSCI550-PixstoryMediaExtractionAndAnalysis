 ALTERNATIVES ARE ALWAYS AN OPTION Irony prevails as much as BJP continues in many states change AAP has brought in Punjab shows the possibility of alternatives Fed up with both national parties some states are ready to try something new Moreover the state of affairs in the Congress Party and the decline of the Akali Dal base gave voters all the more motive to opt for a credible alternative Does COSMETIC and LAST MINUTE CHANGES work in Politics Seems like people observe the parties from day one and the amendments made last minute might not come in favour In the case of Congress even though changing Amarinder Singh could have worked because populism might have been a good idea in Punjab the delayed tactics didn t favour anyone but caused more infighting in Punjab DOES IDEOLOGY MATTER Welcome to the politics here Ideology is a mere framework for the game to initiate In a closer look we can understand parties have no consistency in their ideology but always paraphrases the political tactics The needs are same for a state hence the propaganda of different parties seems to resemble despite their ideology After all it s a game of politics
