Sampdoria coach Marco Giampaolo on the microphones of Dazn analyzes the victory against Venice which allows the blucerchiati to push away the hottest area of the standings It was a direct match, points are worth double We had to be happy to play this match either us or they brutally dictated We he could have given oxygen so as not to arrive short of breath at the end It&#39;s still tough we have to fight but it gives us a good push If we had lost it we would be talking about something else They follow me on a daily basis they work well There isn&#39;t a player who bothers me They are good they work well I don&#39;t have than to complain Then the matches can be lost if I get angry because they can do more because the resources in the squad are many
