A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies The man who never reads lives only one George H Martin Ever since I have fallen in love with stories way back I have had this weird habit of associating places moments and memories of my friends lovers turned strangers acquaintances with the characters quotes and stories they remind me of Is that strange maybe not because a part of them coincides with the fictional world would still exist if they are gone You know sometimes we are what we read and we seek solutions in the stories maybe we look for hope in these or do we lock our favourite memories in these stories that somehow draws a line in our lives between the past and the present Do we seek to live the same joy and happiness that we did when we lived those moments while we read them as stories do these stories make us live what we have never seen with our eyes but rather felt with our fragile hearts or do we simply treasure love loss and pain with the fictional characters Tara is seen reading the book Catch when she meets Ved back in Delhi after years While his life is caught between wanting to be what he wanted to and what he was then a well behaved product manager and a storyteller the catch here were for Tara as well because she was baffled between letting go and holding on While Kaira in Dear Zindagi is seen reading No Easy Day maybe fascinated by the title that how her life is hollow and more apparently lifeless for all she does to keep her alive is to breathe Aisha is seen delighted holding a book by Rabindranath Tagore perhaps a reflection that she grew up reading the same as a kid and now wishes to be a writer just like his idol To the dreamer in her she is pondering over the unexplainable inquisitiveness which that book holds Who are we living in this world without stories The storyteller or the characters living the story
