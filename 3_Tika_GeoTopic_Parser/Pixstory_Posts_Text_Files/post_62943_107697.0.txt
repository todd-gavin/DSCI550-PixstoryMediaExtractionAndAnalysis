See who doesn't like rabbits? Those little jumpy creatures would have anyone's heart jump in joy. And if you're one of those people, I have something for you. You will definitely want to visit Okunoshima in Japan once before you die.

Known as Rabit's Island, it might just be one of the most adorable places in the world. You may ask, why? Or duh, maybe you already figured it out, this island is full of rabbits just roaming around free and friendly. Like, there are tons of them! But, how did they come there?

Well there are several theories. One is just a sad one, rounding World War II. It's said they were brought here to be tested on for the poisonous gases used in the war as weapon. Other is that in 1971, a group of schoolchildren may have freed about eight bunnies. With no predators to worry about—cats and dogs are prohibited, as is hunting—these fast-breeding mammals may have increased to their current number of over 1,000.

Well, whatever be the reason for it, it's certain that you will have a once in a lifetime experience with these little animals here on this Island.
