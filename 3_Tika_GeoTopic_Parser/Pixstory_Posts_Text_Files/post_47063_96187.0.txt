The 27-year-old is back in training ahead of Saturday's Champions League match against 
Wolfsburg at a sold-out Camp Nou.

Asisat Oshoala, a striker for Barcelona Femeni, has returned to action following a knee injury 
suffered in February 2022.

The 27-year-old was injured in training while preparing for Nigeria's Super Falcons' Africa 
Women's Cup of Nations qualification match against Ivory Coast.

The Spanish club shared a photo of Oshoala in training on social media, confirming that she has been allowed to participate in the team's next match.

Part of the statement said, "There was wonderful news to hear since all of Claudia Pina, Mariona Caldentey, Patri Guijarro, and Asisat [Oshoala] have been granted the medical go-ahead to participate in tomorrow's [Saturday] game."

The Super Falcons, in the meantime, have greeted the player with a statement on their social media platforms that reads, "@Asisat Oshoala, welcome back."

The return of Oshoala is welcome news for Barcelona, who are gearing up for their Uefa 
Champions League semi-final first leg match against Wolfsburg on Saturday at a sold-out Camp Nou.

Oshoala has played in the great majority of the club's Primera Division games this season, 
making 26 appearances and clocking 1,607 minutes. In the 34 games she has appeared in, she has been named to the starting XI 18 times and has come in as a substitute eight times.

Oshoala last played in the league on June 24 against Sporting de Huelva for Barcelona. In the encounter, the Nigerian star scored in a 5-0 win for her team. This season, the attacker has 18 Premier League goals, which is tied for third most in the competition in the 2020â€“21 season.

In a 6-0 victory over Sporting de Huelva on October 18, Oshoala scored for the first time in the league this season. Oshoala made 19 league appearances for Barcelona last season, scoring 20 goals and adding one assist.
