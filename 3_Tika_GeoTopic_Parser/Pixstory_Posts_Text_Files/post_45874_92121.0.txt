I have always believed in the principle of ‘Art for Art’s Sake’. It essentially means that the chief or only aim of a work of art is the self-expression of the individual artist who creates it. But unfortunately, not everyone believes in this. 

For example, let’s talk about JK Rowling. She is the celebrated author of the infamous Harry Potter series. Her craft has been appreciated for generations and she is even considered a prodigy. 
However, in the recent times, she has made some transphobic comments which have not gone down well with the community. Despite repeatedly being told how damaging her mindset is to the community and how it violates the human rights of trans people, she has refused to change her stance.

As a result of this, many people called for the boycott of Harry Potter books. She was also included in the Harry Potter reunion for the same reason, as speculated. 

In my opinion, this is completely unfair. I am not talking about whether her views on the trans community are right or not, I am talking about how we should separate the art from the artist. 
Rowling maybe a transphobic but no one can deny that the masterpiece she created with Harry Potter is among the finest pieces of literature. Her political opinions do not take away her talent as a writer. 

Yes, there can and should be a healthy debate about the matter but calling for the books to be boycotted is nothing but an exercise in the repression of free speech. If we go about boycotting every piece of art just because we don’t support certain opinions of the artist, we will soon be left with nothing.
