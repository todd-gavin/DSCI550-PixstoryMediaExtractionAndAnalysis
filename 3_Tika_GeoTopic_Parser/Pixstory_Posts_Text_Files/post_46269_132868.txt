I have seen lots of indian families Saying that Spending money on girls education is waste of money Let s save it for her marriage And the worst part Some of these families are well educated Shame on them It is depressing that some communities still differentiate against the education of the girl or woman Across the world education is viewed as a necessity yet millions of women remain illiterate Education is a human right accessible to all genders or sexes Education is the key factor for girl s empowerment prosperity development and welfare But there are continuous inequalities in the sector of education for girls In villages people don t want there daughters or wives to get education and if you ask them why They will give you there own reasons For young girls in villages education is a luxury nbsp But most of them are forced to discontinue their studies And when they discontinue their studies all they do is help there family in earning money or Get married So what if she belongs to village So what if she is married So what if she is a mother of kids So what if she is years old She deserves Education It s her right let me tell you one thing If you really want to learn then nothing can stop you People should understand that Uneducated women cannot contribute to family management and fail to take care of children This is not only the responsibility of the government but also the responsibility of the people around us to spread awareness They say Educate her because it s her right Just her right No Educate her because she is beautiful and resilient Educate her because she can take her own decisions and stand up for herself Educate her Without having any reason associated with it EDUCATE EVERY WOMAN AND GIRL
