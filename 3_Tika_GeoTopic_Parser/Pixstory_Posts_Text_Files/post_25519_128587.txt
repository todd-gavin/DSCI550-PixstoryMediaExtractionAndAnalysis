There were a lot of issues with how Vince McMahon decided to run WWE but one of the big ones a truly baffling problem that never should have been one was the complete lack of synergy between the main roster and NXT Dexter Lumis was in the midst of a storyline with Indi Hartwell when he was fired by the company earlier this year The two were a couple and his abrupt dismissal led to a big change for Hartwell who also lost her on screen tag team partner at the time Lumis recently returned to the company but did so on the main roster In the past this would have been ignored completely Now they bothered to do the above backstage segment acknowledging the story they were previously telling Indi received a letter from Dexter that she was reading on the NXT weekly program It s a small thing but the details sometimes make all the difference
