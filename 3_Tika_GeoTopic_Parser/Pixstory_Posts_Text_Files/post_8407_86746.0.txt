There are boats, and then there are coracles. In Hampi, the favourite mode of crossing the Tungabhadra is the humble coracle.

Since the existence of the Vijaynagara Empire, Coracles have been a mode of transportation across the Tungabhadra. Around 500 years ago, Domingos Paes, a Portuguese traveller, who had once visited Hampi, had written about unique round basket-boats that the locals used to cross the Tungabhadra river.

This round-shaped boat (it looks like one-half of a hollow coconut) can be leased for a trip to the tiny hamlet of Anegundi. 

If you happen to go after the rains, crossing the mighty Tungabhadra can be exhilarating. But for the most part, the river is a shallow ford and the coracle moves with some effort. 

Once afloat, the time comes to a standstill. And you see life as it must have subsisted in Hampi centuries ago. The self-imposed time travel has its shortcomings — crouching in the boat and holding on to its side, as it jerks and stumbles over rocks, takes some skill. 

Fortunately, it’s a short ride to Anegundi where you can explore an ancient fort and the Anjaneya Hill, believed to be the birthplace of Lord Hanuman. 

In its heyday, it was one of the outposts of Hampi. It indeed is a must-visit place if you happen to visit Hampi, rides can be arranged for a meagre Rs. 50 or around that price and for that, you'll have one of the most definitive experiences of your lifetime.

PS: With the flawless Tungabadra and a swirling coracle ride, Hampi is more than just history!!
