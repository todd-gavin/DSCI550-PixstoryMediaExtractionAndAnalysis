I think we can agree with that, although Catwoman and Spiderman are from different comic universes, we still have the Black Cat who definitely shows Spiderman a few new moves. If I had to choose between having a spider hanging off my wall or a cat, I'm definitely going with the cat. The cat can spend the whole day there stating right at me, but I don't want a spider, no thank youðŸ˜‚
Though I suppose we won't mind Spiderman or Catwoman or Black CatðŸ¤­ðŸ˜‚
