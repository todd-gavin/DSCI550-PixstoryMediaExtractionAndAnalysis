Mike Shouhed's legal problems are still ongoing.
According to legal records acquired by E! News, the Shahs of Sunset alum is now facing 14 criminal counts, including domestic assault. The accusations, which were filed on July 20, came about four months after he was detained and jailed on an unidentified criminal allegation.

Alex Kessel, Shouhed's attorney, refuted charges of domestic violence following the reality star's arrest on March 27. "At this moment, the only comment I can make with certainty is my client in no way committed any act of domestic violence, and the truth will triumph," he stated in an April 4 statement to E! News.

The identity of Shouhed's accused victim is unknown, however on July 26, Paulina Ben-lawyer, Cohen's Joshua Ritter, provided a statement to E! News in reaction to the most recent information in the case. Paulina's main concern is keeping herself and her kids safe, according to Ritter. She continues to cooperate with them and supports the work that the police and city attorney's office have done, while also looking forward to putting this tragic incident behind her and moving on with her life.

Shouhed is currently charged with many offences in addition to domestic abuse. These include, among other things, keeping a weapon in a criminally improper location and intimidating a witness or victim.

Shouhed was initially presented to Shahs of Sunset viewers in the first season of the Bravo series. He continued to appear in the programme as a regular character through season nine, which was the final season to run before the show was put on "indefinite hiatus," as a source told E! News on April 7.
