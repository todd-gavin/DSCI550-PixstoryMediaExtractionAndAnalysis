The same event has been cancelled two weeks after former first lady Melania Trump slammed claims that a charity supposed to benefit from her participation at an April fundraising event was not registered with Florida authorities as "inaccurate, deceptive, and outright false." 

According to the New York Times, the "Tulips & Topiaries" event she advertised in January has been cancelled when Florida regulators discovered that Whip Fundraising, the company she hired to help solicit funds, had not registered with authorities as required by state law.

The company was neither "registered as a professional solicitor or a fund-raising consultant," according to Erin Moffet, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. She went on to say that any cash received for the April event will be sent to GenJustice, a duly registered Florida charity, and that the state's inquiry into Ms Trump's fundraiser was now concluded. 

Ms. Trump published a statement last month in reaction to New York Times reporting on the event, which was intended to benefit a scholarship programme called "Fostering the Future," which was part of her push to continue her husband's "Be Best" project.

Despite Florida law requiring any "charitable organisation or sponsor" to register with the state before engaging in any solicitation for donations, the Times discovered that the Florida Consumer Services Division had not received registration paperwork from any organisation with either name.
