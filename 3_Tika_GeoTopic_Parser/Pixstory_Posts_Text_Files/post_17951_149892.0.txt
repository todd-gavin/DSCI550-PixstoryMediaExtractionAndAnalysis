This is not a drill: Hugh Jackman is back as Wolverine in "Deadpool 3."  Ryan Reynolds made the announcement on his social media. His first appearance in the MCU obviously needs to feel special. 
“Hey, Hugh, you want to play Wolverine one more time?” Reynolds asks as Jackman walks by in the background.
“Yeah, sure, Ryan,” Jackman replies. The video ends with Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love You,” and a “Coming Hugh” tag. The Deadpool logo appears, then is quickly sliced up by Wolverine’s adamantium claws.
