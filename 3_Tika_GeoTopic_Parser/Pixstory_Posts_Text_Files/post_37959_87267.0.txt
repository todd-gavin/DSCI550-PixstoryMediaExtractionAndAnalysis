Crucial win for thr Gunners! 

Thomas Partey broke the shackles in the 11th minute for the Gunners. The Ghana international flicked a Gabriel Martinelli corner as Kasper Schmeichel could only be a spectator to his superb placement. 

The Gunners then put the game to rest in the 59th minute courtesy of Alexandre Lacazette. The Frenchman calmly slotted a penalty in the top right corner and doubled Arsenal's lead, securing all three points at home! 




No Vardy No Party for Leicester City !!

Jamie Vardy has played only 18 Premier League games in the 2021/22 season owing to injuries. But the striker is still the top scorer of the Foxes with 10 league goals. 


Leicester City are currently struggling at the 12th spot in the Premier League table. Jamie Vardy's return from injury against Burnley ended a 5-match winless streak in the league as the striker played a pivotal part in the win. 


Sadly, Jamie Vardy suffered another injury setback in the win against Leeds United last weekend. This should keep him out till April and his presence was sorely missed against Arsenal. Hence, it has to be seen if Brendan Rodger's side can manage to win points in his absence. 




Caglar Soyuncu adds to Leicester City's woes

The Leicester City defender conceded a penalty in a crucial juncture of the game. 1-0 down, the Foxes had started piling up the pressure on Arsenal. But a "wild" Soyuncu handball gave the Gunners a penalty which was slotted home by Lacazette, ending any hopes of a comeback!




Arsenal vs Manchester United for a top-four finish? 

Manchester United beat Tottenham 3-2 on the weekend, hence hurting Spurs' hopes of a top-four finish. Arsenal responded to this with a clutch victory of their own over Leicester City. 

With the season nearing its end, it looks likely that only Manchester United could challenge the Gunners for the 4th position. Hence this makes their clash on 23rd April very vital!
