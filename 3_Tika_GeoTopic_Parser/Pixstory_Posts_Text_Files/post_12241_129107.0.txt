Trees help to combat global warming by absorbing carbon dioxide, removing and storing carbon while releasing oxygen back into the air.
They also reduce wind speeds and cool the air as they lose moisture and reflect heat upwards from their leaves. It’s estimated that trees can reduce the temperature in a city by up to 7°C.
Other environmental benefits include the fact they help to prevent flooding and soil erosion, by absorbing thousands of litres of stormwater.
