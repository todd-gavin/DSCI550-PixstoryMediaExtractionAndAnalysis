After seven years with the Blues, the England international forward is ready for a new challenge.

After confirming her exit from Manchester City, Georgia Stanway has signed a three-year 
contract with Bayern Munich.

After seven years with the Blues, the 23-year-old England international is looking forward to a 
fresh challenge.

While with City, she won the Women's Super League, the League Cup, and the FA Cup, making over 150 appearances, but she believes the time is perfect to try something new.

"I joined Manchester City with the ambition of becoming a professional player," Stanway stated on social media, announcing her departure. For the past seven years, I've been happy to call it home.

"With almost 150 appearances and seven domestic trophies, I leave as the club's leading scorer today."

"I'd like to express my gratitude to every one of the staff and teammates who have helped me 
along the way." And to my fans, who have been nothing but supportive throughout. I've made 
lifelong memories and friendships.

"If not as a player, I'll be back as a fan!"

Stanway leaves City as the club's all-time best scorer, surpassing Nikita Parris' mark in January 2022.

Stanway had been linked with a transfer away from City for some time, and his move to Bayern Munich has finally been confirmed.

"Honestly, I'm very delighted!" she told the official website of her new club. It just feels natural.

"From the first discussion, it just seemed right."

I was completely certain that I belonged here, 
and my gut told me so. FC Bayern has lofty goals, which I like very much.

Bianca Rech, FC Bayern Frauen's sporting director, said on dealing with a player who is now under contract until 2025: "We are thrilled by Georgia's decision." She is a versatile and 
dangerous player who is also defined by her mindset.
