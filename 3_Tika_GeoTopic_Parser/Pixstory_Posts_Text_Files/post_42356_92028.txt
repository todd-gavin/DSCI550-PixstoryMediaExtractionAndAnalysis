Just watched the new web series on Disney Hotstar named Parallels This is the first season of the Parallels and I wonder why Disney and the producers of the series didn t spend much time and money on promotions because this series is too good Parallels is a story about four teenage friends Sam Victor Romane and Bilal where Sam and Victor are brothers and Victor thinks that his parent is biased and love Sam more than him Sam have a crush on Romane and Bilal is a single parent child living with his scientist Mom Sofia One day at night Four of them go to the bunker to celebrate Bilal s birthday and also Sam prepared himself to propose to Romane but suddenly failed experiment of ERN lab s particle collider sends them into a parallels universe After the failed experiment we got to know that now there are three parallel universes which are Where Samuel remain in the original universe and the remaining three disappeared Where Romane and Victor living in the year but there is no Sam and Bilal In this universe Bilal and Romane are living in the year but there is no Sam and Victor But the twist in the web series came when year old Bilal found himself in with Sam who is still a teenager From here onwards a search for Romane and Victor began and when Sam and Bilal found them Sofia the mother of Bilal began the quest for an idea that how to send Bilal Victor and Romane back to their original universe which is in the year As a viewer you already watched series and movies about time travel and the multiverse but by no means this series is bad or you should ignore this This series should be on your watchlist and you should recommend this series to your friends because the series explain scientific terms in a very easy language especially in the fifth episode and you will binge all six episodes in one go and will not feel guilty about it
