Couple of years back from another train I had first seen the towering beautiful lines of the Datia Palace across a lake An old family connection to it added to the lure and then a little hunting on the net had thrown up the visuals of Orchha the Chattris by the river Betwa and the magnificent Chaturbhuj temple Reality didn t disappoint Jhansi was a last minute addition These three places on our itinerary that weekend lie in a region where the state boundaries look like the ravines of the Chambal a maze of furrowing lines So while Jhansi is in Uttar Pradesh Datia and Orchha are in Madhya Pradesh but history and a common socio cultural identity bind this entire region Named after the Bundelas a Rajput clan who came into prominence around the th century Bundelkhand seems to have always been given to strife and a touch of anarchy So no wonder that apart from kings poets and writers like Tulsidas and Maithili Sharan Gupt it has given us figures like Mastani Rani Lakshmibai and Phoolan Devi Concluded
