A sympathetic and understanding police was interacting with them, and strict instructions had been delivered to all the officers-in-charge of Police Stations to ensure that no innocent villager should be troubled by the police without evidence. The move worked and eight villager who were wanted in naxal cases decided to surrender. 

They were asked to surrender their arms, but they claimed that their arms had been taken by the naxals when they left the party. They were told that it would be difficult to get Government Support if they do not surrender the arms, but they looked so innocent and spoke the truth. The whole village had motivated them to surrender for the peace of the area.

The trinity of the Maoist movement had been Osho, Dwarika Mahto and Rajinder Master. Osho had been arrested recently and was in jail. Dwarika’s family was being approached for his surrender, while Rajinder Master, and oldtimer who was the main preacher was arrested along with his girlfriend Zarina Begum of Kala Barwa Village in June 2007. 

The Maoist menace in Bagaha had thus been largely controlled by frequent pressure of the police following a two pronged strategy of area domination and community policing. I enjoyed interacting with the families of the Maoists, as the visits allowed me good views and adventures in the dense jungles of Champaran, also opportunities to spot the Tiger and other wildlife in the Tiger Project.
