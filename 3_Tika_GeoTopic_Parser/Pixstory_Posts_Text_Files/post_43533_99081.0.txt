If you're a true fan, then you'll recognize them all.

1. Kim Mi Kyung
It’s impossible to create this list without the mention of Kim Mi Kyung, who’s played the role of an affectionate mother more times than we can count. One of her most notable characters was when she portrayed Park Shin Hye’s mute mom who also works as a housekeeper in The Heirs, but let’s not forget all the other times she made us cry buckets, such as in Go Back Couple and Hi Bye Mama. she played Park Gyu Young’s mom and the Moon brother’s mother figure in It’s Okay to Not Be Okay. 

2. Kim Sun Young
The versatile Kim Sun Young may have won the Best Supporting Actress award for her role in Crash Landing on You, and while it’s a true testament to her acting range, it’s her characters as a mother that never failed to capture our hearts, the most iconic one being for Reply 1988 as a single mom. 

3. Lee Il Hwa
Another Ssangmun-dong eomma from Reply 1988, Lee Il Hwa does the challenging role perfectly and with great range. From being Yoo In Na’s ambitious mom in My Love from the Star, to Lee Jong Suk’s weak mother in Doctor Stranger

4. Kim Hae Sook
The multi-awarded Kim Hae Sook continues to add more K-dramas to her already-impressive resume—and more often than not, she plays the mother of the lead star, effectively making us shed tears time and again.

5. Lee Jung Eun
Lee Jung Eun is best known internationally for her role in the Academy Award winning film Parasite, but for true-blue K-drama fans, she’s also undoubtedly one of the best eommas out there. We were especially moved by her in Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo as Nam Joo Hyuk’s adoptive mother.
