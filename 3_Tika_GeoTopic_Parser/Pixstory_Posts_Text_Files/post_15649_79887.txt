The Monzino Cardiological Center was the first in Italy and among the few in Europe to make available to its patients the Revolution Apex CT scan, the most advanced cardiac CT scan in the world capable of processing a personalized examination of the heart with the minimum possible radiation exposure. It is one of the first applications of artificial intelligence to cardiovascular imaging capable of creating a specific algorithm for each patient using the principle of machine learning or machines that learn The cardiac CT was born from the idea of being able to study the coronary arteries without resorting to unnecessary invasive tests explains Gianluca Pontone Director of the Department of Perioperative Cardiology and Cardiovascular Imaging The results we have obtained up to now in terms of accuracy are excellent and the benefits for patients are very evident. However, CT scanning always assumes the use of radiation, so our commitment in recent years has focused on finding the way to reduce radio exposure without reducing the accuracy and precision of the exam Today artificial intelligence has offered us the solution While cardiac CT is already widespread and we are sure that Apex technology will become the standard cardiac Magnetic Resonance despite the robust evidence of indications still remains an underused technique in cardiovascular imaging continues Pontone al Monzino we are bucking the trend as facilitated by the single-specialist model that characterizes our center we have recently upgraded our fleet of machines with two cardiac MRI scanners completely dedicated to cardiovascular This availability is important because it not only makes possible an enhancement from a diagnostic point of view but allows to accelerate on the front of the emerging field of guided MRI interventional procedures, therefore faster and without ionizing radiation. With the acquisition of the two new CT and MRI machines, the Department of Perioperative Cardiology and Imaging cardiovascular is positioned among the top international players
