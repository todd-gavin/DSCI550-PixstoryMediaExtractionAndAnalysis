The BJP won 255 seats in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav alleged foul play via EVM fraud by the BJP following the vote-counting process. On March 13, The Live News shared a video of a man slipping in ballots on behalf of others inside a poll booth. The outlet claimed that this was how Akhilesh Yadav was defeated in the elections. While the anchor mentions that the channel could not confirm whether the video was real, he also states, “This video shows the extent of foul play going on in the Uttar Pradesh elections. The allegations and visuals of this foul play clearly expose what’s going on.” (Archive link https://web.archive.org/web/20220315104901/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6QxLgmW0vQ ) The outlet has a verified channel on YouTube and the clip has garnered more than 4 lakh views as of this writing.
