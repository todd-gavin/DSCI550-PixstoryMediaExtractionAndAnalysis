I first became acquainted with Shrii Guruji at the start of the 21st century. At that time he was quite young, yet he had already mastered Sanatan Dharma (at the feet of his Guru), and learned a number of disciplines, such as Jyotish, Numerology, Mantras, Tantra and Gemology. Even back then his friends knew him affectionately as Shrii Guruji—as we still do today.

Our initial interactions were in joint support of the newly founded Graha- anukul-ratna-vishesajna-parishad, aka the Planetary Gemologists Association
(p-g-a.org), which was established to standardize and uplift the science of Planetary Gemology.

We both shared a passion to see high-class Vedic Gemology based on Shastra, common sense, as well as Graha-anukul-ratna-visheshajna-vaad (The philosophy of recommending gems for people’s beneficial planets OR gems act same, not opposite, of their ruling planets).

Guruji was more than helpful, and eventually, after 15 years of contributions, he took up leadership of the well-established PGA.

Subsequentially he has rebuilt the Association’s website, improved the web presence, and reorganized the entrance exam.

With his profound knowledge of Vedic planetary gemology, as well as Internet technology and experience, I cannot think of anyone more suited to the job than Guruji.

Now, after years of personal research, planning and preparation, Guruji Shrii Arnav has put icing on the cake of his career (thus far) with this incredibly extensive book on gems in astrology.

The simplest way to describe this book is as a Color Encyclopedia of Vedic Gemology, destined to become the PGA’s manual on the subject.

In my opinion, The Secrets of Jyotish Gemstones is destined to be the most important and widely utilized book on the subject of Planetary Gemology in the English language, or perhaps in any language.

I am honored that he has asked me to write the book’s foreword, and I congratulate and wish him all success in his noble endeavors.

Om tat sat.
