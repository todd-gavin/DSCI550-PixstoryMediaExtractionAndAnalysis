alexiaputellas believes that Wednesday's Clasico in front of a pack out Camp Nou could be a game-changing moment in the history of women's football

ALEXIA PUTELLAS SAYS:
"THE GAME WILL INSPIRE MANY PEOPLE.THEY WILL SEE WOMEN PLAY AT CAMP NOU AND I AM SURE IN THE FUTURE, REWARDS WILL BE REAPED. MANY GIRLS WILL DREAM OF PLAYING ON SUCH A SPEICAL STAGE. IT COULD BE BEFORE AND AFTER MOMENT IN THE WORLD OF WOMNEN'S FOOTBALL."

The 60,739 supporters who attended Atletico Madrid's match against Barcelona in 2019 set a new record for women's football. The future seemed bright as Atletico de Madrid shattered the 99-year-old attendance record for a club game in women's football in 2019.
On that day, 60,739 fans witnessed Barcelona beat the hosts 2-0 in what felt like a watershed moment for women's football in Spain. However, a year later, the pandemic struck, halting the expansion.

Barcelona will have another chance to shatter that record this week in the most crucial women's El Clasico to date.
The success of Barca's women's team has made fans proud and piqued attention in a year when the men's team has battled to find their pace and identity. For Barcelona fans, the game at the Nou Camp is a watershed moment in the team's history.
"These stadiums are the symbols, the icons of these clubs," explains Lorena Lopez, who has been following Barcelona's women's team since 2018 and travelled to Budapest to watch the team win the Champions League final last season.

"Giving the women a chance to play at these stadiums makes these matches special and helps the sport progress because it attracts more supporters to the women's game."
