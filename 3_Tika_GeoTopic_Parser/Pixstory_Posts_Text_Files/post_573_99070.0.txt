WEALTH
  Wealth index
Households are given scores based on the number and kinds of consumer goods they own, ranging from a television to a bicycle or car, and housing characteristics such as source of drinking water, toilet facilities, and flooring materials. 


In India, the wealthiest households are concentrated in urban areas. Seventy-four percent of the urban population is in the two highest wealth quintiles. By contrast, more than half of the rural population (54%) falls in the two lowest wealth quintiles. Chandigarh (79%), followed by Delhi (68%) and Punjab (61%), have the highest percentage of the population in the highest wealth quintile. The states with the highest percentages of population in the lowest wealth quintile are Jharkhand (46%), Bihar (43%) and Assam (38%). Seventy- one percent of the population in scheduled tribe households and 49 percent of the population in scheduled caste households are in the two lowest wealth quintiles. 
The survey also collected information on household assets, means of transportation, agricultural land, and farm animals. 

The percentage of households that have a bank account or a post office account is almost the same in urban (95%) and rural areas (96%). Urban households are somewhat more likely than rural households to have a mobile telephone (97% versus 92%). Rural households are more likely than urban households to own agricultural land (52% versus 13%) or farm animals (58% versus 10%).
