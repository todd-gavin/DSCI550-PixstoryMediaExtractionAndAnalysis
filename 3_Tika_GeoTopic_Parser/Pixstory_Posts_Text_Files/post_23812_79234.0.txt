Somnath Temple is one of the oldest pilgrimage centres in India and finds mention in the ancient books of Shiv Puran, Skanda Purana and Shreemad Bhagvat Gita. Soma refers to ‘Moon God’, thus Somnath means ‘Protector of the Moon God’.

According to a legend, the Indian God of Moon, Soma was cursed by his father-in-law to lose his lustre. It was Lord Shiva who cured his illness and later Soma built this temple in his honour. It is one of the most revered ‘jyotirlinga’ among the 12 jyotirlingas of India.

The temple is located in Prabhas Kshetra in Saurashtra (Gujarat). Prabhas Kshetra is where Lord Krishna is believed to have left his mortal body. The place also has a Somnath museum, Junagadh gate, beach and a sound and light show to amuse the pilgrims.
