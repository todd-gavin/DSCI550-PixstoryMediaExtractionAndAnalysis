Gender Neutral Bathrooms in U S Capitol is what two lawmakers demand. They said that it would make the Capitol more welcoming for transgenders and gender-nonconforming individuals. This is a great concept and being implemented in Capitol makes a lot of sense to the people.

In a letter Wednesday to the House Administration Committee, Reps. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Hakeem Jeffries of New York said, "All employees, interns, and visitors should have access to safe and comfortable restrooms."

They remarked that there is currently only one single-use restroom on the House side of the Capitol, located in the basement of the Longworth office building.

Enforcing more "will make a visible difference in the lives of transgender and gender non-conforming individuals, as well as other marginalized communities, including people with disabilities, older adults, and parents of small children," the pair said in their letter to the committee's chair, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif.

Their call comes amid a wave of legislation targeting LGBT rights across the country.  Political experts and LGBTQ activists say the surge in many issues is part of a Republican political strategy to use transgender people as a “wedge issue” to encourage right-wing voters.

In a speech declaring June LGBTQ Pride Month, President Joe Biden called the bills “unconscionable attacks” that have left "families in fear and pain.

Concern over the lack of appropriate facilities is shared by our staff and visitors who have communicated to us their stories and experiences, including Members of the LGBT Congressional Staff Association," their letter said.

The lawmakers also noted that the additional private bathrooms would be a help to other staffers and visitors, including elderly and disabled people with caregivers as well as parents with kids.
