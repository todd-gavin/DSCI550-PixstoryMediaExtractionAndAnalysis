The message of the President of the Republic Sergio Mattarella on the occasion of the official celebrations of the Day of Remembrance On the Day of Remembrance which commemorates the victims of the Nazi extermination camps and the insane and criminal plan to genocide the Jews of Europe, I would like to convey to all the participants in the official ceremony taking place this year at the Ministry of Education to the students to the viewers my closeness and my support When the Russian troops entered the Auschwitz camp the most imposing and unfortunate killing machine ever built in the history of mankind their eyes the gates of Hell In the heart of Europe a chasm had opened which had swallowed up centuries of civilization of rights of cultural conquests A delirious ideology based on grotesque theories of racial superiority had quickly erased the ancient values of solidarity coexistence tolerance and even the most basic human feelings, those of pity and compassion History had undergone a tragic upheaval in less than twenty years, returning to barbaric and cruel concepts and practices that were thought to be a legacy of a now distant past War exterminations massacres were the tragic but inexorable consequences The day of remembrance that is celebrated today all over the world not only requires us to remember the millions of deaths, the mourning and suffering of many innocent victims including many Italians, but invites us to prevent and fight every germ today and in the future of racism anti-Semitism discrimination and intolerance Starting from the school benches Because knowledge, information and education play a fundamental role in promoting a just and supportive society And as recent news reports attest, the Auschwitz guard must never be lowered with its gloomy barbed wire chimneys and the gas chambers became the symbol of the Nazi horror of absolute evil But it must be the constant testimony of what misdeeds man is capable of when he abandons himself, betraying his own humanity, to feelings, words and ideologies of hatred and death
