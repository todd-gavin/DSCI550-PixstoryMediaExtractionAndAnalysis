RCB were amazing bowling first. No KKR batsman could even register 30 runs to their name. Russell scored 25 and Umesh Yadav 18 at the end, KKR put up a total of 128. RCB's bowlers never lost the plot. Siraj and Willey were amazing in the powerplay. Akash Deep took 3 wickets and Hasaranga was amazing, he took 4 wickets.

RCB had an initial scare with the openers being sent back for mere 5 runs together. Southee and Yadav picked one a piece, then Kohli went out for 12 to Yadav again. Willey and Rutherford steadied the innings a bit. Narine sent back Willey for 18. Shahbaz played a crucial knock of 27. In the end, it was ex-KKR captain Dinesh Karthik who took RCB home. It was KKR's poor batting performance that cost them the game.
