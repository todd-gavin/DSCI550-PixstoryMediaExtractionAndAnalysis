BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra quote-tweeted a tweet by ANI reporting that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and State Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu ate ‘langar’ at Golden Temple in Amritsar ahead of state elections. Gandhi can be seen wearing a mask in the video. Patra mocked him by tweeting, “Langar with the mask on? Only the eight wonder of the world can do this.”

BJP Punjab also tweeted the video claiming that Gandhi was sitting for the langar with an empty plate and a mask on his face.

Several other BJP leaders also shared the video including BJP SC Morcha chief Lal Singh Arya, BJP MP Jamyang Tsering Namgyal and BJP Delhi General Secretary Kuldeep Singh Chahal.

Even certain journalists mocked the Congress leader – Pramod Pandey from News Nation and Jitendra Pratap Singh from Sudarshan News.

The video is also circulating on Facebook.

False claim
While ANI’s video does not capture Rahul Gandhi eating, the Congress leader had himself broadcast a video of the langar where he can be seen opening his mask before consuming his food. This can be watched from 1:20 minutes in the video below.

After BJP leaders shared ANI’s video with a false claim, Congress leaders also came to Rahul Gandhi’s defence. They uploaded a video where he can clearly be seen eating the food with the mask off.

BJP members had used another image to mock Rahul Gandhi in a similar manner
On January 26, BJP Haryana IT cell head Arun Yadav had posted a picture of Rahul Gandhi sitting in front of a plateful of food with his mask on. “The first man to eat food with his mask on,” wrote Yadav.

This picture was shared by Tamil Nadu Congress Committee on January 24 along with other pictures that show Gandhi with his mask off.

That same day J&K Pradesh Congress Seva Dal had also tweeted pictures from the event. The handle wrote that Gandhi ate food with weavers in Tamil Nadu.
