Zomato announced its first quarter financial results on August 1 and stated that its meal delivery business had achieved break-even with an adjusted EBITDA of 0. In this area, it had reported losses of Rs 30 crore and Rs 80 crore in adjusted EBITDA for the March quarter.

At the corporate level, however, it reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of Rs 150 crore in the quarter ending in June (Q1). The corporation defines adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA that excludes ESOP (employee stock option) charges.

While revenue increased 67.5 percent to Rs 1,414 crore, the company's net loss in the quarter nearly halved (narrowed by 48 percent) year over year to Rs 186 crore.

"The food delivery industry achieved a significant milestone in terms of profitability last quarter when it reached Adjusted EBITDA break-even. Improvements on both the cost and revenue side, as we have seen, drove the growth in contribution as a percentage of GOV to 2.8 percent in Q1FY23 from 1.7 percent in Q4FY22 "CFO Akshant Goyal stated that it had been previously suggested.

Despite the fact that there are many moving components in the industry at the moment, the company said that there is a negative impact of inflation on the demand side.

"Similar to the cost side, rising gasoline prices and wage inflation are having a negative impact on margins. Having said that, we have made considerable progress toward boosting contribution margins thanks to the overall efficiency gains "the CFO stated.
