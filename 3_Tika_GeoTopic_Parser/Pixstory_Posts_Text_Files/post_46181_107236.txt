It s World Blood Donor Day Today But Unfortunately i have Never donated the blood Sad but true But Everytime i see other people donating Blood I became Soo excited to know about it s Process One day I went to hospital With one of my Relative as my relative was donating Blood I was very excited to see the whole process Lemme explain What i saw there When it s time to donate here s what will happen You ll go into a donor room where you ll lie down on a cot A Nurse will clean your arm and insert a new sterile needle into your vein This takes just a few seconds and it can feel like a quick pinch You ll donate about pint one unit of blood The process will take less than minutes But if you re donating platelets red cells or plasma by apheresis the process can take much longer like up to hours When you re done they will ask you to raise your donation arm and put a little bit of pressure on it which helps your blood clot Then they ll put an adhesive strip After This They will give You some Refreshments to eat which includes some healthy Snacks and water But lemme tell you according to me This process of inserting needle is painful As the Expressions of my relative Changed When They inserted needle In arm I genuinely want to do this process of blood donation As the Feeling of satisfaction After Donating blood is Very different After donating blood You know that you saved many lives Happy World blood Donors Day
