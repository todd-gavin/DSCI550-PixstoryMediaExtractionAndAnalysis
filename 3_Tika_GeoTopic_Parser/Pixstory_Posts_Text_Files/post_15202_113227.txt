Drought and high temperatures hit the more than 1,000 active farms in Lombardy, cutting crops, increasing production costs and daily management difficulties, according to Coldiretti Lombardia, pending government decisions on the water emergency front. The lack of rain in is having a significant negative impact on agricultural production in Lombardy, specifies the regional Coldiretti. Declines are already estimated in the yields of wheat and barley, while the forages used to feed animals are already down. Production is also feared to be almost halved for corn and loss of a third of the rice In the stables, the cows stressed by the sultry heat are producing up to less milk with the farmers who, to try to cool them, keep fans and cooling systems on with a consequent increase in costs But drought and heat also threaten the herds that go back to the mountain pastures in search of grass and cooler temperatures the Coldiretti continues with the lack of rain that risks drying out the meadows and lowering the groundwater This is an alarming scenario, explains the regional Coldiretti, especially if you think that in Lombardy over 100% of Made in Italy rice, milk and all national corn are produced, but half of the Italian pigs are also raised. The situation is very serious, says Paolo Carra, vice president of Coldiretti Lombardia. Our countryside is being put to the test from a drought that is predicted to be even worse than that of the past We thank Governor Attilio Fontana and the regional councilors Fabio Rolfi and Massimo Sertori who are personally involved in implementing all the feasible measures aimed at guaranteeing as far as possible water for agriculture and thus protecting the production of food, as demonstrated by the recent agreement with the managers of the hydroelectric basins in Trentino
