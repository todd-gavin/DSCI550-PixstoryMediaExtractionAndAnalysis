The round-of-16 matches between Portugal and Netherlands in the 2006 FIFA World Cup is hands down one of the most controversial and infamous matches in the tournament’s history. It is popularly known as the Battle of Nuremberg or the Massacre of Nuremberg as it holds the match holds the record for most cards shown ever in a football match. 
The footballing rivalry between Portugal and Netherlands was at an all-time high back then. The two teams had faced each other in the semi-final of Euro 2004 (which took place in Portugal) where the hosts ousted the Dutch. The anticipation for their Round-of-16 match in the 2006 World Cup was thus very high. 
As expected, the players started to play roughly right from the beginning and the first booking was received by Mark van Bommel in just 2 minutes. However, things took a serious turn when Boulahrouz's nasty tackle on Cristiano Ronaldo forced the youngster to be subbed off at the 33-minute mark. 
The match ended up being a massacre with a bunch of ugly tackles and confrontations and referee Valentin Ivanov had to show a total of 16 yellow cards including 4 red cards. Portugal ended up winning the match by a narrow 1-0 margin. 
After the match, the then FIFA President Sepp Blatter heavily criticised the referee for being too harsh on the players but many defended Valentin saying that FIFA had asked the referees to keep the players under check. Valentin Ivanov was not allowed to officiate in any other match of the 2006 World Cup after that.
