A recent research showed that sniffing on
peppermint essential oil helps in suppressing
appetite and is able to reduce the calories you
consume.
The participants who sniffed peppermint oil every two hours ended up eating 2,800 fewer calories per week that is enough to lose 5 pounds a month.
I'd say that is incredible!
Menthol influences our neurosensory perceptions and distracts you from cravings and hunger so you're less likely to overeat or binge eat or eat out of boredom.
So if you are trying to lose weight or eat healthy or just cutting off sugar, but falling prey to the temptations around, keep of a bottle of this miracle potion along and you will see wonders happening!
