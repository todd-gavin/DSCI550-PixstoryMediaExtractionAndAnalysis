My Grandfather had a beautiful garden full of fruit trees and colorful flowers Of all the trees the plum rose was the oldest and most prolific Of course it was different from other trees because of it has sweet fruits One day two boys came to my grandfather s garden One of them reached for the plum tree to pick it but my grandfather hit the boy hard on the stick with the stick in his hand They left with tears in their eyes He raised his hand and said angrily That fruit is bad for you No one could touch this tree for fear of my grandfather When my grandfather falls asleep in the afternoon I went with our middle aged gardener And I secretly picked apricots from my grandfather s apricot tree Life was beautiful I was heartbroken in those days when my grandfather called me I did not say do not touch this tree These are photos from my grandfather s tree
