PMS is an acronym for Premenstrual Syndrome. It happens in every three out of four people that have period.

The symptoms of PMS might vary widely from menstruator to menstruator. There may be other contributing factors, such as medical disorders - endometriosis and polycystic ovarian syndrome are typically culprits, although other conditions can also be factors - in addition to the person's personality, culture, perception of pain, etc. The person may experience mood changes, pelvic and abdominal cramps, exhaustion, and headaches, among other symptoms. Again, each one of these people is unique, and the symptoms of one will frequently be extremely different from those of another.

A lot of people think we're throwing tantrums or it's "just her time of the month" but in reality something major is going on with our body which is constantly undermined because of such ignorant jokes. If cis men had period, it would be one of the biggest problems faced by humanity but because it's the minority genders, it isn't exactly taken seriously. Especially because of the misogyny that expects women to power through all kinds of pain and sacrifices. But that's an unfair expectation when every part of our body is hurting, our hormones are a mess and on top of that we are having to deal with people's ignorant comments. It's not quirky or funny as they present in media, we literally feel depressed, feel the world caving in and it's not like those sitcoms.

It's about time we start taking marginalized genders more seriously in their pain. No, you don't need to counter it with a "have you ever been kicked in the balls?" You don't get kicked in the balls every month and experience its symptoms 15 days out of the months. Stop being ignorant. A little empathy could go a long way.
