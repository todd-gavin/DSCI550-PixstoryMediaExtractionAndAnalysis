As per David Ornstein, Manchester United have completed a verbal agreement with Erik Ten Hag. 

The Dutch manager was one of the favourites to land the job along with Mauricio Pochettino. Initial interviews with Erik Ten Hag reportedly impressed the Manchester United board and they have hence decided to make the Dutchman their permanent manager.

As per the report, Ajax have been indicated that Erik Ten Hag will be leaving at the end of the season. Manchester United are ready to offer the Dutchman a four-year contract as per the report. 

Though the agreements between Manchester United and Erik Ten Hag have concluded, the manager is yet to put pen to paper. It is expected that the deal would be finalized in the coming days after the board members set down with the manager and discuss the terms of the contract. 

As per the report even if Erik Ten Hag signs the contract, no information would be let out by Manchester United or Ajax until the end of the season. This has been decided to shield the teams and the players from media attention. 

Hence, it has to be seen how Erik Ten Hag's reign begins with the Red Devils next season!
