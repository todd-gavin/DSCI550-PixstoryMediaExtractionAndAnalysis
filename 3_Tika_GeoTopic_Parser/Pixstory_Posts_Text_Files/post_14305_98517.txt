Max Allegri on how Dusan Vlahovic and Moise Kean are settling in I m very happy with how Dusan Vlahovic has been doing and I am really satisfied with him I didn t expect him to settle in so quickly here after his move in January It s likely that he ll play tomorrow Like others he can only get better Denis Zakaria has come from a different league and it is difficult to play well in every match Here you use more energy on a mental level I am very happy with him he is intelligent and he learns quickly We are just three games from the end of the league season with the cup final still to play We all have to give our all to the team to get the results In the end only what happens on the pitch counts
