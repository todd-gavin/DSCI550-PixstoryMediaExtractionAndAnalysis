I’m a huge ranbir kapoor’s fan. I have watched almost every film of his. 
Today, me and my friend went to see this movie as we both love ranbir kapoor. 
Reviews:
The film is a good theatre experience that will make you enjoy some moments and hate some moments. This movie is quite similar to bahubali and rrr.
First half is good but second half is soo boring. The film starts off with great expectations and the 1st half of the movie pretty much entertains you ,Sanjay Dutt Kills it as the antagonist and rocks in every frame , his acting in the cruel avatar is top notch. 

It’s a one time watch moviee 
Tell me in the notes have you watched this movie?
