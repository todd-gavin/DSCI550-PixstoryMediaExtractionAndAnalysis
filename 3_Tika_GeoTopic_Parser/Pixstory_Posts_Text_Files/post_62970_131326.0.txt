The daughter of top Putin ally Alexander Dugin was killed in a car bombing in Moscow on Monday, and the Russian domestic security service (FSB) has officially placed the blame on Ukraine.
Any involvement has been denied by Ukrainian authorities. According to the Russian FSB, the Ukrainian special services planned and executed the attack, which was directed at Dugin.
According to the intelligence agency, Natalia Vovk, a native of Ukraine, committed the attack before evading to Estonia. Sofia Shaban, 12, and Vovk are said to have travelled to Russia on July 23. Vovk is said to have rented an apartment in the same complex as Dugina.
Vovk allegedly used three different licence plates when she was living in Moscow, according to the FSB. Using licence plates from the so-called Dontesk People's Republic, a separatist state in Ukraine, she entered Russia. According to the FSB, she used Ukrainian plates to leave the country after using Kazakhstani plates when she was in Moscow.
Daria Dugina, a 29-year-old nationalist commentator, was murdered on Saturday night while driving her father's SUV. She had just heard her father, a prominent political and philosophical theorist in Russia, speak on Russian culture and history as she was leaving a festival.
Due to his strong friendship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Dugin has acquired the title "Putin's brain" and is one of Russia's leading proponents of the invasion of Ukraine.
