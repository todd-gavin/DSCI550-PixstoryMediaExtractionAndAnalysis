The UK government has announced plans to get rid of parts of the post-Brexit deal it agreed with the EU in 2019.

The government wants to alter the Northern Ireland Protocol to make it easier for some goods to flow from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.

But the EU obstructs the move, saying going back on the deal breaches international law.

The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's solitary market for goods.

It prevents a difficult border with the Republic of Ireland, but it implies checks on some goods arriving in Northern Ireland from other parts of the UK - a circumstance opposed by unionists in Northern Ireland who argue it creates a trade border in the Irish Sea.

This would mean:

Goods coming from Great Britain (GB) into Northern Ireland (NI) and which are staying would use the green lane. This means there would be no inspections and paperwork would be minimal.

GB goods moving through NI into Ireland or the wider European Union would use the red lane and continue to be checked at NI ports.

London also wants any trade disputes resolved by "independent arbitration" and not by the European Court of Justice, and Northern Ireland to profit from the same tax breaks as elsewhere in the UK.

The government says there is "no other way" of protecting the crucial interests of the UK.

It argues the term "necessity" is utilized in international law to rationalize situations where "the only way a state can safeguard an essential interest" is by disapplying - or breaking - another international obligation.
