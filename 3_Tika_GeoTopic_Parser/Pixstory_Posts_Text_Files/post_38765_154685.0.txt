Scout Report - Young U19 Players taking the World by Storm
Pedri 
Since Neymar's departure to PSG, Dembele, Coutinho, and Griezmann were bought to replace the flamboyant playmaker for a huge sum, but they failed to do so. With Messi bound to leave his boyhood club, the search for a creative and goal-scoring lynchpin is intense. Thankfully, they got a teenager who at 18 years old is setting the stage on fire. His name is Pedro Gonzales Lopez or commonly known as Pedri, was bought for a mere 5 million from Las Palmas.
Pedri is a smart playmaker and has the versatility to play in either wing, in the midfield, in the center, and as a forward. Koeman saw the immense potential and gambled on the Spaniard to give him playing minutes. 
He possesses flair, intensity, accurate passing skills, and in-game understanding. He rarely makes unnecessary passes, or does something foolish which puts his team in danger. He takes one touch and try to get ball rid of him as quickly as possible. 
Looking at his seasonal heatmap, we can see that he played in both the wings, in midfield, and in the center. He made actions there in the form of passes, shots, assists, and touches. In the heatmap, we see that the blue area where its darkened(i.e in the left side) is where he made most of his actions. OIt goes from dark blue to light blue(i.e left to right). 
Passing 
Pedri has accurate passing. He made 52.98 complete passing per 90 .Pedri is an ambipedal midfielder(as he can use both of his feet), he can find his teammate anywhere in the field. Whether it maybe short,longÂ  or medium passes, he has incredible passing range.He can switch the wing at ease while playing for Barcelona. Pedri is not the fastest player, but his ability to glide past players at ease. He completed 1.22 dribbles per 90. He is able to carry the ball at his feet, changing direction using his skills.
