The most important piece of real estate in which to stake a claim is the human mind How you stake a claim in the mind is by creating a perception And how you create that perception is by controlling the context Control the context and you control the mind Control the mind and you control reality A very good example of The Veblen Effect is Johnnie Walker Double Black Scotch whisky The basic JW Black is labelled as being at least years old scotch But JW Double Black has no age statement Nonetheless JW Double Black is sold at a higher price than basic JW Black based on the perceived notion that double black must be much better than just black and that is reinforced by Double Black being much costlier than Black That is how the human mind works In reality no one knows what is so special about Double Black except that the label claims it to be very smooth Without actually saying it is smoother than Black Many believe that this is simply a marketing strategy to pass off un aged scotch at a much higher price through the Veblen Effect And that is how the Veblen Effect when properly implemented becomes a highly successful and profitable marketing strategy to separate consumers from their hard earned money while simultaneously leaving them feeling good about it and continually coming back for more Addendum Apple products laptop iPad iPhone ipod etc are not marketed as need products The VEBLEN Marketing strategy is in full play here The product is very good but it is marketed as status symbol
