The area was very well planned Besides the Tagore hall we had a stadium next door a beautiful park called Iqbal park All activities like the Dusherras took place there The Tagore hall was a cultural hub traditional folk theatre called Band Pather would take place there We would also go to see Kashmiri and Urdu plays All this was happening very nearby therefore approachable and good escapes in between There were also the huge grounds of Amarsingh club were we would go to play cricket hockey and other sports The mixed religion surrounding made the atmosphere very wholesome Something that has stayed on as part of us Before I get sidetracked I would add a small footnote here From the Veranda of the house I would look at the top of the mountains and tell my self that ideally I should have been born in America and if that didn t happen I should have been living on the top of the mountain I would also ask the same to God if he decided to get me born in a place like Kashmir why the hell did I have to live in this colony and not on that mountain Because by the time we were growing up the area had turned into a proper residential colony The pristine charm of the open area my grandfather had bought into was gone Other people had moved in and there were houses all around It was later on in life I realised this is the story every where This is the story of lurban and rural India This is the story of urbanization every where and even Wazir Bagh And now after all these years I live half way up the mountains Exactly the mountains I would look at from that Verandah I cant say God has been unkind He has given me even the smaller things I thought about as a child Deep down the yearning stayed my efforts wante got conditioned the same way Thats where I live now and I am extremely happy What originated than has come now
