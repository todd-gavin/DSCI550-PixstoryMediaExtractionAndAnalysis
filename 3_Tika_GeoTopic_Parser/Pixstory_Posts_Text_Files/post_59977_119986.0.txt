On Friday, the Delhi High Court summoned Congress leaders Jairam Ramesh, Pawan Khera, and Netta D'Souza in connection with a civil defamation lawsuit filed by Union minister Smriti Irani, who decided to seek damages of more than Rs 2 crore for what she claimed were baseless accusations made against her and her daughter

In response to the allegations made against Irani, who is currently holding the portfolios of Ministry of Women and Child Development and Ministry of Minority Affairs, and her daughter, Justice Mini Pushkarna ordered the three Congress leaders to delete tweets, retweets, posts, videos, and photos from social media.

The defendants must remove the content from Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube within 24 hours if they don't follow the court's instructions, the court ruled.

Following accusations from Congress members that her 18-year-old daughter Zoish Irani operated an illegal bar in Goa, Irani reacted by calling for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to remove her from his Cabinet.

Irani replied, calling the accusation "malicious," and saying that her daughter Zoish was targeted out mainly because "her mother gives press conferences criticising Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi."
