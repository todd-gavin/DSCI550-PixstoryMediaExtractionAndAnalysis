We get a close-up look at the daily routines of the Webbs and Gibbs and their tight-knit small village of Grover's Corner through the eyes of the play's narrator, the Stage Manager. Teenage neighbours Emily Webb and George Gibbs must decide their priorities when they start getting along well. Our Town immerses us in what makes life's moments exceptional and priceless in a slice-of-life, meta way. This American classic receives a modern update and design by ACT. ACT gives this American classic a fresh approach and contemporary design to reflect our own town of Asheville, North Carolina today.
