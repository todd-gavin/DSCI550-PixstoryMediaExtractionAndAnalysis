Australia immediately conjures up images of surfing, pleasant weather, kangaroos, and BBQ. Even though Australians refer to them as prawns instead of shrimps, the phrase "throw another shrimp on the barbie" is frequently used! In reality, a lot of Australians despise this saying and say it's just another one of their national stereotypes. 

As per nomadsworld, a typical Australian barbecue consists of sausages, burgers, steak, fresh seafood, bread, and tomato or barbecue sauce. Although they occasionally serve salad, the focus is primarily on the meat and fish (along with a few stubbies, or beer to those outside of Australia). 

Australians don't only barbecue at home; they'll do it everywhere. Public barbecues are provided by local municipalities for usage at well-liked tourist locations like beaches. Please just tidy up after yourself! During your stay youâ€™re sure to have at least one barbeque a week!
