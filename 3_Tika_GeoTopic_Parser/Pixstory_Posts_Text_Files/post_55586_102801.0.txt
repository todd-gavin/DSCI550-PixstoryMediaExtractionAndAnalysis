I know what I am doing this Friday night!

The Cry is highly emotive, dramatic, and rich in depth. This is also a limited series, and it tells the narrative of what happened to new mother Joanna (Jenna Coleman) and her husband Alistair (Ewen Leslie) when their four-month-old son Noah goes missing during a trip to Australia in just four episodes. 

As per collider, the show follows Joanna and Alistair as they deal with the aftermath of the catastrophe, both psychologically and in terms of their delicate relationship, all while under the constant scrutiny of the media. 

The show is superbly acted and photographed, with unexpected twists and turns that will keep you fascinated.
