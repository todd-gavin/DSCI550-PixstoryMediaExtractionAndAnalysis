Unprecedented flash floods, cloudbursts and landslides in Himachal Pradesh took more than 1,500 lives in the last five monsoons, according to an August 2022 report by the state’s disaster management authority. 
Unfolding climate disasters in the Himalayan region have been cited as causes of extreme climate events over the last couple of years including, for example, the August 2022 Pakistan floods that displaced more than 30 million and were attributed to fast-melting glaciers. 
Despite the ecological and climate vulnerabilities of the Himalayas, land use change of forest land and deforestation for large infrastructure projects picked up pace over the last decade in the hilly state of Himachal, even as consecutive governments pushed back on laws that envision greater community ownership and stewardship of delicate forests.
Among these was the June 2022 move by the union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC) to dilute clauses of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, popularly called the Forest Rights Act or FRA, particularly the requirement of consent from the gram sabha (the general body of a village) to hand over forest land to project developers, in its newly amended Forest Conservation Rules, 2022.
The FRA was enacted in 2006 to right injustices, since the colonial era, in treating Adivasi and forest-dwelling or forest-dependent communities as encroachers on forest land.  
A directive, first introduced in 2009 by the environment ministry, made the consent of affected villages mandatory before such transfer of forest land. 
The gram sabha was required to give such consent so that forest-dependent people’s claims over tracts of forests may be considered and settled as mandated by the FRA, and to ensure that projects seeking permission to divert forest land for non-forest use are in compliance with provisions of the FRA. 
The provision was later included in the Forest Conservation (Amendment) Rules, 2017.
