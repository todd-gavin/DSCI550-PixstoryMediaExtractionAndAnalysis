Gigi Hadid is used to travelling the world walking runways, taking photoshoots, and attending red carpet events, but the coronavirus pandemic has caused her life to slow down significantly. She and boyfriend Zayn Malik have been quarantining at her mother Yolanda Hadid's family farm in Pennsylvania since March 2020. After welcoming their first child, a girl called Khai, in September 2020, the pair has only grown to love Pennsylvania even more. Fans have speculated that Gigi Hadid is quitting modelling as a result of these changes. In her most recent Vogue interview, she talked about her profession, and you'll be surprised by what she said.

In terms of her modelling career, Hadid seemed to be unconcerned about resuming her hectic schedule. For the time being, she's content to model from the comfort of her own home and take photos for her second Instagram account, gisposable. Her most recent assignment is a voice acting role in a Scooby Doo episode set to air in September 2020. Hadid said she's open to going into acting roles in the future, even though she's still modelling for publications on the side. She stated, "I'm leaning toward things that feel more stable than being in a different nation every week." 

That is all there is to it. Hadid isn't completely retiring from modelling, but don't expect to see her on every red carpet from now on.
