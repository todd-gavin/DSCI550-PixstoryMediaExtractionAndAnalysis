Three-times Champion Novak Djokovic will not play in the US Open, as expected, because he is not vaccinated against COVID-19 and thus is not allowed to travel to the United States.
Djokovic announced his withdrawal from the year’s last Grand Slam tournament on Twitter on Thursday in a tweet, hours before the draw for the event was revealed
“Sadly, I will not be able to travel to NY this time for US Open,” Djokovic wrote, wishing luck to his fellow players, and said he would “keep in good shape and positive spirit and wait for an opportunity to compete again.”
Djokovic’s refusal of the vaccine caused his deportation from Australia in January before he could make a bid to win his fourth consecutive Australian Open title. The three-time U.S. Open champion, who won the event most recently in 2018, was allowed entrance into France and England for the next two Grand Slam tournaments this spring and summer. 
Djokovic has spent more weeks at No. 1 than anyone else in the history of the ATP rankings. He is no. 6 this week, in part because no rankings points were awarded at Wimbledon this year.
Among the other players who will not be at the US Open for various reasons are No. 2-ranked Alexander Zverev, the 2020 runner-up in New York; 2016 champion Angelique Kerber; 2019 French Open finalist Marketa Vondrousova; Gael Monfils and Reilly Opelka.
