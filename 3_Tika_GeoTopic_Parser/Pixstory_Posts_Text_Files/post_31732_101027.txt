Handwriting is an acquired cognitive and motor task of particular complexity that offers an interesting observation window on brain functions. For this reason, handwriting monitoring provides useful biological information especially in neurological patients. Handwriting disorders are in fact frequently observed in patients with from neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson&#39;s disease micrography and Alzheimer&#39;s disease agraphia An interdisciplinary research team coordinated by Antonio Suppa of the Department of Human Neurosciences of Sapienza has proposed the analysis of handwriting through artificial intelligence as an innovative system for monitoring remote in telemedicine of neurological patients The system based on the accuracy of machine learning algorithms in detecting some handwriting patterns attributable to the physiological aging of healthy subjects an alternative to the usual outpatient clinical evaluation The study carried out in collaboration with the departments of Electronic Information Engineering and telecommunications from Sapienza of IRCCS Neuromed and the Department of Neurology at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio was published in the journal Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience The researchers recruited healthy, right-handed subjects and divided them into three age groups young people between i and adult years of age between and years and finally subjects in advanced adulthood or between i and years Each of them was asked to write their name and surname several times with a black ballpoint pen on a sheet of white paper and then to photograph their own handwriting sample with a smartphone and send it to researchers
