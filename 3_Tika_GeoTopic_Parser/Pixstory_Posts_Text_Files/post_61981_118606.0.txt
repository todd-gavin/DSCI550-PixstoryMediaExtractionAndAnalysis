Disney added parental controls to its streaming service in March, allowing easier means to restrict access to mature content for younger family members. This was a clear sign that Disney was pivoting from only allowing PG-13 or lower films and shows to potentially letting companies expand into developing R-rated content on Disney+.

Last year, it was announced that Marvel Studios would be developing a Marvel Zombies animated series for Disney+. Many fans began speculating on whether it would be connected at all to the What If...? episode of the same premise and if the series would receive a more mature rating.

At the Marvel Studios Animation Panel at San Diego Comic-Con, it was confirmed that the upcoming Marvel Zombies animated series would be rated TV-MA (television's R-rating equivalent) with executives promising that there would be much more gore.

This series also takes place in the same universe as the zombie universe that appeared in What If...? and will include more zombified heroes and villains like Wanda Maximoff, Ghost, Hawkeye, Abomination, Captain Marvel, a legless Captain America, Ikaris
