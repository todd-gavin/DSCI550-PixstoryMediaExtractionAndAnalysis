A view from Wagomon hills🌄 It was the first time I saw horses🐎 this much closer, usually we see animals when they are in cages and we walk around🐘🐼🐯. This entirely new experience made me to think more about why should animals be caged and we should enjoy that scene?  It's very rude to do so and it is guilty pleasure😈 what we are having. So please think about this and let me know your thoughts 🤔💭.
