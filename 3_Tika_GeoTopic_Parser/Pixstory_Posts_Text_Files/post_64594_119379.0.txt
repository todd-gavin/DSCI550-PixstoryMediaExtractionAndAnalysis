Kal ho na ho…… My Favourite❤️
The Romcom movie revolving around "A Story of a Lifetime ... In a Heartbeat". 

When it wasn’t parroting a toxic positivity chorus of ‘just be happy’ in the face of life’s complex challenges, the movie wanted you to believe that walking down the aisle with a grief-stricken bride in love with your dying best friend was a good thing. Actually Love may overcome all odds of our lives .
A girl with no clue of love finally falls into love with the most unexpected person of her life . And that same love of her making all the efforts to make her love her bestfriend Rohit✔️
Due to medical conditions he decided to take up one last project up in his life - making Naina fall in love with Rohit 🫠
Because in this film, agar tum meri nahi ho sakti, to kisi aur ki toh ho sakti ho. 📝📝 said by aman 
That 6 days scheme of getting ladki in by Aman finally got successful 😞.
