Following an interview with President Joe Biden Jake Tapper revealed that when discussing his son Hunter Biden s possible prosecution Joe Biden stated that he believed that prosecutors only know he committed a crime because he admitted it This admission is referring to the one in Hunter Biden s book where he admitted that he was using drugs at the time he filled out a form to buy a gun and said on the form he was not using drugs The clear willingness by CNN and the President to practically brush off the crimes that Hunter Biden committed and the disturbing revelations about his life that have gone public is astonishing We are all well aware at this point of the bias of CNN but the Hunter Biden story took this bias to another level No longer can they seriously simply be called biased news Nor can we hyperbolically say that they re a propaganda machine It s becomes clear at this point that much if their news is in fact propaganda
