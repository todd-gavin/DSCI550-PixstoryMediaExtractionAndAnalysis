Warm and involved fathers have been associated with improved academic performance better sleep for infants and an easier adjustment to the birth of a sibling First a study found that having a warm and loving father impacts children s optimism and self efficacy believing in yourself which ultimately improves their academic performance Suizzo et al When fathers are more involved in caring for their babies the babies show fewer nighttime awakenings If this isn t motivation for a father to get more involved early on then I don t know what is This found that a higher involvement of fathers in the care of their infant in the first six months of life was linked to fewer nighttime awakenings as measured by an objective measure called actigraphy This association persisted even after controlling for breastfeeding Research finds that children who seem to adjust most successfully to the birth of a sibling tend to have fathers who are more involved in their care These children tend to show more positive behaviors toward the mother during this transition So remember that the father or the non birthing parent becoming more involved in child care during this time may not only be important for practical reasons such as giving the mother a chance to physically recover but also for the psychological adjustment of the older child This finding also provides an additional argument for extended paternal leave policies
