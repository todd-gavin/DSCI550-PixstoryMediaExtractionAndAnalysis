Had Interview in Mangalore It was my first biggest interview The panel of who are main people of the company interviewed me When HR told me the Panel is going to be with big of the company i was a little scared tbh But once i went inside i tried to answer everything calmly while being my true self I was wrong about one or question but i backed it up with supporting answer so kinda did okay i guess but overall this was ghe best experience wasn t expecting to went through this smoothly Even if i didn t get this job it was a very nice experience
