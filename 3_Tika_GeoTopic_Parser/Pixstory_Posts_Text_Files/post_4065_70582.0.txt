I am not a fan of mass movies still I would like a good visually appealing film. That's why without much expectation I saw Pushpa.
‌Took me two days to finish the movie. 

The whole movie is problematic in the case of dialogues and even the lyrics of the songs.

‌The special song done by actor Samantha had a massive response for breaking the stereotypical objectifying lyrics. Yet the movie stands as an irony.

‌The main plot itself is problematic, the hero being a smuggler of wood. Cutting down trees and its smuggling is glorified. Let's hope part 2 might be the repenting of the hero.

‌There is a scene wherein Pushpa asks heroine Srivalli to smile and later kiss after payment.
 
‌Moreover, Srivalli even begs Pushpa to sleep with her which is the cringe at its peak.

‌The song called 'Swami' has the most problematic lyrics which includes calling her boyfriend Swami (God).

 The epitome of patriarchal demand is glorified. Moreover, she says she dresses for her boyfriend ( Toxicity plus ignorance is a very brutal combination). She even calls herself milk pot! 

‌I lost hope in the world after seeing this part of the lyrics saying "When my veil is falling if you not see Won't the wind behind laugh at me If my beauty is not yours Won't my birth of girl life be meaningless, Saami".

‌Remember this song has been trending in all languages and is one of the most used ones in the reels. 

‌Irony prevails when Pushpa ignores the worst remarks one makes on his wife but angers off same time upon remarks on his mother. I don't understand this hypocrisy and selective empathy.  (Continued.)
