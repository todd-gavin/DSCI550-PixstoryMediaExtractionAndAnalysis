With 10 games remaining in the Premier League, the Toffees sit just three points clear of the relegation zone. Frank Lampard, the manager of Everton, is sure that his team will avoid relegation from the Premier League.

After losing 2-1 to West Ham on Sunday, the Toffees are just three points above the bottom three with ten games remaining. Lampard's club plays Burnley on Wednesday, and the coach believes his team can climb out of the relegation zone if they maintain playing as they did against West Ham.

"Ten games is a lot. If our luck turns and we keep on the path we showed today and against Newcastle I have a real strong belief we will be OK," he said to BBC Sport.

"Saying that now here means nothing. We just have to focus on ourselves. The next game is huge because it is Burnley but also because it is our next game. After that we move on to Manchester United.

"Look at West Ham. Today they are very strong but two or three years ago they are facing relegation. And then they build, stick together and recruit and they move on. Everton has huge history and a fanbase.

"At the moment we are working to get through this moment. Myself and the players are giving everything. The fans can know if we keep doing that over 10 games, we will be OK."

On Wednesday, Everton will play Burnley, another relegation candidate, at Turf Moor. Sean Dyche's side is in last place in the table, four points behind the Toffees. Everton's next opponents are Manchester United, Leicester City, Liverpool, and Chelsea.
