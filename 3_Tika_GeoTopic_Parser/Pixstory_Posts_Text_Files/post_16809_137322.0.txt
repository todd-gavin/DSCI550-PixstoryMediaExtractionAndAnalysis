The title of the movie Satyaprem Ki Katha, starring Kartik Aaryan and Kiara Advani, was changed a few weeks ago, according to the film’s producers. The name of the movie was Satyanarayan Ki Katha. The change made in the title was to prevent hurting anyone’s sentiment, according to a statement from Sameer Vidwans, the film’s director. The film has officially begun filming with Kartik and Kiara.🎥✅

Satyaprem Ki Katha, the eagerly awaited movie produced by Sajid Nadiadwala in association with Namah Pictures, began production on September 3. Kartik Aaryan and Kiara Advani play the key roles in the movie.❤️‍🔥🔥

The entire cast, the director Sameer Vidwans, the producers Sajid Nadiadwala, Shareen Mantri Kedia, and Kishor Arora, as well as Wardha Nadiadwala and Shafat Nadiadwala were present on the first day of the film.🎥🎥

Since its announcement, Satyaprem Ki Katha has become the most talked-about issue. After their most recent project, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, the movie is a musical love story that brings Kartik Aaryan and Kiara Advani back together once more.❤️❤️
