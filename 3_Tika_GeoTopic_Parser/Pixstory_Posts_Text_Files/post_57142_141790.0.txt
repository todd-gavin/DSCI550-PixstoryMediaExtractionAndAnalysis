Learning to let go is an essential part of psychotherapy, where the person is taught how forgiveness can ease their pain and bring relief.
Holding a grudge against someone is easier but forgiving them is courageous.
The best part about forgiveness is that it keeps our minds healthy and maintains good physical health.
Forgiveness can help in-
-Healthier relationships
-Improved mental health
-Less anxiety, stress and hostility
-Lower blood pressure
-Fewer symptoms of depression
-A stronger immune system
-Improved heart health
-Improved self-esteem
