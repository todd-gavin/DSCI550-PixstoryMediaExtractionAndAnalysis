#9 Man United 4-3 Man City, September 2009
A goal-fest match, as both clubs into this contest on high confidence after buying many talented players. 
Wayne Rooney swept United ahead within two minutes of the start, but his goal was cancelled by new City player Gareth Barry. Darren Fletcher and Craig Bellamy netted each side of the goal, and the score was 2-2. Fletcher was once again on the scoresheet, but another City goal after a defensive blunder by Ferdinand saw the City coming from behind once again.
The game approached full-time, and Giggs found Michael Carrick with his through ball, who made no mistake and produced a memorable day for United fans as they edged City 4-3. 
#8 Man United 1-1 Man City, April 2001
A more of a WWE than a football match, Roy Keane, the United skipper, ended the game with a three-match ban and was fined Â£5k after a brutal tackle on Haland.
The tackle was enough to shift the attention there, and both teams shared a spoil in a match. 
#7 Man City 2-3 Man United, November 1993 
Manchester United Champions League exit was met with offensive chants by City fans, but their reply at the end of the match was remarkable. City were in a comfortable lead in the first half with a brace from Niall Quinn.
But those singing was hushed for a moment when Cantona converted in Michel Vonk's wayward header to reduce the deficit. The goal gave United a significant booster, and they built on this as Cantona once again on the scoresheet before young Keane slammed a winner in his first Manchester Derby.
