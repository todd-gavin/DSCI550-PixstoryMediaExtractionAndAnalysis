#16) Zico 


Known for his exciting style of play, Zico became a household name as he drew comparisons with the best of the game. He was a dynamic player and bamboozled the defenders. The impressive part was his ability to score from the set pieces. In a career spanning 20 years, he scored 100 direct free kicks. He just fell short of winning FIFA's Player of The Century as he came third on the list. Pele and Garrincha were the two ahead of him. 


#15) Garrincha


Regarded as one of the best dribblers of all time, Garrincha played a vital role in Brazil’s World Cup victories in 1958 and 1962. When Pele got injured in 1962 and Brazil’s campaign was in jeopardy, Garrincha led the team to victory. He is the first-ever player to win the Golden Ball and Golden Boot in the same tournament. 


#14) Ferenc Puskas


“Puskas Award” is handed out to the players every year for scoring the best goal of the year. He was a clinical and lethal forward and had 84 goals in 85 international matches. He played for Hungary as well as Spain in the international circuit. In his domestic tenure, he had scored 514 goals from 529 games across all competitions in the Hungarian and the Spanish leagues. 


#13) Marco van Basten


The injuries have brought the careers of several players to halt. And one such player is Marco van Basten. The player stopped playing at the age of 28 due to damage to his ankle. He scored for fun during his time with Ajax, AC Milan and the Netherlands’ national team. He was an exceptionally gifted player with technicality and speed. He won three Ballon d’Or awards and had 282 career goals in 379 appearances before retiring from the game.
