So we've talked about how your vagina keeps itself clean.🧽
It has an army of good bacteria inside, that act like your own personal military force and stop the bad bacteria and other bad guys from growing inside your vagina.🦠
How does it keep clean?
Well, it cleans itself using some liquid - the sticky stuff that comes out on your panties.
Think of it mopping. When you clean the house, you first do the dusting and brooming, and then you mop across the floors.🧹
Your vagina does the same thing. It mops itself using vaginal fluid.✨
Once cleaned, your vagina gets rid of all the dirty gunk on the inside and let's out all that fluid. We call it discharge.
I like to call it vaginal fluid, and not discharge. Because it's completely normalz and it shows a healthy functioning vagina.
Wait, this is normal?😲
Yes? Vaginal fluid or discharge happens to everyone, and it's entirely Normal! It's how your vagina stays clean l, and lubricates itself (and also works as a nice natural lube for sexy times✨)
Oh, cool!😃
So how do I deal with that uncomfortable wetness?🤔
Well, you can wear panty liners! They absorb all the extra fluids, and keep you feeling nice and dry (and also stop your vaginal fluid from bleaching your sexy, lacy underwear 😉)
If your discharge is more than usual, has an unusual smell, an unusual colour, or looks foamy/frothy, then you should speak to your doctor. It could be the sign on an infection.👩‍⚕️
