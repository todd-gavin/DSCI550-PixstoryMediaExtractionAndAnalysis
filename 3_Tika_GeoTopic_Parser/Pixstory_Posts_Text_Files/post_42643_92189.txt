I still remember the night of th May when Chelsea outplayed Real Madrid in the second leg of the UEFA Champions League semifinal The match ended with a scoreline and Real Madrid played one of the worst games since I started watching football Almost a year after Real Madrid and Chelsea are meeting again to face each other in the quarterfinals of the UEFA Champions League and Real Madrid looks forward to taking revenge against Chelsea on the other hand Chelsea wants to continue its winning streak against Real Madrid This match between both the team will be different compared to the last season s match because Last year there were no spectators in the stadium and Real Madrid didn t play in their home stadium because of the construction work in Santiago Bernabeu In football spectators are one of the key factors in knockout games like this Chelsea team of last year was in red hot form because Thomas Tuchel s manager of Chelsea every tactic was working and all the players of the team were happy together but now the situation is different because of the ownership issue If we talk about the tactics Both teams play attacking football and each team wants to score a goal as soon as possible and then play a defensive game Real Madrid will play in a formation and most probably Chelsea will play in a formation Benzema Courtois and Fede Valverde will be the key players for Real Madrid and I want Gareth Bale to start a game against Chelsea because he has experience of playing in such big games and his vision of scoring goals is still world class If I talk about Chelsea they have to play as a team to win the match because if they rely on individual performance then it will be difficult for them to win the match I hope the best team will win the match but personally I want Real Madrid to control the game as much as possible and emerge as the winner of this match
