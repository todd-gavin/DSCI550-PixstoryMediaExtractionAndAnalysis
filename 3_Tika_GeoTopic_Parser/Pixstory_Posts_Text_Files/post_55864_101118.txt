Gender or sexuality is a fluid term and hence when we address it we should talk about everyone starting with women Oppression wasn t new for women and yes we should not be proud of our terrible history here It s been a century since women won the right to vote through the th amendment we rejoice we celebrate but have you realised even after years of achieving a landmark for women in history we still have an unequal representation in politics Aren t we being robbed blind even after the same years of existence men women and the transpersons don t receive equal representation and still there is discrimination towards the rest of the members of the LGBTQIA community Many believe our battle for gender equality has been won since women s suffrage But it was just the beginning and when I talk about equality I mean equal clearly in number representation inclusive of all genders and not just some sympathy seats Do we have equal representation of governors senators and representatives Although the number of women in government in the US has grown they still hold less than of government positions nationwide Both in the Senate and the House of Representatives women historically and currently are underrepresented Most openly LGBT politicians in the U S are part of the Democratic Party which has taken a more favourable attitude than Republicans towards LGBT rights But as the number of LGBTQ Americans increases the pace at which LGBTQ officials are elected to public office lags far behind according to data published Friday by the LGBTQ Victory Institute Currently just over elected officials nationwide identify as openly LGBTQ according to Out for America representing just per cent of people in elected positions We should have the urge for more we deserve nothing less than equality and the little representation we receive is not something to live with
