Spider-Man Star Tom Holland Announces Social Media Break Citing Mental Health. 

The Marvel actor has now taken to Instagram once again to announce that he's stepping away from social media, deleting the Twitter and Instagram apps from his phone, and citing his mental health as the main reason.  "I find Instagram and Twitter to be overstimulating, to be overwhelming," Holland said in a video online. "I get caught up and I spiral when I read things about me online and ultimately it's very detrimental to my mental state."

Holland spent most of the video speaking about a series of helpful apps from the charity stem4. The . 

Hello and goodbye…. I have been
taking a break from social media for my mental health,
but felt compelled to come on here to talk about

I'd like to take a moment to shine a light on their
fantastic work.
Please take the time to watch my video, and should
you feel inclined to share it with anyone who it may
resonate with - it would be greatly appreciated.

help these amazing charities thrive.
Love to you all, and let's get talking about mental
health ❤️
