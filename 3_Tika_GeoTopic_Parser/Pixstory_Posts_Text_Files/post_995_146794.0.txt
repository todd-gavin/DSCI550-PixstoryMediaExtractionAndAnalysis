John Lennon's "Imagine" is one of the best songs to remember world peace day. 
Agree that he talks about an utopia without possessions or greed, without the fighting that he believed nations and religions, by their very existence, promoted.
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion, too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace
Well.....
