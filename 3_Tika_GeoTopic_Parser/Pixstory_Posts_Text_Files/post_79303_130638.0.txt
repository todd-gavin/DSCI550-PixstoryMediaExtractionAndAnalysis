This morning David Ornstein released a transfer bomb in the form of Pedro Neto being revealed as a player Arsenal have been in pursuit of for over a month now, the so called ‘mystery winger’ that had been escaping journalists for so long. It seems as though as soon as the Raphinha deal was off the cards Neto was the clubs immediate 2nd option.

Considering his age profile, ability to play on both wings, directness and the bonus of him literally being an Arsenal fan himself, I think this would make an incredible signing and one that’s very much needed after Saka made his 100th appearance at just 20 a few days ago.

With the player just recently signing a new 5 year deal the transfer won’t be easy but Jorge Mendes has a lot of power over that club and if Pedro Neto himself wants the move then it should definitely help move things along a bit in order to keep Mendes happy.

I don’t think anything will happen until Pépé is moved on but once that happens and we go into the final few weeks of the window things could really start to hot up. 

It’s a strong sign of ambition that despite being top of the league Arsenal are continuing to spend and reinforce to prepare for times when not everyone is healthy. Neto is still raw in areas but Arteta has a good track record working closely with wingers so the sky really is the limit here. Exciting times at this football club.
