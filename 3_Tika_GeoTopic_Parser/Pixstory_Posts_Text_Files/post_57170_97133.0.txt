On Tuesday night, Warner Bros and DC announced the coming of 'The Batman' sequel at CinemaCon.As of now, no release date has been announced, but an official announcement has been made for the making of the sequel.

Since the release of The Batman earlier this year and its huge success, there have been high expectations from the sequel.
Batman became the highest-earning film of 2023, with a total gain of $759 million. It was premiered at Lincoln Center, New York, on March 1, 2022, and was theatrically released worldwide on March 4. However, it was delayed twice from an initial June 2021 release date due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film has received praise for its performances, cinematography, Reeves' direction, action sequences, and story, though some criticised its runtime.

Matt Reeves directed the movie, and Peter Craig wrote the screenplay. It stars Robert Pattinson as Batman.
The film portrays how Batman fights crime in Gotham City for two years.

Reeves thanked cinema makers for keeping the hope alive during a pandemic during the event.
He said, “The success of The Batman was a true team effort. We could not have gotten to this place without … the theatrical experience. For that, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. As a lifelong fan of the movies, I treasure what you do,” Reeves told theatres earlier in the day at CinemaCon. “There’s a sanctuary to be found in the movies.”
