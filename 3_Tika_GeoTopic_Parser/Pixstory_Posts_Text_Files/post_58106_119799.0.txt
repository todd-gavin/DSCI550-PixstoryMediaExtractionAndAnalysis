I came across true beauty when I was in 10 standard , it had 29 chapters then . I was struggling with acne and loved anime so I related with the main character Jugyeong a lot . It had great art , amazing character designs and interesting love interests . I was crazy about it , I used to wait for it every week .

It is story about a highschool girl Jugyeong ,who starts hiding behind makeup because she was bullied due to her acne problems and called ugly by her classmates . 

But now about 5 years later , the story has disappointed me . I thought it would be a story about a girl who comes to terms with her acne problem,embraces her inner beauty and learns that make up does not make you beautiful it only enhances your features .

 I thought she would spread a positive message . But the story is less about jugyeong and her struggles but more about forced love triangles , idol cliches and everything other than Jugyeong which should have been the main focus . After about 196 chapters Jugyeong still cannot show her real race .It ironical that a webtoon naned true beauty teaches us to hide behind makeup .
