During Saturday's election, the Premier League Hall of Fame inductee came in third place.

Didier Drogba, the former Chelsea and Cote d'Ivoire striker, will not be elected president of the
Ivorian Football Federation (FIF) after falling short in the first round of voting.

The two-time African Player of the Year finished third behind Yacine Idriss Diallo and Sory Diabate, according to the results released to the media on Saturday. Diallo received 59 votes,
Diabate received 51 votes, and the 44-year-old finished in third place with 21 votes.

As a result, the top two candidates will go to the second round of voting, when the new Cote
d'Ivoire football captain will be determined.

Presidents of top-flight teams and two lower
divisions – D2 and D3 – are able to vote in the FIF election, which is not open to the public.

Earlier this week, Rash N'guessan, a producer of Radio Cote d'Ivoire Sport, predicted that the
African football legend will win.

On August 1, 2020, Drogba announced his candidacy in front of a large crowd at the FIF offices
in Abidjan. Despite his popularity, there was some uncertainty that he could meet the eligibility
requirements as the Ivory Coast Footballers Association (AFI) declined to approve his
candidacy, causing the African branch of the International Federation of Professional Footballers
(FIFPro) to suspend him.

Drogba, 42, played for the West African country from 2002 to 2014 before retiring from
international football. He has 65 goals in 105 games for the West African country, which is the
third-highest number of international appearances after Didier Zokora (123) and Kolo Toure
(120).

He competed in five Africa Cup of Nations competitions (2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2013) as
well as three World Cup events (2006, 2010 and 2014).
