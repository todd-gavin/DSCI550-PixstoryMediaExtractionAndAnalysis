It's all about Tradition ❤‍🔥
A religious event held in Kerala...
For the better, happier, stronger, healthier living, we believe...
Yearly this occurs and food for all who visited will be provided.
It's a happy family gathering too.. 
In the busy days of peoples lives, such traditions are fading away and the bonds are losing their strengths...
Let's hold it tight before it gets dropped completely 🤝❤‍🔥
