Reem M Al Haj Ahmada Hayder A Al Domi Abstract Background and aims Studies continue to investigate the underlying mechanism of the association between the increased risk of different types of cognitive decline and metabolic dysregulation Brain insulin resistance BIR has been suggested to explain this association The vital role of insulin in the body has been examined intensively and extensively however its role in the brain requires further investigation Herein we confined our focus to summarize the role of brain insulin signaling and the negative effect of dysmetabolism on insulin functioning in the brain Methods Published scientific manuscripts between and that discussed the effect of selected metabolic disorder conditions such as obesity type diabetes mellitus T DM and high fat diet HFD on brain functions were reviewed The main keywords used were insulin resistance brain insulin resistance obesity T DM and cognition Results Various metabolic disorders were linked to the increased risk of BIR and was suggested to increase the probability of cognition impairment occurrence Several proposed mechanisms explain this association among which insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia were primary factors attributed to an increased risk of BIR among various metabolic disorders Conclusions Understanding the trajectory of the association between metabolic disorders and alternation in cognition status could expand our vision of those overlapping conditions and pave the road to both treatment and preventative strategies for cognitive disorders Sources
