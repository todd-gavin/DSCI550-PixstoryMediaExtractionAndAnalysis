Where next? Paulo Dybala to leave Juventus for free after failing to agree new deal with Serie A giants

Juventus forward Paulo Dybala is headed for the exit at Juventus. Earlier on Monday, talks were held between the representatives of Dybala and the club, but in a shocking turn of events, it seems the Argentine international’s time at Juventus is coming to an end. 

The 28-year-old’s contract is set to expire later this summer, and Juve, who had reportedly agreed a contract extension with their star forward earlier in October 2021, have offered a slightly less lucrative deal than what was agreed initially. 

After showdown talks of two hours, Juventus and Dybala’s representatives couldn’t come to an agreement regarding their future plans and by the looks of it, the Argentine star playmaker could be headed out of the Allianz Stadium. 

Juventus had signed Dybala from Palermo in June 2015 and in the seven years since, he’s won five Serie A titles and four Coppa Italia trophies. 

In recent times, the star forward has been plagued by injury issues and talking about his stats, Dybala has 13 goals in 19 matches across all competitions this term. 

Earlier, he came ever so close to joining Tottenham Hotspurs in August 2019 that the Premier League side had even agreed a deal worth reported £64.4m with Juventus, only for the Serie A club to then call off the transfer, as they couldn’t find a replacement for Dybala in time. 

Now that Paulo Dybala would be free to talk to clubs around the world, that too on a free transfer, he could attract plenty of interest, particularly from England, if Manchester United or Tottenham revive their interest in the Argentine playmaker.
