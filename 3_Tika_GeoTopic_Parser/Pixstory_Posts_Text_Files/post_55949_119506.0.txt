President Joe Biden tested negative for Covid and left isolation Wednesday after five days, using his fairly smooth recovery to make the case for more Americans to stay up to date on their vaccinations and take the antiviral Plaxlovid if they get infected.

Biden received a negative Covid test Tuesday evening and again Wednesday morning and his symptoms have almost totally resolved, White House doctor Kevin O'Connor said in a letter.

 As a precaution, Biden will wear a mask for 10 days when around others, O'Connor said.
In statements delivered in the Rose Garden before heading into the West Wing for the first time in five days, Biden said that with the availability of tests, vaccines, and treatments, Americans can weather a Covid infection without fear.

“Many of us are still going to get Covid, even if we take the precautions. That doesn’t mean we’re doing anything wrong,” Biden said. “Unfortunately, this Covid is still with us as it has been for two and a half years, but our fight against Covid is making a huge difference. What’s different now is our ability to protect ourselves from a serious illness.”
