This English Premier League season, a lot of teams are doing extremely well, and the majority of those clubs have been labeled as the favorites to win the championship.

There will be students beginning university in September who weren't even born the last time the Gunners won the championship and who have simply heard tales of the grandeur from their parents and other elderly relatives. Even so, they can still have some optimism. 

As was previously said, Arsenal's most recent title-winning season was 2015–16, when they came in second place, narrowly edging out rivals Spurs on the last day of the campaign and finishing 10 points below Leicester. It's hardly surprising that Arsenal will win the title in 2022–23 as they trailed Man City by 24 points in the previous season.

Here are three reasons why Arsenal may claim the Premier League title this year, but in my opinion, the Londoners are also the favorites to do so.

New Goal Scoring Threats

Eddie Nketiah and Jesus will be their major sources of goals, as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang left in January and Alexandre Lacazette followed him this summer.

Like Lacazette, Nketiah's contract with Arsenal was up in the summer, but the academy product has signed a new deal and finished the 2021–2022 season in respectable form, scoring five goals in his final seven Premier League outings. Nketiah is prepared to accomplish "something special" at the Emirates after receiving the storied No. 14 shirt from Arsenal. 

Jesus played for City for 236 games and scored 95 goals, but once Erling Haaland joined, Jesus was passed over. Therefore, the Gunners acted quickly to sign the 25-year-old.
