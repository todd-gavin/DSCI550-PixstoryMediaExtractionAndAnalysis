The Pir Panjal Range is primarily located in the contentious Kashmir region. From the Nilam (Kishanganga) River in the western Azad Kashmir region, which is administered by Pakistan, it stretches southeast for more than 200 miles (320 km), passing through the southwest Jammu and Kashmir union territory, which is administered by India, and ending at the upper Beas River in the northwest Himachal Pradesh state, India. The Jammu Hills to the south and the Vale of Kashmir, beyond which are the Great Himalayas, are separated by this abrupt rise to an average elevation of more than 13,000 feet (4,000 metres). The Pir Panjal Range is a mountain range in northern India. It is a portion of the western (Punjab) Himalayas, which is an outlier in the wider Himalayan chain to the west. 
It has numerous significant Himalayan peaks, including Manimahesh Kailash Peak, which is 5,656 metres (18,556 feet) high, as well as Mt. Deo Tibba, Mt. Indrasan, Ganga Choti, and Pir Kanthi. There are many peaks with high elevations in the Pir Panjal range. On the Pir Panjal's easternmost range, you may find the majority of high elevation peaks. Two significant and tallest peaks in the eastern end of the mountain range are Mt. Deo Tibba (6,001 m/19,688 ft) and Mt. Indrasan (6,221 m/20,410 ft). Both the Chandra (upper Chenab) Valley and the Parvati-Beas Valley in Himachal Pradesh's Lahaul and Spiti district can be used to access them.
