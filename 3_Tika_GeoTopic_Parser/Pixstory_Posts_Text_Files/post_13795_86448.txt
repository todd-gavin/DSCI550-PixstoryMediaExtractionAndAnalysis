Poor losers Paris Saint Germain The star studded Parisians were beaten fair and square by Real Madrid in the Champions League second leg on at Santiago Bernabeu The team having the forwardline of Lionel Messi Kylian Mbappe and Neymar have failed to accept the defeat in the right spirit The coach Mauricio Pochettino have blamed the referee for the overall loss The club president has done something even worse He allegedly stormed into referee s dressing room after the match and broke equipment That s absolutely shocking If this was PSG s worst season in the last years then it was their own undoing The referee certainly had nothing to do The news that Mbappe could be joining Real Madrid next season is making rounds for the past few months The presidents of Real Madrid and PSG met for dinner ahead of the match and according to PSG boss the topic of the Frenchman s future was avoided Perhaps there was hardly any need to There was another Frenchman Karim Benzema who did all the talking on the pitch through his sheer skills It was his brilliant hat trick in the second half that sunk PSG completely It is a pity that Pochettino failed to acknowledge such exceptional performance and accused Benzema of committing a foul while scoring the first goal It s Feeling very unfair because of the goal conceded It is a clear foul of Benzema to Donnarumma The emotional state has changed and we have been very exposed It s a tremendous blow because we were better in the tie the coach said Actually what the Argentine said was hugely unfair And what the coach has to say about his team conceding three goals in a span of minutes in the second half that too when they were leading by a goal overall Is PSG s world class line up basically a bunch of chokers Let s celebrate the fact that Benzema became the oldest player to score a hat trick in Champions League history the first French player to score three hat tricks in the competition Nothing can t be done if PSG were at the receiving end
