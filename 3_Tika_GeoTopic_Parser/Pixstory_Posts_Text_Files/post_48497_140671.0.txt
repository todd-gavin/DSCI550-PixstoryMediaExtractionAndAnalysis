Romans 12:14 “Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.” Romans 12:19 “Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” says the Lord.”
The unfortunate passing away of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II has led to mixed reactions around the world, many of them including dismissing, mocking and ridiculing. According to reports, there are also parties being held in parts of the world, in celebration. 
When asked, most people would talk about her Majesty’s misdeeds and acts of injustice, which in itself is the greatest irony of all times, if one of the major complaints someone has include her creating a society with less respect and dignity, isn’t celebrating, mocking and making jokes an act of disrespect itself? 
The death of a 96 year old woman, with decades worth of legacy, Britain’s longest-reigning monarch, is not a cause of celebration, and the reactions from “justice-loving” people is a case of pondering of where are we headed as a society, where instead of letting the dead rest, showing respect to them and their family members, their emotions and letting God take care of everything else, humans tend to loose morals while preaching about the same morals?
