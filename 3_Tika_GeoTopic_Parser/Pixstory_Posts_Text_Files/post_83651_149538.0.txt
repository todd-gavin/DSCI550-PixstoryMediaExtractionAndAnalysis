Okay, this is a good sign that someone has money.
The fact that someone does not appear to have money is a clear indication that they do.
In other words, they don't wear expensive suits or expensive watches because rich people understand that the best way to lose money is to spend it on luxury goods, and that commodities designed to signify wealth are actually the things that will make you less wealthy.
That is, for all intents and purposes, a lot of rich people walk around as if they were poor, and they don't buy into fashion. They don't buy something expensive just to show off. They are safeguarding their wealth by investing their money.
Anyway, all of this is to say that there's this confusing paradox in which a sign of the rich and wealthy is precisely that they look and act poor.
