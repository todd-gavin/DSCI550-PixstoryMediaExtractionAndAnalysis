Smoking is a tough habit of quitting, but what binds or stops someone from doing it?
The reason is the presence of nicotine.
People who smoke regularly have to deal with the impacts of nicotine withdrawal.

What is a nicotine withdrawal?
It is physical and psychological symptoms that hover around one's body and mind when nicotine leaves the body.
As soon as the person stops smoking, there's an urge and need to take another cigarette as the decreased levels of nicotine would compel a person to endure the symptoms like irritation, frustration, and trouble sleeping or concentrating; this pain would allay when the person chooses to smoke another cigarette.
This is a labyrinth; quitting smoking is not so easy.

"Thirty minutes after your last cigarette, you are thinking about the next cigarette. An hour after your last cigarette, most people who smoke feel edgy and uncomfortable."
Taking another puff would satiate the nicotine thirst in the body, and the person would experience a dopamine rush when nicotine gets attached to receptors in the brain.
The tension and frustration disappear, and you're again feeling comfortable.
This comfort would not last long, and the urge would remain to pressurise someone to smoke. 

One could choose a replacement therapy, medications, non-drug remedies, and coping strategies to deal with nicotine withdrawal.
