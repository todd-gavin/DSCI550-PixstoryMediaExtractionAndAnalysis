Have you ever been moved to tears by a news broadcast about an abused dog but have no qualms about eating a bucket of chicken legs that resulted in the suffering and death of many birds? Have you ever wondered why?

"Speciesism," an erroneous notion that one species is more significant than another, is the answer. This toxic mindset is profoundly embedded in our culture, and it has a wide range of harmful implications. Most humans are socialised to believe that certain beings are deserving of our care and compassion while others are not - all based on arbitrary human choices.

Parents, schools, the media, and other influences, whether consciously or not, give the message to children that puppies and kittens are "friends," fish and poultry are "food," and rats and mice are "pests." Most kids are also taught that human wants, needs, and interests always take precedence over those of other species, no matter how insignificant.

Regardless of what humans think of them, all animals deserve equal respect. While most of us have been conditioned to believe in speciesism our entire lives, we can – and must – escape this toxic mindset. Rejecting speciesism also entails examining our personal decisions objectively and making changes to those that harm animals. One of the best ways to start is to express our opposition to animal testing by purchasing exclusively non-animal tested items. Veganism is also important because it eliminates or reduces animal-derived goods from our lifestyle.

It's past time to acknowledge that all living, feeling beings are deserving of respect and compassion. We have to reject speciesism and treat all beings with integrity and consistency, and the first step is to acknowledge that they have the right to live without being exploited by humans. We have to unlearn old ways.
