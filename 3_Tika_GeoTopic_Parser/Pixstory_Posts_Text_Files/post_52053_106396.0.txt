First-time parents Bianca and Nathan Heffion eagerly filled their nursery as they awaited the arrival of their baby girl

“Like all first-time parents, we overbought,” Bianca, from NSW, tells 7Life..

But nine months on, the baby items sit in the corner unused, untouched with their tags still attached.

A textbook pregnancy led to the happy and healthy arrival of baby Savannah, but three months later the family faced life-changing news.

After a routine check-up, doctors discovered Savannah’s hips weren’t aligned

Bianca had noticed something seemed off when changing her daughter’s nappy.

“Her hips were quite stiff,” the mum says. “But she was my first baby so I wasn’t sure if that was normal.”

Scans revealed the scale of the problem.

Savannah had hip dysplasia -and in her case it meant she had two completely dislocated hips.

Impacting one in every 1000 births, the condition is correctable and if noticed at birth, surgery isn’t necessary.

But Savannah needed treatment as soon as possible.

“When they told us the only option was surgery my heart just sank, she was so tiny,” Bianca says.

A few weeks later - five days before Christmas - Bianca held Savannah’s hand as she was wheeled into theatre.

The toddler was then placed under anaesthetic and, as she drifted off to sleep, Bianca stepped outside the operating room.

“I held it together all day, but as soon as I let go of her hand and left I was a mess,” the mum says.

Thankfully, surgery was successful.

Medics were able to successfully cut and reshape the bone that had restricted her movement, and Savannah was put in a 2kg cast - stretching from her hips to her toes - to recover.

Over the next 24 hours, staff ran the parents through the new way to care for Savannah.

Life would be different for the foreseeable future.

There was a list of dos and don’ts; a need to keep the cast dry at all times and the new parents had to master a different way of changing her nappy.
