Question :With the reports of some NCR schools reporting covid cases among children, what advise would you give school going children ?

Dr ANOOP MISRAâ€™S reply 
We need to wait and watch. No point closing schools at this point. 

The students should just follow all guidelines of covid protocol and social distancing . 
Keep wearing masks and keep hand washing. 
Take lunch separately and not in group.
