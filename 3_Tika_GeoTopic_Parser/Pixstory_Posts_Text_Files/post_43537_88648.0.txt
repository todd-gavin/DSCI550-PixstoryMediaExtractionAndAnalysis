In December 2021, BTS shocked ARMYS worldwide when they decided to open individual Instagram accounts. It has been a source of happiness for fans

throughout the past few months. ARMYS have loved seeing the members update their accounts with what they're doing and interacting with each other in the comments.

One person who has always been there to make sure ARMYS are treated to content is none other than BTS's V! Although V has become known for posting things and then deleting them in record time, his feed has become truly aesthetic with posts from his travels, shows, and much more. However, on March 21 (KST), V posted something that didn't really fit in with his account's aesthetic but was enough to make ARMYS smile. V posted some images of himself as "Taechwita..." For those who might not be aware of the reference, it looks back at the 2021 Muster Sowoozoo event and the CT7 performance of Agust D's "Daechwita."

At one point, V, dressed up in costume, is tied up and seemingly executed by RM. Being the talented actor he is, his pose and facial expression captivated ARMYS' attention, and they've been unable to get over it ever since. V changed the caption for the post but both seemed to make historical references with words people would use when apologizing to the king for doing wrong. The current caption combines that with modern slang, reading, "Could I make just one request before I die? Ayo, district magistrate, drop the beat." When the photo was posted, ARMYS couldn't get over the fact that V was bringing back this iconic meme almost a year after it was first created... While others joked that the Instagram account was nearly becoming a fan account. The reason for thinking thv is becoming a fan account is because it isn't the first time V has been in tune with ARMYS' memes. After the group first opened their accounts, V posted a stunning vintage-style photo of himself looking extremely handsome, and it had the caption, "1921."
