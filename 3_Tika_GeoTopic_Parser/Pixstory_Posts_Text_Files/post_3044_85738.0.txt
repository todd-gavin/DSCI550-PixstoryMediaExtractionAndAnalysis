f a nuclear-armed nation attacks a tiny place, the outcome is a non-brainer. But nearly a fortnight later, it is worth asking if the war in Ukraine is turning out to be a modern-day David-vs-Goliath story, and if a former comedian can defeat Putin.

Let’s harbor no illusions. Ukraine has been suffering heavy blows and Russia is taking control of key territories. As the Russian attack is killing and displacing people, Ukrainians are putting up what little resistance they can. In realistic terms, Ukraine is in no position to defend, much less win – except through concerted Western action. The West has not directly entered the action so far, and Putin is determined to achieve his objective.

Yet, a few unexpected developments are giving rise to the possibility that the war may have a surprise in store. Firstly, few had expected President Volodymyr Zelensky to put up a heroic resistance that has inspired citizens. Even those Ukrainians who did not support him earlier admit he has emerged as “Captain Ukraine” and the first “true” president of Ukraine: https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/02/27/ukraine-russia-zelensky-president-changed-my-mind-inspired-millions/

That has galvanized popular opinion and self-confidence. Volodymyr Yermolenko, chief editor of UkraineWorld, an English-language news site, says “There is a strong feeling that if Ukraine wins — and I’m sure it wins — that can bring the end of both Putin’s and Lukashenko’s regimes”: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/opinion/ukraine-victory.html It’s this confidence which stops Putin’s forces from finishing the job, in spite far superior military power, in a matter of day as it was assumed in the beginning.

Yermolenko is not alone. An opinion poll of 2,000 adult Ukrainians outside of Russian-occupied territories reveals 70 percent of them are confident of defeating Putin: https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/ukraine-conflict/1646036410-poll-most-ukrainians-believe-they-will-win-against-russia

Is this reminiscent of the biblical tale of David and Goliath? On a TV show, an American rabbi said, “We have elderly Ukrainian women making Molotov cocktails in their basement. If that's not a David & Goliath story, I don't know what is”: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-vs-russia-a-modern-day-david-vs-goliath-story/
