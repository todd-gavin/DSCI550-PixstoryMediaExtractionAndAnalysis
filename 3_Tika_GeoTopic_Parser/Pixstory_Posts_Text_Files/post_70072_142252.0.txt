A four-day 'E' Certificate Course was conducted by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) for women in Goa.
As many as 22 persons participated in the course that was conducted free of cost at Athletic Stadium, Bambolim.
The comprehensive four-day course that began on September 10 was divided into theory and practical sessions.
The trainees were taken from five centres - GFDC Mayem, GFDC Poira, GFDC Aldona, GFDC Savoi Verem and GFDC Santa Cruz. 
GFDC has been developing grassroots football in Goa and the event was a unique experience for the kids. Trainees of GFDC were also invited for the programme. 
The training team comprised AIFF course educator from Kerala Deepak CM, and Maymol Rocky, the coordinator deputed by Sports Authority of Goa (SAG) to help promote women's football.
"We had a good batch of participants who played football at a good level. The facilities were on par with International standards, with quality ground and other facilities. Since this course is all about coaching grassrootsÂ  players (6 to 12 years) and understanding the children, the participants were very much keen on learning. I really enjoyed the course as a Coach Educator," said Deepak. 
"It was a great opportunity that FIFA has conducted this course free of cost for women. SAG has given their support to make this course possible. If all stakeholders viz GFDC, SAG, AFC, GFA, AIFF, FIFA, etc, work in unison then there are better ahead days for football, especially uplifting women footballers in the state," said Rocky who was present on all four days of the programme.
Rocky also said that the course was attended by women footballers as well as those who are undergoing BPED courses in colleges.
"The courses were conducted smoothly. Overall, it has been a good experience of the girls. Everyone enjoyed themselves," she said.
