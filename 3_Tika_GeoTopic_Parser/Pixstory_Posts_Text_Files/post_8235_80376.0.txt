The NBA's Feb. 10 trade deadline grows closer by the hour, and as such, the deals are beginning to trickle in. The Los Angeles Clippers swiped Norman Powell and Robert Covington from the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday, and not to be outdone, the Cleveland Cavaliers responded by landing Caris LeVert on Sunday. Those deals are just the appetizers. The Philadelphia 76ers are still seeking a deal for Ben Simmons. James Harden is suddenly available. The Los Angeles Lakers are desperate to make a move of some kind to support LeBron James and Anthony Davis, and there's always a surprise or two before the buzzer sounds.

There will be no shortage of action in the coming hours, and the music doesn't stop until 3 p.m. ET on Thursday. Fortunately, we've got you covered until then. We're tracking every deal, monitoring the biggest rumors and grading trades as they arrive, but in this space, we'll be reacting to the news as it happens. Stay here for the latest updates and reactions during the final stretch of trading this NBA season.  

Some bad news for contenders in need of forward help: Marc Stein is now reporting that the Kings are sending signals that they plan to keep Harrison Barnes. This makes sense if they are dead set on trying to reach the play-in round and snap their 15-year lottery streak. Earlier reporting suggested that they were hoping to trade Barnes for a win-now piece, but they were unlikely to find anyone who could help them win more right now than Barnes himself.
