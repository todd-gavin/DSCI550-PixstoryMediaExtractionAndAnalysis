Although Delhi deserves the rap it gets for its abysmal air quality it does have these pockets of redemption where one can peacefully and I m not saying quietly Peace being a state of mind and quiet well a totally different thing or very healthily still inhale and then inhale some more Exploring the gardens is not only a walk on the green side but in a lot of the gardens in Delhi a walkthrough history There are many where the monuments not only sit pretty in their manicured surroundings but have immense historical value Although not laid out like the Mughal gardens of say Srinagar they have a certain charm to their meandering layouts The most beautiful bit is that in every season one sees some or the other tree flowering My favourite for all the seasons and reasons of the heart is the Lodhi garden Back in the pre pollution days it used to be my evening dose of fresh air It has the octagonal tomb of Mohammed Shah circa on a mound looking imposing The Bara Gumbad with its adjoining remains of a mosque faces the Shisha Gumbad Both straddle the middle of a mildly undulating path A miniature walled park within the park complete with its own pint sized monument sits close to these two housing a rose garden One of my favourite parts is the stone bridge at the end of the pond near the geese enclosure It arches gracefully just so Poetic place to watch the sun go down over the battlements surrounding the tomb of Sikandar Lodhi dating back to the th century The other is the slope between the Bara Gumbad and the pond The perfect place to relive one s childhood and take a roll down Not that the gradient will let you get too far In spring this portion is a sea of colours and the place to have a picnic sun yourself watch couples get their pre nuptial photo shoot or catch the odd powers that be re energize themselves with their daily dose of Vitamin D and power walk To be concluded
