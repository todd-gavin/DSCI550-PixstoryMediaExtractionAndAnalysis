#2 Cesc Fabregas
Francesc “Cesc” Fabregas was the youngest Arsenal debutant and goalscorer at 16 years old, and probably the most clever and technically adept player the club has seen. He is regarded as one of the greatest midfielders of the Golden era of Spanish football. The 2005 FA Cup final victory against Manchester United marked his rise to glory. It was after the exit of Patrick Vieira when the Spaniard really came to the fore and proved his mettle with a stellar performance against Italians in the Champions League.
In 2008, he was declared PFA Young Player of The Year and assumed captainship of the club. He played an instrumental role in achieving Euro 2008 and FIFA World Cup victory with Spain. The premier centre-forward made 303 appearances for the Gunners.

#1 Patrick Vieira 
Top on our list is Patrick Vieira, Arsenal’s finest and the ire of other Premier League clubs. The 6’4” Frenchman of strong stature, under Wenger’s tutelage, blossomed into one of the world’s greatest in his position and lead Arsenal to its invincible glory. During his nine-year stint in the Premier League, he established himself as a predominant box-to-box midfielder.
He played 406 matches for the club scoring 33 goals. 
The goals weren’t frequent but they were spectacular when they arrived. His aggressive and highly competitive style of play enabled him to excel as captain from 2002 until his departure in 2005. Following retirement, in 2013, he took charge as the Football Development Executive of Manchester City, a role that was in fact created specifically for him. He now manages Crystal Palace.
He will forever be remembered as one of the most astute minds and a formidable force in football.
