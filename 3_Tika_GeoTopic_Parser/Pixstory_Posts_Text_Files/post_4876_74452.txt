Whenever somebody talks about Bengalis the food becomes a part of it and there are certain stereotypes which come along No we Bengalis don t eat fish for every meal The truth is we don t even eat fish everyday and how sweet Bengali sweets are Well that is what makes us and our language the sweetest Keeping the stereotypes away the reality of Bengali cuisine is absolutely rich and distinct serving a gamut of flavors The rich history and different rulers have added to the distinct taste and flavors in our cuisine The rule of Nawabs in Bengal has deeply influenced Bengali food which is a combination of subtle and fiery flavours There are certain European influences also like the snack food tradition and foods like chops and cutlets that are British in origin but are prepared and served in most Bengali households Although I m not from Bengal I m a Probashi Bangali which means non resident Bengalis who live outside the state of Bengal But I do take a lot of pride in our culture and food and why should I even not There are many reasons for that and obviously we Bengali people are artistic and so is our food Although I do understand where the stereotype of fish with Bengali households comes from it s the geographical and climatic conditions of the land Historically the main source of protein in Bengal was not suited to growing dal which supplies protein to most Indians Habits do eventually become tradition and tradition becomes a culture that further governs the behavior of society as a whole But how can I even deny Fish is the healthiest source of protein along with having Omega fatty acids thus making us smarter although these are just rumours but maybe not you can see the history Although there are many other fish eating states in the country Bengalis get single handedly carved out for eating fish Not that we mind the stereotype because we know we make our fish the best but our cuisine varies a lot more and is absolutely rich and diverse way more and beyond just eating fish just like our culture
