It is a difficult task for the committee to bring attention to the events that happened more than a year ago. The committee opened by seeking to tug the American public back to that brutal day with footage of the attackers marching up to the Capitol and shoving windows to get in, overwhelming Capitol Police officers.

Committee members in the coming days will show how Trump tried to sabotage elections in favour of him. “President Trump ignored the rulings of our nation’s courts,” Cheney said. “He ignored his campaign leadership.” They played a video of Trump’s attorney general, William P. Barr, who told the committee he resigned in the final month of the administration in part because Trump was trying to grapple his way to stay in power: “I made it clear I did not agree with the idea of saying the election was stolen and putting out this stuff, which I told the president was bullshit,” Barr said.

On Wednesday, the committee will list how Trump “corruptly planned” to replace top Justice Department officials with his allies, who wanted to uphold investigations of baseless election fraud claims in states like Georgia.

Later, the committee will spend put substantial pressure on Trump and his allies put on Pence to overturn the election results on that day, something Pence himself said was “wrong.” They’ll also talk about how Trump “corruptly pressured” state legislators and election officials to alter election results, and will shed new light on the Trump campaign’s undertakings to set up slates of false electors in states he’d lost.

Finally, the committee will revisit the day of the attack, indicting Trump of having “summoned” right-wing groups to attack the Capitol, then withstanding calls by his allies and family to tell the assailants to go home. And in Cheney’s words, after the attack, White House staff feared that Trump “was too dangerous to be left alone.”

And yes Trump is in big trouble.
