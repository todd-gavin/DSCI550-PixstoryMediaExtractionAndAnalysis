Leaders from all political parties attended an all-party conference that the government held before the opening of the Monsoon session of Parliament.

Senior Union Minister Rajnath Singh, Deputy Leader of the Lok Sabha, BJP Leader in the Rajya Sabha Piyush Goyal, and Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi are the representatives of the government.

There were practically all major party leaders there, including Mallikarjun Kharge, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Jairam Ramesh, and Tiruchi Siva of the DMK, Sudeep Bandyopadhyay of the TMC, and Sharad Pawar of the NCP.

In order to discuss concerns and come to an agreement, the government has a tradition of convening an all-party conference before the commencement of each session.

The opposition will likely push for a debate of the Agnipath project, the economy, and unemployment during the meeting. Introducing the government's legislative agenda is expected.
The Monsoon session of Congress will start on July 18 and end on August 12.

The Congress expressed its severe disapproval of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to skip the all-party meeting that the administration had called in advance of the Monsoon session of Parliament.

The prime minister's absence from the meeting raised questions from Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh.
'All Party Meeting to discuss upcoming session of Parliament has just started, and the Prime Minister as usual is absent,' he tweeted.
