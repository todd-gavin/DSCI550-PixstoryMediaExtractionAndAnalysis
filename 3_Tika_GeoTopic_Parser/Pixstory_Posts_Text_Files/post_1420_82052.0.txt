Rosa Louise McCauley Parks (February 4, 1913 – October 24, 2005) was an American activist in the civil rights movement best known for her pivotal role in the Montgomery bus boycott. 

In 1900, buses were heavily segregated by race in Montgomery: the first four rows of seats were reserved for white passengers. Black passengers could sit in certain designated rows at the back - until white people needed more seats, in which case they were required to make way for them. 

When Rosa was asked to move from her seat in order to accommodate white passengers, she simply refused. The (white) bus driver threatened her with arrest if she would not stand, to which she replied that he could do that. In her autobiography, My Story, she said:

“People always say that I didn't give up my seat because I was tired, but that isn't true. I was not tired physically, or no more tired than I usually was at the end of a working day. I was not old, although some people have an image of me as being old then. I was forty-two. No, the only tired I was, was tired of giving in.” 

That simple act went on to have enormous civil rights ripples: it inspired the black community to boycott the Montgomery buses for over a year. Later, the federal Montgomery bus lawsuit Browder v. Gayle resulted in a November 1956 decision that bus segregation is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
