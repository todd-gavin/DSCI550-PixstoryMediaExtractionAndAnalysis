Growing up in a Bengali family I have always been familiar with Batik It is everywhere from the sarees my Grandmother wore to purses and clutches to table covers and bedsheets Cultural programs like Rabindra Jayanti always calls for Batik sarees kurtas and shawls It is an ancient art the swirl of white creating intricate patterns on the vibrant hued material It is derived from two words namely Amba meaning to write and Titik meaning dots While the origin of Batik is obscure it has been practiced in Egypt Indonesia India and Japan during the last years It is done in three stages first step being drawing the designs on the material with molten wax Then it is dyed Due to the wax the part of the cloth remains the previous colour except some of the colours seep through the cracks in the wax rendering the designs even more unique After it has dried the wax is removed often by boiling the cloth The art of Batik was dying in Bengal But it was revived by Rabindranath Tagore when he returned from Java Indonesia and brought back pieces of the work Thus the study of Batik was introduced in Viswa the Bharati University Rathindranath Tagore son of Rabindranath Tagore learned leatherwork in Europe and introduced leather Batik Another pioneer of Batik was Gauri Bhanja eldest daughter of Nandalal Bose renowned artist and Principal of Kala Bhavan It is definitely a tough art to master but the results are beautiful I hope more people will start appreciating this art and love it as I have
