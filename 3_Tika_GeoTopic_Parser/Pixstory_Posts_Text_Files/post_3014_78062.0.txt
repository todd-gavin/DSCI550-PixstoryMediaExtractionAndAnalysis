Italian President Sergio Mattarella has been elected to a second term after country’s lawmakers elected him after a complicated process that resulted in eight rounds of voting.

Mattarella, 80, was widely expected to retire and a new president expected to take his place. But Italian politics has seen so many changes in the the last few weeks that Mattarella was considered the safest bet to continue in the largely ceremonial post. Even though he led in a few rounds, the 80-year-old president kept saying he didn’t want a second term. But he was still elected for another seven-year term.

Till a few days back, former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was considered one of the frontrunners until he decided to quit after failing to garner enough voters in his favor. Berlusconi gave a reason that not many people believe to be true. In a meeting of right-wing leaders, He claimed that he was dropping out as a “national responsibility.” “Today, Italy needs unity,” he said and explained that the ongoing coronavirus pandemic was the main reason.

And Mattarella may have been the right choice. 

Premier Mario Draghi, who indicated his willingness to become the president, was considered a favourite. But many politicians feared that if he becomes the president, the country could be thrown into a political crisis and that it may have to go into a snap poll for which not many parties were ready.

Draghi has been widely credited for stabilising the country's politics and economy while leading a coalition government. Draghi may still become the President if Mattarella resigns early from his second term. But that is a possibility only after the general elections in early 2023.

Matterella emerged as the consensus candidate and that in itself is an achievement for a country that is deeply divided on political lines.
