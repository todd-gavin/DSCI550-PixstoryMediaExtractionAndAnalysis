Earth set a new record on 29th July by completing a rotation 1.59 milliseconds faster than its standard 24 hours.

The speed of the planet's rotation has been increasing recently for reasons unknown.

This isn't new as Earth has been speeding up for quite some time, in the year 2020, the shortest month was recorded since the 1960s. July 19 2020 was 1.47 milliseconds shorter.

Although we don't know for certain the reasons behind this phenomenon. Some scientists believe that Earth has been exhibiting an increased rotation pace because of climatic changes which are going through devastating changes, tidal movements, and processes in its core. 

Others claim that the movement of the planet's geographic poles across its surface might be responsible. This phenomenon is called the Chandler wobble and is similar to the quivering of a spinning top when it starts gaining momentum or becomes slower.

What exactly are the reasons behind this & how it will affect the planet and its inhabitants is yet unknown.
