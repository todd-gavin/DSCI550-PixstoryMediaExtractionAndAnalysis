July 4th – also known as Independence Day – marks the day in 1776 when the Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, signaling the official separation of the 13 original colonies from Great Britain amid the Revolutionary War.

Since that day, July 4, 1776 has been considered America’s “birthday,” making her 246 years old today. The day has been a federal holiday in the U.S. since 1870, though celebrations go back to the 18th century and the American Revolution, according to History.com.

Before the American Revolution, colonists would annually celebrate the king's birthday with processions, bonfires, and bell ringing. The same items were used to commemorate the new nation's declaration of independence from England. 

The custom of lighting off fireworks on July 4th is said to have started in Philadelphia on July 4, 1977, when a ship fired off a 13-gun salute in honour of the 13 colonies. The Sons of Liberty lit off fireworks that same evening above Boston Commons. 

After the War of 1812, the custom of commemorating July 4th expanded and spread throughout the nation. 

Independence Day is observed with fireworks, parties, and parades, much like it was during its inception.
