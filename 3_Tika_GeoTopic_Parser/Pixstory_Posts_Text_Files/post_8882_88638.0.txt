An experiment in Dyarchy and it's failure continues....

His word on this subject undoubtedly will be a word of an independent observer and may I request that you should call him and satisfy yourself whether the Government did not do all that was humanly possible to do to stop the communal trouble and the process of mutual killing, whether of Hindus and Sikhs by Muslims or of Muslims by Hindus and Sikhs. If they were unsuccessful in their efforts it was mainly due to circumstances outside their control. 

“His Highness and his Ministers have always believed that Hindus and Muslims must live like brothers in the State. 

“May I ask you in the interests of justice and fairplay and on principles of ahinsa whether in these circumstances you were right in saying what you said in the prayer speech above cited? I may also say that if the line of reasoning adopted by you is sound then His Highness and myself are willing to be tried before an impartial tribunal along with all the heads of Governments where such massacres took place, namely the Governments of East Punjab, West Punjab, the Government of Delhi, the Government of Bihar and the Government of Bengal and some other states. If all these Heads of Governments are tried by an impartial tribunal, I have no hesitation in saying that the Jammu and Kashmir administration of the time will come out of the ordeal best of all the governments where similar events took place. I do not for a moment say that what happened here was justified because similar events happened elsewhere, but I do say that the situation in the whole country on these matters should be viewed with one eye and a particular State should not be picked out for special treatment. I am sure in the light of facts stated above you will make amends and apply a healing balm to the agony that your post-prayer speech has caused to His Highness and myself.
