Cholito Simeone with today&#39;s hat-trick scored against Venice became the Argentine footballer to have scored the most goals in the five major European leagues Even better than a champion like Lionel Messi this year at PSG who instead of goals scored only in Ligue and others in the Champions League Simeone ahead for now also of Lautaro Martinez who stops in Serie A and Paulo Dybala with goal quota with the Juventus shirt At the end of the match Cholito did not hide the emotion for his personal hat-trick after a period not easy that saw him without goals for well consecutive games
