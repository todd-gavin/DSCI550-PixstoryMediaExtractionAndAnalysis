"One is not born but rather becomes a woman."
These lines remain so vivid that I feel it was just yesterday when I was savouring Simone de Beauvoir's writing.
It startles me how well she manifests it by putting it all correctly. 
People have always found their way to define femininity for a woman. Besides what is given to her innately and biologically, most other things are foisted and forced.
"Femininity does not arise from biology, psychology, or intellect differences. Instead, femininity is a construction of civilization, reflecting not "essential" differences in men and women but differences in their situations. The situation determines character, not the other way around. The woman is not born fully formed; her upbringing gradually shapes her. Biology does not define what makes a woman a womanâ€”a woman learns her role from men and others in society. A woman is not born passive, secondary, and nonessential, but all the forces in the external world have conspired to make her so. Every individual self, regardless of gender, is entitled to subjectivity; only outside influences have conspired to rob women of this right. Destiny is not a cosmic force but a human choice resulting from culture and circumstance."
