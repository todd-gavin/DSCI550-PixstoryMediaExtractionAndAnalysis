The Swedish striker has already spent time in the US at the LA Galaxy and could retrace the footsteps if a suitable opportunity is presented. 


The Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic is not ruling out the possible return to the US soil at some stage in his footballing career, with some quizzed comments on his link to play at Inter Miami. 

An evergreen frontman who is currently in Europe with AC Milan has previously spent two years in the US with LA Galaxy hitting 53 goals in 58 appearances between 2018 and 2019. 


It has been suggested that with injuries catching up on him and contract running down, at San Siro retracing footsteps to the United States could be made in 2022, with a potential reunion with his former PSG teammate David Beckham in Florida. 


Could Ibrahimovic return to MLS?

Quizzed by ESPN on whether the football world could see a possible return of the Swedish striker to the Sunshine State he said, “Maybe if I come back I’ll have my own club. Where I go, I am the boss. So that will not change.”


Did Ibrahimovic enjoy his days in America?

The 40-year-old frontman has never been one to operate in anybody’s shadow with it clear that any return to the States would require him to be given plenty of freedom.

He was allowed to do that in Los Angeles, but a man that has won major trophies in England, Spain, Netherlands, Italy and France was not entirely taken with his experience of celebrity in Hollywood. 

Ibrahimovic added about his experience in America, “I like people when they hate you because then they bring out the best in you.”


While speculating a return to the States with a new contract still up for grabs at Series-A title-chasing Milan, Ibrahimovic appears to be in no rush to hang up his boots.
