The toxic Targaryens and their dragons are returning.
After almost a decade of keeping fans riveted with numerous plot twists, Game of Thrones came to an end with Season 8 in 2019. The conclusion was unanimously slammed as the show seemed to have forgotten its own plot elements from the previous seasons and was perceived as incredibly rushed. Nevertheless, House of the Dragon, a prequel series, might just heal those old wounds. The new series focuses on the Targaryen family history, and is set around two centuries before the original.
We will witness the Civil War that came to be known as the Dance Of The Dragons, and it is touted to be one of the most fascinating, and bloody periods of the dynastyâ€™s history. 
Episode 1 titled "The heirs of the Dragon" was packed to the core, it got everything right, the legacy of Targareyns, the grandiosity of the Dragons and the incestuous relationships too.
The episode had a lot of uncomfortable violent moments, none coming close to the gruesome birth scene, I'll spare you the details, but nothing could've made me ready for the twist at the end.
Towards the end of the episode King Viserys changed his mind and declared his daughter Rhaenrya Targaryen to be his heir rather than his younger brother Daemon Targaryen. While revealing the same to her daughter, he also told her of an ancient Targaryen secret and why Aegon conquered the seven kingdoms.
Aegon had a prophetic dream, where he saw a long night that would engulf every living being and a darkness that would start rising as the Long winter arrived. Aegon knew that with the dragons they could unite all the living to fight against the eternal darkness. Viserys also said that this secret has been passed down from a Targaryen king to their heir so that at the right time, they can stand up to fight.
MY MIND WAS BLOWN AT THAT MOMENT!!!!! House of the Dragon will surely be a great show, if the pilot is any indication
