Chris Richards, a defender for the United States, has joined Crystal Palace from Bayern Munich on a five-year deal, the two clubs announced on Wednesday. 

As per TOI, the deal's financial specifics were kept confidential. According to the BBC, Palace will initially pay 8.5 million pounds ($10.33 million) for the 22-year-old centre back, with add-ons bringing the total to 11 million pounds. 

“I'm really excited for it," Richards told Palace's website. The kind of project I've seen (attracted me). It's a lot of young players but also young players who have a lot of fight. Palace is a club that seems like they're always fighting." 

After making his senior debut in 2020, the adaptable defender earned 10 games for the Bavarian team. He played 34 times in all competitions while on loan at Hoffenheim for the second half of the 2020–21 season and the entire previous season.
