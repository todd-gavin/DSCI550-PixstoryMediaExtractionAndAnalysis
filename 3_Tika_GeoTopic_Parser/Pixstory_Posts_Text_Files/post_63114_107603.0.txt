Have you ever heard someone say, "Oh, fudge!" when they've made a mistake? The rich candy-like confection known as fudge, like the Slinky, Post-It note, potato chips, and penicillin, is thought to have been created by accident. According to mythology, a confectioner made a mistake while making caramel, but ended up with something as delicious. On June 16, National Fudge Day, we commemorate this pleasant accident. Fudge has a long history with female scholars, dating back to the late 1800s and early 1900s, when recipes for it spread like wildfire among students at women's colleges like Vassar, Wellesley, and Smith. For the Vassar Senior Auction in 1890, one student made 30 pounds of the stuff!
