Climate change is the most pressing concern threatening the very existence of Mother Earth She feels stressed due to environmental damages on many fronts The once fertile land is increasingly infertile Industrial pollution has reached alarming levels Vegetation cover has decreased Animal are dying Birds are getting extinct Mother Earth wants us to act fast and act on many fronts She wants us to work for increasing forest cover She wants us to preserve protect and promote our animals and birds She wants us to go for renewable energy like solar energy This will help protect the fossil fuels She wants us to be serious about saving our sources of water like glaciers This is possible only if we start thinking seriously about global warming She wants us to work on preventing river pollution and save them from metamorphosing into drainage lines She wants us to work on alternative solutions to industrial pollution that is the source of many a problems around us Look at the painting Don t you feel that Mother Earth is stressed and unhappy Don t you feel that she has too many tasks to protect herself Don t you feel she is suffering from existential dilemma If there is one lesson that we can draw from the painting it is that we need to work in multiple fronts to save the Mother Earth and our own human civilisation Let us help Mother Earth and ourselves Let us pledge ourselves towards sustainable development
