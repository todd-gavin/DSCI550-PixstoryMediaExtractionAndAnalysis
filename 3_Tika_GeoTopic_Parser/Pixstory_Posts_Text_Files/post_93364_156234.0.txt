Hello everyone!
I'm Punya Aggarwal. I'm a very fun and chilled out person. I like making new friends, going on vacations, discovering new places and watch movies. I also binge watch a lot of Netflix and amazon prime. My current favourite is 'Mismatched'. Prajataka Koli, my favourite youtuber has done fantastically well in this series. I also like to read, my favourite author of all times is Jane Austen. 
I'm a very patient and fun loving person. I love being kind to animals. I also have a pet dog. My aim in life is to always enjoy and help as much people as I can.
