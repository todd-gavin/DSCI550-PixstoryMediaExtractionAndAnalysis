Dermot Mulroney, well known for his role as Julia Roberts' closest friend in My Best Friend's Wedding, has signed on to join the cast of Spyglass Media and Paramount Pictures' next Scream sequel. 

Hollywood Reporter said that the new film will begin filming this summer, following the violent success of the fifth edition, which grossed more than $81 million domestically and $140 million internationally when it was released in January. 

Melissa Barrera, Jasmin Savoy Brown, Mason Gooding, and Jenna Ortega are among those returning to face the blade of the killer known as Ghostface, with Hayden Panettiere, who starred in 2011's Scream 4, reprising her role in the slasher film franchise. 

The plot for the forthcoming film is being kept under wraps. But, but the companies said the new feature “continues with the four survivors of the Ghostface killings as they leave Woodsboro behind and start a fresh chapter.”
