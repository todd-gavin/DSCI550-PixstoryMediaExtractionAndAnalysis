When we talk about cancer we often think about its symptoms and we will be aware about the most common ones like a lump or so But in certain cancer types the symptoms may not be visible and so some will be detected through variation in our blood results or while we undergo endoscopy So a new research gives a light on how we can detect the symptoms of pancreatic cancer which is often a deadly form of a cancer The researchers says that their findings shows that gallstones could be a warning sign for the aggressive form of the cancer PDAC is like the most common type of pancreatic cancer that accounts for more than percent of the cases It becomes fatal as it gets diagnosed the disease might have spreaded up and have reached its lager stages Pancreatic cancer can be difficult to diagnose and then chances of survival are slim said Dr Marianna Papageorge the study s lead researcher and research fellow at Boston Medical Center in a statement Our findings suggest that gallstone disease may be a way to better diagnose this type of cancer meaning we could save more lives The study explained further The researchers identified people with PDAC and compared them with an average of people per year from the database percent of the people were diagnosed with gallstone disease before getting diagnosed with PDAC percent among removed their gallbladders And among the non cancer patients percent had gallstone and percent have removed their gallbladders Gallstone disease does not cause pancreatic cancer but understanding its association with PDAC can help combat the high mortality rate with pancreatic cancer by providing the opportunity for earlier diagnosis and treatment Papageorge said Sources
