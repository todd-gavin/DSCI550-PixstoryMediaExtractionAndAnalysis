As the mid-term elections pave their way in the upcoming month, there has been much chaos about Biden's position in the election.
President Joe Biden has been a high-profile surrogate or, to say, campaign anchor for House, Senate and gubernatorial candidates. But the question is whether his party candidates want to lean on him for the election.
Although less than least responded in support of president Biden, there has been a huge decry and reluctance to choose Biden because he has not proven him enough.
There won't be any medium left that hasn't traduced or attacked him. According to an analysis by the Wesleyan Media Project, he has been attacked in televised ads more than Obama in 2010 Or Trump in 2018. 
Not even 5 % of ads mention Biden with a positive outlook. The co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project said, “From the few ads that mention Biden in a positive way, it’s not as if he’s featured in the ad themselves with the candidate walking down the White House lawn with the president. It’s pretty much the text itself and in a litany of the other things the candidate is supporting. We treat that as a positive mention, but it’s not exactly an embrace of him or his leadership.”
His growing unpopularity can be blamed on the current critical situation in America; the reasons could be many, as Biden is down in polls, he has inflation. In addition, there are a lot of former president supporters criticizing him. Besides all, he has not made himself a legitimate president.
So the question remains whether the party's candidates would lean on him and whether he will be able to gain the correct popularity through his work and campaigns.
