When the peer group s ideology is positive peer pressure can be helpful to an individual Peer pressure is a good thing because it can help you conform to social norms and conform to the opinions of those around you When you re in a situation where everyone around you is pressuring you to do something it can be difficult to resist This pressure makes it easier for you to follow the group and stay on track It also gives you an incentive to perform well as failure to comply with the group may result in social exclusion The key thing to remember is that peer pressure doesn t always have to be negative in fact it can actually be motivating and inspiring If done correctly peer pressure can actually lead to better performance and better decisions Peer pressure is a powerful force that helps you in many ways First of all it can encourage you to try new things and take risks Peer pressure also makes it possible for you to conform to social norms without feeling guilty or ashamed And finally it can help you learn faster because when people are pressured to do something they typically learn more quickly than when they re not being pressured As long as you know what is right and what is wrong you shouldn t have too much problem with it
