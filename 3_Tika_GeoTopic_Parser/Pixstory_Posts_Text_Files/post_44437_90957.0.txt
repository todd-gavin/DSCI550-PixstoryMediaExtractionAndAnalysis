Iran generally barred Iran Women Spectators from football and other sports stadium since it was established in 1979.
 
Iran once again denied entry to the Women spectators from watching an International game leaving hundreds of ticketed fans locked out. The World Cup Qualifier against Lebanon and won 2-0 at the Imam Reza Stadium. “Around 2,000 Iranian women, who bought tickets for the Iran-Lebanon match were present at the front gates of the stadium but were denied entry,” ISNA news agency said.

The Islamic Republic has barred female spectators from football and other sports stadiums since it was established in 1979. 

Clerics, who played a major role in decision-making, argue women must be shielded from the masculine atmosphere and sight of semi-clad men. 

But world’s football governing body FIFA had ordered the Islamic Republic to allow women to view football matches without any restrictions and in big numbers. This must be determined according to the demand for the tickets. 

The FIFA directives, threatening Iran’s decision on account of allowance of female spectators to the stadium, took a leap when a fan, Sahar Khodayari set herself on fire in fear of being jailed after trying to watch the match in disguise. 

Her death sparked an outcry resulting in calls for Iran to be banned from matches and their matches being boycotted. 

FIFA had been pushing for years for Iran to open the gates for women spectators, but Tehran had allowed only a limited number of female spectators until 2019.
