Because countries like China and India are being used by USA to do this? America is what goes into these countries with their imperialist ideas and destroy them, later wave it off like you just did.
Colonialism and the industrial revolution both contributed to the current riches and industrialization of certain nations. In order to make the poorer countries in Africa, South America, and Asia poorer, they took their minerals, lumber, gems, and people before leaving them to fend for themselves with crumbling infrastructure, a population that is largely uneducated, and internal strife. As a result, they used fossil fuels extensively for at least 200 years before these countries. not to mention the external conflict brought on by treating them like Cold War pawns.
Therefore, it is only fair that the wealthier countries invest in the developing world to assist them create renewable resources and acquire technologies so they can advance while producing less pollution.
The benefits of historical fossil fuel burning have gone to the wealthiest nations, who are also the most capable of taking effective action. The harms, however, have disproportionately affected the poorest nations and the least responsible individuals.
It comes as no surprise that many sceptics of climate science also defend or deny colonialism. They worship nothing but unbridled capitalism and won't listen to arguments against it.
