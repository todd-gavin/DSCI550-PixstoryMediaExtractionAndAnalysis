A week ago Sandro Tonali decided with a goal in full stoppage time Lazio Milan A vital goal in the Scudetto race of the Rossoneri who rose to the top of the standings over Inter then stopped during the week by Bologna After the match decided by the classy midfielder, rapper Dani Faiv had published in his stories a little spoiler of his new song dedicated to Tonali Then on Friday night the artist officially released the song now available in all digital stores Rossoneri midfield author of perhaps the most important goal of the season and grew up dreaming of one day wearing the Devil&#39;s shirt as also told in the song Sweat, blood and effort I am Sandro Tonali I run without ever stopping Now if I enter the field there is no more game I&#39;m branding it I keep Sandro Tonali for the rest of my life
