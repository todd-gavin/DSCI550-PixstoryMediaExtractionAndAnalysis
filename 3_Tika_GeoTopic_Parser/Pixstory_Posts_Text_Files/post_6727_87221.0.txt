FACT CHECK

Through reverse-image search, Alt News found that this image is from a press conference held on April 12, 2021, by the Uganda police force where the official spokesperson for the Uganda police Fred Enanga was demonstrating the use of a catapult.

The press conference was about the Directorate of Crime Intelligence confiscating several factory-made catapults during its intelligence operations, that had been imported by “anti-social elements” as tools of violence. The catapults were capable of firing metallic projectiles or bearings and thus posed a serious danger to the safety and security of Ugandans. The police had urged citizens to be vigilant against such acts of violence.

Prominent Ugandan news broadcaster UBC Television Uganda also covered this news.

Thus, an image of the official police spokesperson of Uganda, Fred Enanga, conducting a press conference regarding the use of catapults by “anti-social elements” was circulated with the false claim that he hit a journalist for asking an “irrelevant question”.
