In an official letter, US President Joe Biden informed the heads of the House of Representatives and the US Senate that he intends to withdraw the title of "America's main ally outside of NATO" from Afghanistan.

The Obama administration had granted this title to Afghanistan in 2011.

This position is given by the United States to countries that have strategic business relations with the United States but are not members of NATO.

According to the Associated Press, Hillary Clinton, the US Secretary of State at the time, after arriving in Kabul on January 17, 2011, in a joint press conference with Hamid Karzai, the President of Afghanistan at the time, announced that the US government, in order to increase the level of cooperation between the two countries, would include Afghanistan in America's allies are outside the NATO organization.

He described this action of the Obama administration as a sign of "America's strong commitment to the future of Afghanistan".

In Asia, major countries such as Israel, Qatar, Pakistan, Jordan, Kuwait, etc. are the main allies of America outside of NATO.
