My favourite place is nature. Nature serves as a catalyst for my creative thinking, which leads to improved writing. Even if I'm not expressly writing about nature, by the time I get back home and am in front of my computer, I am typically free from whatever was impeding my flow of ideas. I come back more attuned to my surroundings and conscious of my connection to something far bigger than myself. I am reminded of who I am when I am in the natural environment, and this prevents me from attempting to be someone I am not. And I believe that's the secret to effective writing: expressing your ideas in a genuine manner that is true to who you are.
