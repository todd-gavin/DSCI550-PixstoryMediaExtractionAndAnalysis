IMPORTANT HEART HEALTHY DIETARY ADVICE
Supplement the diet
I hard to get all the nutrients we need from our diet, so to be sure you are not deficient, supplement
your diet with a good-quality daily multivitamins. Essential fats can also be supplemented ili the
form of fish oils. However please consult your doctor before starting any supplements.
Eliminate allergens from the diet
If you suspect intolerance to a particular food - for example, if you react badly after eating the same
thing or seem to crave a particular food-eliminate it from diet and monitor the reaction. If after two
weeks you see no difference in behaviour / symptoms reintroduce it and see if there's a reaction. If not then try different suspected food group until you find what's bothering you (or find that food's not
in fact the problem).


Some ideas for healthy eating:

Breakfast - Get accustomed to eating breakfast no matter how early you have to leave the house. 

Some options are- vegetable sandwich, cornflakes, dalia porridge, oats, cheese,sandwich, idlis, poha, upma, omlette-bread, french toast etc.

Lunch - Most people eat lunch at their work place, so aim at being creative so that you can pack food which is nutritious yet attractive. Mix vegetable pulao, stuffed vegetable parathas. stuffed dal rolis, vegetable tikkis with whole wheat bread, chicken or fish sandwich can be
offered.
Healthy snacks - Should be simple and readily available. Replace chiwada / wafers with other
nutritious snacks, Fresh fruit (for faddy eaters it often helps to cut fruit into pieces and they will
gradually eat it without noticing). Sprouted dal made into a bhel is good. A cup of milk can be
replaced with a milkshake. Dhoklas, idlis etc. are healthier options.

Dinner - Should be a family time and not TV time or any other activity like reading. Eat slowly
and savour each bite. Don't get habituated to eating a lot of potatoes as a part of their daily diet.
