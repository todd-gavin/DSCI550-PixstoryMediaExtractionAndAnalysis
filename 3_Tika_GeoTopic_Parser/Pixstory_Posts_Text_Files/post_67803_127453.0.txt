Here, in this article, we bring you a list of five unfortunate incidents in the history of cricket which took all of us by storm.

Death of Phillip Hughes

Phillip Hughes, famously known as Phil, was an Australian left-handed opening batsman who made his Test Debut in 2009 at the age of 20. At the age of 19, he became the youngest batsman to score a century in the Sheffield Shield Game. It came as a shock when he died at the age of 25. Cricket was never seen as a sport which would cause serious injuries or death, unlike other sports like boxing. On 25 November 2014, Phil was batting for South Australia against New South Wales in a Sheffield Shield Game. He got hit on the neck by a bouncer. Despite all the protection, he had to face a bad blow. Without any delay, he was rushed to the hospital but could not survive more than two days. That day is considered as the black day in the cricket world.

Kapil Dev’s Unrecorded Knock

The third edition of the cricket world cup tournament, which embarked India’s first ever winning moment, also reminds of Kapil Dev’s unbeaten knock of 175 runs from 138 deliveries comprising 16 fours and six sixes. This was the first-ever ODI century by an Indian and the highest individual ODI score, at the time when matches were for 60 overs. It was a do or die situation for team India. If this match against Zimbabwe was lost, India would have never created History. It is unfortunate not to have a live recording of such a great match. Kapil’s innings was never recorded on camera because of a nationwide strike by sole broadcasters BBC back then. Media didn't cover the two matches played on that day, the other one was Australia vs West Indies at Lord's.
