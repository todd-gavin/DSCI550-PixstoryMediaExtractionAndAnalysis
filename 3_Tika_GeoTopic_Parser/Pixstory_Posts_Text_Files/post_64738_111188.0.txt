About 18 years ago, Borrusia Dortmund had to take a loan of 2 Million Euros from their Der Klassier rivals Bayern Munich just to pay their player wages. It was a phenomenal situation, Firstly because of all the teams it was Bayern who was helping and secondly, it was because today BvB are one of the most well run clubs in Europe.

So, How did they end up in this situation?

Under Ottmar Hitzfeld Dortmund won the Bundesliga in 1995 and the Champions League in 1997 buying Matthias Summer, Riedle, Andreas Moller all for about 4 million each and Heiko Herrlich for about 5 million. It was a time backed by heavy spending and generous wages. The problem Dortmund faces was the inability to produce capable homegrown players. As a result, the club spent      
extravagantly to capitalise and sustain on their recent success. 

In 1998, the club spent 13.8 million. In 1999, the spent 24 million and continued to break the German transfer record twice in the next two years. In the four years between 1998-2001, the club spent a humongous amount of 170 million and only recouped 38 million. Further on, the club also increased the stadium capacity after winning the Bundesliga in 95, which was all fine if the success on the pitch continued. Spoiler alert, it didn’t. After 6 years in charge Hitzfeld stepped aside and toke the role of director of football. 
And Chaos unfolded, BvB had a total of 5 coaches in charge between 1997 and 2000, and the club wouldn’t qualify for the champions league till 2002. Things on the pitch weren’t good too, there were a lot of faction in between the squad. In an attempt to increase short term revenue, the club had “used every trick in the book to keep the club afloat and hide the true extent of the crisis” according to Rafael Honigstein.
