In Yale economics student Fred Smith wrote a paper about the automation of society and the transportation of goods While business was booming the company struggled to keep pace with rising fuel costs Suffocating in debt FedEx resorted to extreme measures such as pilots using personal credit cards to pay for fuel It didn t matter nothing could stop the bleeding In FedEx had just left in the bank What does one do when they need to create thousands of dollars out of thin air Take a trip to Sin City and roll the dice Smith withdrew the company s remaining cash and headed to Las Vegas for a night His game of choice Blackjack Fortune favors the bold and Smith had a hot hand that night hours and later Fred wired all of the funds back to FedEx s bank account and they were able to keep the lights on for another week The wasn t decisive but it was an omen that things would get better Smith said After his Vegas detour Smith successfully raised M in additional capital and they turned profitable in In an essay published by Forbes Smith wrote No business school graduate would recommend gambling as a financial strategy but sometimes it pays to be a little crazy early in your career Obviously management execution played an outsized role in FedEx s success but luck favours the brave Story of Tesla and Apple are part of folklore In just one month before the Dot Com crash Amazon sold M in convertible bonds on the European markets Had the e commerce giant waited just two weeks later it would likely be remembered as another Pets com One hiccup in Tesla s production a bit of pettiness from Bill Gates or a week s hesitation and we could live in a world with no Teslas no iPhones and no Amazon Prime Instead these three companies are worth trillions of dollars Incidentally Fred Smith has now stepped down and appointed and appointed Raj Subramaniam as his successor
