Asterigos Curse of the Stars is an action RPG inspired from Greek and Roman mythology with a Souls like template The game puts you in the strong adventuring boots of Hilda a flame haired young warrior on a quest to save her lost father To do this she must uncover the secrets of Aphes a beautiful city that s been cursed so expect plenty of battles against mutated manticores powerful minotaurs and hideous hydra along the way According to the game s Steam page The gameplay elements inspired by soulslike games alongside a lighter dynamic combat system create a fresh take on the modern action RPG genre providing you with a harmonious difficulty and exploration balance Possessing both martial skills and sorcery Hilda wields a varied arsenal of weapons that are both conventional and magical These range from sword amp shield dual blades spears hammers to magical implements like magic staves and enchanted armlets each with their own distinct move sets and fighting style The game has a flexible fighting style with the player able to switch between fighting styles and mix and match attacks with different weapon combos making it an overall gratifying experience Exploration is highly rewarded and encouraged because much like Dark Souls there is no HUD or mini map to guide the player forcing them to devise their own path Quest markers are also absent which serves as a reminder that games can be completed without these tools but navigational aides are a nice feature Wandering around the streets and corners of Aphes without these devices is able to successfully create a sense of exploring the unknown in a new world where anything could be lurking around the corner be it danger or treasure The game following a Souls like template is challenging enough but for players familiar with the harder Souls like games it isn t all that challenging or presenting anything new Enemy variety is a bit of a problem as it is not much and the enemies themselves are not too challenging making the game feel far too linear and straightforward But for its simplicity Asterigos presents a fun challenge that is still an exhilarating and adrenaline pumping experience Score
