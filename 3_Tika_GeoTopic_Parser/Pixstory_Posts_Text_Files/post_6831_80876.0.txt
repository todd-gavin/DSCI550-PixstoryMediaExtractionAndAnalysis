For the past several weeks, various districts of Karnataka have witnessed protests amid colleges prohibiting students to attend classes wearing hijabs. As Muslim students protest against the ban, Hindu students, several instigated by right-wing outfits, have organised counter-protests which has led the violence to intensify.

During these protests, a video from PES college in Mandya went viral where a group of young men in saffron shawls heckled a Muslim student in a burqa. As they made unprovoked chants of ‘Jai Shri Ram’, the student yelled back ‘Allah-hu-Akbar’ in defiance. The young woman was later identified as Bibi Muskan Khan and her video trended on Twitter with the hashtag #Sherni (lioness).

In the backdrop of this, an image of a woman standing next to Rahul Gandhi is widely being shared across social media platforms with the claim that she’s the “hijab-wearing lioness”. The claims suggest that the widespread protests across Karnataka are planned conspiracies by the Congress party.

The photo is extremely viral on Facebook and is accompanied by the hashtag #ToolKitInAction.

Fact-check
We performed a Google reverse image search on the viral image and found that the photo was uploaded on the official Facebook page of Amba Prasad. Amba Prasad is a Congress MLA from Barkagaon in Jharkhand. The viral photo was clicked in February 2022 when Prasad met Rahul Gandhi along with other Congress MLAs from Jharkhand. Photos of this visit can also be found on the official Twitter handle of the Indian National Congress.
