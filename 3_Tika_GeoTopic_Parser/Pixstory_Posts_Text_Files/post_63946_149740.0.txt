 James Earls Jones, the man behind the iconic voice of Darth Vader and one of Hollywood’s most recognizable voices at the age of 91 years is finally looking to step back from the beloved Star Wars villain. In a report by Vanity Fair, Jones has signed off on archival voice recordings being used by young filmmakers, who plan to recreate Jones’ voice from his previous films for future Lucasfilm projects using artificial intelligence.

As such, he has been actively working with Lucasfilm and Ukrainian company Respeecher on using AI to take his Darth Vader voice and keep it alive through machine learning. Jones’s AI generated Darth Vader voice was seen in the Disney+ series Obi Wan Kenobi. Respeecher uses sound bites to “clone” an actor’s voice, allowing a studio to record new lines without having the actor present.

Matthew Wood, Skywalker Sound’s supervising sound editor, told Vanity Fair that he presented Jones with the option once he “mentioned he was looking into winding down” the role of Darth Vader. The actor first voiced the classic villain in 1977’s Star Wars: A New Hope (then simply titled Star Wars), where the character was physically portrayed by David Prowse, and since then he has appeared as the Sith Lord in various Star Wars related media.
