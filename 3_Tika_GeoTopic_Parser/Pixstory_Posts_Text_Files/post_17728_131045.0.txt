HBO's "House of the Dragon" premiered Sunday. The prequel to "Game of Thrones" brought in 9.99 million viewers for its series premiere. HBO says it drew the largest audience in the pay TV channel's history as well.
"House of the Dragon" is HBO's second-most-watched series of all time. The premiere episode was watched by 2.4 million people, 76% less than "Game of Thrones". The series is based on George R.R. Martin's 2018 novel "Fire & Blood". Leading cast members include Paddy Considine, Matt Smith, Olivia Cooke and Emma D'Arcy.
"It was wonderful to see millions of ‘Game of Thrones’ fans return with us to Westeros last night,” said Casey Bloys, chief content officer of HBO and HBO Max. “‘House of the Dragon’ features an incredibly talented cast and crew who poured their heart and soul into the production, and we’re ecstatic with viewers’ positive response. We look forward to sharing with audiences what else George, Ryan and Miguel have in store for them this season.”
