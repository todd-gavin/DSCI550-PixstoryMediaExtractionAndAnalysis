It s a time to rejoice from the involvement of many African American qualified lawyers in the judiciary We have judge Rick Lawrence confirmed to the Maine Court Lawrence has an experience of years in the high court He got a unanimous confirmation vote reflecting his acceptance He also had given a powerful testimony before the legislature s joint standing committee on judiciary His family history of being displaced during world war and the discrimination they experienced spurred his interest in court cases and the judiciary He believes his confirmation would affirm more diversity in the judiciary He said My interest in the law and thoughts about someday becoming a lawyer grew out of those roots According to BDN Gov Janet Mills who nominated Lawrence said she is proud that lawmakers have recognized Judge Lawrence s extensive legal experience measured temperament strong intellect and proven commitment to upholding the law and administering justice impartially More and more representation in the judiciary by judges is being demanded and being done I believe it s much needed as no one feels left out in any field This diverse representation in Judiciary would boost the confidence of people in the judicial system of our country What s your take on this
