One week after removing the last of its Covid restrictions, Los Angeles officials are concerned about the spread of the more contagious BA.2 variant, an increase in cases, and looming school and religious holidays.

"While outbreaks in many sectors remain low," the County Public Health Department stated on Friday, "gatherings for Ramadan, Passover, Easter, and Spring Break may eventually lead to more cases and outbreaks."

The good news is that, despite rising case and test positivity rates, the new variant, and recently lifted restrictions, hospitalizations and deaths are not increasing.
Since Tuesday, the region's 7-day test positivity has increased by 50%, from 0.8 percent to 1.2 percent today. Even though the percentages are still very low, such a jump in a 7-day average is worth noting.

According to a LADPH statement, "this increase in cases is likely due to the more easily transmitted BA.2 subvariant, which continues to increase in L.A. County."
