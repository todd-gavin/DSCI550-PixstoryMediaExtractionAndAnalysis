The Color Purple by Alice Walker was published in 1982 and is the winner of the prestigious Pulitzer Prize. 

It is an epistolary novel (written in letters) and traces the life of Celie and her sister Nettie. This novel is an important one in the domain of African American literature. It is one of the few novels wherein the character narrating the events of the novel is a black woman. 

The Color Purple brings out beautifully doubly marginalised status of African American women in America. They are not only oppressed by white people but also are a victim of exploitation from patriarchal black men. 

Additionally, the novel also brings out the problematic relationship to the homeland of Africa black people have through the character of Nettie. Although born and bought up in America, black people are constantly reminded that they are “outsiders” and do not truly belong. On the other hand, they are also not fully accepted by Africans for their “Americanness”.

The language is a major theme in the novel. The English used in the novel is not typical English but ‘black English’ per se. The rules of grammar are regularly subverted and the language is broken. This expresses the inner psyche of the characters and their incapability to express the trauma they go through the novel in words. 

In my opinion, the novel is a Bildungsroman that focuses on the financial and psychological growth of its characters. This novel will leave you in tears with a smile on your face and will definitely touch your heart.
