The Premier League season kicked off I'm Early August and just over a month later it has been more than entertaining. It's always interesting to see how each team starts the seasonafter the Summer transfer window to see which teams invested correctly and which didn't.There have been many surprises already this season with many unexpected teams overperforming whilst some of the bigger clubs have struggled to start the season strongly. After these first few weeks of the season, we can now try and predict which teams will finishin the top four and secure a Champions League position for the subsequent season.
It's only fair that we discuss Arsenal first. The Gunners have had the most impressive start to
the season, winning their first five league games. Mikel Arteta's side sit top of the table afterthe Spanish manager has started to repay the trust of the Arsenal fans. Summer signings such as Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko have been instantly slotted into Arsenal'sstarting line-up and have delivered. It is clear that Arteta had a clear plan during the summer transfer window, making the appropriate signings and is now reaping the rewards at the top of the table. If Arsenal continue playing as they are, it's hard seeing Arsenal finishinganywhere outside of the top four meaning the London side will be playing in Europe'sgreatest competition for the first time since Arsene Wenger left the club.
Manchester City currently sit second in the table, just a point behind Arsenal. The current Premier League champions are yet to lose a game this season, but have dropped pointsagainst teams such as Newcastle United and Aston Villa. These were games where youexpected Pep Guardiola's side to pick up all three points, especially against a strugglingAston Villa side.
