MENTAL HEALTH OF MEDICAL STUDENTS 
Mental health struggles come from various causes and have different signs.
“Medical students report higher levels of psychological distress than their same-age peers, despite having similar or healthier profiles than peers at the outset of medical school,” according to a 2018 studyTrusted Source.
The study cited various stressors for medical students, such as:
academic stress
issues with work-life balance
relationship conflicts
poor student guidance or support
volume of information
finances
uncertainty about the future
lack of time to oneself
responsibility
the need to be successful
Medical students’ common mental health challenges include:
anxiety
depression
burnout
How mental health challenges manifest in medical students can vary by individual.
Depression during medical school was already common — and then came the pandemic.
Options for medical students to seek help include:
speaking with a private therapist
consulting with a primary care physician
seeking a counselor through the school’s student health services
talking with a trusted colleague or faculty member
confiding in a family member or friends.
