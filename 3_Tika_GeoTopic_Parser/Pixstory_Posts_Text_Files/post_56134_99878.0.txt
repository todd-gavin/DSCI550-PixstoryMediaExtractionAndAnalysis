‌Relation between Russia and the West is becoming worst day by day and now has come to a point where no amendments can be made. Boris Johnson told LBC "Repentance is going to be very difficult for Vladimir Putin now".
‌
‌When LBC asked the PM of the UK whether Putin could ever be welcomed back on the global stage if he repents, the prime minister said: "Nothing is impossible, I suppose - but I just cannot see for the life of me how we can renormalise relations with Putin now. He [Putin] has grossly violated human rights, international law; he's guilty of the absolutely barbaric onslaught on an innocent country - and to renormalise would be to make the mistake we made in 2014."
‌
‌ US intelligence has warned Putin is preparing for a long war in Ukraine, with even Russian victory in the east of the country - where fierce fighting continues - potentially not ending the conflict.

It comes as the UK has pledged an extra £1.3bn in military support to Ukraine as forces there push back the Russian invasion. We see forces like UK and US strongly aiding Ukraine and promoting war. Can't they try and stop the war? The loss is numerous and it is easy to sit back and enjoy but imagine much living fear and losing their minds to the sounds of weapons every single day! When it comes to the responsibility of displacement and destroying homes of millions of people, Russia will be held accountable and even the UN who seriously couldn't stop it! Of course, Putin will never be a hero or anything of that sort to anyone as he had crossed all the limits.
