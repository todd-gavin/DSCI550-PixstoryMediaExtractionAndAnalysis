Russia, which occupied four of its territories during the attack on Ukraine, has now made an 'official' announcement of joining them with itself. According to media reports, Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a treaty regarding this. It is a case of 'grabbing' the largest territory in Europe since the Second World War. Russia occupied Kherson, Zaporizhzhya, Luhansk and Donetsk in Ukraine.

Earlier, Russia had conducted a so-called referendum in these four regions, in which people were asked whether the people of Ukraine wanted to join Russia. However, many people said that all this was done at 'gun-point', so that it would not result in opposition to Russia.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged all countries of the world to oppose Russia's "fake referendum". However, justifying this, Putin mentioned colonialism in his speech. He said that the Soviet Union was involved in the common struggle of third world countries in the fight against colonialism. India is also included in these countries.

 United States imposed the sanctions on over 1000 Russian individuals and organisations in connection to the Russian invasion on Ukraine. This decision came after Russian President Vladimir Putin at a ceremony Friday announced the annexation of four Ukrainian regions. This included Russia’s Central Bank governor as well as the families of National Security Council members. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said, “We will not stand by as Putin fraudulently attempts to annex parts of Ukraine.” US President Joe Biden said, “Russia is violating international law, trampling on United Nations charter, and showing its contempt for peaceful nations everywhere.
