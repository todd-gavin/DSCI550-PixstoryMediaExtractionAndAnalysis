The film PS-1 rallied well over the weekend with good, healthy growth on Saturday and Sunday. 👍The film dropped only by 30 percent on Monday when compared to Friday and then grew by around 10 percent on Tuesday. On the Dussehra day, Ponniyin Selvan almost matched its Saturday numbers as it grew by a very good 40 percent, to add Rs. 2.25 - 2.55 crore nett. The growth was expected but this level of growth just puts the film in a very good position as it enters week 2. ✅✅The numbers of Ponniyin Selvan Part 1 on Dussehra are higher than the opening day of another Pan-India film Godfather, which has opened between Rs. 75 lakh and 90 lakh on its first Day. It is to be seen how the film trends on Thursday and over the weekend. 🔥🔥🔥The film mustered an opening of around Rs. 1.85 crore nett on its first day in Hindi, which isn't too bad given that the film lacked face value to drive the film in the north and that it was solely dependent on scale and execution.💯
