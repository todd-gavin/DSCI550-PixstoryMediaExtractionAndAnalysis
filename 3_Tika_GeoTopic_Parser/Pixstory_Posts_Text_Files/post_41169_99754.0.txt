Every year on May 12, the anniversary of Florence Nightingale's birth, ICN hosts the celebrations for International Nurses Day. 

ICN has released a collection of case studies submitted by nurses from around the world to highlight the diverse variety of innovative work that nurses conduct on a daily basis. These tales, which were featured on the ICN and IND websites throughout the year, demonstrate the work of nurses throughout the pandemic to care for patients with COVID-19, as well as the full range of nursing that continued to care for those suffering from other conditions. 

ICN reports tell us that the nurses provide accessible, affordable, person-centered, holistic care for everybody, from birth to death, noncommunicable illnesses to infectious disease, mental health to chronic ailments, in hospitals, communities, and homes.

The new theme for International Nurses Day (IND) 2022 was been revealed by the International Council of Nurses (ICN): Nurses: A Leading Voice - To ensure global health, invest in nursing and respect rights, concentrating on the need to protect, support, and invest in the nursing profession to build health systems around the world.

The COVID-19 has revealed flaws in health systems around the world due to underinvestment. In order to reform health systems to fulfil the needs of individuals and communities now and in the future, the topic for IND 2022 emphasises the importance of investing in nursing, building a resilient, highly qualified nursing workforce, and protecting nurses' rights.
