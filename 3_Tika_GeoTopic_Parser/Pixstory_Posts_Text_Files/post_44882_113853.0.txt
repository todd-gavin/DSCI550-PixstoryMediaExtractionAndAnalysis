After rupturing her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) just three days before her nation was
scheduled to begin their European Championship campaign, Spain's star player Alexia Putellas
has been ruled out of Euro 2022.

Spain's chances of winning the tournament have been given a second severe blow as Jenni
Hermoso, the team's all-time leading scorer, was forced to withdraw from the tournament due to
a knee sprain, during training. The 28-year-old had medical examinations in London on Tuesday
afternoon to determine the exact extent of the injury, and the Spanish national team has
revealed she has torn her left ACL.

The national soccer squad of Spain issued the following statement:

"The tests carried out on the Spanish international on the afternoon of this Tuesday, July 5,
2022, at King Edward VII's hospital in London, have confirmed that the captain of the Spanish
Women's National Team suffers a rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee."

The revelation hurts Spain's prospects of winning a significant prize this summer for the first
time in the women's team's history. In 100 games for the national team, Putellas has scored 27
goals. He won the Ballon d'Or in 2021 and is widely recognised as the best player in football.

Along with German Dzsenifer Marozsan and compatriot Hermoso, the Barcelona captain is the
most recent international player to withdraw from Euro 2022 due to an ACL injury.

On Friday
night at Stadium MK, Spain's Euro 2022 campaign gets underway against Finland. Spain is
widely regarded as the favourite.

The Spain team led by Jorge Vilda had intended to contend for the trophy this summer, but they
will now have to do without both their captain and striker Jenni Hermoso. Barcelona will be
saddened by the news as well because it will likely prevent her from playing the full season and
have a huge impact on their forthcoming one.
