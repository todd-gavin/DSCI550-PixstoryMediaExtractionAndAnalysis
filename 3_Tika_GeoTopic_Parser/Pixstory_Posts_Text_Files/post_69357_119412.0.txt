According to officials, a portion of the strategic 270-km Jammu-Srinagar national highway has been reopened for vehicular traffic after being closed early on Wednesday due to mudslides and shooting stones in Ramban district. 

According to reports, authorities permitted stranded cars, including an Amarnath Yatra convoy, to travel towards Kashmir. 

Officials reported that in addition to mudslides brought on by heavy rains, shooting stones also damaged the only all-weather road connecting Kashmir with the rest of the nation at Mehad in Ramban. 

According to them, traffic heading towards Kashmir was permitted once the highway in Mehad was been cleared of debris.
