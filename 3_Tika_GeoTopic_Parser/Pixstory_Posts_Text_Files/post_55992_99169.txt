 Conservatives councillors in the local elections are low this year Less than councillors have won seats and the party lost power over key cities including Westminster conservatives remain in charge mainly on the Brexit backing fringes of London Bexley Bromley and Hillingdon London s case shows that a capital whose representation and political thinking are coming to be yet more at odds with the party governing the country which cannot be good for either in the long run Levelling up is seen as the only route to further electoral success for Boris Johnson but some London Tories are asking whether it is a price worth paying Is one man s political ambition worth the devastation of the party in the capital as levelling up doesn t bring much hope Meanwhile the new Mayor at least in Croydon and winning in Harrow and Enfield shows how tories took power over the broken or flawed administrations So there are changes for Tories in London still they have to work more
