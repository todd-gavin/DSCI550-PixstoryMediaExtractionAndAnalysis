A couple of weeks ago, I came across a beginnersâ€™ guide to Journaling and it has become one of my present hobbies and a stress releaser too. So, I would like to share some tips I came across that might be helpful for other beginners who are facing a problem in starting. (Try it out after reading!!) Lets Learn Together ðŸ˜Š
1.	JUST WRITE!
Even though it seems extremely easy, I want to emphasise how difficult it is to make the first mark in a brand-new notebook. The first piece of advice is to simply begin. It could even be your name. It becomes much easier to continue once you get over the dread of making a mistake in your notebook.
2.	STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS 
Set a timer or a page number goal and write whatever comes to your mind without censoring.
3.	SUM UP YOUR DAY
Often on busy days or when I lack energy to write much, I write just a few words to sum up my day.Â  This could literally be just words, or it could be short sentences or phrases to remember something. Another way to do this is to write out a timeline of the day and try to remember what you were doing that day.
4. BE CREATIVE 
Sometimes there just arenâ€™t words.Â  The good thing is your journal doesnâ€™t need to be just words.Â  You can draw, paint, paste in pictures, use stickers, or really anything youâ€™d like.Â  You could take a pen and scribble on a bad day and just get your feelings out. I find it rewarding to look back on prior journal pages and these can be lots of fun.
