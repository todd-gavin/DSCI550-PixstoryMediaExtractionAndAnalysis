 What is the use of apologising after the damage is done Now you have become answerable for the lives of innocent children and teachers Wasn t the police meant to protect us Why isn t the gun debate reaching anywhere in the US One of the main reasons is the ineptitude of the Police Force We witnessed it in the School shooting The Texas Department of Public Safety admitted that it was the wrong decision for officers to conclude the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School had transitioned from an active shooter situation to a barricaded situation when children were still inside the classroom and at risk When inquired whether the parents of the victims of this week s mass shooting at Robb Elementary School are owed an apology the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety said he knew an apology wouldn t help following the loss of children and two adults If I thought it would help I d apologize Texas DPS Director Steven C McCraw told reporters McCraw had acknowledged that authorities made the wrong decision in not recognizing the attack was still going on inside the fourth grade classroom The incident commander made a misjudgment McCraw said as students lay dying playing dead or calling from inside Rooms and I mean isn t it the police s duty to check on when a complaint is made too when they are aware of such an incident This is a very ridiculous explanation The police force with training and years of experience isn t aware of this situation and how to handle it They must be held responsible so that citizens have faith in them They have to prove themselves worth trusting and assure that they won t leave citizens in havoc and sit back and relax
