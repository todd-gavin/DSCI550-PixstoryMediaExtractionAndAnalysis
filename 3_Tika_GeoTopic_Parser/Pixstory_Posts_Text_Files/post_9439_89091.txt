IFFK charms people world movies and renowned directors alike You would see an auto driver who just dropped a guest at a venue of IFFK standing in the same queue later Kim Ki duk late South Korean film director and screenwriter loved this festival and city spotted anywhere during the season Most celebrities from the world cinema happily come to this small state and attend inaugural functions discussion forums and sometimes receive a prestigious award for their films at the closing ceremony It s a ritual for hotels and food joints in Thiruvananthapuram capital Kerala state to accommodate many regulars and greet new comers every year It s hard to see such a precise functional body like IFFK which never fails in selecting and bringing an impressive collection of world cinema and its creators to a single venue for more than two decades During my four day visit I felt Russian films rule the fest this year and the pandemic affected the film making in most of the countries and many directors sent personal video messages IFFK hardly misses a spotted movie or a director of the year
