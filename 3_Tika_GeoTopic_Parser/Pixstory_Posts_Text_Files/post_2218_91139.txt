Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh which both go to polls in November December this year are ruled by the BJP and extremely crucial for the Congress to win at least one of these to restore some pride that has been badly bruised after its humiliating defeat in the assembly elections in five states For years now the polls in these two states have been bipolar between the BJP and the Congress but this time the entry of the Aam Aadmi Party AAP has made the contest interesting Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal s party is buoyed by the landslide win in Punjab that is a neighbouring state of Himachal Pradesh After its Punjab victory the AAP is hopeful of a good show in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh Kejriwal s party is primarily projecting itself as a credible alternative to the Congress insisting that the grand old party has lost the zeal and vigour to fight the BJP or for that matter any election The AAP is eyeing the Congress space in both Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh and has the potential to upstage it by showcasing the Delhi model that boasts of improving health and education sectors and worked very well in Punjab In Himachal Pradesh the term of state Congress chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore ended a few months ago but he still is holding the post as the party leadership is struggling to find his successor This has aggravated the infighting in the state unit with one group led by former chief minister Virbhadra Singh s wife Pratibha Singh demanding that the reins of the party be handed over to her or else her loyalists will be forced to chalk out a separate path She won the Mandi Lok Sabha bypoll in November last year Another section led by former Himachal Pradesh Congress president Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu is insisting that he should again be appointed on the post claiming that only he has the capacity to bring back the party back to power in the hill state by ousting the ruling BJP Besides the AAP appears to be the new abode of the disgruntled leaders in both the BJP and the Congress
