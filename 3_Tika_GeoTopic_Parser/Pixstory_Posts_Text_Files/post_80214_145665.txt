Imagine driving behind a diesel truck spewing clouds of smoke into the air while your new fully electric vehicle cleans up its carbon emissions This dream may soon be a reality A team of students from the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands has created a Zero Emission Mobility ZEM vehicle a fully electric battery powered EV that captures carbon dioxide CO as it drives This according to its own creators could change the world s perception of mobility for years to come in a sporty all electric cr from the Netherlands resembling a BMW coupe but unique Called ZEM for zero emission mobility the two seater houses a Cleantron lithium ion battery pack and most of its parts are D printed from recycled plastics Lahaije said The target is to minimize carbon dioxide emitted during the car s full lifespan from manufacturing to recycling he added ZEM uses two filters that can capture up to kilograms lb of CO over miles of driving the Eindhoven team estimated They imagine a future when filters can be emptied at charging stations Furthermore and seeing the success of the vehicle the Dutch university has proposed to the student team to patent under their CO capture filter Increase its absorption capacity in the coming years and be able to manufacture and sell them to large automobile manufacturers The electric car is designed as a vehicle with a sporty appearance and with a single passenger compartment adapted for two passengers The team says there is room for improvement in both design and construction as the project focused solely on their ability to capture CO A major problem however has been the cost of implementing this technology If the team building ZEM can partner with governments and private companies to bring the carbon capture filter used in their EV to the mass market it could help make a significant difference in the transportation industry Sources Thetatvaindia
