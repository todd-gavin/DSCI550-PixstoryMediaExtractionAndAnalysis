The answer is yes Sex during periods can cause pregnancy although the risk is low Based on the length of your menstrual cycle the chances of getting pregnant if you have sex during your periods may not be as low as you may imagine it to be On average sperm can live or stay viable alive and active in the reproductive tract of a woman upto days after unprotected sex As a consequence based on when one ovulates egg is released and how long one s period is there is a chance of pregnancy even if one has sex during their periods Simply put if your cycle length is short your fertile window may be earlier than you may think it to be So even if you have sex on your periods you may ovulate shortly after and there may be a chance of the sperm staying alive in your system and coming into contact with the egg Ovulation roughly happens in the middle of the period cycle For example if you have a day menstrual cycle and your periods last for days This means that you may ovulate roughly between the th th day If you have sex on the th day of your periods sperm could stay viable till the th day However if you have sex on the th day then it would be viable till the th day Similarly imagine your cycle was around days long that means you ovulate on the th day If you had unprotected sex during the th day of your periods then you are at risk It is therefore untrue that one can have unprotected sex during their periods and not get pregnant Using birth control like condoms birth control pills etc is always a good idea if you aren t intending on getting pregnant Sources
