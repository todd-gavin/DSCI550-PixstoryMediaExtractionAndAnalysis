Valentine upon us and probably wondering about how to set up a perfect date, I’m surely not gonna tell you do’s and don’t cause I seriously have no opinion or experience in the matter. What I can tell you is about a perfect meal.
A romantic dinner should be special ofcourse, but also comforting, delicious, something different and unique. Fancy restaurants, standalone or hotels, will be setting up different menu’s with special chocolates and desserts. You should definitely go research what does your nearby  places have special. 
For cuisines specific choices you should go with Italian, historians say the ingredients used for Italian are aphrodisiac in nature it’s one of the most romantic cuisines for dinner dates and suitable for Valentines.
A perfect dinner for me should comprise of 3 4 courses with a variety of dishes, maybe start with a simple soup to warm the cold weather, have a delightful starter or appetizer, maybe pair up with a glass of Wine or any suitable drink for your choice.
What better way is there to communicate than food, it’s not just an expression but something you share, express feel and even sometimes be the person you want it to be.
Take out your beloved to the food that you love and both share.
Have a blast!!!!!!!
Cheers!!!!
