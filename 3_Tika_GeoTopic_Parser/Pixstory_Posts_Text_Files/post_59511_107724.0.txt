A video of cops from the 20th Battalion of Assam Police practising during torrential rains in Dhubri district has gone viral on social media as Assam continues to be drenched for the third day in a row. In the footage, police officers can be seen marching past and raising '1,2,1,2' chants with zeal and determination in the rain. 
"Training through the Rain at 20th APBn Dhubri," Assam Special DGP (Law and Order) GP Singh captioned the video on Twitter.
