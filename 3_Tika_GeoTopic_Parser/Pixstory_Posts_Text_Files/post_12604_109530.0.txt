When someone apologizes, it can be our instinct to say "it's ok" and sometimes it is. But
what about when it isn't ok?

You're allowed to still feel hurt even when someone apologizes. And you can choose to accept their apology, without condoning the behavior.
Here are some ways to respond to an apology, without saying it's ok.

"Thank you for apologizing."

• 'I appreciate the apology. If I'm being
honest, I'm still hurt by it and it may take some time for me to move past it."

• "I appreciate the apology, but what you
did what really hurtful. I need some time apart, while I process this."

• "Thank you for saying that. I need more
time to process.

• "I believe that you're sorry. I still need
some time."
