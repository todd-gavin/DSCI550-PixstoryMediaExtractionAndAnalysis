This movie was absolutely horrible. A boring, random, nonsensical mess from start to finish. The film is incompetently directed from a very poor script. It feels more like a superhero movie from the early 2000's such as Catwoman or Daredevil. Watching it makes it clear that the people involved had no idea what they were doing, and should never have been put in charge of a project this size to begin with. The story makes no sense, and the whole reason Batman wants to kill Superman is contrived. Batman and Superman hate each other because they both cause collateral damage and human death, and neither one ever sees fit to point out their similarities, or try and talk to each other about their different perspectives. Apparently that would have been too interesting, so of course Snyder didn't include it. 
    None of the characters are interesting, which give the audience no reason to care about what happens to them. Batman and Superman are both dull, unlikable, and might as well be the same character. Amy Adams is a weak Lois Lane, and her subplot is pointless filler. Lex Luther is a horrible and annoying villain with no sense of menace, unclear motives, and ridiculous dialogue. Gal Godot's performance as Wonder Woman is quite weak here, compared to her performance in her solo film. Whether that's due to Zack Snyder's poor directing or her having just improved by the time they shot Wonder Woman, I don't know.  
      The film is overly long and padded out. The soundtrack is obnoxiously loud and generic compared to Hans Zimmer's other works. The film is very boring and has almost no action until the end and even than, the action scenes that take place are weak and poorly choreographed with the exception of one incredible scene with Batman fighting a room full of henchmen. This scene is the one bright spot in the film, and a sad reminder of what the rest of the film could have been.
