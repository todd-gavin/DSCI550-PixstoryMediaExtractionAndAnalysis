Merle Hoffman is a healthcare pioneer and activist who spoke endlessly about abortion rights and health care for women.

Shortly after New York State legalized abortion in 1970, three years before the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion nationally, Hoffman helped solidify one of the country's first ambulatory abortion centers, Flushing Women's Medical Center in 1971.

 It was the forerunner of Choices Women's Medical Center, which Hoffman founded and serves as president and CEO. Choices is a full-service healthcare provider, offering gynecological services, pre-natal care, family care, transgender health care, telemedicine, mental health, and other services.

She also founded National Abortion Federation and I think she might be one of those women who deeply feel saddened by the supreme court's decision to overturn Roe v/a Wade as she struggled for abortion rights throughout her lifetime. 

She compared abortion to slavery-“If you’re forcing someone to carry a child against their will, and you all owning their bodies, which is what it is, I don’t know what else you would call that,” she tells The Independent, speaking before the Supreme Court’s June 24 decision to end constitutional protections for abortion care.
