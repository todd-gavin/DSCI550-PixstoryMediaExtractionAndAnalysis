Marco was watching this little Arctic fox as it incessantly called another nearby.

Gradually he noticed the fox's wet breath was quickly freezing in the air after each call.

It was late winter in Spitsbergen, Svalbard, and the cold arctic air was -35°C (-31°F).

Photographing arctic foxes is often frustrating, as they are normally running around fast in search of food, but this one was very relaxed and let Marco get close enough to focus on it, with the light glowing perfectly in the background.

Equipmemt used: Canon EOS 5D Mark IV + 70--200mm f2.8 II lens; 1/1600 sec
