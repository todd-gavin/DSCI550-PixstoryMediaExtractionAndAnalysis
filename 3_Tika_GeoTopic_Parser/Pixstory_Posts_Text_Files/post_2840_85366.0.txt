Something historic is underway. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is resetting strategic equations in the west, and may change the map of Europe. Observers and experts are talking of history changing its direction. Is it? It might seem so also because of the Euro-centric western bias – though a military action is bound to leave a historic milestone.

Yes, military conflicts have never paused but the Ukraine war is an exception. When the US and Albania requested a Security Council meeting to vote to convene the emergency General Assembly session, that was the first time in UNSC was doing so in 40 years: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/united-nations-general-assembly-ukraine-russia-emergency-session/ Of the 11 such sessions in the UN history, the previous one was way back in 1997: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Emergency_sessions_of_the_United_Nations_General_Assembly (The meeting passed the resolution asking Russia to withdraw its troops: https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113152)

Putin has twice threatened the use of the nuclear arsenal, which Russia had never done since the foundation of the federation in 1991: https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-02-28/russias-nuclear-threat-explained

That prompted Yuval Noah Harari, a popular historian of broad trends and also a leading opinion-maker, to argue that what is at stake in Ukraine is the direction of human history. He considers very long-range issues in this essay and concludes that humanity’s greatest political achievement has been the decline of war, and that is now in jeopardy: https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2022/02/09/yuval-noah-harari-argues-that-whats-at-stake-in-ukraine-is-the-direction-of-human-history

Many commentators have echoed the same thoughts with differing specifics and emphases. In short, that the one week of war has upended life within the boundaries of Ukraine and Putin’s brutal assault is “steering history in a new direction and switching up 75 years of relations among some of the world’s most powerful and wealthy countries”: https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/03/02/one-week-of-war-in-ukraine/

But was there ever a time when history was running in one direction? It has always been full of twists and turns, and there have been innumerable conflicts in recent decades, each taking history in a different direction. Those, of course, are going on in third world countries and this one is the first fought on European soil. Think Afghanistan, Syria. Is it Euro-centrism that’s provoking those pronouncements?: https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/closer-look/news/russias-invasion-ukraine-why-our-perspective-human-suffering-so-eurocentric-2973571

Then there is also “the tendency to view the immediate as the most significant”: https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/past-as-present-ukraine-is-not-a-tussle-between-light-and-darkness/cid/1854199
