It was a game full of goals and excitement in Vinovo as Juventus Women faced Milan in the Coppa Italia semi-final. The first leg had seen Joe Montemurro’s side secure a hefty advantage, beating the hosts 1-6 in Milan. Things weren’t quite so simple this time around as the Bianconere had to come from behind in an eight-goal thriller, winning 5-3 in the end.

In their fourth kit (powered by Adidas & Kobra), rather than the iconic black and white strip, Juve did not get off to the start they hoped for, going behind early on to Lindsey Thomas’s goal. Valentina Bergamaschi then doubled Milan’s advantage not long into the second half. The Bianconere were quick to react, reducing the deficit through Andrea Staskova just a couple of minutes later. However, Bergamaschi once again extended the visitor’s lead. The scoreline didn’t threaten Juve’s qualification chances, but they weren’t about to accept defeat: Staskova got a second to make it 2-3, Barbara Bonansea equalised with a wonderful effort, Arianna Caruso converted a penalty to put them ahead and Lisa Boattin, wearing the captain’s armband, sealed the deal with a fifth. They now face a head-to-head with Roma in the final.
