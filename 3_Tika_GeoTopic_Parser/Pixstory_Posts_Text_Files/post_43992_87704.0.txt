Since leading France to victory in Russia 2018, the World Cup winner's reputation has grown, with his countrymen hailing him as 'exceptional.'

Arsene Wenger believes Kylian Mbappe has a Pele-like personality, recalling how everyone thought he was "crazy" to believe such a thing.

The former Gunners manager also believes his countryman is better than Erling Haaland, who is still the subject of transfer speculation.

Mbappe's reputation has grown since he led France to victory in Russia 2018, and Wenger describes him as an "exceptional" talent.

What exactly has been said?
"When I first saw him, I said on French television: 'There's Pele in him'," Wenger told BEIN Sports. "Everyone thought I was a bit crazy, but he's got to this level.

"Technically, he is a little ahead of Haaland. He has his fantasy, not just his speed.
"He has intelligence, good technical quality, good timing in his runs, quick analysis of the game. He is also a free spirit, he is exceptional."
Mbappé doesn’t love the comparisons with Pele:

“Of course, I was very happy, very proud, but this is a difficult comparison,” he told ESPN.

“I don’t think anyone can do it like he did on his day. There’s only one Pele, he’s unique. I didn’t give too much attention to it, because no-one will ever be like Pele.”
“The club hasn’t stopped growing since the new owners arrived, and we players must evolve together with the club before we can think about winning a Champions League, that’s the final step,” Mbappe added.

“The club is very conscious about these steps and, if everyone plays their part, it will come naturally. But, with our potential, of course the Champions League will become our goal at some point.”
