Today, when Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid will face each other in Wanda Metropolitano Stadium, nothing much will be at stake except the pride of both the teams.

Because, as you all know, Real Madrid already won the La Liga and Real Madrid yet to play four matches in the league. So, Real Madridâ€™s manager, Carlo Ancelotti can make some changes in playing 11 today, to keep key players away from injuries, so the manager can field the best playing 11 in the Champions League final.

 On the other hand, Atletico Madrid is 3 points ahead of the fifth-place team, Real Betis with one game in hand. So even if Atletico Madrid drops the points today, their place in the top 4 spot will not be in any danger.

As a Real Madrid fan, I wish Real Madrid will win the match against Atletico Madrid and show them that the color of Madrid is still white.
