Today is a big day for space enthusiasts, including me. A new milestone has been achieved that is testimony to how fascinating is our universe is. 

The Hubble Space Telescope of NASA has set a new record by detecting the light of a star that lived inside the first billion years of the universe's formation in the big bang, making it the farthest individual star ever seen. 

NASA TV has reported that the discovery represents a significant step back in time from the previous single-star record holder, which was discovered by Hubble in 2018. That star existed when the universe was around 4 billion years old, or 30% of its present age, at a time known as "redshift 1.5," according to astronomers. The term "redshift" is used by scientists to describe how light from faraway objects is stretched or "shifted" to longer, redder wavelengths as it travels toward us as the cosmos expands.

The newly discovered star is so far away that its light took 12.9 billion years to reach Earth, making it appear to us at redshift 6.2, when the universe was just 7% of its present age. Clusters of stars trapped inside early galaxies are the tiniest things hitherto discovered at such a long distance.

“We almost didn’t believe it at first, it was so much farther than the previous most-distant, highest redshift star,” said astronomer Brian Welch of the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, lead author of the paper describing the discovery, which is published in the March 30 journal Nature.
