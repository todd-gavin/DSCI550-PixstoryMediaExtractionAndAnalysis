As per the Mirror, Roman Abramovich's journey with Chelsea might be over. But the Russian billionaire's investment in the world of football is far from it. The report states that Abramovich has now turned his attention to another club. 

Yes! As per multiple reports, Roman Abramovich is waiting for the Chelsea sale to be completed as soon as possible. Following this, the Russian businessman will look to buy Valencia CF in the Spanish League. 

Valencia owner and Singaporean businessman Peter Lim has put the LaLiga club up for sale. Miguel Zorio, a former vice-president at Valencia is looking to buy the shares of the club. But Zorio is not happy that Lim has revealed to the international media that Roman Abramovich is also interested in the club!

Miguel Zorio wrote a letter where he clearly stated, "Peter Lim (The Valencia owner) has tried to sell the club in London for €250million. But he has not succeeded. Lately, he has leaked to international media that he has two purchase offers, mine and that of Roman Abramovich."

The former Valencia vice-president has also mentioned in the letter asking Peter Lim to either sell the club to one of the bidders. If not, he has asked the owner to invest at least €50 million into the club every year. 





Can Abramovich improve the LaLiga club?

Los Murciélagos or The Bats have been one of LaLiga's biggest clubs over the years. But due to financial crisis and improper management, Valencia have been reduced to more of a mid-table club in the past few seasons.

Valencia's last title was the Copa Del Rey that they won in the 2018/19 season. The Bats enjoyed their best period in recent history between 1999 and 2004. In this timeframe, Valencia won the LaLiga title twice and also reached two UEFA Champions League finals.

Roman Abramovich significantly improved Chelsea since buying the club in 2003. Hence if the Russian buys Valencia, this would certainly make LaLiga even more competitive in the coming seasons.
