After the releases of movies like Bahubali, Pushpa, KGF, and RRR, there is a narrative going on against Bollywood movies, everyone is saying that South Indian movies are superior to Bollywood movies and sooner than later Bollywood will no longer be there and no one gonna watch Bollywood movies.

As an aspiring movie director, I feel bad whenever this kind of topic starts trending on Twitter or news channels but as an analyst, I realize one thing that Bollywood helped South Indian producers and directors to promote and distribute their movies on North Indian channels.

Starting from Bahubali, when no one knew that film like Bahubali is gonna released in theatres, then Karan Johar realized the potential of that movie and distribute the movie on the North Indian channel and we all know that film was celebrated like the festival.

After that KGF was the movie which collaborated with Farhan Akhtarâ€™s production house, Excel Entertainment and the film got released with Hindi dub and movie become a blockbuster.

After this, the pandemic hit the world, and Pushpa was released when the Omicron variant was around the corner that movie also created a lot of buzz but not in theatres as compared to the OTT platform.

After Pushpa, SS Rajamouli made another movie called RRR, and now, Rajamouli understands the business as well as North Indian audiences very well and he holds the hand of correct people and promotes his movie with Karan Johar, Aamir Khan, Salman khan, and a very famous YouTuber Bhuvan Bam and also take Alia Bhatt as a heroine because Alia Bhatt will grab the attention of North Indian audiences and many people will go to watch just because of her and RRR worked very well in Hindi channels.

After that, KGF was released and this time director gave roles to Bollywood actors as an antagonist, one is Sanjay Dutt and the other is Raveena Tandon Farhan Akhtar distributed the movie again in North Indian channels and the film is working superbly.

So, never hate Bollywood again and thank them that they never say no to promote good cinema.
