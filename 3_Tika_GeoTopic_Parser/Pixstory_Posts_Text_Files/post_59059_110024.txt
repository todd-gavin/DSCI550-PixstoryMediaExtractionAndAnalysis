Yeah it s okay You don t need to have any plan You re not behind You should relax and ask yourself questions about how and what you want from yourself keep asking repeatedly unless you get an answer Aim to find yourself and what you are good at Share things that trouble you and talk to your friends and family If there s no one to listen then write them out Have a journal Which helps me a lot to figure out things that bother me Hope it helps you too Overthinking about the future can make your present worthless So chill and work hard Don t give a damn about your friend s plan
