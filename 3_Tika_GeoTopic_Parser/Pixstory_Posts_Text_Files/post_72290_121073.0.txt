Bukayo Saka is undoubtedly England’s bright future but it’s up to Mikel Arteta and the board to decide whether he’ll be Arsenal’s as well. The 20-year-old winger has two years left in his contract and is yet to sign a long-term deal that would keep him tied to the club. 

Edu Gaspar, Arsenal’s technical director, is under pressure to commence talks of a new deal and include a release clause in it. Meanwhile, Saka looks like a perfect fit in the Liverpool setup. Jurgen Klopp is a big admirer of the youngster and deems him to be an ideal replacement for Mohamed Salah.

The Arsenal No.7 had appeared 38 times for the Gunners and was directly involved in 18 goals in the Premier League last season. Glen Johnson, a former Premier League defender, was one such critic who was vocal about his opinion. 

With the transfer window coming to an end and Arsenal looking formidable in their squad, it is highly unlikely Saka would push for a move. Also, Klopp has stated that he has ended his shopping for the summer unless any late emergency. The Gunners have gone big in the market splashing big money on players to rebuild the squad and make it into the Champions League after 6 long years. If this comes true, it could encourage the man in topic to stay in the Emirates and be part of the setup for a long time.
