Mitchell Robinson of the New York Knicks will be an unrestricted free agency this summer, and he is likely to attract interest.

The Detroit Pistons, Oklahoma City Thunder, and Dallas Mavericks are all likely to chase the veteran centre, according to Steve Popper of Newsday.

Robinson, like the rest of the Knicks, has experienced a roller coaster season. The 23-year-old is averaging 8.4 points, 8.7 rebounds, and 1.7 blocks per contest while shooting 76.9% from the floor and a dismal 48.7% from the free throw line.

On offence, he's still the prototypical rim-running centre, with the athleticism to catch lobs off the pick-and-roll. Beyond that and offensive rebounds, his offensive impact is limited. With Derrick Rose out for the majority of the season, the Knicks have lacked the high-end point guard play required to maximise his potential as a roller.

Robinson is a capable rim protector on defence, albeit the Knicks' defence has regressed this season.
You know you've got some real athleticism when you can block Kevin Durant's shot.

As a result, the Knicks have dropped to 28-40, five games behind the Charlotte Hornets (33-35) again for Eastern Conference's No. 10 seed and final play-in place. The Knicks have gone from being one of the top stories in the league last season to possibly not even making the play-in tournament this season.

In New York, it's been a difficult season, and it could be the last for head coach Tom Thibodeau. Robinson is expected to draw a lot of interest in free agency, so he may not be the only one to leave.
