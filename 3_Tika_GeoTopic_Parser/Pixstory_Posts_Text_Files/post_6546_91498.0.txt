An old photograph of Bhagwant Mann has been shared on social media to mock the newly-appointed Punjab Chief Minister. The accompanying claim suggests that 12 years ago, Mann was apprehended by Punjab police for stealing a bike.

The photograph shows three young men sitting in a squatting position. They are drenched in colour.

It is widespread on Facebook.

Alt News received several requests on its official mobile app and on the WhatsApp helpline (+91 76000 11160) to verify if the image depicted a younger Mann caught by the police for stealing a bike.

We got in touch with Karamjit Anmol through his brother Meet Manak. The actor confirmed this is an old photograph of a Holi celebration, held at the residence of singer Harbhajan Mann.

The actor has often shared old photographs of himself with Mann to commemorate occasions.

We spoke with Manjit Siddhu who is the third person in the viral photograph. He said that the image is from his university days around 1994-95 when he visited Harbhajan Mann’s residence at Sirhind Road, Patiala, along with Bhagwant Mann and Karamjit Anmol.
