Kamala Devi is a single mom of four kids. She lives and works in Chitrakoot district. Since her husband's death two years ago, she has taken on the responsibility of running her household, educating and securing a future for her children. 

Kamala is from Siddhupur village. She used to be part of her village's women's self-help group for which meetings were held in the district headquarters. Kamala couldn't make it to some of the meetings because of the distance, because of which she was pulled up by her supervisors. It was then that Kamala decided to take out a loan for an e-rickshaw and provide reliable transportation not just for herself but also for people from her village. At first, people were sceptical. Here was a Dalit woman, a single mother, taking the plunge into a cutthroat business - initially people mocked her and refused to give her business. However, their insults fell on deaf ears. Kamala refused to pay attention to detractors, she says, "society does not like to see women step out of their places inside homes into the city and make a way in the world for themselves. They will always have something to say. That's why I don't pay any attention to what society says. I have to do what I have to do for the well-being of me and my children. That's all that matters. Too bad if society and its oppressive structures dont like it." 

Kamala is perhaps the lone female auto driver in Chitrakoot district, certainly the only Dalit woman driver, where public transport is a real challenge.
