In a mass shooting at a car show in Arkansas, at least 24 were injured including children and as per portals such as the daily telegraph reports the injured included a baby. The car show was a part of a community event held to raise budgets for scholarships and school supplies, according to the website of the Delta Neighborhood Empowerment Youth Organization. The very event held for the welfare of children turned into the blood-shed of the same.

 "Following a report of gunfire outside a local business hosting the car show, State troopers were dispatched at around 7.25pm to Dumas, about 90 miles south of Little Rock," said Bill Sadler, an Arkansas State police spokesperson.

This is what according to the Guardian the organiser of the event, Wallace McGhee had to say: "For something like this to happen, it’s a tragedy, We did this here for 16 years without a problem.”

Meanwhile, the Police Chief also said one person is in custody although many seemed to be involved. More updates on the number of victims were not released. This would further prompt stricter gun laws in the country. If people are worried about safety gun laws should be made stricter. This very incident is evidence of how guns can cause damage to the life of many innocent people including children. Those advocating for guns must be ready to use innocuous  weapons for defence and not guns. This has gone too far.
