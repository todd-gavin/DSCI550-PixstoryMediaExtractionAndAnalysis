Ending months of speculation, Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam has announced that she will not seek a second term. 

Lam, 64, has said that she will be concentrating on her family which she admitted has been "affected" after she decided to join politics. 

Lam's tenure has been controversial as it was under her watch that China gained almost full control of Hong Kong which was followed by a violent put-down of protests and large-scale restrictions on freedom of speech. 

In all likelihood, No 2 government official and Chief Secretary John Lee will takeover from Lam. He is said to be close to Beijing, too. 

Although Lam was elected with a thumping majority, she fell foul of many people in Hong Kong after she proposed a law that allowed extraditions to mainland China. This resulted in huge protests in 2019. But with the help of China, she was able to gain control of the situation and then began a crackdown. 

Lam was often called a "puppet" of Beijing, but she always claimed that whatever she was doing was for the good of Hong Kong. 

Hong Kong's free press has been brought to its knees and any dissent is confronted with full force. Several laws have been passed making the life for pro-democracy activists very difficult. Many are in jail. 

Although under Lam's leadership, Hong Kong dealt with the pandemic very well for better part of two years ever since the outbreak, the omicron variant did threaten the city's health infrastructure and Lam was criticized for the same. 

Lam may be seen as a leader who did well on behalf of China, the people of Hong Kong may have a different opinion on her. History may see her as a divisive figure who cared more for China than for the people who elected her to lead them.
