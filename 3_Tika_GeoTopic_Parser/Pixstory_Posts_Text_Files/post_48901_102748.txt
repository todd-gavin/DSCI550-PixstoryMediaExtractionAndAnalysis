Mark Lanigan of Ontario Canada decided to sell his farm in after a calf was born three months prematurely and he spent the entire day attempting to keep it alive I had an epiphany the year old explains While Mr Lanigan s Farmhouse Garden Animal Home now includes cows one horse a donkey chickens and ducks he also sells veggies including radishes cabbages and beets Instead of sending those animals to slaughter he is in fact setting up an animal sanctuary for them It wasn t something that was planned or talked about it just happened really quickly He says My sons were going to take over the farm They thought I was nuts His neighbours have stopped talking to him ever since he changed his mind about slaughtering animals However he claims he can talk to both animals activists and beef farmers with an open mind It s amazing how people are able to form a connect with their fellow beings so easily yet they re so disconnected to the nature at the same time It took Mr Lanigan helping one calf to see that even these animals are worthy of life And how intolerant people get when you challenge their beliefs even without actually challenging them He only had to change his own ways and suddenly nobody was talking to him It s kind of a hyperbole when people say vegans are intolerant for not wanting animals to get murdered while they are so intolerant about a man changing his personal habits Source BBC
