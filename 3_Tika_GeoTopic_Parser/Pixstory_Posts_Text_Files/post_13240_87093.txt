 These days when I look at the media and see horrific incidents and people fleeing violence and terror in Ukraine it really takes me to my time as a person A child fleeing war injustice and inhumanity in Afghanistan And what a shame for the international community that history is repeating itself in Afghanistan today we are just talking about the Ukraine crisis but that is exactly what is happening in my country The issue of refugees has been a long standing issue in Australia and has been at stake throughout politics I came to Australia by boat because that was the only route available And now if you compare this with the situation in Ukraine are you asking Ukrainian refugees who are not allowed to come by land and have to leave Ukraine by plane I do not think this is what we expect from the world Our country Australia is one of the signatories of the UN Convention This country has obligations and responsibilities towards the refugees and they must do their part and duty We should welcome Ukrainian refugees in this land whether they are Ukrainian refugees or Afghan refugees We have a duty to protect refugees Unfortunately this is not the case in Australia because it is a matter of political abuse Right in the Afghanistan crisis Scott Morrison announced people but in other places like Canada It is a shame that a country as big and rich as Australia was only willing to protect people And finally I ask all the spectators how would you all react if we imprisoned Ukrainian refugees in detention centers camps today We currently have hundreds of asylum seekers in detention centers camps in Australia Video link
