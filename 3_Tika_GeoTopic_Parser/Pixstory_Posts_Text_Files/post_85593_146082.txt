I m your pretty next door neighbour type girl who dreams in colour I literally have Dolby Atmos in my brain popping colours for both sweet dreams and nightmares I like to overthink as well but these days I have an optimistic approach to life where I ve set limits no more negativity and it s such a relief I m also one of those people who get lost while reading and then get a book hangover Love climbing trees and music so much so that I broke my favourite sandals recently and have to give my ears a break from my headphones My friends would call me a history buff bouncing around whenever we re at monuments or museum It s true though I feel like my eyes sparkle in those moments Last but not the least Hii My name is Epsa and it means to be desired pretty name I know
