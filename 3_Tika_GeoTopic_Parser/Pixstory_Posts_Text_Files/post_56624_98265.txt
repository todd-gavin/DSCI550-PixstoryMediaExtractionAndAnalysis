Melbourne captain Daisy Pearce has confirmed she will play at least one more AFLW season The year old was weighing up her future last season as she juggled media commentary roles and considered taking up coaching roles The call to extend her playing career comes after a stellar season in which Pearce won a host of individual accolades and led the Demons to the grand final which they lost to Adelaide Next season will be Pearce s third since she took a year off to have twins Sylvie and Roy I ve got at least one more in me Pearce said I think since the kids I thought to myself that it would be good to get back for one more and I ve kind of put this ceiling on it all the way along The one mores have turned into three more and here I am feeling fit and healthy and like I can still contribute Over and above all that I just still love it It s still the highlight of my week other than coming home to my beautiful family to go down to footy training and be part of the cycle of a footy season Pearce won Melbourne s best and fairest award was selected in the All Australian team and named the AFL Players Association s best captain for the fourth time for her most recent season She will continue in her commentary roles this year before the next AFLW season starts in August Geelong had been interested in Pearce filling a coaching role with their AFL men s team but a step into coaching is on hold for now I ve never been clearer on what my role in the team is and I m grateful to be doing it with great perspective of having a family and other great opportunities in life Pearce said It s media and footy this year and then next year who knows It s hard to forecast The thing that people keep telling me and that resonates with me is that you re a long time retired For as long as I m loving it I d be silly to give it away
