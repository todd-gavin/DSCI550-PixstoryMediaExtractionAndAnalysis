 Abstract Background Diabetes self management DSM is essential for patients to achieve better health outcomes However previous studies have demonstrated that the performance of DSM is not optimal This study was designed to identify the significant determinants of self management behavior in type diabetes T DM patients to improve DSM Method A convenient sampling method was employed in this study Data were collected from a community health center from January to February in Nanjing city China A total of patients completed the self administered questionnaires A structural equation model based on the theory of planned behavior TPB was adopted for analysis Results TPB model presents excellent goodness of fit of data Attitude P lt subjective norms SN P lt and perceived behavior control PBC P lt were strong predictors of intention Intention P lt and PBC P lt had a direct effect on self management behavior The impact of attitude and SN on behavior was significantly mediated via behavioral intention Conclusion The application of TPB to self management behavior in T DM patients can significantly enhance our understanding of theory based self management behavior This predictive model could potentially be a valuable tool and provide a feasible approach for formulating more targeted and population specific DSM interventions in future research Sources
