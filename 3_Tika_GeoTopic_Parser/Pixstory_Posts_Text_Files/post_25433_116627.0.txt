The greatest moments in anime and manga history will occur when LUFFY finds one piece, and I recognised it when Roger discovered one piece and after reading this. On that particular episode, I'm not sure if I was crying because I was happy or sad, but I believe it was a combination of both and still got the same feeling when I read this message from Oda.No series will ever compare to that one moment which will be referred to as the pinnacle of peaks.
