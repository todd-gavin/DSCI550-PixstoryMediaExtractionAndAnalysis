Kylie Jenner illustrated the power of a full-coverage look today in Paris🤩. The beauty entrepreneur opted for a body-hugging dress at the Acne Studios’ spring 23 show. ✨️The dress felt like a modern twist on ’70s disco glamor with its dramatic winged sleeves, à la Donna Summer. 😉💗Jenner completed the slightly campy look with some statement-making, Alien-esque sunglasses.🕶 The ensemble reads: “Batgirl at a Studio 54 party.” Fabulous.
Jenner has long had an affinity for Acne Studios. She embraced texture last year when she wore a fuzzy bucket hat, hairy boots, and a shiny leather coat from Acne’s fall 2021 collection.❤️‍🔥👄
