Wesley Sneijder
Wesley Sneijder, one of the greatest playmakers in Dutch history, joined Los Blancos in 2007, after spending five years at Ajax, wherein he established himself as the world's top young prospect. The 35-year-old had a strong first season, but his playing time in the following year was severely hampered by an injury.
He was quickly transferred from Los Blancos to Inter Milan in 2009, where he quickly made a name for himself as one of the finest players in the world. He helped the Italian team win the treble, consisting of the 2010 Champions League title. Sneijder has established himself as one of the greatest midfielders in sports history since leaving the Bernabeu-based club.
Arjen Robben
Arjen Robben joined the Bernabeu in 2007 following stellar displays for Chelsea. He had an instant effect, scoring five goals in 28 games to help his new team win the La Liga championship. Despite another strong campaign with Los Blancos in 2008, he was deemed unnecessary at the Bernabeu in 2009 when Cristiano and Kaka were brought in. Robben ended up winning several awards at Bayern Munich, therefore it might be said that it was one of Florentino Perez's worst errors.
However, Robben at least found himself a new home in Bayern and had a decade of unwavering success. He won eight Bundesliga championships, five DFB Pokals, five DFL-Supercups, and the Champions League. The 35-year-old, who is without a doubt one of the finest wingers in the game and a game-changer on the field, played in Germany for 10 brilliant seasons until retiring in 2019.
