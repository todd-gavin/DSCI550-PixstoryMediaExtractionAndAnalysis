The 2022 World Cup group stage has been drawn, and there will be plenty of discussion topics in each of the eight groups, as expected.

The matchup between the United States and England was one of the highlights of the group round, and they could be joined by another British team in June when Wales, Scotland, and Ukraine compete for the last berth in the group.

Mexico's adversaries in the United States also picked an intriguing opponent in Argentina, despite the fact that El Tri's past matches haven't exactly gone in their favour. Tata Martino, the Mexican coach, will face his native country and a side he previously coached. He was also Lionel Messi's manager at Barcelona.

Les Rouges take against Belgium, the world's No. 2 team, in Canada's first World Cup appearance in 37 years. Matches against Morocco and Croatia, on the other hand, might provide Canada with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to advance out of the group.

FIFA has already stated that finalizing the schedule and stadium assignments for each team will take some time following the draw. This hasn't always been the case in previous draws, but FIFA wants to optimize the schedule for domestic television slots and supporters traveling within Qatar. The stadium's proximity allows fans to move between matches, and organizers hope to make that daily schedule easier for the big contests.
