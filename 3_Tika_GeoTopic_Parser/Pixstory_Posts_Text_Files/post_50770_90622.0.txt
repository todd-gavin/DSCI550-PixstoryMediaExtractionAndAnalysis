The ambivalence of Trump's supporter base has put the former President in a tight spot, as to what his position should be regarding the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict. Trump is still fine tuning his messaging regarding the ongoing conflict as a result of this.

The former President in his term as President had a great relationship with Putin and often praised him. The reflection of that can still be seen in many parts of Trump's base with many
believing that Putin is in the right, in the Ukraine issue and was justified in pushing back against the NATO expansion. They have been critical of Ukraine and have shown sympathy for Putin

On the other end of the spectrum many Trump supporters have been critical of Putin and have called for a stronger American response to the ongoing war. They believe that the war cannot be stopped without a direct intervention from the US.

Trump so far has been inconsistent in his messaging about the war and the split in his supporter base regarding the issue is a good explanation for that. Trump for a long time has blamed Biden for Russia's invasion of Ukraine but in the recently the former President has also criticised Putin in what feels like an eternity. Trump is still figuring out a strategy on how to respond to the ongoing conflict while not splitting his voter base.
