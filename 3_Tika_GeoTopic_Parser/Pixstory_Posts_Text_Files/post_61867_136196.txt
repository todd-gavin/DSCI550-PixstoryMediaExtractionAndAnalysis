Louis Tomlinson admits he was chasing a radio hit with Just Hold On The former One Direction star is immensely proud of his debut solo single with world famous DJ Steve Aoki however he felt he had to go after a hit The year old star has just returned with his new single Bigger Than Me the lead track from his second solo LP Faith in the Future which still has dance elements but he hopes it comes across in an authentic way this time around In an interview with The Official Charts Company he said There are a couple of more dance leaning tunes on this record I was so particular on the first record that I wanted to be seen in a certain light and it had to be organic and credible Of course those things are still vitally important to me but I ve given myself more freedom I loved DMA s last album THE GLOW which Stuart Price produced That has dance elements in it but was done in a really authentic way It doesn t feel remotely contrived or like a f made for radio pop dance hybrid That was really food for thought for me throughout the process Those moments across this record felt brave for me because I dipped my toe in with the Steve Aoki track Number peaking collaboration Just Hold On That s a song I m immensely proud of but if I m being completely honest it was me playing for radio It was something I felt I had to do These songs come from a different place Yes I m using dance elements but I hope it s done in an authentic way However the guitar is still the most prominent instrument with Louis working with guitar band the DMA s Courteeners Joe Cross and more on the follow up to s Walls He said The fans won t be surprised that the guitars are the most prevalent instrument across this record That won t surprise my fans but it might surprise other people Better than me Music video is out right now
