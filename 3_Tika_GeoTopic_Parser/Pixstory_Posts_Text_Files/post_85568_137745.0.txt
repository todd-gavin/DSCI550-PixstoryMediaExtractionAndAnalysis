It is not at all easy to wrap six yards of fabric, but, yeah it do look fabulous that it's worth it. ✨️
I wore this saree on my freshers and guess what it was customised by me only.  From purchasing fabrics to getting ideas from pinterest to giving it to a tailor it was a tough task but it was all worth it.
I didn't accessoried it enough. I just wore a watch which was ofcourse stolen from my mum's wardrobe 🤭 and oxidised earrings that was again stolen from my sister's wardrobe. 🤫
Want to look glamorous yet modest? Wear a saree. You'll rock. 🥳
