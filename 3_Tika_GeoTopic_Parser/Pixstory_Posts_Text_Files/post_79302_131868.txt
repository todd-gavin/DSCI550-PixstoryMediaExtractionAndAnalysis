It is often the case with modern football that the plaudits go to those who are scoring assisting and saving the most It s clearly impossible to watch every single game for the full minutes so we fall upon surface level stats and highlight reels As a result I feel there need to be credit given to those who do the simple roles pass with maximum efficiency create chances that aren t finished win all their duels and so on Here are some of the best performers from this week that might not have gotten the credit they deserve Tyrell Malacia In the United game for obvious reasons Lisandro Martinez was spoken about a lot He had an almost flawless game responding to the critics who have been on his case the past week Nonetheless coming up against one of the hardest wingers in the world to play again Malacia came across relatively unscathed tackles pass accuracy clearances interception and duels won He didn t do anything spectacular but he was almost flawless at everything that was asked of him Pascal Struijk Continuing with the LB theme Struijk is a player who is adjusting to his new role remarkably He completed of his passes completed dribbles and made successful tackles He remains little spoken about but for the rd match running has been quietly impressive Alex Iwobi rejuvenated by his change in role Iwobi looks a cut above some of his fellow teammates From central midfield he created chances made recoveries and won duels One to keep an eye on this season for sure Eberechi Eze A player who might ve got more attention than others on this list but his performance needed highlighting regardless passes completed chances created bcc dribbles completed tackles recoveries duels fouled times The numbers speak for themselves really He seems to have finally shaken off the injury woes and is filling the huge potential he s always been capable of Also shoutout to Djenepo Lavia MacAllister Neves
