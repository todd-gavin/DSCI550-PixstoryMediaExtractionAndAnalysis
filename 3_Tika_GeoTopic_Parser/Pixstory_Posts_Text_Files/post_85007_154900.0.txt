Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb kept their hopes in the UEFA Champions League alive by eking out a point against RB Salzburg last night when they faced each other at the Stadion Maksimir. Dinamo Zagreb showed what they are capable of in their very first UCL match of the season when they shocked the world by defeating Chelsea and now they have a real chance of qualifying for the Round of 16 if they perform well in the remaining matches. 
Dinamo Zagreb might be at the bottom of the Group E table but they are tied in points with AC Milan (4 points). Considering the fact that RB Salzburg currently have 7 points, anything can still happen in this group and Zagreb are still in the competition. 
Many might argue that Dinamo Zagreb were the better side in last night’s match and they might even have won the match if they could convert their chances. They had more possession throughout the match and had 3 really good chances of scoring. 
It was RB Salzburg however who took the lead. Nicolas Seiwald scored the first goal of the night after a deflection put the ball in his way. Zagreb played with more intent after that and they finally got the equalizer right before halftime at the 40’ mark. Robert Ljubičić half-volleyed the ball into the back of the net from a corner. 
Fans expected more from Dinamo Zagreb’s top player though. He is one of the highest goalscorers in the UEFA Champions League this season so far. He got a couple of chances but sadly it was not his night and he was goalless. 
Dinamo Zagreb will now face AC Milan in their next match. They must win it to keep their hopes in the competition (and the prospect of playing in the Europa League even) alive.
