Between April and July of this year cases of severe hepatitis without any explainable cause were reported in children in more than countries Nearly half of these cases were in Europe including over a quarter in the UK Usually childhood hepatitis is caused by an infection from one of the hepatitis viruses such as hepatitis A or hepatitis C But although children were presenting with elevated levels of hepatitis markers in their blood no traces of hepatitis viruses were detected in these children nor in any of the related cases since Initial investigations found a potential link between adenovirus infection and these cases of hepatitis Adenoviruses are very common viral infections especially in children They typically cause infections such as mild colds pink eye conjunctivitis or stomach problems However if they get to the liver they can on rare occasion cause hepatitis However given how common adenoviruses are in children and because they rarely cause hepatitis in healthy people it was difficult to say this was the probable cause A new study suggests that the spate of severe hepatitis cases seen in children may be the result of three factors working together adenovirus adeno associated virus AAV and an underlying genetic predisposition to the disease A potential cause emerges In a pre print study which means it has not yet been reviewed by other scientists a team of researchers looked at nine of the original hepatitis cases in April and conducted a large range of tests seeking to find new or previously undetected viruses or genetic factors that may have caused hepatitis in the children The team found that all nine children had been infected with adeno associated virus They then compared their findings with healthy children and children who d had adenovirus infections but no hepatitis Adeno associated virus was not detected in any of these children This was a strong indicator that AAV was a cause of these mystery hepatitis cases Read more
