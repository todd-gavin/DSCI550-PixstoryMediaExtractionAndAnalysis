Leicester City only played 2 Premier League games in January 2022. Three matches were postponed due to Covid. The foxes were able to grab only one point out of the possible 6 points in January 2022.


The foxes were given a huge blow when they drew against Brighton. The odds were with the foxes but they failed to win against them. With this decision, Leicester City is yet to win a game this year.


Brenden Rodgers went with a formation of 4-2-3-1. Vardy is still out due to injury. Dhaka, Tielemans, Barnes and Maddison started the game at the King Power Stadium. Graham Potter went with a diamond formation which is 4-4-2. Burn , Trossard and Veltman started the game. Lallana and Welbeck were on bench.


Leicester had a promising start to the game. They were attacking and coming back to defence. The game was looking one-sided. Brighton was equally offensive in the game. The first half ended with 0-0 on the scoreboard.


As soon as the second half started, the foxes took the lead within seconds. Daka scored the first goal of the game. Welbeck came on in the 60th minute. Brighton started getting more possession as well as more shots since the substitutions. The overall possession was 57%.


Both the teams had the same number of shots. In the 82nd minute, Welbeck equalises for Brighton which made the home crowd furious. It was the second time in the month that Leicester City threw their lead away in the final minutes of the game. The game ended 1-1 which was a disappointing result for the foxes.


Brendan Rodgers needs to improve some of its tactics to get better results in the future. With this result, Leicester City is in the 10th position. They have just 26 points from 20 games played. Brighton is above them with 30 points from 22 games.


Leicester City with face Nottingham Forest for the FA Cup round 4 on 6th February. Brighton on the other hand will face Spurs for the same round of the FA Cup on 5th February.
