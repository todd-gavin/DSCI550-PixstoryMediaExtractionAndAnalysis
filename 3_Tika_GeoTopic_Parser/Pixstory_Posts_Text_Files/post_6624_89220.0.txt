Several social media users have shared a short video clip allegedly from Vijaywada that shows a JCB operating on the first floor of a building that looks dilapidated. In the same video, a mosque can also be spotted across the road. The video is being shared with the claim that the Andhra Pradesh government is demolishing a temple in order to widen the road while leaving the mosque untouched.

Video Verification
Alt News performed a keyword search on Twitter and discovered that the video dates back to 2020.

Alt News spoke with Vijayawada-based journalists and temple associates. They stated that both the claim as well as the video are old. As per them, the clip shows the renovation of Sri Vijayeshwara Swamy Vari Devasthanam, and not its demolition as claimed.

During our investigation, we also found that Facebook user Sri Rakesh Kurapati had posted a news clipping that shows the building in question. Earlier, NewsMeter fact-checked the video based on this clipping.

Using Google Lens, we translated the news clipping and found that report states that the video shows development initiatives at the Vijayeshwara temple. A part of the building consisting of shops was demolished in order to increase the area of the temple.
