This diet has many downsides as it restricts people to a great extent; they're often compelled to avoid eating things they like or would usually choose to eat.
So it might not be the right choice for everyone. There are also reasons like foods having high salt that makes it difficult for some people to choose such a diet.
As the ones having blood pressure or kidney problems would suffer.
Also, people tend to take multivitamins to complete their nutrition to supplement their lost nutrients.
This extra restrictive nature of the macrobiotic diet makes it difficult for many people to choose it as they don't want to lose nutrients and avoid eating some food.
