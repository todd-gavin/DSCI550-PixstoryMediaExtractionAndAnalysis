Neetu Kapoor badly judged for her living her life after Rishi Kapoor’s death; ‘She is happy and free’‼️‼️

While Neetu in one of her interactions had spoken that how people do not want the widows to be happy and rather cry because that's what she is supposed to do according to society. Talking about getting trolled for being happy in an interview with Film Campanion, Neetu Kapoor said. " I block the ones who troll me because you know thode hote hai beech mein ke 'husband marr gaya, ye enjoy kar rahi hai (Her husband has died and she's enjoying).' They want to see that crying widow type, there is some section of people but I just block them."
Talking about everyone having a different way of ehaling she said, " I say this is the way I want to be, this is the way I will be, this the way I will heal. Koi log ro ro ke heal karte hai, koi log khush ho ke heal karte hai(Some heal by crying, others heal by being happy). I can never forget my husband. He will be here (in my heart), with me, with my children, all our lives". Rightly said Neetu ji.💔💔
