On Monday, a man in West Bengal cut his wife's hand from her wrist to prevent her from applying for a job as a nurse at a government hospital.

Renu Khatun is the victim, and Sher Mohammad, a native of Ketugram in East Burdwan district, is the spouse in issue. Sher kept the severed body part at his home, despite the fact that he promptly admitted his wife to a local hospital, to ensure that the physicians would be unable to reconnect it.

Sher and his family members quickly left the hospital after his wife was admitted.

Renu was getting nursing training and working as an assistant in a private hospital in Durgapur, a nearby industrial district, according to neighbours.

When Sher received the letter inviting her to join the government hospital, she was said to be furious.

Sher was scared that if his wife got a government job, she would abandon him because he was unemployed, according to residents. Sher was adamant that she not take the job, which led to regular squabbles between the two. Renu, on the other hand, was completely unconcerned.

Sher finally took this drastic step on Monday. Renu's elder brother, Ripon Sekh, told reporters, "Ever since my sister received the state government's appointment letter, Sher has insisted that she reject it." Renu, on the other hand, had always wanted to be a nurse and had refused. We had no idea Sher's insecurity would lead to such a tragic outcome."
