I visited Plum by Bent Chair a few months back with my friends and instantly thought the decor and concept of the restaurant was different than anything I’d ever seen before. I’ve heard that all those chandeliers and ceiling plants, those mismatched chairs and tables you see, you can pay for them right there and then and take them home! I can’t tell if this is true or not but I need to know!
