The former Argentine forward, Gonzalo Higuain is all to set call the end of his footballing career when the contract expires at the end of the year. The 34-year-old who is into his third season with Miami is out of contract in December. 
There has been speculation that the Argentine forward is all set to return to his former team River Plate but his father has called off all those rumours. 


What was said?

Jorge Higuain, a former player of Boca Juniors and River Plate told TNT Sports about his son’s plans. “He is not going back to Argentina. He told me that he is retiring at the end of the season He is retiring this year and is retiring from football.” He also added that “my son has been into several places and has everything to succeed. For me, it would be an insult if he does not continue in football.”

If Higuain does decide to call it off, it would bring the curtain down on a glittering career that has seen him play in five different countries and win 14 major trophies. 

He began his career in the year 2006 with River Plate, scoring 15 goals in 29 league games before moving to Real Madrid in December 2006.
