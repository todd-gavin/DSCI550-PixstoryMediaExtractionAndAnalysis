New research suggests that Australians are less likely change their behaviours to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions compared to residents of other countries The new global survey has been undertaken by IPSOS and found that Australians were less likely to shift to sustainable transport options including taking less flights or using public transport and less than half of Australians had a plan for reducing their household energy use The study found that while Australians were more likely to take steps to avoid purchasing products with a lot of packaging and were more willing to buy second hand goods they were less likely to use more efficient household appliances or reduce meat and dairy consumption Despite a high public demand for government and businesses to take climate action there is a lot of inertia to overcome in getting people to make changes in their own behaviours IPSOS director Stuart Clark said It is very clear that many Australians are unable or unwilling to make changes to their lifestyles and that we lag behind many other countries in this respect Encouraging and enabling the public to take up highly impactful initiatives like eating less meat and dairy using public transport and going carless or buying an electric vehicle requires a combination of education cultural change and improved services and infrastructure Clark added IPSOS surveyed more than people drawn from different countries The survey found that those living throughout Asia including China South Korea Malaysia and India were more likely to change their practices in an effort to reduce their contribution to climate change Citizens from European countries as well as Australia were generally less likely to change their behaviour The research suggests that a lack of government support for some actions such as the lack of federal policies supporting the uptake of electric vehicles might be creating barriers and contributing to a wider apathy amongst Australians to change their behaviours The survey also found that respondents from all countries were likely to overestimate the climate benefits of some actions while also underestimating the benefits of others
