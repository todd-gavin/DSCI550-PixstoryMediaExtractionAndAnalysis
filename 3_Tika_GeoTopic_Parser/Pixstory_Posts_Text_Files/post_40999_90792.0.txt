A Hollywood film producer has made a deal with a plumber who got a record contract after being overheard singing while installing a bathroom. 
Kev Crane, from Leicestershire, landed a record deal after spending six weeks working at a music producer's house. 

BBC reported that the rights to his storey have now been sold to Stacy Sherman and Billy Ray, the writers of The Hunger Games. Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, British sitcom and film writers, have written a script, he said. 

Mr Crane, from Quorn, said: "It's like I'm seeing something happen to someone else." The team were responsible for iconic comedies such as The Likely Lads and Auf Wiedersehen. “I never imagined something like this could happen to me.”, he said. 

"We grew up watching shows like Porridge and Auf Wiedersehen, Pet along with films like The Commitments, so it feels unreal to be now working with the creators of those and having Zoom calls with them in LA and to think it's our story that they're working on," he said.

Film producer Stacy Sherman said she was drawn to the story because it is a tale of "the human spirit and music".
