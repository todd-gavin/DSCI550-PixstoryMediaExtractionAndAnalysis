When thieves stole an estimated $190 million from U.S. crypto firm Nomad last week, it was the seventh hack of 2022 to target an increasingly important cog in the crypto machine: Blockchain “bridges” – strings of code that help move crypto coins between different applications.


According to statistics from London-based blockchain analysis company Elliptic, hackers have already stolen cryptocurrency worth over $1.2 billion from bridges this year, more than double the amount they did last year.

Ronghui Hu, an associate professor of computer science at Columbia University in New York and co-founder of the cybersecurity company CertiK, stated, "This is a conflict where the cybersecurity firm or the project can't be the winner."

“We have to protect so many projects. For them (hackers) when they look at one project and there’s no bugs, they can simply move on to the next one, until they find a one weak point.”

Currently, the majority of digital tokens operate on their own distinct blockchain, which functions as a kind of online ledger for cryptocurrency transactions. When initiatives using these coins get isolated, their chances of being widely used are decreased.

Blockchain bridges seek to topple these barriers. In "Web3," the much-hyped vision of a digital future where cryptocurrency is integrated into online life and commerce, backers claim they will play a crucial role.

The weakest connection, though, can be a bridge.

The Nomad hack ranked as the eighth-largest cryptocurrency theft ever. A $615 million theft from Ronin, which was utilised in a well-known online game, and a $320 million theft from Wormhole, which was used in so-called decentralised banking applications, are two other bridge thefts that have occurred this year.

“Blockchain bridges are the most fertile ground for new vulnerabilities,” said Steve Bassi, co-founder and CEO of malware detector PolySwarm.
