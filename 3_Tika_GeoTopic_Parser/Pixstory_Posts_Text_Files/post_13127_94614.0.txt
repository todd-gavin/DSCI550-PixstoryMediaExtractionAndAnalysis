Aziz Hazara's new film, a concept artist who recently won the Next Generation Award, is a combination of light, darkness and sound. The film begins with a picture of Kabul's nights being struck by the red trail of a dark rocket. The continuation of the Taliban anthem disrupts the order in the colors and lights of the city.

The wide-frame film tries to accommodate all the lights that glow with different lights; It is as if the artist wanted to put all the inhabitants of the Afghan capital in one frame with all their differences.

The steady image of colors and lights is tarnished by the sound of a Taliban anthem calling its fighters to jihad. The colors are intertwined and stretched like bloodstains. Gradually, the sound of the Taliban's male anthem, which has been transformed into different forms with different effects, becomes vague and incomprehensible; To the extent that only a sound like a big illusion pervades the whole image.

Aziz Hazara previously won the $ 100,000 Pinchuk Prize at the Ukrainian Art Center for his "Five-Channel Video" about Afghan children.
