In a conversation with Film Companion, Kartik Aaryan talked about his professional success and shed some light on the upcoming projects in which he is engaged at the moment.🎥

 However, he also talked about his personal life and confirmed that he is single at the moment and isn't dating anyone. The actor also opened up about his breakup with his ex-girlfriend, Sara Ali Khan and admitted that he had hardly dated anyone since then. 🤔🤔

Although the actor first stated that he had dated no one for the last 1.5 years, he soon corrected it to 1 year and explained that he doesn't think it's that precise. To support his relationship status, he added that the last dialled number in his call log is of his mother.❤️❤️
