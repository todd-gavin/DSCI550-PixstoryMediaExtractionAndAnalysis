Following Everton s laborious win at home on Saturday s early kickoff the Manchester United players were in no mood whatsoever to observe the usual niceties In what was another forgettable evening in a season of forgettable evenings United barely inflicted any damage on Everton s backline Cristiano Ronaldo however probably inflicted more damage onto an Everton fan s mobile phone following the match The video that has emerged involves Ronaldo walking down the tunnel at Goodison Park but it remains unclear as to what Ronaldo smashed was a phone While fan in the presumptuous world of twitter have already started to assume a broken phone some say Ronaldo simply threw down a shin pad with the other pair in his left hand A frustrated Ronaldo walked down the tunnel as the person recording said footage seemed to shout an insult toward the Portuguese saying you re sh t How very typical of British fans Ragnick s team have just won once in their last games in England s top tier Despite CR and Marcus Rashford returning to United s team sheet Everton recorded a victory that might just prove to be the difference between daylight and relegation for them Ralf Ragnick was at the centre of most of the insults being thrown at United for his team selection versus Leicester If anything a change in team sheets didn t seem to change much as United barely got anything out of this game It s just one of those defeats you can t stand for because It s unacceptable for United to play the way they have done on the business end of the season If at all the allegations thrown at Ronaldo are true his acts will not go unnoticed and it will require impending investigation by the FA probably even a fine If not well that s just what happens to Ronaldo week in week out
