O wild West Wind thou breath of Autumn s being Thou from whose unseen presence the leaves dead Are driven like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing Yellow and black and pale and hectic red Pestilence stricken multitudes O thou Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed The winged seeds where they lie cold and low Each like a corpse within its grave until Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow Her clarion o er the dreaming earth and fill Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air With living hues and odours plain and hill Wild Spirit which art moving everywhere Destroyer and preserver hear oh hear Percy Bysshe Shelley
