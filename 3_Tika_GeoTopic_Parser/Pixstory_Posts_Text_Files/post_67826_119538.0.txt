Women’s Cricket is set to make its debut in the Commonwealth Games scheduled to commence on July 28 in Birmingham. The first game of the tournament will be played between Australia and India on July 29 while the hosts England will start their campaign against Sri Lanka on the next day against Sri Lanka.

A total of 16 T20 matches will be played over the course of 10 days and the Edgbaston Cricket ground in Birmingham will play hosts to all of them. It is one of the iconic grounds in England having hosted a lot of crucial matches including that of World Cup before and history is set to be created on August 7 when the teams will fight it out for the Gold medal.

Meanwhile, the pitch curator will have to be on their toes with 16 matches set to be played during the Commonwealth Games.

Here’s the pitch report of the Edgbaston Cricket Ground:

Edgbaston has hosted only one Women’s T20I previously between England and South Africa way back in 2014. Apart from this, the venue has played hosts to six Men’s T20 Internationals with the average run-scoring being 8.72 per over. 

Average score in six Men’s T20I matches has been 169. Interestingly, all six matches have been won by the team batting first. The venue hosted as many as 11 T20 matches in the recently concluded T20 Blast.

Pitch Report: The pitch at the Edgbaston is decent for batters and scores around 160-170 is expected to be par. However, as the tournament progresses, expect the surface to turn slow and scoring rate to come down. The team winning the toss should look to bat first.

Previous scores at the venue batting first in T20Is: 167, 162, 180, 221, 170

Previous scores at the venue batting first in T20 Blast 2022: 152, 190, 204, 186, 228

Average score in T20Is: 169

Average score in T20 Blast 2022: 212 (Last 5 matches)

Lowest defended target at the venue (T20Is): 126 (England Women vs SA Women in 2014)

Highest successful chase at the venue (T20Is): No score has been chased successfully in T20Is yet.
