Five years ago Marco Verratti was also part of the group that missed the World Cup The PSG midfielder was also there last summer when the national team triumphed at the European Championship Today he spoke to the press two days before the match against North Macedonia the first is hopes of the two that could lead to Qatar Compared to now there is more enthusiasm and more awareness By helping each other and staying united as during the European Championship we have come a long way and what we do best Just then we showed that in this team everyone is important, the group counts We are focus only on qualifying Italy will play under a lot of pressure Missing out on the World Cup for the second time in a row would be a disaster at a football level but this thought does not detract from Verratti&#39;s optimism We cannot afford to stay out of the World Cup but we are used to playing with this pressure we have to think about working well on the field not about what awaits us Accepting that we are in this situation and the thought that we depend only on ourselves There is a lot of pressure and a lot to lose but we cannot afford it On arrival in Coverciano after difficult weeks with the Psg Verratti says he is happy and that the change of air sweeps away bad thoughts Everyone has a different story with the club team here everyone gives everything for the same shirt for the same story And then even just entering Coverciano makes you feel good you forget everyone the bad thoughts the defeats with the club and you only remember that you have a great duty to take Italy where it deserves To make the history of this national team again
