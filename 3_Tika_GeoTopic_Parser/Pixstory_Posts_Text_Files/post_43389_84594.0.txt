Yes, it's really astonishing that for some people the only thing to fear, is fear itself. Yes, this is real. Still seems to be far-fetched? It's quite mind-boggling, right?

The fear of phobias is known as Phobophobia. 
It's quite different or you can say that it's complex than any other kind of phobias as you are afraid of fear itself. 
Phobophobics tend to avoid all kind of possible triggers that tend to bring them into any kind of agitation or apprehension. Usually they know that it's not rational to be extremely afraid but due to lack of control over their emotions, they usually fail to reduce their fear. 

Isn't it bizarre?
