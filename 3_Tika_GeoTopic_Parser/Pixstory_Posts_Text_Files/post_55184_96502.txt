How much do Australian networks and storytellers want to be the mirror that reflects Australian culture Or even shape it It s a conundrum that was raised at the recent Screen Forever conference as TVTonight reported Daniel Monaghan believes that if we reflect or attempt to reflect the Australian audience as we do as a network we are shaping it So we should not make the mistake of thinking we can have one without the other We re constantly accused of attempting to form too hard in public But in all honesty as a network our goal is to create stories that reflect the population whether it s sexuality cultural ethnic or racial variety He said We are always trying to think how can we pull these stories forward and reflect the audience who s going to engage with us And it s hard on the commercial side because you are always aiming for the big broad audience On the other hand Sally Riley Head of Drama Entertainment and Indigenous ABC said that I don t know that we re trying to shape We re trying to reflect Australia But I think we want to give insight to what the Australian experience is like She rightly pointed out that AustraliaI is not one thing it s many different peoples experience If we can engage people emotionally that s how we change people s minds about racism or all sorts of issues What do you think about it
