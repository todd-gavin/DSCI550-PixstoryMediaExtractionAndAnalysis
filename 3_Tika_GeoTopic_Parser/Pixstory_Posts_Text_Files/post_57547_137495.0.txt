Sounds uncanny?
Of course, yes, but it doesn't matter how bizarre this idea would sound; it actually heals.
The thought of inserting thin needles through the skin at some strategic points was a Chinese practice.
It is considered Chinese medicine, used to relieve a health condition or symptom and pain of any kind.
This practice was devised before 2500 BCE in China.
Later, it began to gain popularity in other countries that used this method for curing diseases.
The idea of acupuncture is evoked from the yin and yang philosophy.
"The yin, the female principle, is passive and dark and is represented by the earth; the yang, the male principle, is active and light and is represented by the heavens. "
It is believed that these forces act in our bodies as they do in the universe, and any imbalance in these two forces can cause disease of disharmony. Hence, acupuncture therapy is used to bring the yin and the yang back to balance.
This whole concept makes the therapy more intriguing and interesting.
Surprisingly many people choose therapy to get relief.
