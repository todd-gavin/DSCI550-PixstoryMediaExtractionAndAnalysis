n the picture, Anushka posed during the golden hour, outside a vanity van. She wore warm clothes, which included a beige sweatshirt with black pants and a pair of boots. She also sported chunky sunglasses and struck different poses with the same background. 😍😍😍😍Sharing her displeasure with the outcome of the photos, Anushka explained in a long caption why she still wants to put them online for the world to see. She wrote, “Ek bhi photo acchi nahin lagi mujhe! Toh Maine socha hamesha acchi photo daalna hai yeh kissne kaha? (I didn’t like even a single picture. But, then I thought, who has said that one needs to post good pictures on social media?) 😮😮😮😱😱😱😱“Toh yeh hain Meri ok ok type photos jo main naa daalti lekin apni keemti saans inko kheechne main use kari hai toh post karna toh banta hai. Chalo ok bye (So, here are my okayish pictures, which I usually don’t post. But I realised I have invested my previous effort to get them clicked, it’s worth a post)” the actor further added. 😛😛😛😛😛Arjun Kapoor, who has quite a bit of a reputation for teasing his industry friends....Soon after she shared the pictures, Arjun Kapoor rushed to the comment section and teased her, “Hoodie achi hai (fire emoji) photos toh kharaab hai I agree (Your hoodie is nice, but not your pictures).”✅✅✅✅✅✅😂😂
