 Keep Band Aids in your wallet Never carry your money on just one bag Use cupcake liners for popsicle drips Always keep a towel in your car or in any sort of vehicle Always keep a store of water filled containers that can be used during water crisis Make sure to boil the vegetables before you cook Keep the leftover food in closed boxes and always keep it covered so that it can be reused To keep the lemons fresh pack it in aluminium foil Don t buy a big packet of any food item as they will get damp Instead buy small small packets and use them wisely Whenever you have a catch or sprain in your back shoulder or neck immediately stand straight and erect Secure plastic wrap around a bunch of bananas to slow the ripening of banana Whenever you have acidity just chew some carom seeds Always include ginger and clove in your tea it will maintain your immunity Don t throw away used tea leaves it can be used as a fertiliser Make sure you maintain a sheet so that you can keep a track of your expenses Hope this helps you too
