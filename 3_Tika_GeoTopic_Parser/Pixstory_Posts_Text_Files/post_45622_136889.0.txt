On September 3, Little Women will make its Netflix debut. As per Fansided, a brand-new K-Drama follows three impoverished sisters whose lives drastically improve after one of them discovers a bag with 70 billion won. But it's not all rosy because they end up involved with South Korea's richest family as a result of having the money. 

The same production studio that gave us the Netflix original programmes Love Alarm, Sweet Home, and Twenty-Five Twenty-One created the mystery series. Director Kim Hee-won of Vincenzo directed it, while Chung Seo-kyung wrote the script. In addition, the same-titled 1868 book by Louisa May Alcott was turned into a television series. 

If you're as eager as I am to watch it, let me know!
