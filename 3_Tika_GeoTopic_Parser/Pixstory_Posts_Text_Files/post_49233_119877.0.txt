I've always liked Linkin Park (Formerly Xero, Hybrid Theory). I think they make great music and truly do justice to the genre they've picked. Ranging from pop-rock to soft and hard rock, I really enjoy their music. I love the amount of detail they put into their lyrics. They once said something along the lines of wanting to make music not about a certain situation but the emotions that come with those certain situations, and they truly do that. Also while I'm not personally a big fan of rap, I think their rap is great too! Here are some of my personal favorites:

Crawling
Lost in the echo
Numb
Breaking the habit
New divide
Given up
One step closer
Faint
Papercut
In my remains
Iridescent
Heavy
Nobody can save me
sharp edges
One more light
Valentine's day
Figure 9
Lying from you
With you
Keys to kingdom
Lied greed misery / War

Some people swear they are better than Metallica, and um well, I'd say that is a little far fetched claim but I would totally like to believe they're not much behind than Metallica either. I think Linkin Park's music is truly distinct and there's no real need of this comparison. While I listen to both those bands, I've found myself listening to Linkin Park more. Probably because they're more of our time I believe. I also like their range better.
