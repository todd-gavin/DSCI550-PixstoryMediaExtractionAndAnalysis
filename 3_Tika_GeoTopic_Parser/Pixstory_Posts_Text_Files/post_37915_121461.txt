The Premier League season is set to kick off on th August as Crystal Palace welcome Arsenal to Selhurst Park Here is my prediction of how the season is going to pan out Champions Manchester City The Cityzens have added a much needed centre forward in Erling Haaland to their ranks With a sturdy defence and a sharpened attack the Sky Blues would certainly be the favourites to win the title again Top Four Man City Liverpool Tottenham Hotspur Man United Man City Liverpool and the Spurs look set to occupy thr top four berths All the mentioned clubs have a strong set of players equally partnered by exquisite managers Man United Chelsea and Arsenal would contest for the remaining spots and the Red Devils could slightly pip their opponents in Cristiano Ronaldo decides to stay at the club Wildcards Tottenham Hotspur Antonio Conte has gone on a signing spree in the summer signing the likes of Richarlison Perisic Spence Lenglet and others The Spurs certainly can upset the big boys on their day but can they go all out and win the league Only time will tell Relegation Nottingham Forest Fulham Bournemouth The three clubs that were promoted would certainly have to play out of their skins to stay in the Premier League The rest of the clubs look settled hence these could face the drop in May
