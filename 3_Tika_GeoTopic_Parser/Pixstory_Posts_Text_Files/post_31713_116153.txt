Feminist archeology was born with the aim of abolishing prejudices related to the role played by women in antiquity, trying to underline the importance of the female figure often considered marginal. We are therefore talking about a different way of interpreting the ancient world. Another salient point of the critique of feminist archeology the image we have of the archaeologist In the common imagination the rude and powerful scholar who works in the field moving heavy boulders and soil that of the archaeologist instead refers to the scholar encouraged to do research in the laboratory Although there is a clear inequality, some archaeologists have opposed the thought feminist only a small number of scholars are actively engaged in challenging patriarchal power structures Some even prefer to avoid the term feminist for fear of leaking a political ideology and/or because of the negative connotations that the term has acquired over time We instead have no fear of calling ourselves feminists and we fully support the cause Source genderarchaeology
