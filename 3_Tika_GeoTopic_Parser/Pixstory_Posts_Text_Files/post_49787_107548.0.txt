How important is it to manifest in this era? Why do we need this? There is so much chaos among the people, especially the youth and often people wander. 

Here are some tips for manifesting 

Taking responsibility is a very important factor. Not only take responsibility for good but bad, mistakes happened, fears etc. The darker side of yours is important so you have to accept it to overcome it. 

Stop blaming others- Many people might have given your trauma and made your life miserable, but it is also because you let them. This could be parents, friends or anybody. You should not let it grow negative energy inside you.

Stop looking for motivation: This is tricky because motivation is needed in your journey. But you cannot get constantly motivated by looking for videos or hearing stories. Just give some space in your heart so that you can input your motivation.

Love yourself so much that you can forgive yourself as well as others. You know you can overcome this, and achieve everything you ever wanted because you choose it and worked for it.
