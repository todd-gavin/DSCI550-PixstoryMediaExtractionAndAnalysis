Mohamed Salah hoped to take revenge on Real Madrid by winning the Champions League final played in Paris For the Egyptian and for Liverpool instead came the second consecutive disappointment against the Blancos one step away from the title of European champions Salah&#39;s season ended thus with the successes in the Carabao Cup and the FA Cup as well as the golden boot won as top scorer in the Premier League The Reds forward took stock of his social profiles I can&#39;t put into words how much we wanted to bring that trophy back to Liverpool but in the end there is no we succeeded I can&#39;t thank the fans enough for your support it&#39;s been a very long season but part of me wishes the next one starts again tomorrow To be rewarded by the fans and sportswriters in the same season something special that i will never forget anyway i would give them all up those personal rewards for having the chance to replay that final but that&#39;s not how football works
