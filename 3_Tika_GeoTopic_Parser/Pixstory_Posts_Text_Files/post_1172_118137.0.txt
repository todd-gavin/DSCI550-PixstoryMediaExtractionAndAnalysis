Marriage is an opportunity for most people in India to finally have sex. But what if I tell you a significant number of men, despite having the desire and intention to have sex, will never be able to have partner sex or consummate their marriage? 

Strangely, even doctors won‚Äôt be able to help them as they won‚Äôt have any medical issues. Many such couples go through years of misery, blaming each other for their sexual difficulty, without ever knowing the real reasons. 

In today‚Äôs video I talk about a rare masturbatory technique, engaged in by a large minority of men around the world that can inadvertently make many of them unable to have partner sex, forever. 

Joining me in this conversation is Dr
Lawarence I Sank, a Harvard trained sex-therapist, who was the first to study
the dangers ‚Äòprone masturbation‚Äô in men, nearly 25 years ago. The technique is now identified as one of the leading causes of erectile dysfunction/difficulty in achieving orgasm in men, by doctors/sex therapists/sexologists around the world, including India. 

I will also be sharing a copy of the treatment protocol advised by Dr Sank for the benefit of my listeners at the
end of this podcast. 

Some of the questions/topics that will be answered discussed
during the session are:

Why do some men learn to masturbate the wrong way?

Why is it important to know how to masturbate the right way?

How religious prohibitions on masturbation can ruin sex life?

Can certain masturbatory techniques make women unable to achieve orgasm?

The importance of medically accurate sexuality education
