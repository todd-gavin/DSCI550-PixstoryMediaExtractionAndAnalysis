At present, there are over 350 different pasta shapes and nearly four times as many names! The etymology of pasta shape names has a fascinating history, one that often goes undiscussed. 

The word “pasta” itself derives from the Italian word for the dough from which pasta shapes are made. The names themselves usually trace back to either their creation process or objects they resemble.  “Spaghetti”, for example, derives from the Italian word spago, meaning string, resembling its long, straggly shape. The term “ravioli”, however, derives from the Italian riavvolgere – “to wrap”– in reference to the process of “wrapping” the dough around the filling before cutting into squares.

In spite of an abundance of choice, we’ve managed to pick out five of our favourite names for pasta shapes. Not only will this help all of you pasta-lovers brush up your pasta knowledge, it also provides some helpful trivia to share at your next dinner party! 
Now I'll give my basic homemade pasta dough recipe. The dough should be hard not soft. Ingredients are- 
500gm - All Purpose Flour or Maida
4 Eggs - Whole 
2Tbsp - Olive Oil
1 ½ Tsp - Salt 

There's no use of water usually but if the dough is not needed or the eggs maybe small in size so can just sprinkle a lit bit of water.
Rest it for  30 mins in Fridge. Then roll out in your desired shape and size or according to your recipe. Boil in salt water till Al dente.
