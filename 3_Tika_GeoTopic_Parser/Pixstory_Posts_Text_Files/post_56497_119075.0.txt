Danni Di Toro has pretty much done it all over a 30-year career in sport.

The 47-year-old has been to seven Paralympics across two different sports, co-captained the team twice, won Paralympic silver and bronze, and claimed multiple wheelchair tennis grand slam titles.

So it's remarkable that the much loved member of Australia's Paralympic team can still notch up a first in her career, as she prepares for her first Commonwealth Games.

"To be able to actually have a genuine rookie experience at something is really cool and super refreshing," Di Toro told ABC Sport.

"Any opportunity to get the exposure, get more people seeing what we do, if that gets people with disabilities involved in sport, that's amazing.

"But more importantly, it's about showing that there's a place for all of us."

While the Paralympics are the pinnacle elite sporting competition for athletes with a disability, the Commonwealth Games are the only multi-sport event with an integrated para-sport program.

Manchester 2002 was the first Games to include this element, with 10 events.

That's grown with each Games, and Birmingham will have the largest para-sport component in history, across eight sports and 42 events.

It's a significantly pared back program compared to the Paralympics, meaning there aren't as many classifications available, and a smaller number of events across the selected sports.

Australia will send a record 74 para-athletes, alongside eight guides, pilots and directors, with representation in each of the eight sports.
