Why does our mental health easily fall to the bottom of our priority list when we know that if we aren't prioritising it, everything else in life suffers and we can't enjoy our day to day. This is your reminder. Your mental health is more important than :

1. Keeping up with emails and messages.

2. Fitting in, people pleasing and wanting
to be liked.

3. Always being seen as the 'funny or
positive one'

4. Saying yes when you mean no.

5. Everything, if you're not looking after
your mental health, it becomes far more
difficult to enjoy everything else in life.
