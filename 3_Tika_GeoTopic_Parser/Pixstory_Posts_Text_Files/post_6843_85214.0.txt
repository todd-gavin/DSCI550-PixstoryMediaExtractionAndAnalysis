Against the backdrop of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a video of a man entering a plane is making the rounds on social media. Seated inside are several other male and female passengers. Though the footage does not show the face of this individual, it has been claimed that this is Vladimir Putin. Users suggest that he personally went to meet Indian students who were being evacuated aboard an Air India aircraft. Social media users see this is a mark of respect for India, and are praising Prime Minister Modi. The two-minute-long clip was posted on Facebook with this claim. 

Alt News also received numerous requests to verify the footage on our WhatsApp helpline number (+91 76000 11160).

Taking a closer look at the video, we can confirm that the man is not President Vladimir Putin. At the 0:33 mark, the man identifies himself as Rahul Shrivastava, the Indian ambassador to Romania.

In a February 26 tweet carrying the video, ANI quoted Shrivastava who said that the Indian government was working day and night to evacuate Indians from Ukraine.

He also appears in the video speaking to the students via intercom. He says, “I know you have gone through a very long and arduous journey. Now that you’re on the last leg of your journey back home, your relatives, family and friends would be waiting with open arms to welcome you. When you’re back in our motherland, you should also remember that you have friends who are still here. When you talk to your friends waiting to be evacuated, you should assure them that the government of India team is working night and day to evacuate everyone.” Wishing the students a safe passage, he also asked them to remember this day, February 26, when faced with any difficult situations in the future.
