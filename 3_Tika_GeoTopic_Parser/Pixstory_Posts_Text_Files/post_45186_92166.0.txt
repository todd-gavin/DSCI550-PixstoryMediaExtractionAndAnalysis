During the Champions League quarter-final match in Lisbon, the defender made light of a
frustrating circumstance in which he was nearly injured by projectiles.

Liverpool defender Andrew Robertson claims he was nearly struck by lighters during his team's
match against Benfica, and the Scottish international suggests that home fans take advantage
of the situation to quit smoking. The Reds had a 3-1 lead into the second leg after goals from
Ibrahima Konate, Sadio Mane, and Luis Diaz in the first leg.

Home fans were observed throwing objects onto the pitch throughout the game, with Diaz just
avoiding being hit after his goal, and Robertson claiming he, too, was near to getting struck.

"I got quite a few lighters thrown at me [taking a corner], maybe it will stop them smoking - so
take the postives from it," he told BT Sport. "But you should try not to throw things on the pitch
because it can hurt people, luckily none hit me."

Diaz, a former Porto player, was the hero of the show at his old rivals' stadium, as he assisted
Mane's goal before scoring himself late on. The Colombian was greeted with hostility, but
Robertson praised the January addition for how he handled the spotlight.

The joy on Luis Diaz's face spoke it all. He was well aware of how significant this achievement
was, and he was not about to pass up the chance to celebrate it. When his name was given out
before kickoff at Estadio da Luz, it was booed, but he would get the last laugh.

"He got a nice reception from the start, playing for one of their rivals," Robertson said. "A good
goal for him and a two-goal cushion makes a difference. Hopefully we can get the job done."
