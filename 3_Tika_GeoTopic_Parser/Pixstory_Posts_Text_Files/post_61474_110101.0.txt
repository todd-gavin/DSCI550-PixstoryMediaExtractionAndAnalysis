Orchids are – currently with about 28.000 accepted species – the second biggest group of flowering plants worldwide.

This diversity and the wide distribution beg the question – how can you identify an orchid? The structure of the orchid flower is a key characteristic in identifying them. Orchid flowers are monosymmetrical. This means that both halves of the flower mirror each other. One special attribute of the orchid flower is that the female parts are fused to the so called column and the male parts are fused together to a pollinarium that sits protected under the anther cap. Three Sepals (outer circle of flower petals) and three Petals (inner circle of flower petals) form the flower. One of the petals differs greatly from the other two and forms the “lip” of the flower where pollinators can “land” on the flower.
