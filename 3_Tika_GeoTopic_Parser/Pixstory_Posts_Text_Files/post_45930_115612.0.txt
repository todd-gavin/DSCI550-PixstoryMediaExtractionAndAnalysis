According to a snapshot of the conversation posted online, Melania Trump rejected her then chief of staff's recommendation that she send a tweet denouncing the Capitol incident on January 6. 

Well honestly, I am not surprised one bit because I have always believed that everything Melania does is a facade and she has no real “good” intention. This just proves it. 

As per news portals, following the January 6 committee hearing before Congress when former White House assistant Cassidy Hutchinson testified, Stephanie Grisham released the purported text exchange with the former First Lady on Twitter on Tuesday.

“Do you want to tweet that peaceful protests are the right of every American, but there is no place for lawlessness and violence?” Ms Grisham wrote in the message.

Ms Trump, whose name appears as “MT” in the exchange, responded with one word, “No.”

However, I really hope that all of this was revealed on time. So that more people could see the reality of Trumps. 

Ms Grisham, who resigned from the White House immediately after the events of January 6, 2021, replied, “I’ve spoken about this many times before, testified to the committee twice, and have co-operated with some legal cases.”

She had described the text exchange in her book published last year, I’ll Take Your Questions Now: What I Saw in the Trump White House.
