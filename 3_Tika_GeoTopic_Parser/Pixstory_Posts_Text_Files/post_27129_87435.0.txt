According to The New York Times, Alec Baldwin reportedly wanted to continue filming his "Rust" movie, even after fatally shooting and killing cinematography Halyna Hutchins.

Baldwin reportedly told the cast and crew that it would
"honor" Hutchins' memory. He also stated that the film's profits and insurance payouts could potentially go to Hutchins' husband Matthew and their son.

The filming did not continue, and the movie likely will never be finished.
