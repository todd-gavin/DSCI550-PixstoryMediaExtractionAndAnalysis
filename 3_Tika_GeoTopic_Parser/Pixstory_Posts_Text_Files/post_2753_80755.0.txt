Russia has been maintaining its aggressive stance on Ukraine while also willing to talk more. Diplomacy has not achieved a breakthrough despite several world leaders trying their best. And the prospect of Russia invading Ukraine is giving chills to the world. 

If the war breaks out, many refugees could be forced to flee Ukraine leading to a new crisis for Europe besides the NATO being caught in no-man's land if Russia invades Ukraine. The talks were faltering when the UK defense secretary said that military tensions were still moving the "wrong way".

UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace has warned that it would be a "lose-lose" scenario if Moscow attacks Ukraine. But so far, according to defense experts, Russia has done enough to show that it has done its homework on the possible after effects of invading Ukraine.

According to some news reports from the U.S., Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine, and this has been communicated to the Russian military. Defense correspondents are quoting sources.

Other tell-tale signs of an impending Russian invasion include almost half of all combat-ready troops being moved to the border of Ukraine by Russia and its warships moving from different places to Black Sea. Russia has said that it was moving ships for a military exercise. (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/8/six-russia-warships-en-route-to-black-sea-for)

Recently, French President Emmanuel Macron, said that Putin assured him that Russian forces would not ramp up the crisis near Ukraine's borders. But just the opposite has been happening on ground.

NATO has warned that sanctions would following if Russia invades. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen has warned that all options were on the table and that "sanctions would concern the financial and energy sectors, as well as exports of high-tech products."
