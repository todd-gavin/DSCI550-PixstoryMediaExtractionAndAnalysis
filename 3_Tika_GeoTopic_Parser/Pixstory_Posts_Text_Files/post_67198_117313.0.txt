WE STAND BETWEEN 'NOW' AND THE MYSTERY 

So much to hold within,
Life is now or never
That's the feeling,
So much that slowly
Drills down deep
Like a machine 
To pierce through the loneliness
And talking to dumb silence.
A pathway 
So dark and hollow,
Crickets creak
Where the shadowS brood
All day long,
No soul ,no conscience,
Only old grievances like a candle
Flicker before getting blown away
By the wind
Across the sleepy garden walls,
I breathe your name with a sigh,
With a promise to bring in peace . 

Light shines far away,
Far away,
Love rings
Like the soft sound of a bell,
We are here,
We stand between 'now' and the mystery,
Lost in an unfathomable destiny.
