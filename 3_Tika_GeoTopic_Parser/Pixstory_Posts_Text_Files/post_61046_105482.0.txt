I don’t know how to say this other than just outright state it: I know that privacy is dead and we confer ourselves entitled to any news about any person who manages to achieve celebrity status (the ethics of this are questionable in itself but we’ll delve into that another day). But domestic violence is by no means a light-hearted or amusing subject to make memes about,. or strife for entertainment from – you would think that a society could deter this much without having their morals explicitly called out by 17-year olds online.. How we managed to completely forget the trauma endured by both parties in an abusive relationship will remain a perplexity. How we instead chose to take sides, based on our personal biases, and continued to exploit the lives of these individuals( with Amber Heard undoubtedly facing the brunt of it)   will remain a source of extreme humiliation – not only on us but also on the part of several, “big names” in news sources who continued to sensationalise these trials for profits and popularity( that’s consumerism, I guess).

As for those of you who think that toxic masculinity makes it difficult for domestic violence victims who are men to seek justice or even help, please remember that Johnny Depp, is extremely privileged based on the huge support and wealth he has amassed based on his acting merit. If you don’t believe me, believe the 19 billion views that #justiceforjohnnydepp gained on tik-tok.

A lot of things could be done differently (re: correctly) - the jurists should have been separated, actual defence tactics beyond "Darvo" could have been utilised.. Nevertheless, I would like to remind you to not set this case as a standard of any kind, but to treat it as a lesson: it is perhaps time to be wary of the forms of online media we are constantly consuming and start checking our own opinion. (Maybe base it on actual facts to start with !)
