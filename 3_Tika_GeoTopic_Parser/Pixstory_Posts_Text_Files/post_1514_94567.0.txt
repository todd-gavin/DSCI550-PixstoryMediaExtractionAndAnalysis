On a short trip to Delhi, I got the opportunity to visit the Pixstory offices in New Delhi.

I met the Pixstory team for the first time but from the minute we met, I felt like I was meeting old friends after a long time. 

Over the last year, I have followed their journeys on Pixstory- their recipes, opinion on world affairs, how they beat COVID and musings about their day to day lives. Our meeting felt like an extension on our interactions on the app. 

It also made me reflect on the space Pixstory offers- unfiltered, authentic and real.
