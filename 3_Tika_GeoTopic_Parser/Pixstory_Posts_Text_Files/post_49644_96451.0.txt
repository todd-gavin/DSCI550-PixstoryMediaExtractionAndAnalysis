It took years for Disney to come to its senses (at least a bit). Disney is/was responsible for the sexism and gender roles instilled in children to a great extent and yes we have discussed it a zillion times. We are open to changes and we are open to amendments Disney made especially raised voices against the so-called "Don't Say Gay" bill.  

We all know the tension began when Disney denounced Florida's 'Don't say a gay bill', which allows parents to sue their local school district if topics such as sexual orientation or gender identity are mentioned in the classroom. So what has Florida governor Ron DeSantis done? He signed a  law that eliminates a statute that has for decades allowed entertainment giant Disney to act as a self-governing body in Orlando, where it has its theme park. It included the capacity to levy taxes, build roads, control utilities and operate its fire department. The Florida bill will eliminate Disney's Reedy Creek Improvement District and several others. The measure, however, allows for districts to be re-established in the future.

So we saw what happens when a company like Disney expresses its opinion. So we know why the people of Florida remain silent. Is this what the government is supposed to do when a citizen expresses their opinion or goes against a fundamentally flawed bill they are subdued. I say some people want nothing but to spread hate.
