The defeat against Bodo Glimt in the first leg of the Conference League quarter-finals doesn&#39;t worry Jos Mourinho despite the fact that in the three matches against the Norwegians he has never achieved a victory And in seven days he needs to score full points to be able to access the semi-finals He knows it well the Portuguese coach We don&#39;t lose a defeat and we have the second half to play A defeat when you play in the group or in a league where you lose points but here we have a second half to play in front of our fans We have never won against Bodo in the previous three games but the only one that counts is the next one. We win it and we&#39;ll be in the semifinal. the team both in terms of intensity due to the risk of injuries like Mancini and because it is different from natural grass Playing on synthetic grass We know that another sport is very vulnerable to injuries and it seems to me that what Mancini suffered is important We thank those who allows you to play on these fields
