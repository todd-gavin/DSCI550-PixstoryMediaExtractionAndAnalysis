Sadio Mane has completed a m move from Liverpool to Bayern Munich on a three year contract The Reds will receive m euros with an additional m euros based on appearances plus m euros for individual and team achievements as reported by Fabrizio Romano Liverpool turned down two bids from Bayern before agreeing a fee for the Senegal forward who was under contract until next summer before accepting the deal from Bayern for the desired price tag Many experts would find it appalling that Man was let go by Liverpool for such a low price Man has been magical for Liverpool and this comes off as a bad decision by the management Man wanted a new challenge and to step away from Liverpool and Bayern was looking to replace the Barcelona bound Lewandowski so all in all all the parties concerned would be very happy with how the situation worked out
