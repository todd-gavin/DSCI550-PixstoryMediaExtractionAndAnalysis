Antonio Conte came in, brought with him several training reforms as well as a more
structured approach to having leaders in the dressing room. Besides just being a natural
leader himself, Conte instilled confidence in players like Matt Doherty and Harry Kane.

Full-backs getting forward to score was a regular occurrence. Players like Reguilon and
Emerson Royal were granted freedom unlike under Nuno. Soon enough Spurs were out of
the mid-table places and were competing for a European spot again.

Tottenham's journey in the EFL cup, FA Cup and Conference league weren't much to talk
about but come March, they'd beaten Manchester City again before demolishing Everton
and Leeds United in successive weeks. Three losses in February hurt but that was followed
by an impressive March. Conte's football was working and Spurs ended the season on a
relative high â€” clinching Champions League football being unbeaten in the final month of
Premier League fixtures. The Italian's obsessive winning mentality, Son's quality in the final
third and January signings got Spurs over the line eventually.

Hit of the Season: Dejan Kulusevski. The Swedish winger was brought in on loan from
Juventus alongside Rodrigo Bentancur. The pair were personal requests from Conte's entourage and they did not fail to excite.

Kulusevski finished the season with 5 goals and 8
assists in 6 great months at Tottenham.

Flop of the Season: Steven Bergjwin. The flying Dutchman spent much time on the bench
and on the sidelines. The highlight of his season was when he came off the bench to rescue
a win at Leicester, scoring twice in the dying moments. Still a shadow of the player he was
under Jose Mourinho.

Top Scorer: Heung Min Son. The South Korean shares the Premier League golden boot
with Mohammed Salah on 23 goals, scoring once every 131 minutes. Truly one of Asia's
finest.
