Writing is the paint brush of storytelling whether analytical factual or just out of expression When I heard about Pixstory I had to get involved I am at the start of my writing career and I needed a platform where I could safely express my writing around football and specifically Arsenal FC I have seen so many experiences where creators are targetted by trolls or hate abuse which has sadly slipped into our realities Mental health is fragile and suicide rates are at an increase so the need to create a platform which kicks out unwanted abuse is needed more than ever and it s encouraging to see platforms such as this on the rise Arsenal FC have gone through dark times which has spiked abuse on social channels so the time is now to turn this around Arsenal s exact motto is Victory through harmony that means we stick together through good and the rough times I m excited to come onboard and I look forward to sharing more thoughts as the season progresses
