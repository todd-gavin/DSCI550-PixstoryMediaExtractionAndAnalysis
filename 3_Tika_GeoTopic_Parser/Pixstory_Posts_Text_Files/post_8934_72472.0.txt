Bacha posh was a very new yet scary word for me when I first heard about it. I was in 4th grade when my brother got the DVD of an Afghani movie which became a hit in Afghanistan. The movie was called ‘OSAMA’ and I thought it was about Osama Bin Laden. To young me Osama Bin Laden was a bad man who was the reason behind many people dying in Afghanistan and I was reluctant to watch the movie. To older me the perception about Laden hasn’t changed an inch.
 
Anyway,
The movie featured a young girl who was married to an old man and would dress and had hair like a boy. I didn’t understand the concept of the movie back then and thought it was Osama Bin Laden’s son. I saw the movie in bits and pieces because I was scared until I recently watched “The Breadwinner” which showcased the hard reality of life in Afghanistan especially when there is no man in the house to run errands or earn money to feed the family. 
 
Bacha posh (literal meaning "dressed up as a boy") is a practice in Afghanistan where some families without sons would pick one of their daughters under the age of 12 usually to live and behave as a boy. This enables the child to behave more freely: attending school, escorting her sisters in public, and most importantly work to feed the family. Afghanistan is a dominated patriarchal society where boys are given more importance than girls.  
 
When I was a kid I thought it was a practice where one of the daughters in the house is forced to become the son to take care of the family. But I was wrong, bacha posh has got nothing to do with one's sexuality but has to do more with survival. 
 
Under a regime where women aren’t allowed to go outside their homes without their mahram (male guardians) some families without any male in the house are forced to make their youngest daughter a bacha posha.
