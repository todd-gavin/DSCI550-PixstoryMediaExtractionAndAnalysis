Italy s gender segregated voting queues A lousy justification to police trans folks Italy s general elections on Sunday have experienced the widespread implementation of nbsp decades old Italian election law that calls for separation into men only and women only queues and states that electoral lists must also be divided by gender This act of Italian government recieved huge backlash from LGBTQ folks Thousands of voters in Italy faced barriers as their identity cards did not represent their gender creating a breach of privacy against trans and gender nonconforming folks Cathy La Torre a LGBTQ activist and lawyer stood against the law and vows to sue Torre aims to take the case to the constitutional court and ask for the abrogation of the law Electoral authorities have not given an official explanation as to why the there were binary queues but according to some sources The decision to implement them is being portrayed as an intention to better manage long queues at polling stations with waits of an hour or more to vote Another lousy excuse to justify policing people s bodies
