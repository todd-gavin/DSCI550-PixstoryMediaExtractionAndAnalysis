This is the place where I currently reside in, Ghaziabad. I took this photo from my 10 month old phone. And guess what happened to my old phone? It got snatched away while I was walking on road at night.
Amongst all this, do you know what's the most astonishing part? It is that my nearby friends didn't even get surprised. They acted like it was a very normal thing. And why would they even? It has become
 so common.
Now answering your question of what would I like to change about my city, it would be nothing but this. Robbery is not normal and shouldn't be normalised. Till then, Bye! Let me keep my phone safe as I am going out ;)
