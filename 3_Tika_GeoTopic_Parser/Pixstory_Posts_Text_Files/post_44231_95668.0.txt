Wayne Rooney joined Manchester United from Everton in 2004 as an 18-year-old up-and-coming star for a £20 million transfer fee plus an additional £7 million in contingency
payments, which was a record sum for a player under the age of 20 at the time.

On September 28, 2004, Rooney made his Manchester United debut in a Champions League
group stage match against Fenerbahce of Turkey. The teenager had a fantastic debut, scoring a
hat-trick in Manchester United's 6-2 victory. The other three goals were scored by Ruud van
Nistelrooy, Ryan Giggs, and David Bellion.

The former England international played in 559 matches for the club, scoring 253 goals. He has
scored the most goals for the club in its history.
