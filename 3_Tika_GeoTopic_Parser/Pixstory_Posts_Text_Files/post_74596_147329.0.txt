Shortly after, Karisma Kapoor, too, joined them at the celebrations.  🔥🔥🔥🔥Taking to Instagram Stories, Karisma Kapoor shared inside glimpses from the family affair. She posted a photo from the cake cutting ceremony where Kareena is seen holding her younger son Jehangir Ali Khan who is blowing out the candles. He appears to be mesmerised by the fruit cake. The post read, “Birthday wishes.” ❤️❤️❤️✅✅In another picture, Kareena and Karisma came together for selfie. Both of them wore white outfits as they struck a pose during the get-together. Sharing the picture, Karisma wrote, “And the twinning continues.” 😍😍😍😍The couple, dressed in uber-chic outfits, posed for the paparazzi as well. However, it was Kareena’s fashion-forward birthday glory that took the cake. Bebo slipped into an elegant white mini dress which, we must add, boasted of some scene-stealing details. 😍😍😍😍The birthday girl opted for a mini dress featuring tone-on-tone delicate thread work all over. The all-white number came with a simple crew neck but was amped up with voluminous sleeves and waist cut-out details. Oh, and that’s not all. The ruffled side belt and pleated hem of the mini dress added to the voguish appeal✔️❤️❤️. Kareena not just made an impressive sartorial choice on her birthday but aced the styling game as well. A pair of white heels, a black designer handbag, statement cascading earrings and a pair of sunglasses added to the glam vibes. Her bold red lips added that perfect pop of colour to her birthday look.🔥🔥🔥
