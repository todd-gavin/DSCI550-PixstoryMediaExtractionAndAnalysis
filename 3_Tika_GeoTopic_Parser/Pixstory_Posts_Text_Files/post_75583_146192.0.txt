Last season, Arsenal suffered a few times from knock-backs. It seemed every time they lost, the loss would compound and be carried into the next games, leading to further poor results.
Against Crystal Palace, Arsenal lost, and lost the two games after. Against Manchester United they lost, and lost to Everton after. Ultimately they lost to Spurs, and lost the game after to Newcastle, losing top four in the process.
To be able to bounce back quickly and strongly, and not carry those losses into their next games is a crucial mental block Arsenal must overcome. Losses must be quickly moved past, to reduce the loss of points. 
Arsenal do appear to have come some way in overcoming those blocks already. Against Manchester United, Arsenal lost their first game of the season. After five consecutive wins, many predicted a loss could stumble this young Gunners side and cause a downturn in form. However, Arsenal returned against Brentford with a ferocious performance, smashing Brentford in their own home.
The improvement in this regard could be down to a number of things.
Experience is an obvious one, this side undoubtedly have learnt lessons from last season. They lost out of a number of points from carrying over losses, and they will be keen to prevent that happening again.
The new faces in the dressing room undoubtedly help too. Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko are two players with incredible mentalities. Being in that Manchester City dressing room, they know what it means to respond to a defeat. And they will absolutely have passed that onto their team-mates.
Arsenal will lose games this season. That is just an undeniable fact. However, if they can isolate those losses, and keep them from bleeding into other fixtures, they will be a hell of a lot better off than they were last season.
