By Shekhar Iyer A serious debate is raging within the Congress on hiring election strategist Prashant Kishor to help in the revamp of the party Sonia Gandhi thinks that Kishor has superb ideas that can catapult the party to a dominant position to challenge Prime Minister Narendra Modi and upset the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections But senior leaders like Digvijay Singh Kamal Nath and Ashok Gehlot believe that while Kishor may have had the guts to tell Sonia Gandhi and her children Rahul and Priyanka to allow a non family member to become party chief he could not be fully entrusted with the task of reviving of the Congress Apparently Kishor has convinced the Gandhis that their main worry about the flow of funds can be resolved because he knows the nuts and bolts of enhancing financial support to fight the elections Also he has also pledged to negotiate with leaders such as other opposition leaders including Jaganmohan Reddy M K Stalin Akhilesh Yadav Naveen Patnaik Tejashwi Yadav and Mamata Banerjee so that the Congress is able to contest a decent number of Lok Sabha seats In turn Kishor expects the Congress to accommodate him at a senior level allowing him ample freedom to implement his proposals that include fixing the leadership issue at all levels reclaiming the party s founding tenets raising an army of grassroots leaders and foot soldiers and creating a supportive media and digital propagation network Naturally Sonia Gandhi has found Kishor s offer very tempting and could be close to inducting him A year ago a similar exercise had failed to materialise and ended up with Kishor criticising the party leaders for not seizing on an opportunity to utilise his services Therefore the latest round of consultations between Sonia Gandhi and other leaders seemed to indicate that Kishor s Congress entry may be certain But he has to dissociate from all other parties including the DMK Trinamool Congress and the Telangana Rashtra Samithi TRS for whom he has been working for some time Read the full story here
