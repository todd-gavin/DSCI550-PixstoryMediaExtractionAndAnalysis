Bengaluru, Namma Bengaluru❤
I came to this metropolitan city with thousands of doubts, fears, and anxiety. But Bangalore welcomed me with rain, and poured love too. Now after one month, I'm gonna leave Bangalore, as I said earlier, I'm gonna miss this place. In short span of time  it turned to "Namma Bengaluru" from Bangalore. It's a place which gave me peace, which makes it perfect as home🏠.
