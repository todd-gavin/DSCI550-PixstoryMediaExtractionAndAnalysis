Climate change will significantly alter the way sound travels underwater affecting ecosystems and potentially exacerbating human-made noise In warmer waters, sound waves travel faster and persist longer before dying out, according to a study published in the scientific journal Earth s Future has identified acoustic hotspots in the ocean that could have a significant impact on the life of aquatic organisms Projections show that the greatest impact will occur in the Arctic where an amplification of the effects of climate change is already observed says Stefano OGS researcher Salon specifying that this will not happen uniformly throughout the Arctic but in a specific part where the signal of climate change according to the model projections becomes robust and exceeds the uncertainty of the model itself The research team also applied the projection of the variation of sound propagation to a specific marine organism the North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis is a critically endangered species and inhabits both acoustic hotspots of the North Atlantic The results demonstrate that the typical vocalization of these whales at Hertz is likely to propagate more far away in a future warmer ocean We have chosen a species of megafauna but many organisms that live in the ocean are influenced by the propagation of sound highlighted Affatati, specifying that all these hotspots are in fact areas characterized by great biodiversity
