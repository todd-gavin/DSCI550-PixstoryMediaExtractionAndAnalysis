Some songs are special because not many people don t know about them They are absolute trasures hidden in plain sight you just need to look at them This song is one of those The song ohh meri laila from the film titled Laila Majnu sadly the film didn t do well on the box office despite being great Same goes for its songs the film s album is wonderful Yet mist people don t know about it Singers Atif Aslam Jyotica Tangri Music Joy Barua Lyrics Irshad Kamil
