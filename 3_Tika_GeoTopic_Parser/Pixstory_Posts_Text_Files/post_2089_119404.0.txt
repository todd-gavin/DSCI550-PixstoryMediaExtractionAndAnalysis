On Tuesday, jurors in Texas heard the opening statements in the defamation trial of the notorious media personality Alex Jones. The defamation trial centers on allegedly defamatory statements made by Alex Jones against the families of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre victims, which claimed the lives of 26 first-graders and instructors. Alex Jones specifically claimed that the incident was planned and that those engaged were actually crisis actors. Later, however, Alex Jones recanted his claims and accepted that the massacre had occurred.

Alex Jones has been found guilty in two different defamation proceedings stemming from his claims about the Sandy Hook massacre; however, in all of these trials, default judgments were granted because he refused to respond to court requests and provide documents.

Alex Jones' lawyers said, in relation to the case, “It’s a very important First Amendment case. On trial right now is not just people’s freedom of speech, but it’s also people’s freedom to listen. To choose what they watch on television, to make those choices for themselves, instead of having a personal injury lawyer make those choices for them.” The plaintiffs are seeking nearly $150 million in damages, including $75 million for harm to the parents' reputation and another $75 million for emotional distress. This amount symbolizes $1 for each American purportedly duped by Alex Jones' claims.
