As many as five Congress leaders including four former ministers from Punjab joined the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP on Saturday This marks yet another exodus from the grand old party that has been unable to recover after the stunning defeat in the Lok Sabha elections From young leaders to veterans the Congress is losing them to different political parties mainly the BJP One reason for this exodus is that these leaders don t see any future for themselves in the party and hence look for greener pastures Secondly they want to protect their business and other interests Thirdly it is frustrating for them to stay away from power politics for too long That is why they look for better avenues In Punjab the Aam Aadmi Party AAP decimated everyone be it the Congress the BJP the Shiromani Akali Dal SAD or the Punjab Lok Congress of former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh The Bhagwant Mann government has also launched a drive against corruption and maintained that it will go after the corrupt people irrespective of how influential or powerful they are This has made many jittery and in the present situation the only safe place seems to be the BJP The four former ministers who joined the BJP on Saturday are Raj Kumar Verka Balbir Singh Sidhu Gurpreet Singh Kangar and Sundar Sham Arora Apart from them Congress leaders Kewal S Dhillon Kamaljeet S Dhillon and the sitting Mayor of Congress in Mohali Amarjeet S Sidhu too joined the BJP Balbir Sidhu a three time legislator from Mohali was the health minister in the previous Congress government while Gurpreet Kangar a three time legislator from Rampura Phul was the revenue minister Verka a prominent Dalit leader from the Majha region is also a three time legislator and was the minister for social justice and and empowerment and minorities in the previous government Sunder Sham Arora a former legislator from Hoshiarpur was the industry and commerce minister in the previous Congress government Their joining happened days after former Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar joined the BJP It seems the fear factor played heavily on their minds prompting them to jump ship
