For most people it's the left hand and for lefties it's the right hand. It's a creativity boost but does not mean it benefits only painters and artists.

When you use the non-dominant hand, you are
creating new brain neural connections which helps with clarity and fighting brain fog.
Also using your other hand activates both brain hemispheres equally, which results in thinking differently and innovatively
It's a great great way to reduce stress and anxiety since you put your complete focus on writing.
It also improves your memory and playing skills, since you're constantly using both sides of your brain and muscle tissue.


This is a must learn skill for kids to promote their learning, thinking, writing and creativity.
