In the present world of fashion there are number of models who come up with several brands and show their beauty and talent. But there is a duo which has a different kind of fan following and have created their own market value. 
Gigi Hadid and Bella Hadid are two such names who have left their mark in the world fashion. They have always been in the latest news and have represented many international luxury Brands like Gucci, Fendi, Armani, Versace and many more. Both of them are seen at various events but it's very rare when they come together for a show and walk on the same ramp together. Fans always wish to see them together on the ramp and they are super crazy for the same. Recently they were seen on the ramp for Ralph Lauren's autumn/winter 2022 show. Gigi opened the show in a sweater emblazoned with Ralph Laurenâ€™s initials, teamed with tailored trousers, cut-out brogues and a sturdy black handbag embodying classic NYC style. Bella later strolled down the catwalk in an equally polished outfit, comprising a black roll neck,  with a crisp white shirt and checked blazer over the top. The look was finished off with a matching bag and loafers.The show, which involved a predominantly monochrome palette, also featured a series of timeless black and white evening looks. Gigi, who recently dyed her locks platinum blonde, upped the ante in a black torso-baring gown, while her younger sister served up a healthy dose of glamour in an elegant white dress featuring an asymmetric neckline. All the fans and the fashion lovers have gone crazy to see them together. The sisters are ruling the world fashion and killing them with their fashion.
