Paris Saint Germain took on FC Nantes in the French Super Cup (Trophée des Champions) final tonight at Israel’s Bloomfield Stadium and they registered a dominating 4-0 win to lift the first trophy of the 2022-23 season. 

Head coach Christophe Galtier used a 3-4-3 formation with Lionel Messi, Neymar and Pablo Sarabia upfront as Kylian Mbappe was not a part of tonight’s squad and it did wonders for the french side. Lionel Messi scored a wonder right-footed goal after dribbling past the goalkeeper at the 22’ mark and opened PSG’s tally for the night. 

It was followed by a sensational free-kick by Neymar right before Half time. He got his second goal of the night in the second half after converting a poorly taken penalty. The only other goal in the match was scored by Sergio Ramos at the 57’ mark. 

This victory was particularly important for Lionel Messi’s personal trophy record as it is his 41st career trophy. He is now just 3 trophies away from overtaking Dani Alves who has won the most number of trophies by any footballer ever. 

Paris Saint Germain have had a very positive performance in the pre-season and their 4-0 win in the first official match of the season will definitely add to their confidence. Not to forget that Kylian Mbappe is yet to be added to this team. 

PSG’s new signing Vitinha was one of the many players who caught fans’ attention tonight with his stellar performance. He is an absolute baller and a brilliant addition to PSG’s midfield. PSG fans will definitely look forward to many more similar performances from him in days to come. 

As for PSG’s two stars Lionel Messi and Neymar Jr, the duo has seemingly rebuilt their long-lost chemistry. Their understanding on the pitch is next level and it will only grow eventually. They are definitely reminding us of the sweet old FC Barcelona days.
