Every time Shruti Haasan and Santanu Hazarika come together on social media, they set the internet on fire. The Salaar actress has dropped another sizzling photo on her Instagram account. The lovebirds can be seen adorably gazing into each other's eyes. In a recent conversation with ETimes, she was asked about her marriage plans, to which she replied, “I have no clue. I have no answer for you." 

Prior to this, Shruti Haasan opened up about her idea of marriage. Answering the question, she said. “It’s not something I’d jump at right away," she had said. She also said that her views on marriage had been influenced by her parents’ Kamal Haasan and Sarika's divorce. “Because their marriage did not work out, she would not discount the idea of marriage. When it worked, they were a brilliant couple, and that’s what I chose to look at."
