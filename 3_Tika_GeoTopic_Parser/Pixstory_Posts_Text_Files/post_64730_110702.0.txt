According to a lot of reports, Everton’s Richarlison has agreed personal terms with Spurs and Daniel Levy is in negotiations with Chairman Bill Kenwright to agree on a fee and finalise the transfer.
Clubs like PSG,Real Madrid and Bayern Munich were all interested in Richarlison, and a few season back Barcelona also bid about 100 Million Euros for Richarlison, which was turned down by Everton power Farhad Moshiri. PSG looked favourites to sign the Goodison favourite before Mbappe’s contract renewal since Richy himself wanted to move to a club for Champions League football.

The negotiations with Tottenham have been a rollercoaster ride, Their first bid was 50 Million which was way too low. Spurs were also interested in player exchange plus a fee for Richarlison since Everton are interested in Harry Winks and are looked set to complete the signing for 20 million. This transfer would be separate from the Richarlison one since Everton need to balance their books since they have recorded over 200 million pounds in loses over the last few season and were close to breaking the rules if they had spent a lot of money in the 2021 summer transfer window. 
Tottenham also wanted to offer Lucas Moura as a player swap, But Frank Lampard wasn’t interested in signing the player.
 Yesterday, the North London club offered Steven Bergwijn plus 20 Million pounds for Richarlison which was again turned down by Chairman Kenwright, But Everton still offered the dutch winger a contract way better than the contract offered by Ajax in hope to Hijack the transfer from Ajax and convince the winger to move to the Merseyside club. Negotiations are still ongoing with the fee to be at 60 Million pounds.

Chelsea are also interested in bringing the Brazilian to replace Lukaku the former Everton player who is moving back to Inter on loan, but Raphina is still Chelsea’s top priority
