The Spanish midfielder Soler has been strongly linked with a summer transfer to
Barcelona.

Valencia has released a statement angrily denying reports of the transfer of
Carlos Soler to Barcelona.

Soler graduated to the senior team squad in 2016 having made 219 appearances
thereafter for the club, having scored 216 goals. 34 of those goals have come in the
recent campaign 2021-22 but the midfielder’s contract is due to expire next summer and
he has been strongly linked with a move to Camp Nou.

What has Valencia said about Barca’s interest in Soler?

Valencia’s outlet Diario AS has reported Barcelona has successfully negotiated a $21
million deal with Valencia for Soler ahead of the summer transfer window.

Valencia has reported that the information is false while also trying to confirm they are in
the process of trying to tie the 25-year-old to fresh terms.

“In response to a story published in a Spanish newspaper this Monday, Valencia denies
the existence of any agreement- or any ongoing negotiation with Barcelona for the
transfer of Carlos Soler.” A statement on the club’s official website reads.

“The club is currently in an open negotiation process with the player and his agents to
extend his contract with Valencia.”

Valencia also tweeted an image of soler with the caption,” Don’t Lie!”
Soler’s stance on his future”Soler opened up on the speculation surrounding his future in an interview last month,
expressing his desire to remain at Mestalla beyond the end of the 2022-23 season.

“It’s not comfortable,” the Spain International told.”Sometimes people talk for the sake of
it, or without checking, which can hurt.

Sometimes things are said that I’m sure they
don’t know.”
