Such a lovely movie Enjoyed watching it throughout The story and the way they made the film was simply superb It was like without unnecessary dramas and fights and no negativity at all It just spoke a normal people life which was so realistic and relatable Lived with the movie throughout Dhanush is always a boy next door and Nithya menon proved that she is a girl next door Hats off to Director for treating us with a smoothie treat
