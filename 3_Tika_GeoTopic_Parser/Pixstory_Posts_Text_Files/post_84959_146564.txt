Opportunities While a th place finish in the league under a new manager is not a bad season Wolves fell off towards the end of last season and should have finished higher They were strong contenders at many points of the campaign to finish in the top six but their performances were not consistent which meant they eventually finished th This season they should definitely aim to improve on the th place finish last season and they possess the quality to do this They are not competing in Europe therefore they have an advantage over sides like West Ham and Leicester as they have the luxury of having a full week to prepare for games although this may not be the case every week due to the congested fixtures this season Threats One threat that is evident at the moment is that Wolves could potentially suffer a dip in their performances this season Many did not know what to expect last year as it was Bruno Lage s first season therefore the expectations were relatively low but Lage and Wolves do not have this luxury at their disposal this season There is also a sense that other managers in the league will have a bteer idea and understanding of Wolves tactics and how they will approach games this season therefore this is also a threat
