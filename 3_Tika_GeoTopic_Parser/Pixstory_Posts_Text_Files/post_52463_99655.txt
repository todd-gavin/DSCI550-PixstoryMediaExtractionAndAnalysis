Think about it it s so deep When your mind is completely focused on something you feel more energetic When your mind is a bit distracted you make excuses that you don t have enough energy to think take action And vice versa is always not true Sometimes you have energy but lack focus and sometimes you don t have energy because you are distracted I don t study because I am not focused on doing that not because I lack energy I have nothing to do without studying but I don t So I have energy but I don t have a focus on studying On the other hand I watch a lot of YT videos Netflix Show etc a lot It s because I am distracted from what I need to do it needs less energy for my mind to enjoy watching In conclusion Focus brings Energy Distraction takes Energy Thanks Stay Khush
