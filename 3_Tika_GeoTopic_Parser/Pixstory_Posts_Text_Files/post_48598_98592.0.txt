Pablo Prigioni is the NBA's oldest rookie, having joined the New York Knicks in 2012 at the age of 35 after being a two-time All-EuroLeague pick while playing in Europe, most notably Spain.

The Argentinian point guard made his NBA debut with the Knicks at an age when many players are contemplating retirement, and has since carved out a respectable career in the world's most competitive basketball league. Prigioni typified the archetypal European guard for four seasons, always looking for the pass and hitting his open shots.

Prigioni may not be one of the team's greatest players, but it's evident that when he's on the field, the team has been at its best.

Prigioni excels at forcing turnovers and is always on the lookout for a cheap inbound play. He also doesn't give the ball over and knows when to speed up the offense.

Prigioni moved to Minnesota in 2019-20 after accepting an assistant coaching post with the Nets in April 2018.
