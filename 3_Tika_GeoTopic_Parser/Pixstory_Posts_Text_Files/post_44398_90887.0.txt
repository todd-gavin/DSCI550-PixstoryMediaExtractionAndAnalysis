The Pharaohs suffered a defeat when the African side were beaten by the African side
Senegal in their second leg meet up at Cameroon. 
The loss came after the Egyptian
side lost to the Senegals 3-1 on penalties.
Failure to reach the World Cup to be held in Qatar later this year- which would have
been Egypt’s fourth appearance at the global group stage, led the Portuguese man to
resign from his managerial post.
He posted on his official Twitter handle,” Dream is over. From the bottom of my heart,
my gratitude to the Egypt Federation for this honour of coaching the National Team.”
He added, “It was a privilege to work and be helped by such dedicated and capable
professionals and wonderful friends.”
Queiroz was appointed as the head coach of the Egyptian side in September, oversaw
mixed emotions when they reached the finals of the Nations Cup and were criticized for
their conservative and negative style.
The head coach also courted controversy with his touchline style and suffered a
suspension after being sent off in the semi-final victory over hosts Cameroon.
“Without you, nothing could be possible for me in my life,” he concluded. “I am very
much proud of you lads.”
Queiroz, who had previously been associated as Sir Alex Ferguson’s assistant, has also
held the reins of the National Teams of Columbia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates, as
well as their homeland Portugal.
His previous stint in African Football came in 2000-2002 when he coached the South
African side, although he resigned ahead of the World Cup in Japan.
