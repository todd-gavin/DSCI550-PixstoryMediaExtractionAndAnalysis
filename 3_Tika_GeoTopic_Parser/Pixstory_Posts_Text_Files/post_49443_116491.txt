I actually agree with most of what you said Children should be allowed to make choices about what they want to believe in But I can t help but notice the examples you wrote were not a political stance but a basic human rights Kids should definitely be feminists Why should we not teach children that people are equal And it s ironic to be saying all of this when you support a right wing stance that quite literally force and condition people to be them Children are baptised before they even know how to speak How is that even different from what you wrote Religion is political If you teach your kids Christianity Islam Hinduism Judaism or anything you are already instilling political values in them Then why is it wrong when the left does it Everything is not being politicized today it is only getting reversed Trees are political now because the older generations messed the ecosystem up Toys are political now because for the longest time they were in fact adhering to a discriminatory propaganda Things are not being politicized now They always were They are just being corrected
