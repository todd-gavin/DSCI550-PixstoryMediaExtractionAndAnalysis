Now that the dust has finally settled we can step away from the mania of deadline day and do our best to objectively assess how yesterday went and where we now stand Going into the final days it was clear that the club always needed a winger to prevent Saka from playing every single game something we ve seen a little too much of In addition to this there was always a focus on a left midfielder but after injuries to Partey and Elneny in quick succession all of a sudden the emphasis moved towards the anchor position at the base of midfield Now for me this position is arguably the most important in a system such as the one we play so getting that position right is of paramount importance to the club As much as I desperately wanted Tielemans you d be putting a square peg in a round hole which is far from ideal As the day went on more and more reports came out that the primary target was Douglas Luiz Aston Villa wanted around m for the player with just a single year left on his contract Arsenal went up to m but ultimately it didn t happen He wasn t my first choice in that position but I can t help but feel we re shorthanded going into an incredibly busy fixture schedule with the winter World Cup to thank But did we make the right decision I would argue long term yes Just as we decided not to overpay for Alex Isak in January if we wait for the right player to become available for the right fee good things may come However and importantly this is a huge risk and one I m not sure is necessary given the position we re in At the very least I felt we could ve loaned a player to support the thin squad and tie us over to the perfect target Just as last year the lack of CF cost us a top spot this could do the same or worse Only time will tell PixstoryArsenal Arsenal
