Oats chilla is a popular breakfast food made with oats, gram flour, spices, vegetables and herbs. It is Quick and easy to make as there is no waiting time involved in the preparation of batter. My recipe will help you make oats chilla under 20-25 minutes from the time you make the batter to cooking the chilla  on the stovetop. 
Steps to make a oats chilla:
1. Add 1 cup of oats to a grinder 
2. Grind to a slightly coarse powder. If the flour is too coarse the oats chilla can break.
3. Add it to a mixing bowl along with

Â¼ cup besan
Â½ to Â¾ cumin seeds (jeera) or carom seeds (ajwain)
Â½ teaspoon salt
Â¼ teaspoon turmeric. You can skip turmeric, I used it for the color.
4. Add
Vegetables according to you 
2 tablespoons coriander leaves finely chopped
5. Pour 1 cup water.
6. Mix to make a batter adding water as needed.
7. Heat your pan well. When it is hot enough, drizzle few drops of oil and smear with a tissue or cloth. If using a non-stick pan you donâ€™t need to grease it.
8. Regulate the heat to medium flame. Mix the batter well. Pour 1 ladle full of batter. It will be about Â¼ cup. 
9. Spread it with a light hand. Do not spread it too much. If the batter is too thick, you wonâ€™t be able to spread it as it will stick to the ladle as you spread. In this case add little more water. If the batter is too runny, the oats chilla will be too soft and limpy. In this case you may need to add a tbsp of besan.
10. Cook well on both the sides. To make it lightly crisp, cook on a medium heat for few minutes.
And then youâ€™ re ready to eat hot chilla ðŸ˜‰
