After the 3-0 triumph over Venezuela in the World Cup qualifiers, Argentine skipper Lionel Messi spoke in a different language. He didn’t make things too clear, but dropped enough hints to assume that the Barcelona legend could call it a day after the Qatar World Cup this year. He said: “I don’t know what I will do after the World Cup. I am thinking about what is coming. After Qatar I will have to reassess many things.” He added his doubts had nothing to do with past frustration playing for Argentina. He won his first title with the team last year — the Copa America in a final against Brazil. “It has been a while that I am happy here, since before winning the Copa. I am thankful for all this they make me feel every time I come to Argentina,” was what Messi had to say. Asked about him continuing with the national team after Qatar, Messi said: “I don’t know, the truth is I don’t know….. “let’s hope these go the best way possible. But for sure after the World Cup many things will change.”
Did Messi’s words come as a surprise? Perhaps not. In fact, one was expecting such things from Messi. In June this year, Messi will turn 35. He is clearly not the same footballer he was only a few years ago. His magic is on the wane, which is evident from his form in Paris Saint-Germain currently. Winning the Ligue 1 title is nothing new for PSG – they could have done it again this season even without Messi. The Argentine master was expected to lead them in Champions League, but he could add little thrust to the failed campaign that fell apart in early rounds. Messi has won the Copa America title already and the Qatar World Cup would be his last chance to put hands on the coveted trophy. If he wins it, that would be a grand exit. And if he fails, then he would have nothing more to add to his brilliant CV. No wonder, Messi is preparing grounds for the next course of action.
