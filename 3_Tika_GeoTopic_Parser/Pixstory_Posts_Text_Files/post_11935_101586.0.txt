I believe that a holistic approach to women’s health is essential . ❤️

I will tell you the 5 Pillars of Women's Health ; 

❤️‍🩹Physical health
Roughly 1/4 of women are affected by pelvic floor disorders . Weakened pelvic muscles may result in incontinence , discomfort , and activity limitation .
Tip : Kegel exercises strengthen the pelvic floor for continence control and stronger pleasure .

❤️‍🩹 Mental health
One in five women experiences a Common Mental Disorder (such as anxiety or depression) . For women and people who menstruate , hormonal fluctuations can cause additional mental distress .
Tip : Make friends with your Inner Critic during PMS , by being gentle yet firm with it .

❤️‍🩹Emotional health
Women who endure sexism are 5x more likely to suffer from depression , and trans women are 4x more likely to suffer from mental health problems than cis women .
Tip : Make time for daily check-ins with your emotions and give attention to your heart .

❤️‍🩹 Sexual health
31% of women experience severe reproductive health problems , but under half seek help " regardless of severity" . The study found that this was primarily due to stigmatization and embarrassment .
Tip : Normalise talking about sexual health and getting checked regularly .

❤️‍🩹Spiritual health
Findings show a strong correlation between spirituality and positive health outcomes for women , particularly among women of color . Spiritual belief and emotional regulation may influence self-esteem , a sense of belonging , and quality of life .
Tip : Use the breath to expand the experience of pleasure and connection .
