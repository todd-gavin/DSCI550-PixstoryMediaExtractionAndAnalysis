The first leg of the Real Madrid-Manchester City tie in the Champions League brought to the fore a number of conclusions. But the tie remains as open as it was before the first leg at the Etihad, even if City boast an advantage heading into the second leg.

Real Madrid will have felt pretty gutted about the fact that they only lost by a goal, having been significantly the worse team for much of the 90 minutes. The man responsible for that — Karim Benzema.

"Karim Benzema is the current favourite for the Ballon d’Or. Robert Lewandowski has scored 
more goals for Bayern Munich this season, but it’s the big goals that Benzema has scored this year which would make him the favourite."

Mcmanaman has no doubt in his mind about the Frenchman's excellence.

He scored a hattrick against Paris Saint-Germain, a hattrick against Chelsea and a potential title-winning goal against Sevilla. His quality of goals now definitely makes him the favourite.

The fact that he’s got 39 goals in total, taking Madrid on route to the title, as well as the 
semi-finals of the Champions League, then I think he’s definitely the top candidate for the 
Ballon d’Or.

Add two goals of vital importance against City to that, and there really isn't much of an argument against Benzema lifting France Football's annual award this year.

Mcmanaman's comments came before the first game in Manchester, but the contents remain relevant even after as Benzema's heroics went further in proving his point. His first goal was a subtle finish with the inside of his left, and the second pure artistry — a dinked penalty that left the Etihad stunned into silence.
