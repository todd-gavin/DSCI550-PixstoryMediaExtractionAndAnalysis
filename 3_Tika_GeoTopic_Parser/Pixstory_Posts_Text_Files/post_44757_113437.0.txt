Donation of Yellow Sapphire Gemstone
There is a method of pacifying pratikula planets (planets that give adverse or malefic results) by way of gem donation. This is known as Ratna Daan or Ratna Arpana.

The following things are to be offered along
with a beautiful natural jyotish quality yellow sapphire:

- Natural yellow sapphire that has the characteristics described in the texts. It can be of any size provided it is natural and beautiful.
- Yellow silk cloth
- Turmeric
- Chana Dal-Bengal Gram
- Yellow flower
- Ghee (clarified butter)
- Sugar
- Dakshina/Offering in terms of currency to the Brahmin.

All these things should be donated to a wise, capable, devout and practising Brahmin (priest of the highest Hindu caste) on a Thursday morning before 10 am. 

Those who are not in a position or unable to perform the ritual given above should donate a yellow sapphire to a Brahmin in the morning before 10 am. One can also donate a yellow topaz or a heliodor for similar purpose.

Donation in such a way pacifies the negative results of the Planet Jupiter and blesses the individual with health, wealth and happiness.

Period of effect of Yellow Sapphire

Once worn in an auspicious time frame the yellow sapphire is effective for a person for 4 years 3 months and 18 days. On completion of this period one 
should wear a new yellow sapphire. The existing yellow sapphire should be sold or given to a loved one. The same yellow sapphire is effective for that person for 
equivalent amount of time. If such a yellow sapphire is Jyotish quality then it will be effective for a span of 4 years 3 months and 18 days for every new individual it reaches. The same principle also applies for the substitute of the alternative gemstones for Jupiter- yellow topaz and heliodor.
