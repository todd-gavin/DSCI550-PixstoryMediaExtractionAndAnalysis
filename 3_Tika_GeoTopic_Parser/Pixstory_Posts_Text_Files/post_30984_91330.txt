The decision taken today by Federbasket and Coni is historic in its own way. In fact, they chose not to let the Italian national basketball team take the field in the match against Russia valid for the World Cup qualifiers and scheduled for next July in Pesaro, the first refusal to face the Russians by Italian sport The decision shared by Holland and Iceland with the other nations included in the same group and stems from the fact that FIBA, the international federation, is one of the few that has not taken a position after the Russian invasion of Ukraine Giovanni Malag president of the Coni explained Italy has decided that Coni will not play in this on the side of the Federation And the same will happen to Iceland and Holland who are part of our same group We are very sorry for the choice of Fiba we do not understand So what about Fifa ousted teams from morning to night The Cio was very clear only basketball and biathlon did not follow the instructions
