Do you know stress can play a major role in delayed periods and many other complications related to menstrual cycle?

Stress causes the body to go into fight or flight modeâ€”itâ€™s just the way weâ€™re wired. When youâ€™re in this mode, it affects your hormones, which in turn affect your ovulation and, of course, your period.

This means you may have periods that are late or even stop completely for several months.

Some stress in life is unavoidable, but you can learn to manage your stress.

Exercising, getting restful sleep, having a healthy diet, confiding in friends and family and having healthy social activities can potentially reduce the effects of stress on your health. 

Stay healthy, Stay happy ðŸ˜Š
