The Chelsea midfielder and his country paid the price for missing two important penalty shots against Switzerland.

Jorginho cast a forlorn face after Italy's upset defeat to North Macedonia on Thursday, confessing that two costly penalty misses during the World Cup qualifying campaign are tormenting him.

The Euro 2020 champions were eliminated from contention for Qatar after a late defeat in Palermo.

The Azzurri will miss their second straight World Cup final, which is the first time in their history.

What exactly was said?

Jorginho, who is typically one of the best spot-kick takers in the game, missed two in a row against Switzerland in the first round of qualifying, denying Italy two wins that would have put them first in Group C ahead of their neighbours.

“It hurts when I think about it, because I do still think about it and it will haunt me for the rest of my life," the Chelsea midfielder told RAI Sport.

"Stepping up there twice and not being able to help your team and your country is something that I will carry with me forever, and it weighs on me.

“People say we need to lift our heads and carry on, but it’s tough.”

Italy became the first reigning European champion to miss the World Cup since Greece in 2006 on Thursday, and Jorginho, one of the stars of their Euro 2020 success, acknowledges it will take time to recover.

“It is hard to explain what happened,” he added.

“It hurts so much. I’ll be honest, I am still incredulous. I don’t think we lacked creativity, as we always dominated matches and created so many chances. Unfortunately, we were unable to finish them off.

“We played good football, we won the European Championship last summer, but unfortunately in the last few games we made small errors and were unable to recover from them. They made the difference.”
