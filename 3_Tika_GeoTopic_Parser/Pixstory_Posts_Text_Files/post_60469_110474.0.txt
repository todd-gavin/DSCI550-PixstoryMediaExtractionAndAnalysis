On June 27, Son Ye Jin announced the exciting news via Instagram.

Her post reads as follows:

You are all well, right?
I am doing well^^
Today, I want to carefully share some joyful news~

A new life has come to us..

I’m still a bit dazed, but I am feeling changes in my body every day with concern and excitement~
As thankful as I am, I also feel that much cautious, so I haven’t even told anyone around me yet.
Before it gets later, I am sharing this news with fans and acquaintances who must have been waiting as much as us.

We will make sure to protect the valuable life that has come to us~
I hope all of you will also protect what is valuable in your lives and live in good health..

Be happy♥
