Mikel Arteta has been advised by Paul Merson to change his team's style of play in some
games in order to get the desired outcome.

Arsenal is nearing the halfway point of a season that has promised a return to the Champions
League in recent weeks.

Tottenham just defeated Arsenal 3-0, and the Lilywhites are now two points ahead of the
Gunners in the league table.

Arsenal will have to overcome Newcastle United tomorrow to reclaim fourth place, but they might have been in a better position if they hadn't lost to Spurs.

Merson feels they might have won the game if they had taken a different strategy, and Arteta
has to be more tactically adaptable.

"I like Arteta, but he's no Pep Guardiola." He doesn't have Pep's squad. So, play to your team's
strengths. It's his most serious weakness. Everyone could see the game plan he required.

However, he was completely incorrect. With Holding playing at center half, he had no speed. So
go deep and play on the outskirts of your box. Give Harry Kane no room to drop into, and give
Heung-min Son no room to rush into from behind. Simple.

"However, Arsenal did the exact opposite Arsenal had no obligation to win the game, so they
went all out with a high line and blew it.
Holding is insufficient. But I don't hold him responsible.

They should have taken a risk on him... Because he needed to keep Son from gaining a leg up
on him.
"It was a stonewall dismissal." The management made several poor decisions. Come to
Tottenham at your own risk.

Manchester City had done it, and Spurs had done it twice! Arteta
had lost his way.

“Honestly… Arsenal should have dug in and made things difficult for them, then sat back and
waited for their moment. "What I was seeing was unbelievable."
