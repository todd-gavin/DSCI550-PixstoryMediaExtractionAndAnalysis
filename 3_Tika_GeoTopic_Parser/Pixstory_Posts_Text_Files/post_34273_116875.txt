When I got injured against Cape Verde where I had a concussion I thought I might die These are the words released by Sadio Man to the microphones of Pro Direct Soccer France about the events that took place during the last African Cup Liverpool didn&#39;t want me to play the next match but at the same time I had no intention of leaving the team alone I was ready to give my life I called the president of the Senegalese federation and told him that we had to make a contract If I die they must say it&#39;s my fault Thank God gone all good and we managed to win the African Cup
