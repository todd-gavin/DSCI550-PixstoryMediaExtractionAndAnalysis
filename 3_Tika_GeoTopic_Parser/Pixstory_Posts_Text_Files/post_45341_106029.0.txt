On Thursday, June 9th, the UEFA Nations League returns with a new series of fixtures, with
Spain taking on Switzerland.

Switzerland's Nations League campaign has gotten off to a shaky start, and the team will need
to improve in the coming weeks. The Swiss were defeated 4-0 by Portugal last week and will be
looking to get back on track against La Furia Roja.

Spain has had a poor start to their season as well, but they have a game on Thursday to make
up for it. In their previous match, the 2010 World Cup winners were held to a 2-2 tie by the
Czech Republic.

Switzerland vs Spain: Probable Playing XI

Switzerland : Yann Sommer; Silvan Widmer, Nico Elvedi, Manuel Akanji, Ricardo Rodriguez;
Granit Xhaka, Remo Freuler; Steven Zuber, Xherdan Shaqiri, Renato Steffen; Breel Embolo

Spain: Unai Simon; Cesar Azpilicueta, Eric Garcia, Pau Torres, Jordi Alba; Sergio Busquets,
Koke, Gavi; Pablo Sarabia, Alvaro Morata, Ferran Torres

Switzerland vs Spain: Prediction

While Spain's performance against the Czech Republic was disappointing, their starting XI will
be more acquainted this time around, which is more than can be said about their hosts.

Yakin's defensive predicament is exacerbated by Schar's suspension, as his team struggles for
inspiration in all parts of the field, and we can only see La Roja cruising to their first group
victory.

Prediction: Brazil 1 - 3 Argentina
