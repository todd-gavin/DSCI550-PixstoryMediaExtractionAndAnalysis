Belarus vs Azerbaijan: Prediction

Azerbaijan will like their chances of winning on neutral territory now that Belarus' home advantage has been stripped away. Goals, on the other hand, are likely to be few and far between, therefore we expect a low-scoring stalemate in Serbia.

Prediction: Belarus 1-1 Azerbaijan
