In the monthly insert of Sportweek space for the Genoa coach Alexander Blessin The coach talked at length about his family and his love for Italy The truth is that I fell in love with you in May when Napoli came to Germany to play in the Cup final Uefa It was Maradona&#39;s Naples I will never forget his warm-up on the pitch He dribbled with every part of his body and the ball never fell to the ground I was years old I saw the game in the midst of the Neapolitan fans they all jumped the grandstand was shaking and I thought Shit now it&#39;s coming down everything Up until the first leg Napoli had won and conquered the cup My wife tells me you&#39;re at home and not on the field lower the tone of your voice a little that I&#39;m like this Above all I&#39;m not an actor if I&#39;m sad or angry or happy and proud yes see And in Genoa I felt happy already after the first game We had drawn in Udine and yet the fans were celebrating as if we had won I wondered where I was At home my wife and my three daughters They chat and chat and I have nothing more to do say I popped an ear above my head too points a finger at the top of my skull So I only talk to the two dogs they are male So then I let off steam in the field
