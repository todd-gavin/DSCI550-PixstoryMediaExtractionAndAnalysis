One of the core and often overlooked features of rock and metal music is the bass Usually because of the vocals booming loudness heaviness distortion riffs and guitar solos people often overlook the bass but in reality if riffs shape the song then bass supports the entire structure Without a good bass player a song no matter how good will collapse because the bass is the supporting pillar on which everything else is constructed but still unfortunately suffers from a thankless and daunting responsibility Being a good bassist depends more than just skill but also requires creativity That doesn t mean slapping the fretboard or playing a bass solo but rather understanding the total sound of the band and what bass line would best suit the song in unison with the supporting instruments These are the top greatest bassists in rock metal music who have become the stuff of ultimate adulation from musicians and rock and metal lovers across the world Steve Harris Iron Maiden Geezer Butler Black Sabbath Geddy Lee Rush Steve Di Giorgio various bands Cliff Burton Metallica Lemmy Kilmister Motorhead John Paul Jones Led Zeppelin John Myung Dream Theater Les Claypool Primus Chris Squire Yes Justin Chancellor Tool Billy Sheehan various artists Roger Glover Deep Purple Phil Lynott Thin Lizzy Frank Bello Anthrax Dave Ellefson Megadeth Robert Trujillo Suicidal Tendencies Metallica Rex Brown Pantera Down Alex Webster Cannibal Corpse Tim Commerford Rage Against The Machine
