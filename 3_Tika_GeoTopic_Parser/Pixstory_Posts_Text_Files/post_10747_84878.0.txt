Season opener - India Open Throws competition at National Institute of Sports, Patiala, was the first competition of the domestic athletics season. 

As far as my performance was concerned, it was an average outing for me. 

I touched 54m mark for gold, but it was 3-4m short of my expectations. Hopefully, in the coming Grand Prix, I will touch the mark. 

For this year, my target is 2022 Commonwealth Games.
