 Owing to legal battles states can t pass any kind of policy or bill that makes health care inaccessible to trans folks but with whatever happening around from Mississippi introducing a bill early this year to ban gender affirming care for anyone under and Missouri attempting to pass a bill banning care for trans youth advocates and the trans community can sense never say never moment The Missouri bill also included a clause that vaguely mentioned that state health insurance plans renewed in would not be required to cover gender transition procedures without specifying any age requirements It would have affected trans adults as well But as these restrictions have moved forward these proposals failed to pass and also have feeble legal grounds to stick It would be a difficult step for legislators to eliminate health care provisions for trans people but this does create worrisome environment
