All eyes were on Kim Kardashian as she stepped out with her new boyfriend Pete Davidson for the 2022 Met Gala red carpet. For her Met Gala debut, the ‘Keeping Up With The Kardashians’ star wore Marilyn Monroe’s iconic dress from the legendary actress-model’s 1962 performance of ‘Happy Birthday, Mr. President,’ which has been on display in Orlando, Florida, at Ripley’s Believe It or Not!.

Kardashian completed her glamorous look with diamond drop earrings and a white fur jacket. “Well this is Marilyn Monroe’s dress and it is 60 years old and she wore this when she sang ‘Happy Birthday’ to President John F. Kennedy in 1962," Kardashian told Vogue correspondent La La Anthony on the red carpet.
