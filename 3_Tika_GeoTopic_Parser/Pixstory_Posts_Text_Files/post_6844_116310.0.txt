A video of a middle-aged man in wedding attire standing alongside two brides in a temple is circulating widely on social media.

Both women claim that the man is their father and he coerced them to marry him by threatening to poison them. The video is shared with the claim that a father is marrying his two daughters. The claim further opines that the family is from the Hindu community, hence this will “not cause any outrage”. 

Twitter user Mohammad Tanveer shared the video with a caption in Hindi that reads, “A father forcibly married both his daughters. One is 20 and the other daughter is 19… Since they are Hindus, no one will be offended.” This clip gained over 60,000 views.
