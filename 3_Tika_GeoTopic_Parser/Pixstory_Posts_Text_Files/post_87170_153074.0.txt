Eric Ten Hag decided to substitute Marcus Rashford in for Jadon Sancho and Antony Martial in for Bruno Fernandez in the second half. This immediately paid off as Rashford equalised for United inside 7 minites into the second half. Rashford then assisted Martial 10 minutes later to help United take the lead. Ronaldo too came close to finding his 700th club career goal when he hit the post from close range. He however managed to assist Rashford for his second goal of the night as united made it 3-1 with 6 minutes of regular time left. 
However Omonia weren't finished yet as they found their second within 90 seconds of Rashford scoring United's third of the night.  Panayiotou headed in a beautiful cross to pull one back for his team. However this proved to be the last significant moment of the match for the hosts as united came close with Ronaldo missing the goal after a good run. Rashford turned out to be the hero as he was a part of each of his side's goal contributions. 
United ended up with a much needed 3-2 win as they claim the second spot as of now below real Sociedad in the group.
