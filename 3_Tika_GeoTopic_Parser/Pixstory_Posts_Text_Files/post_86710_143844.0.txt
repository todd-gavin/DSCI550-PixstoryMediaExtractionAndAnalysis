The preparation for the Fifa Qatar world cup is in full swing, and UAE is taking various new measures to ensure the whole event will go on smoothly.
After many years, the Qatar Airport will come back fully functional. It has been semi-active since 2014, when Hamad International Airport was nearby. So far, the authorities have not released any official statement on moving from Hamad to Doha. Still, many airlines like Kuwait's Jazeera Airways, FlyDubai, and SalamAit have started selling tickets to Doha Airport.
After the semi-active retirement in 2014, the Doha Airport was mainly used by the Qatari Royal Family and VIPs, along with some airforce.
As per reports, the arrival and departure time of the airport can handle over 2000 departing passengers per hour. There will be over 83 check-in desks with over 50 arrival immigration and immigration countered counters. To take the crowd better, the airport will also manage around 22 boarding gates.
