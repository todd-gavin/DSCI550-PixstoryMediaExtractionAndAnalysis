Amber Heard was on the verge of being fired from the Aquaman sequel However according to DC Films president Walter Hamada her work was not jeopardised for the reasons the actress claims and the company did not limit her role as a result According to Hollywood Reporter On Tuesday Hamada testified in Johnny Depp s million defamation case that the studio pondered recasting Heard as Mera in the upcoming picture Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom for several weeks The studio was concerned according to Hamada about the lack of chemistry between Heard and Jason Momoa who plays Aquaman They didn t have a lot of chemistry together Hamada said The reality is it s not uncommon on movies for two leads to not have chemistry and it s sort of movie magic and editorial the ability to put performances with the magic of a great score and how you put the pieces together you can fabricate that chemistry she said At the end of the day when you watch the movie it looks like they have great chemistry But I just know that through the course of postproduction it took a lot of effort to get there Sometimes you just put characters together on the screen and they work It s like what makes a movie star a movie star You know it when you see it The chemistry wasn t there This one was more difficult because of lack of chemistry between the two
