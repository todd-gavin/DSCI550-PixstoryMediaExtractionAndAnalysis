Background Pregnant women less frequently receive Coronavirus Disease COVID vaccination and are at increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes from COVID Objectives First describe the vaccination status treatment and outcomes of hospitalized symptomatic pregnant women with COVID and second estimate whether treatment differs by pregnancy status among treatment eligible i e requiring supplemental oxygen per National Institutes of Health guidelines at the time of the study women Study Design During January November the COVID Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network completed medical chart abstraction for a probability sample of hospitalized women aged years with laboratory confirmed SARS CoV infection Of these women had symptoms of COVID upon admission were pregnant We calculated weighted prevalence estimates of demographic and clinical characteristics vaccination status and outcomes among pregnant women with symptoms of COVID upon admission We used propensity score matching to estimate prevalence ratios PR and confidence intervals CI of treatment eligible patients who received remdesivir or systemic steroids by pregnancy status Results Among hospitalized pregnant women with symptomatic COVID were non Hispanic Black were Hispanic or Latino and were aged years Among those with known COVID vaccination status were unvaccinated One third were treatment eligible Among treatment eligible pregnant women received systemic steroids and received remdesivir Among those that were no longer pregnant at discharge n had spontaneous abortions and had stillbirths Of the live births were pre term Among a propensity score matched cohort of treatment eligible hospitalized women of reproductive age pregnant women were less likely than non pregnant women to receive remdesivir PR CI and systemic steroids PR CI Conclusion Most hospitalized pregnant patients with symptomatic COVID were unvaccinated Hospitalized pregnant patients were less likely to receive recommended remdesivir and systemic steroids compared to similar hospitalized non pregnant women Our results underscore the need to identify opportunities for improving COVID vaccination implementation of treatment of pregnant women and the inclusion of pregnant women in clinical trials Sources
