Man is a social being and we need to constantly communicate with people in order to survive in this world .Meeting others is an essential part of lives and communicating effectively is important.I will tell what i share when i meet someone for the very first time.I try to make a good impression cause it's a famous saying that first impression is the last impressed and i believe it completely.I usually being with an energetic hi and i try to maintain all good and positive vibes.The next questions depend on the situation.I try to ask questions and enquire more rather than talking about myself.For example if i am in a seminar room and i am meeting a new person i would ask him  question like 'do u know the speaker','Does the topic of the seminar interests you','Where are you from'etc etc.Sometimes i personally become shy and dont ask questions which i really want to.Sometimes i personally feel that if the person was made a connection then it would be great but personally i dont try to act all enthusiastic .Also this truly does not describe me cause i am at my best self when meeting new people.
