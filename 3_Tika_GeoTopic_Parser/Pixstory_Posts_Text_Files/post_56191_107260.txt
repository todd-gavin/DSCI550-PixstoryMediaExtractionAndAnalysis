The European Union is expected to undertake legal action against the UK government over its conclusion to scrap some post Brexit trade arrangements Ministers contend current checks on some goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland must end to prevent harm to the peace process Following elections in Northern Ireland last month the Democratic Unionist Party is rejecting to fulfil a power sharing executive with Sinn Fein until the protocol is changed But other parties in Northern Ireland including Sinn Fein the Alliance Party and the SDLP accept the deal as it stands The UK government says it would choose to agree on changes with the EU rather than act alone in making changes to the protocol Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told BBC Radio s Today Programme We ve been acting in good faith in these negotiations but the fundamental issues that are affecting political stability in Northern Ireland are in the text of the protocol and what we need in the EU to agree to change the text of the protocol the EU has implied it will restart legal action it began in March last year when it indicted the UK of delaying without consultation the enforcement of parts of the protocol about customs checks It could go further by taking the UK to the ECJ over assertions it did too little to set up border control posts and share data with the EU Businesses which import Great Britain goods to Northern Ireland have encountered difficulties with the protocol as the checks and controls add cost and complexity Food and horticulture importers have confronted the greatest problems as those goods face the most onerous controls Source BBC
