After spending five years in jail for a crime he did not commit, 25-year-old Madkam Hunga returned to his village on the southern tip of Chhattisgarh to start life afresh, only to discover that he was a free man, with no freedom. 
The rains destroyed Hunga's house. Bushes and weeds overran his five-acre farm. His animals were either dead or had been sold off. His wife was married to another man. His six-year-old daughter had no clothes on her body. His eight-year-old was chopping wood to cook the food his impoverished sister sent from another village. His brother was dead. 
When Article 14 met him in Burkapal village on 23 July, Hunga faced an immediate dilemma: whether to find work as a daily wage labourer and start putting food on the table or to borrow money to buy a bullock and start ploughing his farm. 
Sitting outside a mud house with a thatched roof, Hunga said, “Before going to jail, my one-and-half-year-old daughter was fine and healthy. After returning, I see her disabled. Due to the lack of money, my mother could not get treatment for her. Today she can neither speak nor walk or even eat by herself. But I don't have money to get her treated.” 
"This year, I have come out of jail, but I cannot farm because I need money and bullocks,” he said. 
Arrested when the Bharatiya Janata Party was in power in Chhattisgarh, 125 people from the tribal villages of Sukma district, a hotbed of the violent Naxal movement, were charged in the killing of 25 paramilitary soldiers of the Central Reserve Police Force on 24 April 2017. 
One month ago, on 18 July, they were acquitted by a court of the National Investigation Agency after the prosecution in the Congress Party-run state failed to show they were involved in the ambush carried out by Maoist rebels, also known as Naxals.
