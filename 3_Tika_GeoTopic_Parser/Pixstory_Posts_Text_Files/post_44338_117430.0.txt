Bundesliga giants FC Bayern Munich have finally completed the signing of star Dutch defender Matthijs de Ligt from Juventus on a 5-year deal (until 2027). The German club will pay a guaranteed fee of €70 Million (plus €10 Million add-ons) to the Serie A side. 

Matthijs de Ligt announced his farewell from Juventus FC in a heart-touching social media post earlier today in which he wrote, “The time has come to close a very beautiful chapter in my career.

 Massive thanks to the entire juventusfc family, club, coaches, players, staff and fans for the love you’ve shown to me. Was an honour to fight by your side and play for this team. Sarete sempre nel mio cuore.” 

The Dutch defender had joined Juventus in July 2019 for a whopping price of €75 million back in July 2019 from Ajax Amsterdam after their dream run in the UEFA Champions League. He was one of the hottest properties in the market back then alongside his teammate Frenkie De Jong. Coincidentally, both of them were up in the market again in this window. 

Chelsea and FC Bayern Munich had always been the two clubs who were most interested in Matthijs de Ligt. However, it was Bayern who kept on pushing every day and ultimately got the job done. They rushed Robert Lewandowski’s transfer to FC Barcelona just to generate funds for De Ligt’s bid. 

The addition of De Ligt has created a very suitable situation in the defence for Bayern. Manager Julian Nagalsmann usually goes with a 3-2-4-1 with only one centre back.

 That role is usually played by Dayot Upamecano. With De Ligt’s arrival, Bayern now have a much better alternative in that spot and they can also go with a 4-man defence. The defensive duo of Matthijs de Ligt and Dayot Upamecano can prove to be one of the bests in Europe in upcoming days.
