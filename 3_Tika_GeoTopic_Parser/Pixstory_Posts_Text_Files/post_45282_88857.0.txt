Gareth Southgate has called up four players ahead of friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast.

England have added four new faces to their squad for the March international break, including two first-time call-ups, after Aaron Ramsdale, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Reece James, and Tamece Abraham were all ruled out through injury.

Gareth Southgate's side will face Switzerland and Ivory Coast later this month as the Three Lions ramp up preparations for the Qatar 2022 World Cup, which will take place at the end of the year.

However, Arsenal goalkeeper Ramsdale, Roma forward Abraham, and the right-back pairing of Liverpool's Alexander-Arnold and Chelsea's James have all been forced to withdraw from this month's fixtures due to injuries, necessitating a personnel reshuffle for England.

Who has been added to the squad?
Southgate has called up West Brom goalkeeper Sam Johnstone - a rare example of a Championship second-tier inclusion in the national set-up - and Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins to replace Ramsdale and Abraham, respectively.

The former was in the manager's last squad in November, while the latter had previously appeared as a No.9 understudy to Harry Kane during the October international break.

Southgate has chosen to give two uncapped players their first senior call-ups, Crystal Palace right-back Tyrick Mitchell and Southampton defender Kyle Walker-Peters, with the pair set to make their senior debuts this month.

Who has been left out?

Southgate's decision to go with like-for-like replacements means there is no room for displaced Manchester United duo Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho, who were both left out of the original squad last week.

There was also no room for Milan center-back Fikayo Tomori or Everton forward Dominic Calvert-Lewin, the latter of whom had been Kane's reserve pick in recent years.

Finally, Leeds duo Kalvin Phillips and Patrick Bamford are both left out, though their absence is less surprising given the pair's fitness.
