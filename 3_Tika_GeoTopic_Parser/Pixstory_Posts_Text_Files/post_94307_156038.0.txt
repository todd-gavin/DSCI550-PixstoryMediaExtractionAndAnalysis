Japan booked their passage into the round of 16 with an easy win over Canada in their Group D fixture at the Fatorda Stadium. They beat the North American side four goals to nil with two a piece on either side of half time.
The goal scoring started with No.19, Mao Kubota. Japan won the ball in the midfield and Kubota struck a long range shot that swirled and found the net. Although Canadian goalkeeper Lallier could have done better. She partly redeemed herself with a strong save off a shot from striker Hiwatari in the 19th minute. Again as a result of Canada not being able to clear their lines well.
Next to score was forward U. Shiragaki, another long range effort but this time off a huge deflection from her Canadian forward counterpart, Watson. The ball went over Lallier’s head and into the net. 
The second half’s proceedings were started by M. Tanikawa as she danced her way into the opposition defence. It was a solo effort from the midfielder taking the ball from the edge of the box, passing two defenders, making some room to pull the trigger and eventually scoring.
Japan continued the offensive till the final whistle as they won a penalty in injury time. Tsujisawa was pushed from behind in the penalty area as she tried to head a ball that came from the left flank. The penalty from Takaoka was pushed on to the bar by Lallier but the Japanese striker was quick to latch on to the ball and turn home the rebound.
Japan would be satisfied to have four different goal scorers as they enter the latter stages of the competition. On the other hand, Canada have to pick themselves up for their clash against France.
