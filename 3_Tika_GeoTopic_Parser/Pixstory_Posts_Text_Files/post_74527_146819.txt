Aishwarya and Trisha are all set to star in Mani Ratnam s epic period drama Ponniyin Selvan I scheduled for release this month Both will be sharing screen space for the first time in Mani Ratnam s magnum opus Ponniyin Selvan which will hit theatres on September In a recent interview Trisha revealed that unlike their characters in the film the two actresses share quite a rapport off screen and were even scolded by the director for their camaraderie The two actors got along well despite the fact that their characters in the movie are at odds which caused the director some issues Trisha shared her experience of working with Aishwarya and heaped praises on her co star She called Aishwarya beautiful and revealed that the movie required them to stay arch rival like their respective characters however the two actresses got along with each other pretty well And therefore there were times when the veteran filmmaker Mani Ratnam would scold them too I fortunately got to meet her and interact with her on the day one of my shoot She is beautiful inside and out I don t even need to say that The thing is this was challenging because we are not supposed to like each other too much in this film but we got along pretty famously on set There were times when Mani sir would come and say listen you guys are taking too much stop talking I can t have this camaraderie for my scene she said The actress further mentioned that Aishwarya was lovely to work with and her command over the Tamil Language surprised everyone She is so warm and one of the most hardworking actors I have worked with She spoke in chaste Tamil and how it has to be spoken She will get up at am and get ready with us I am very honoured that I could share a screen space with her Trisha added
