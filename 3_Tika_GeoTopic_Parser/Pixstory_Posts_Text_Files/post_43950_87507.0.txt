Michael Owen
Michael Owen, who founded his own stable in Cheshire in 2006 and converted it into a Group 1-calibre facility for trainer Tom Dascombe, is possibly the most recent footballer-turned-racing-aficionado there is.

Thomas Muller
Muller and his wife Lisa, a semi-professional dressage rider, own horses at their house in Germany, but they are used for show rather for racing.

Mick Channon
After retirement, he pursued his passion for horse racing, first as an assistant before obtaining his own licence and establishing himself as one of the sport's best trainers. His reputation with horses has likely surpassed what he accomplished on the field, which is no minor accomplishment.

Faustino Asprill
We wanted to put him on this list because he once shared a video of himself teaching one of his horses to play football while riding it in a pink Tyrannosaurus Rex costume. That's right, you read it accurately.
