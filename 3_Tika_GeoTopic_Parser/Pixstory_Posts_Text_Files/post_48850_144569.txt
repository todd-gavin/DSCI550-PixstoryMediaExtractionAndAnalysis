 They them are probably two words that have managed to trigger many people in our society more than decades of oppression faced by trans and non binary people ever has But if you actually are one of those who want to truly be compassionate and make small changes to make the society better for everyone in it then you may want to start using singular they to refer to people trans or cis if you don t know their preferred pronouns In our society pronouns are a topic that is often avoided or glossed over However using gender neutral pronouns can go a long way in making allies out of the transgender and nonbinary community When we use someone s preferred pronoun instead of their assigned gender at birth it sends the message that they are just like everyone else This helps to break down barriers and create trust between members of the transgender and nonbinary community and those who identify as cisgender those whose preferred gender matches their assigned gender It also allows people to focus on shared goals rather than differences For example if a trans student wants to get more involved with campus life but feel uncomfortable referring to themselves using traditional masculine or feminine pronouns normalizing the usage of third person singular they will help them feel more comfortable participating in activites on campus If they re not even comfortable in their institute how can they be expected to give their best The benefits of normalizing the use of pronouns go far beyond empowering individuals within marginalized communities they have potential effects on wider social movements as well When allyship is based upon understanding and respect rather than exclusionary attitudes towards difference progress becomes much easier to achieve
