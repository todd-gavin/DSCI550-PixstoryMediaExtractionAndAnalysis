Monkeypox is a more benign version of the smallpox virus and can be treated with an antiviral drug developed for smallpox. But unlike measles, Covid or influenza, monkeypox does not typically cause large outbreaks.
Clinicians should become aware of the symptoms to detect new cases quickly. Monkeypox infection begins with fever and body aches. Its most recognizable feature is a characteristic rash that starts with flat red marks and then becomes raised and filled with pus.

Monkeypox does not spread easily between people, so doctors have been puzzled by the outbreak and by the appearance of cases on different continents at the same time. The virus is only transmitted from person to person through close physical contact – including sexual intercourse.
Symptoms are usually mild – headaches, aching muscles and exhaustion – but monkeypox also causes skin lesions which can become infected, resulting in secondary infections.

The virus is endemic in parts of Central and West Africa and may be spread through bites or scratches from rodents and small mammals. According to the World Health Organization, contact with live and dead animals through hunting and consumption of wild game or bush meat are known risk factors.
