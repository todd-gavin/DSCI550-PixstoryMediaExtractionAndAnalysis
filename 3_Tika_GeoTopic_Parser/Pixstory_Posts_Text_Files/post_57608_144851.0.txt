Gone are the times when this system of acknowledgement and acceptance used to be authentic and genuine.
Awards, these days, are mere branding skills used for the sake of earning money.
The whole game of sponsorships and unfair treatment of talent has made it futile.
If I solely speak of the movies and cinema and not everything acknowledged or awarded, then there would be enough to prove my point.
The movie-making process is quite complex and subtle for everyone to comprehend, hence analysing and deciding what work should receive the most praise needs to be unbiased and critical.
I think awards have just become a part of diplomacy; whoever wishes to win a charm must go on with the process of making the awards givers happy.
In other words, it is a way of disparaging someone's hard work.
Beyond awards, I think rewards should be accepted and promoted unless this system becomes uncorrupted and free from prejudices.
