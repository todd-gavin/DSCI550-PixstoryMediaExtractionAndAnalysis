Lizzo, an American singer,  in a recent interview with Vanity Fair, gave a message to the critics who share abhorring racist and fatphobic comments.
Lizzo has always portrayed herself as the epitome of a woman who can easily fight the prejudices a coloured, plus-size woman would face.
But in the interview, she says it can be hurtful sometimes to receive such comments.
She spoke of the video she released in last year's August, where she called out a specific comment that traduced her in the name of race and size.
Although she spoke of all of it but never actually revealed the exact words.
She explained, “Then people will know what really hurt me. People have been calling me fat my entire life, but that was the first time seeing an insult of how I looked, who I am, and my music wrapped into one, and it really hurt me. And if one person says it, then another person says it, it multiplies like a f–king virus. If enough people on the internet start echoing sentiments about you, it becomes part of your public persona and it’s out of your control.”
Talking about it, Lizzo also gave a message to just not let these things affect you; instead, just "F__k them!"
