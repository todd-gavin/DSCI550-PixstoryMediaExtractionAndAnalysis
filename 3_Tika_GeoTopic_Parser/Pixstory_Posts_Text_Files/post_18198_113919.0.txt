Forbes recently unveiled its 2022 list of “America’s Richest Self-Made Women,” the publication’s annual ranking of the nation’s most financially successful women entrepreneurs, executives, entertainers and more.

No. 21 on the list is 34-year-old Rihanna, the youngest on the entire tally to have a net worth of more than one billion dollars. Her $1.4 billion comes primarily from the success of her cosmetics line, Fenty Beauty, according to Forbes. “She also has a 30% stake in the Savage x Fenty lingerie line, which raised money at a $1 billion valuation in February 2021,” the site also mentions. RiRi is said to be Barbados’ first billionaire, and in April, was announced as the world’s richest female musician.
