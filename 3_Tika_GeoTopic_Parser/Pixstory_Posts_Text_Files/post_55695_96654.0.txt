During the first two weeks of the 2022 election campaign in Australia, the red wall concept has been mentioned in dispatches. 

The Guardian reported that journalists and pundits have speculated whether Scott Morrison is attempting a Johnson-style flip, writing off heartland seats in metropolitan Australia as vulnerable to the so-called "teal" independents and looking for gains in outer suburban and regional Labor-held seats, such as Hunter and Parramatta, to offset the losses.
