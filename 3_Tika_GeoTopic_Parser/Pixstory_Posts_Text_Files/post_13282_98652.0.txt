A poll by an Afghan research organization shows that the majority of Afghans disagree with the Taliban's values ​​and way of governing. The popularity of the Taliban among the people is 7% in total.

In this survey, 81% of people in Afghanistan's cities and villages support women's education and work.

In this study, the Afghanistan Research and Analysis Organization interviewed nearly 10,000 Afghans in 2020 and 2021, according to which more than 77 percent of the population rejected the Taliban's way of governing, especially its religious extremism.

71% of the people agree with the system of the Islamic Republic in Afghanistan, although a significant part of them want changes and reforms in it.

 The head of the organization says that their polling data show that "the Taliban in Afghanistan do not have any tools and legal legitimacy to represent the diverse Afghan society."

The poll's findings are consistent with other surveys, including the Asian Bank, which have found that the Taliban's popularity among Afghans has remained below 10 percent in recent years. A survey by the Afghanistan Research and Analysis Organization found that only 7.1 percent of the population supported the Taliban.

The highest level of support for the Taliban regime was found among Pashtun respondents (9%) and the lowest among Uzbek respondents (1.5%).

The Taliban have implemented policies such as banning work and educating women and girls under the guise of "Afghan traditions." But the poll shows that more than 81 percent of people in Afghanistan's cities and villages support women's work and education.
