She is lost nowadays , 👀
Smiling for the world but a mess inside
How can she tell someone what's going on
When she doesn't know ! 🤍

All these thoughts inside her are like a ship sailing in a thunder storm ⛈️
World thinks her as a positive person
Which she is for them but
Tries hard to be for herself too ! 🤍

Like a bird flying and chirping
Like a flower blossimg in the springs ,
But now she has cut down all the strings ! 💕

Now the bird is alive but had forget to fly
The flowers are blossoming but the fragrance has forget to imply
Everything is same but she isn't

Yes she has forget to fly
In the world full of lies ✨️🌸
