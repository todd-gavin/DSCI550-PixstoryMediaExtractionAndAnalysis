After the mocking own goal that cost Fiorentina the defeat in the semi-final first leg of the Coppa Italia Lorenzo Venuti used social media to tell his state of mind In a long post accompanied by a photo of the choreography of the Fiesole curve and an image of his disappointment Venuti wrote I dreamed it would end differently because I cared too much for my teammates for the company for Florence and the Florentines Destiny however had other plans and wanted it to end like this But no drama because the real problems are unfortunately others In the long outburst Venuti has concluded with a thought for supporters and critics Thanks to all the Florentines for their support before and after the match tonight you won And thanks also to those who criticize because you are an extra stimulus to improve with the aim of making you bite your tongue
