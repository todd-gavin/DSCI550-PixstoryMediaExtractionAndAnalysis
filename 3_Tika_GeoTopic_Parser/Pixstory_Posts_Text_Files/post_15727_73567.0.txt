Lake Sørvágsvatn (or Lake Leitisvatn) in the Faroe Islands looks like it's perched high above the ocean below... right?

But this is one big optical illusion:

In reality, the lake is no more than about 90 feet above sea level. The cliff in front of the lake -- coupled with the perfect camera angle -- just makes the lake look as if it's sitting hundreds and hundreds of feet high.


Lake Sørvágsvatn and the rest of the Faroe Islands are sandwiched between Iceland and Norway. This region of the world is known for its winding fjords, killer views and crazy-cool rock formations, like a boulder,r wedged into the crevice of a mountain and this spine-tingling Instagram spot. And apparently, optical-illusion lakes are part of the lineup, too.
