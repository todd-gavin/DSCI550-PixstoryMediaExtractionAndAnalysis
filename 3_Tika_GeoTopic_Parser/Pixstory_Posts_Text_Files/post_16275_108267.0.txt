Shah Rukh Khan has dropped parenting lessons time and again. In an earlier interview, the Badshaah of Bollywood opened up about his bond with his three kids Aryan, Suhana, and Abram and said, â€œI love my children not because they are my children, but because I have garnered a friendship with them. I am realising this, as they are getting older, they are my greatest friends. I think my mental age is between 12 to 14, so it is nice to have two friends that I can ever have."
