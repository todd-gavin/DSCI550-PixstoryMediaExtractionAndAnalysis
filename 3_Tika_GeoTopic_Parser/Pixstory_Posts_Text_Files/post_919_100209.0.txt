Trust Former President Donland Trump to say things noone else could usually think of. 

"The Democrats are sending another $40 billion to Ukraine, yet America’s parents are struggling to even feed their children,” Trump said in a statement issued through his Save America PAC.

The former president claimed “no one is talking about” the baby formula shortage in the U.S., which he said is “a national disgrace.”

“It is unthinkable that in the year 2022 American families are unable to get baby formulas for their children. Families whose children have serious allergies and require ‘elemental’ formula are in even more desperate and dire straits,” he added.

Earlier this week, the House passed nearly $40 billion in aid for Ukraine, including about $8.7 billion for an Economic Support Fund, $6 billion in security assistance and $900 million in support services for refugees.

The package, which passed 368-57, only had 57 Republicans vote “no,” meaning most House Republicans backed the legislation.
