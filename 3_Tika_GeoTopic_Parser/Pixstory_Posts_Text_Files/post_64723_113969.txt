All this builds to the pulse pounding climax as Peter stumbles upon his father s burnt corpse and Annie s body is apparently taken over by Paimon and he begins to decapitate herself with a wire and then is surrounded by nude members of Ellen s cult with nowhere to run or hide Peter jumps out of the attic window the same bright light seen before ventures into Peter clicking his tongue and wearing a familiar dazed expression He appears to have been taken over by Charlie as his mother s corpse levitates into a tree house Peter wanders inside where Joan and several other cult members await him They bow before a mannequin resembling one of Charlie s makeshift toys with Charlie s crowned head placed on top Joan revealed that Charlie and Paimon are one in the same now that Charlie has been transferred to a male host she is able to be crowned as King of hell The first two acts were plentiful with foreshadowing for starters many of the cult members were present at Alan s funeral with Annie being surprised by the large turnouts and she also mentions that her brother committed suicide after their mother tried to putt people in him this means that the court likely tried and failed to use him as a male host for Paimon which motivated Ellen to convince Annie to have children that could serve as hosts Perhaps the biggest clue was Paimon s symbol which can be found hidden throughout the film the symbol is even present on the pole that decapitated Charlie suggesting that her death wasn t an accident It s widely believed that the cult orchestrated Charlie s death planting the animals corpse on the road so Peter would swerve towards the telephone pole In that sense the Graham family are like playthings being controlled by the cult which gives even greater significance to the dollhouse depicted in the film Perhaps the biggest question revolving around the ending is if it s supposed to be taken literally according to the Director Ari Astor the ending is not a metaphor for deteriorating mental health confirming that Charlie is indeed Paimon
