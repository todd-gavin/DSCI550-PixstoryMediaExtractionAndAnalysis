A bucket list is important. It contains your wishes and wants and what you want to achieve in life. It provides you something to look forward to working on over the course of the months, years, or your entire life, or a place to turn when you're feeling lost.

Life can be hard but putting some items on your bucket list can really give you some sense of purpose. So what's on your bucket list? It can be anything from something as simple as wanting to try a particular dish to something like a world tour. Meeting a celebrity, cosplaying your favorite character, wanting a pet, wanting to fall in love, going on a solo trip, mending relationships. Anything. What's it for you?
