The Weeknd barely got started performing the second of his sold out shows in L A Saturday night when he lost his voice and he was almost in tears SoFi Stadium was packed with fans when minutes in the band started playing Can t Feel My Face Thing is the Weeknd was nowhere to be seen The Weeknd s show had to stop mid song because he had no voice Something happened during the previous song he yelled and apparently it blew out his vocal cords When the song ended he came onstage and told the crowd It s killing me The audience didn t know what was up until the next song played and there was no Weeknd He said fighting back tears I can t give you the concert I want to give you promising everyone would get their money back and he would reschedule soon The Weeknd was profusely apologetic and clearly emotional This was a big part of his After Hours Til Dawn Tour and he knew how much the show meant to his fans You hear pretty much the entire crowd was on Weeknd s side applauding him for being transparent His voice went out during the first song and he was devastated He says he ll make it up to fans with a new date This isn t the first time his tour has been postponed due to the flu
