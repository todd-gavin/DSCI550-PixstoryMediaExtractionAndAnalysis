Go ahead abandon me I know you feel like it I ll manage the pain I always have People never stick around me So this won t be anything new How can we ever be friends My heart races for you It sees no reason To beat except for yours But I ll bear the separation Even though I have no right to For you it might seem easy To avoid me every time To contradict me at everything Please know this very well Don t seek reasons from me Then when this heart of mine ruptures The chaos you ve caused If you only knew A war between my mind and heart I witness everyday My heart is always victorious As in it you reside My mind still taunts As it knows My heart can only dream And it can never occur in reality As you ve left long ago Only I don t want to accept it I m in crowds all day All I think of is you When I m with you I can t utter a word As I fear for mistakes I was doomed from the very beginning The way you ignore me Has left me hollow The sorrow won t leave My foolish heart still won t stop Dreaming about a life with you My downfall is just yours to witness We re becoming strangers again Still I ll put in every effort For I d like to go out of your life In the best way possible Before you abandon me I ll confess my love to you Mir
