The 19-year-old midfielder has sustained his second season-ending injury and will be out for
several weeks.

 Barcelona has revealed that midfielder Pedri tore his hamstring against Eintracht
Frankfurt in the Europa League on Thursday. In the second part of the quarter-final second leg,
the Spain international had to be replaced by Frenkie de Jong.

After the game, Barca coach Xavi revealed that the newest physical concern for the 19-year-old
was "really bad news," and the club has since announced that he will be ruled out for the time
being.

An update from the club read: "Tests on Friday morning have revealed that Pedri has ruptured
the femoral biceps in his left hamstring.

"It means he will be unavailable for selection until he recovers from the injury."

Pedri's hamstring problem isn't the first he's had since breaking through at Barcelona.

 Earlier
this season, he was sidelined for a lengthy period due to a similar issue. He hadn't played since
August, and he just returned to the first team in January of this year. As a result, the Barca
youth academy graduate has only made 22 appearances in all competitions.

Barcelona were knocked out of the Europa League quarter-finals by Eintracht Frankfurt 3-2 at
Camp Nou on Thursday, but Xavi has dismissed the departure as a "disaster" for the club.

Before the loss, the Blaugrana had gone 15 games without losing, riding high until a 1-1
aggregate scoreline entering play turned into a 4-3 finish that was nowhere near as close as the
scoreboard portrays. It was undoubtedly a low point in Xavi's career, one that would bring
Barcelona back to earth following a hot streak.
