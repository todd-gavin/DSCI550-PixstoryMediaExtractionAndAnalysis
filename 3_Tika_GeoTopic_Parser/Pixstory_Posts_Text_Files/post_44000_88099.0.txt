Pep Guardiola, the manager of Manchester City, has remained defiant in the face of mounting rumours about Erling Haaland's possible summer arrival. Haaland, who has a £63 million release clause in his Borussia Dortmund contract, has been linked with a move to the Premier League winners.

Man City have signed a startling agreement with the 21-year-old striker after discussing personal conditions and the transfer framework, according to MailSport. However, according to BILD, the Citizens will pay more than £300 million in total over the course of a five-year arrangement, greatly above the £63 million cost.

Man City would pay £8.4 million in bonuses based on sporting achievement, according to the German site, as well as a staggering £67.1 million between Haaland's agent Mino Raiola and his father, Alf-Inge. When you factor in his £33.6 million yearly pay, it'll easily be one of the most expensive transactions in football history.

Guardiola was asked about City's interest in Haaland before of this weekend's FA Cup quarter-final against Southampton. The Catalan coach, on the other hand, gave no hints as to where the deal is at, responding with a two-word response: "Dortmund player."

He continued: "Since I'm here, every month, we are going to sign 50 players. Right now, it's impossible that I'm going to talk about some guys who aren't here. Haaland is a Dortmund player. You can ask for this player or another one. The transfer window is going to start, and many things will happen."

Maybe I speak about this club needs a striker for the next five, six, seven years maybe once in 12 months. I'm not going to be the guy with the success because we didn't have a striker. It's important that if you play well, seven or eight players arrive in the box. This is the best way."
