WA's already weakened opposition has been dealt another blow, with veteran Nationals MP Vince Catania announcing his resignation from state politics.

Mr Catania is one of just six opposition alliance MPs in WA's Lower House in which there are 59 seats in total.

His departure will trigger a by-election in the months ahead, leaving open the possibility his seat of North West Central could be lost to Labor – further increasing the party's huge majority.

Mr Catania narrowly held onto the state's largest seat at the last election, with his margin slipping from 10.1 per cent to just 1.7.

It meant he won the seat by just 259 votes.

Catania keen to focus on family

The North West Central MP said he was quitting politics because of the toll it was taking on his family — his wife Danielle and his five teenage children.

"Having spent 17 years of working in the largest electorate in Western Australia to the best of my ability, that means being away from home for half a year and it's not fair to the family who's suffered over that period of time," he told the ABC.

"This decision will obviously lead to a new career path, but also ensure that I can be a husband, be a father and enjoy time with the teenage children.

"The kids will all be adults before we know it, so it's well and truly time for me to put my family first.

"It'll be a shock to a few people, but the people who know me know how hard it is to constantly be away.

"I think people in the electorate will understand that."

Mr Catania acknowledged a by-election would be challenging for the Nationals.

"it's going to be a difficult election no doubt, I'm sure the Labor party will throw everything at the North West (Central) seat," he said.

"It does cause a bit of pain for the National-Liberal alliance but that's politics, and I'm sure that everyone's well seasoned in the opposition, and they will dust off their campaign strategies to try and retain the seat."
