TON UP - The showdown with Inter is Juventus Women's 100th match in Serie A. Of the 99 games so far, the Bianconere have collected 88 wins, more than any other team from the same number of games in the Italian top flight in the three-points-for-a-win era (from 1995/1996).

BLACK & BLUE - Juventus have triumphed in all five previous matches against the Nerazzurre in Serie A, with an aggregate score of 18-2. Not only are the Bianconere the only team with a 100% record against Inter in the competition, they also eliminated the Milanese club from the Italian Cup in February.

SWEET HOME - Juventus have scored exactly five goals in each of their two games at Vinovo against Inter in Serie A. Of the teams currently in the competition, none has a better scoring average at home against a single opponent.

SCORING RUN - Cristiana Girelli has netted five times in five appearances against Inter in Serie A. One more goal would see Girelli catch Valentina Giacinti as the player to have scored the most against the Nerazzurre in the top flight.

OPPOSITE ATTRACTION - No team outscores Inter in the first 30 minutes of play this season, with 18 goals. Juventus, meanwhile, are the most prolific side in the last half hour, with 19 goals.
