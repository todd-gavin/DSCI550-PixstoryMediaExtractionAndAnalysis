In his essay Existentialism is a Humanism Jean Paul Sartre suggests that in the absence of God humans must define their own essence through the choices they make In this film instead of God we have the Warden who is a perverse deity Satan masquerading as a holy figure He is always quoting the Christian bible and bragging about how many passages he has memorised yet he is arbitrarily cruel and spiteful He has a stitch work quote about judgement on his wall but behind it is the vault where he keeps records of his illegal activities According to Sartre s analogy An artisan uses a tool to craft an object He determines its essence and the object has no say in the matter Sucks for you object Similarly if humans were crafted by God that would mean humans have no say in their essence either Sartre contends that each man makes his essence as he lives and God plays no part in it Because of the Warden inmates are not in charge of their own essence The institution breaks them and the walls come to define who they are Brooks loses his ability to live in the free world and turns to the seedy underworld of graffiti before ultimately calling it quits Prison robs people of their will to freedom and by extension their humanity
