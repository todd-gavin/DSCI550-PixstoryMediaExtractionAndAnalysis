From childhood, I mainly played Cricket. My journey in Tennis started in 2002 with the simple issue of my parents saying, "You play outside too much! Come inside for a bit." That's when I was exposed to the world of Table Tennis. My friend taught me the sport, and I soon knew that this was what I wanted to play. From an early age, I was visibly good in sports, and in fact, I was better than others around me. I made the change to Tennis in 2002 and managed to join the stadium in 2003. Within 1 year, the growth trajectory was amazing. By the end of the year, I was a runner-up in Under-15 boys for the State level. I started playing at the national level in 2004 itself.
My family's support throughout was immense. My parents, uncle, sister, and other family members saw my potential and knew I'd do well. Outsiders would also talk about my sports capabilities and how I can do much more. The one unfortunate thing in this entire chaos was that Table Tennis is an expensive sport. My father worked a normal bank job, and the pay wasn't much. My father never made me feel the lack of anything. However, the way my parents made ends meet gave me so much inspiration to go out there and make them proud.   
The community support was fluctuating. While many were happy about my success, some did not entirely appreciate it because they also tried to do well in the same sport. Since their growth pace was slower than mine, they would not celebrate my achievements wholeheartedly. Sports always held an important space in my life as apart from Tennis, I played Badminton, Football, and Cricket and also enjoyed Swimming. I would keep on switching between various sports for fun. I haven't explored weightlifting, boxing, taekwondo, and the like because Tennis is still my main sport. My wrist and hand play a vital role in my performance so I can't afford to hurt that part of my body. Unfortunately, an accident in my later years did just that!
