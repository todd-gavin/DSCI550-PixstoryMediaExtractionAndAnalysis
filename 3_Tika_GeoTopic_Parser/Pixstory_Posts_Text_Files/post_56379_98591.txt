We have numerous examples worldwide of how the blame game shifts to women every time something happens to them Yes many people stand with them initially yet ask them to be careful and would have asked whether there was a possible way to escape or prevent the violence So what are we women supposed to do We live without disturbing anyone men curb our freedom assert authority over us and use violence and we need to prevent it from happening by living in a cage Are men entitled to harm women NO HUMAN IS Women need protection because of men who suppress them It is their responsibility to behave which is the minimum expected from them No matter how you behave your relationship or what you wear nothing gives anyone the authority to harm or assault you Often victim blaming happens as she was asking for it Unless she literally asked for it she was never asked In any circumstance everything is a no until a proper yes Me too movement was often seen with contempt and many men opposed it and started men too It s good that you got inspired but our stories are not for you to joke upon Women shouldn t be ever blamed even if they talk about the violence they faced after years as they have been suppressed not to call out by the fear exerted by patriarchy She has the fear that she will be blamed living with trauma is huge and adding fire to it is heart breaking We need nothing but common sense and empathy to stand with the victim rather than suppressing them
