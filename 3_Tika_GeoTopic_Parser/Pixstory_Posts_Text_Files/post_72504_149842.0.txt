Hrithik Roshan and Saif Ali Khan, who will be seen sharing the screen space in their upcoming film, ‘Vikram Vedha’, are currently promoting the film but separately. If Hrithik is promoting the movie at an event, Saif is not there, and when Saif is at the promotions, Hrithik is missing. Owing to this, many started wondering if all was well with the two actors. According to a report in a news portal, everything is well between Saif and Hrithik. The reason the actors are not promoting the film together is because of their marketing strategy. Yes, you heard that right! Hrithik and Saif are pitted against each other in ‘Vikram Vedha’ and the makers do not want to show their off-screen camaraderie during the promotions. This is reportedly the reason why they are not seen together at the promotions, a report in BollywoodLife stated. While Hrithik will be seen essaying the role of a gangster in the movie, Saif will play the cop. The trailer and the songs of the movie have been receiving positive reviews from the audience and it would be interesting to see if the film is able to pull the audience to the theatres.
