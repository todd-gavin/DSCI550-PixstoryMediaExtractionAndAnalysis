Finally the trailer of Marvel Studios new movie Thor Love and Thunder is out and one word I want to say about the trailer is that it s weak Yes as a Marvel fan it is difficult to digest for me as well as you all but after watching the trailer I got no vibes at all Humour in the trailer is not so good and when you introduce your new villain of the movie then you should put at least one scene of him where fans got goosebumps but Marvel disappoints us there as well Thor Love and Thunder is releasing on July exclusively in cinemas
