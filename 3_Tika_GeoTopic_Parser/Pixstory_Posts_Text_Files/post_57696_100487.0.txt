Cliffhangers are the worst, be it a book or a movie. The thing with book cliffhangers is that you've spent this certain amount of time, absolutely riveted and devoted to the story and suddenly it ends on an incomplete note and there's no sequel or any hint of anything else being disclosed to you to give you closure so you're just so done.
