Betaab Valley was originally known as Hagan Valley or Hagoon, but came to be known by its present name & became extremely famous after the movie Betaab, which was shot here. It is located almost 15 kilometers from Pahalgam in Anantnag district of Jammu and Kashmir. The valley's lush meadows, mountains, and dense vegetation, which provide lovely chances for sightseeing and are a photographer's paradise, are what make it a major tourist destination in Jammu and Kashmir. Its landscape, which is populated with trees like chinar, deodar, pine, willows, and poplars and surrounded by snow-covered mountain peaks, is substantially enhanced by the Lidder River's bluish-green waters. It is particularly wonderful for sightseeing and picnicking, and you should go there while you're on vacation in Kashmir because of its extraordinary beauty.
