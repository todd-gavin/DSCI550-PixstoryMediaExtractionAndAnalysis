Paulo Dybala is in a hurry to find a new club and according to reports in Italy, he could end up playing in Spain, where Real Madrid and Atletico could make their move, but only if they sell some of their strikers. 

Dybala has been in talks with Inter for several months, but negotiations have now been put on hold. The Serie A champions are set to meet the intermediary Fabrizio De Vecchi but have already made it clear that they wonâ€™t raise their offer.

Inter have secured the services of Romelu Lukaku, who will return on loan from Chelsea, so they are in no hurry to reach an agreement with Dybala. Due to FTP regulations, they also need to sell at least two strikers before signing the former Juventus star.
