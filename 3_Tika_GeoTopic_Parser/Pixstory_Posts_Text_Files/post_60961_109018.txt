There is an advantage to having loving cousins they spoil you with gifts I got this game as a gift from my cousin s brother and it has been my favorite game since then It builds up so much drama and tension Irritating other opponents makes the tower fall and building sweats by concentrating on pulling the block Additionally this game also incorporated the game of Truth and Dare Adding more fire to the party I love it Which is your favorite board game
