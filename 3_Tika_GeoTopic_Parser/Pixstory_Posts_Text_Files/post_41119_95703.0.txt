According to a local newspaper, a Black Life Matters vehicle was vandalised overnight last Thursday in Portland, Oregon, costing its owners upwards of $50,000. 

The initiative began in late 2021, according to BLM Trucking boss Charles Preston, to assist provide jobs for young men and keep them out of trouble. 

Fox News reported that it's run by the Golden Opportunity Youth Association and does deliveries for Amazon and Western Pacific, among others. It is not affiliated with the official "Black Lives Matter" organisation, despite its name. 

The truck was parked at a Safety on Northeast Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard Thursday night, according to Founder Timothy Luther McNair. They discovered it destroyed and torched the next morning, with obscenity spray-painted on the side.

Preston described seeing the truck as "a dagger in the heart.” He said “The window was broke, you couldn’t see," McNair told the station. "So, when we opened the door, all we could smell was gasoline and soot and smoke damage." 

Fortunately, despite the setback, McNair has shown his willingness to forgive the perpetrators, telling Fox News that he believes in forgiveness. 

"I simply believe it was an individual who was mislead into believing that we represent anything unethical. But why go around destroying other people's property, in my opinion?" McNair explained. "It's like saying that just because someone's name is Muhammad makes them a terrorist. I'm not sure what you're talking about."
