Every once in a while, an event happens that just reduces the acute animosity and hatred that now exists between India and Pakistan. 

It makes all of us feel a lot better. 

Reena Varma, the 90-year old resident of Pune, who left her ancestral home in 'Prem Gali' in Rawalpindi in 1947, after partition, is currently visiting Pakistan. 

She reached Lahore on 17th July, where she was received warmly and enthusiastically by Imran Williams, who runs the India-Pakistan Heritage Club and who worked hard to make this visit possible. There were quite a few others who welcomed Reena Varma.  

Reena Varma's arrival at her ancestral home in Rawalpindi yesterday was like a celebrity visit. The whole vicinity gathered. She was showered with rose petals and there was dancing and much jubilation. The spirited lady that she is, Reena Varma did a nice jig herself. 

The videos of people warmly receiving her & dancing in the streets to welcome her are doing the rounds on Twitter and YouTube. BBC Hindi is following her visit. A lot of YouTubers in Pakistan are covering her visit as well. 

If the visa regime between the two countries eases, it could spark a huge tourism boom between the two halves of Punjab. Lakhs would want to visit the two sides. 

Alas, for now it looks implausible as well as improbable.

Given a chance, even I would like to visit the East (Bangladesh, which should not be a problem) as well as the West (Pakistan).

One day, hopefully.
