Lately there is a lot of buzz on bodies on the heavier side inclusiveness of plus sizes and in general fat glorification someone recently posted a tweet saying DO NOT GLORIFY OR NORMALIZE FAT PEOPLE BECAUSE BEING FAT IS NOT HEALTHY And from there I wonder they have missed something very important A core message that we want society to realize We know that being fat isn t always healthy Varieties of bodies carry weight in so many different ways So by saying that it s not healthy and I WILL NOT NORMALIZE FAT PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY RE LAZY is not the way to tell them to be healthy So what did we miss then What message do we want people to know The message is this being comfortable in our body will take us to a journey of self acceptance and from there we will know how to love our body in any condition or in any shape Therefore we could really know how to love ourselves and one of them is being healthy You dont get to tell people how to live correctly because the journey of self acceptance is hard enough already People struggle just to accept their body And self acceptance is anybody s right And no by shaming you will not take them to a self love journey If your intention is to REALLY to remind how to be healthy then ENCOURAGE Dont shame Be mindful in your approach and considerate in your tone
