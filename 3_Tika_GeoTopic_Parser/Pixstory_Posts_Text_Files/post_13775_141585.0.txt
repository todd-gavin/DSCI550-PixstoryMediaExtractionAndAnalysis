Every edition of World Cup football throws up a few new things – the one at Qatar in November-December is not going to be an exception. But for the football fans, who want the game to grow at all level without any prejudice, the biggest takeaway is that the female referees will make World Cup history this year by supervising at a major men’s tournament for the first time. Three female referees and three female assistant referees were announced by FIFA among 129 officials selected for World Cup duty. French referee Stéphanie Frappart already worked men’s games in World Cup qualifying and the Champions League, after handling the 2019 Women’s World Cup final. She also refereed the final of the men’s French Cup.
Salima Mukansanga of Rwanda and Yoshimi Yamashita of Japan are also on the list of 36 referees preparing for the 64 games at the tournament. The 69 assistant referees include Neuza Back of Brazil, Karen Díaz Medina of Mexico and Kathryn Nesbitt of the United States. This effort by FIFA is certainly a giant step forward, that, too, when the World Cup to be played in a country governed by strict Muslim laws, which are not always ready to offer equal rights to women in the sporting arena. One will not easy forget how a top Qatar Football Association official, who is also a member of the Royal family, snubbed the two female referees after the 2020 Club World Cup final in 2020. Officials made all efforts to give the incident a different twist, but fans, who watched the video of the incident, alleged the female referees were ignored deliberately.        
But FIFA remains determined in its effort. “As always, the criteria we have used is ‘quality first’ and the selected match officials represent the highest level of refereeing worldwide,” said FIFA Referees Committee chairman Pierluigi Collina, who supervised the 2002 World Cup final. “In this way, we clearly emphasise that it is quality that counts for us and not gender,” he reminded.
