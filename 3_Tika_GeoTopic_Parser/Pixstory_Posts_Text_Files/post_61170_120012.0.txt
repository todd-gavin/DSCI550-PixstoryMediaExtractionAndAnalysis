There are a number of ways that can provide short term relief from menstrual pain and can be easily done at home such as:

1. Rest and relax. Taking a nap in a comfortable position or relaxing in the bathtub with soothing essential oils can help ease the pain.
2. Application of heat is known to significantly reduce the pain. You can either use a heated pain relief pad or simply turn toward a trusty hot water bag.
3. Gently massaging your abdomen and lower back can soothe the pain too.
4. Try to do some gentle exercises that help in improving the flow of blood to the pelvic area.
5. Try relaxation techniques such as guided meditations and deep breathing.
6. If you are pressed for time and cannot rest, over the counter pain medication should do the trick.

It can make your periods much more comfortable.
