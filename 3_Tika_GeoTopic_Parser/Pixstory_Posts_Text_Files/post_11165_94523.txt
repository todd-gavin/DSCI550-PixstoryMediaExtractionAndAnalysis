Exercise has been demonstrated to protect brain cells A recent research investigating the processes involved in this link implies that exercise may help protect brain volume and hence help prevent dementia The study appears in Neurology the American Academy of Neurology s medical publication on April Inserm Research Center in Caen France co author G raldine Poisnel PhD said the findings may help researchers create techniques to prevent or delay age related memory and cognitive deterioration Physical activity in older persons improves cardiovascular health and may improve structural brain integrity Insulin and body mass index BMI had no effect on the link between exercise and glucose metabolism in the brain Dementia patients have impaired glucose metabolism in the brain The study included healthy adults aged on average The people answered questions concerning their recent physical activities MRI scans measured volume and glucose metabolism BMI insulin cholesterol blood pressure and other variables were measured The most active adults had a larger overall volume of grey matter in their brains than the least active ones mm against mm Researchers observed the same results when solely looking at Alzheimer s brain regions The most active had a greater average rate of glucose metabolism in the brain than the least active The amount of amyloid plaque in the brain was not linked to physical activity Amyloid plaque indicates Alzheimer s Poisnel says additional study is needed to grasp these connections Physical activity can assist maintain a lower BMI and hence promote brain health according to Poisnel That exercise protects brain volume is not proven It merely shows a link The study s limitations include the fact that participants reported their own physical activity Research and Innovation Horizon Region Normandy and MMA Foundation of Future Entrepreneurs funded the study
