In Gujarati, Locho means something is not right (fishy).

It has its name from the fact that it was created while making Khaman. In the process of making khaman, it turned out like a lump (locho we call it in Gujarati) instead of getting pieces like Khaman!

So The story behind it is something like this –

Once a chef by mistake added more water to the khaman dhokla batter. So the better turned out very runny and that’s why khaman also turned out a little softer and mushy than the regular one.

So he said,” arre aa to LOCHO thai gayo” means It becomes lumpy and not right.

To hide his mistake, he served that dish along with the tasty and colorful toppings like green chutney, sev, onion, masala, and butter.

And this mistake is loved by his customers and this dish was born.

Made with ingredients like chana dal, urad dal, and poha, this Surti Locho is protein-rich and uses very minimal oil in it. It is one type of Indian street food that can be enjoyed as breakfast, a snack, or as a light dinner.
