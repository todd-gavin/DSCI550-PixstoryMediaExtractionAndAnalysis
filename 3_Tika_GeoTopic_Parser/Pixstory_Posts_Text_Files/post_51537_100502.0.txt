Pep Guardiola gave an emotional interview after Manchester City failed to secure the Premier League on Matchday 37 against West Ham United. 
To do so, City will have to wait until their final Matchday game against Aston Villa. While they are favourites to win the league now after securing their fate in their own hands, but an upset isn't ruled out of the equation. 

Here's what Pep Guardiola said after the 2-2 draw away at the London Stadium:

"We knew we had tough games" said Guardiola. 
"West Ham away after an exceptional performance against Wolves - we knew it - we needed four points - and now there is no debate about goal difference, and no debate about anything, we just have to win our game and if we don't, Liverpool will be Champions."

Guradiola urged the Cityzens to turn the streets Blue while addressing his player's to give everything on the pitch against Villa.

"I can assure you of something - in one week our stadium will be sold out, will give them our lives and they will give theirs, all together.

"To do this is an incredible priviledge, after many years together. It is incredible.

"To have our chance with out people, to win one game and to be champions. I'm looking forward to it. 

"It will be tough, emotional and we have to analyse what we have to do to beat Aston Villa, but we have for 90 minutes to win, I'm pretty sure of that...... everything that we have"

Pep expressed his opinions about Liverpool and he was in a cheerful mood while addressing them:

"One of the most perfect teams I have seen in my life - against Liverpool - this Liverpool team, you can't win the league three or four fixtures ago. It's Impossible!

The Catalan coach also shared what he told his players after the draw:

"It's in our hands. If they lose or win, it depends on us.......  all the people all blues in Manchester, go to the streets and go to the stadium and know we are going to give everything to win and they will be so proud"
