Tom Gilbert will debut for Queensland in the State of Origin decider as Billy Slater resisted making sweeping changes for the Brisbane clash.

With experienced second-rower Felise Kaufusi unavailable due to family reasons, Maroons selectors have called in North Queensland forward.

Gilbert's Cowboys teammate Jordan McLean will make his debut for New South Wales with Jack Wighton named on the bench and Payne Haas missing out due to injury.

Haas, who has been battling a recurring AC joint issue all season, played in the Broncos' 40-26 defeat to the Cowboys on Saturday.

He has since re-aggravated the injury and won't feature in the decider on July 13.

McLean was part of the extended squad for Origin II but has yet to earn NSW honours, despite winning eight caps for Australia.

Gilbert has been named on the interchange bench, with fellow Cowboy Jeremiah Nanai promoted to the starting side in Kaufusi's absence.

Maroons selectors have also added another Cowboy in Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow and emerging Sydney Roosters playmaker Sam Walker to the squad, effectively replacing Corey Oates and Reece Walsh.

The Maroons were dominated in a 44-12 loss in Perth last Sunday, where they had the chance to seal the series after an upset 16-10 victory in Sydney.

Slater resisted any urge to tinker with his pack, or his youthful backline for the Lang Park clash though.

Josh Papalii is again set to start in the front row. Wingers Murray Taulagi and Selwyn Cobbo have retained their spots while back-rower Nanai gets his chance to start after two quiet games off the bench this series.

Cameron Munster (shoulder) and Kalyn Ponga (concussion) have both been named after missing games for their clubs on the weekend.
