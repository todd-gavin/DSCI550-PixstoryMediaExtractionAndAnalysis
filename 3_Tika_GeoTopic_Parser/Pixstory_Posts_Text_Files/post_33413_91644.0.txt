At Jaimanglagarh, a very interesting discovery was pointed out by Dr. R. C. Prasad Singh. An excursion to the site was arranged under the joint leadership of Principal S N Sinha and Prof. R. K. Choudhary in honour of Maharaj Kumar Dr. Raghubir Singh, M.P. and Dr. R. S. Sharma of the Patna University, who, probably in 1957, had come to preside over the annual function and to inaugurate the Bulletin No. 4 of the Jayaswal Archaeological and Historical Society and Museum of the College respectively. The team was taken round the settlement site and reached a point where people were then sinking a well. 

Prof Choudhary was fortunate enough to find the rim of a broken vessel which probably came from the depth of 20’. From the appearance of the rim, it could be guessed that the vessel was wheel-thrown and baked under proper heat. Proceeding further, they came across the moat where local authorities were excavating a tank of about 300’ length and 100’ width for public use. The western bank of the tank cut through the outer wall of the settlement site.

 Three rows of wooden posts, five posts in each row and each at a distance of 7.5’ were seen approximately in the middle of the tank. In addition to this two outer posts, one in the left and other in the rear, were also visible. After a brief survey of the area Dr. R S Sharma observed that these posts were remains of an ancient bridge constructed probably to connect the settlement site with Stupas in the north-east. 

Dr. Singh remarked that if so, it would prove to be an unique discovery in the history of Indian Archaeology, with no remains of ancient bridge having been found elsewhere in the subcontinent and thus requested the Archaeological Department to take every possible measure to preserve and clear the monument. Not much is known about the current status of the remains then seen by the team.
