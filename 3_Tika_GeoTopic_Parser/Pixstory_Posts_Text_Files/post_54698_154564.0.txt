A particularly cold September has given us a glimpse of the winter to come. The cold will bite hardest for the 13% of England’s households that are already in fuel poverty. As the energy crisis intensifies, this is expected to rise further.European leaders have therefore rushed to implement measures to protect households. The UK’s Energy Price Guarantee caps the unit price of electricity and gas at 34p and 10p respectively. While this will ease some concerns over rising energy bills, many households will still be priced out of warming their home in the coming months.So here are four ways research indicates households can reduce their energy use in time for the winter – and save money in the process.1. Air dry laundryWashing and drying clothing is responsible for around 12% of household electricity use in the UK.Yet modern washing machines are highly efficient, typically using 0.5 kilowatt hours for a 9kg wash. This is considerably less than the 0.82 kilowatt hours used on average by hand washing. Even inefficient washing machines tend to use less energy than hand washing as much less hot water is required.By instead restricting use of the tumble dryer, greater reductions in energy use can be achieved. Tumble dryers use a lot of energy, with a single cycle using up to 4.5 kilowatt hours. This will cost £1.50 per cycle at the price cap.By air drying laundry instead, I calculated that the average household could save over £130 a year.2. Use less hot waterFacing critical gas shortages, the German city of Hanover turned off the hot water in the bathrooms of all public buildings earlier this year.While energy-saving measures this severe are unlikely, hot water production in the UK is a major consumer of energy, accounting for roughly one quarter of household energy use. There are several ways households can reduce their hot water use.Read more: https://theconversation.com/four-ways-to-reduce-your-household-energy-use-proven-by-research-191794
