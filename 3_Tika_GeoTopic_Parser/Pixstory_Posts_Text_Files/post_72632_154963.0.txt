As we are celebrating World Mental Health Week in our college, we have decided to enact a play regarding the significance of mental health in our professional and personal life.
The drama is based on the life circle of a human being from early childhood to late adulthood. The drama emphazises the need of mental assistance by the professional for people who are suffering from depression and deep loneliness.
