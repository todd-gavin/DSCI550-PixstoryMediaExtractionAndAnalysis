Recently Australians got a new government and it was a new hope for them. This elections were a or different from the others, in a good way. The youth were participating actively and they were raising important issues like climate change and equal rights for LGBTQ community. 

But is everything good now? Is our government actively working towards those goals? Apparently not! The focus is rather on building a nuclear fleet!

Experts have slammed Peter Dutton's claim that he wanted to buy two US nuclear submarines to fill an impending capability vacuum, as the Liberal leader tries to contain the fallout. 

The Guardian reported that In a campaign to persuade Labor's Richard Marles to rule out other possibilities to bridge the gap between the retirement of Collins class submarines and Australia's ambition to develop a nuclear fleet, Dutton has been accused of "political point-scoring" and being "unhelpful." 

Former defence minister Peter Dutton revealed a plan he planned before the election to buy two Virginia-class submarines by 2030 on Thursday, stating he had "made a judgement the Americans would have permitted exactly that." 

The remarks drew a lot of attention, both because Australia had not yet made a formal decision on whether or not to go with the US or or UK nuclear submarines and because experts have suggested it is unlikely the US would give up two of its own submarines by 2030.
