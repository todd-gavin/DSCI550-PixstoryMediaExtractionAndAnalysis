The boy wonder who signed for Arsenal at 16, Theo Walcott played his first games for the Gunners in 2006-07, collecting two assists in his first two appearances. His first goal for the club opened the scoring in the League Cup final that season as Chelsea beat Arsenal 2-1.
Known for his terrifying pace and knack for scoring spectacular goals, Walcott grappled with injuries as he established himself in the side. His speed made him the ideal wide player, though claiming the #14 shirt ahead of the 2008-09 season anticipated his later role given its previous wearer was Thierry Henry.
The 2010-11 campaign proved to be a turning point. Netting his first career hat-trick against Blackpool, Walcott scored 13 times – his best haul in a single season until then – followed by 11 further strikes in 2011-12. With seven and eight Premier League assists respectively, these two campaigns offered substantial proof of Walcott’s twin goal-scoring and creative capabilities.
These performances saw Arsene Wenger increasingly entrust his speedster with the striker’s role and Walcott subsequently enjoyed his best campaign till date with double figures for goals and assists, including netting a career-best 21 times, in 2012-13.
In January 2014, Walcott ruptured an ACL in an FA Cup win against Tottenham, courting controversy with a hand gesture at the opprobrious Spurs fans as he was stretchered off. He capped a successful return from injury with the first goal in the 2015 FA Cup final win, also setting up the winner in the Community Shield later that year.
In 2016-17, Walcott had another successful campaign, registering his hundredth Arsenal goal among 19 strikes overall, with another FA Cup win into the bargain. In Europe, Walcott remains one of Arsenal’s most successful players ever, being the club’s third-highest goal-scorer (18) and second-highest appearance maker (67) in the Champions League.
The 2017-18 season, however, proved to be his last for Arsenal with Walcott suddenly frozen out, making just 16 appearances and scoring four goals before departing for Everton in the January transfer window. In all, he made 397 appearances for the Gunners, scoring 108 goals and winning three FA Cups.
