Pavel Sagolsem, Program Manager, Nazariya (edited, in the speaker's own words):

I'm so glad that I have another nonbinary person on the panel because I think the understanding of our experience is still shaping up. 

For nonbinary people, ‘passing’ is something which does not really factor in. For us, it's about the agency and our desire to just be who we want to be for that moment. Right now you see me in a sari — I’m ‘feminizing’ myself. But I do not see this as the end of my transition.

As a nonbinary person, when I say transition, it's not like one thing to the other, but also about the agency to keep on going to and fro and whenever I want to, to whatever I want to do.

Recently, I had to go to hospital because of a heatstroke. My eyebrows were threaded and there was a bit of femininity in me, but then of course, I couldn't really dress up. So some of the people there called me ‘madam’ and some called me ‘sir’.

Somehow I feel comfortable in that because I think the ambiguity that we represent was captured there. 

But then again, the authority and agency is more with the people treating me.
