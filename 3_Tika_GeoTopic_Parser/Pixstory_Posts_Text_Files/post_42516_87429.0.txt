Just watched the trailer of the stand-alone series of the new Marvel superhero ‘Ms. Marvel.’ 

After watching the trailer I understood few things which I will share with you all guys which are as follows:- 

1. Ms. Marvel will be the first Marvel series where the lead actress is Muslim. Yeah, the name of the character is Kamala khan. 

2. After watching the trailer, we got a sneak peek of the characters from ‘Fantastic Four.’

3. After watching the trailer, I noticed things like, Kamala khan is fond of Avengers and later she will discover her ‘cosmic’ powers. 

4. Going by the rumors, Pakistani actor, Fawad Khan is also there in the series. 

5. Ms. Marvel will release on June 8 and you can stream it on Disney+ Hotstar. 

As a fan of Marvel Studios, you can only hope that this series will be performed according to our expectations.
