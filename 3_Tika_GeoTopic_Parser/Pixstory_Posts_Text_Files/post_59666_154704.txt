The seed of DROPSPLAY was incepted inside our mind in late We as a bunch of super passionate filmmakers were making films hovering over different art forms everything was going smooth like butter but soon we realized that art has some kind of magic as everyone is having an idea but like every industry there is a saturation point or we may call it as but how would I execute it man Then we were like We ll be there for you cause you re there for me too The number of approachers was ton more than we expected They say that an art produced isn t an art until it has some quality production value Someone had the script we converted it into a film Someone else had the lyrics amp music we made it a industry standard song So we filled their heart now it was time to fill their stomach too Look an artist s only job is to produce art DROPSPLAY does it all for them so that artists can focus on their respective art Who knows the next Spielberg or next Arijit is sitting at his home in his small town with a fantastic movie idea or soothing tune inside his mind and without hope We are the HOPE What Is Aar Deri Noy By Sidhu Aar Deri Noy by Sidhu is a project where the Dropsplay team wants to send a message to the society that no more we will let our daughters mothers sisters fail and this is exclusively promoted by INKZOID The youth needs to get in the right path This is the issue that we ignore but this time the blood needs to be on fire Dropsplay will be coming up with many more contents which will add value to society Do watch Aar Deri Noyy An anti rape music video ft Sidhu Cactus through the link given below
