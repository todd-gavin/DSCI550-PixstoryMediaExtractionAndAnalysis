Glass skin, as you may know, is your skin at its healthiest. No acne, no pigmentation, no dark spots. Just a glass-like appearance. But did you know there's something called the Glass Skin Facial?

The Glass Skin Facial combines resurfacing techniques with a blend of nutrients and PRFM (plasma) delivered in small amounts using very thin micro-needles that act as a little injector. Although your own liquid gold plasma has been shown to stimulate collagen, reduce fine lines and wrinkles, pigmentation, and texture, this therapy does not address oil in the skin.

This method allows the solution to micro-inject to the precise depth of correction without sacrificing the product's benefits by allowing it to sit on the skin's surface. Full facial repair is achieved, with gradual improvements visible over time.
