Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) is an evaluation of a firm’s collective conscientiousness for social and environmental factors. It is typically a score that is compiled from data collected surrounding specific metrics related to intangible assets within the enterprise. It could be considered a form of corporate social credit score. Research shows that such intangible assets comprise an increasing percentage of future enterprise value.

Last fall, the Real Estate industry gave itself a pat on the back for being environmentally and socially responsible.

When a referee for ESG investing issued its annual scores, companies including Ivanhoé Cambridge, Prologis and Vornado Realty Trust touted highlights such as a “Green Star” rating or improvement from the previous year in one of the categories.

What the companies failed to disclose, though, was that each has an employee on one of the committees that helps create the standards. Picture students creating questions for an exam, then crowing about acing it.

Real estate’s use of the referee GRESB, raises a broader question: 

Can the industry be impartial enough to self-govern when it comes to climate change?

GRESB does not bill itself as an outside arbitrator. It describes itself as a member-led organization “by industry, for industry.”

The problem with institutions like GRESB is that institutional investors don’t demand a lot in terms of ESG measurements because it would hurt their bottom line.
