India bears world's highest health, economic burden due to lead poisoning: Centre :-
A 2020 report by the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) and non-profit Pure Earth had found India to be home to a major chunk of the 800 million children poisoned by lead globally.
Now, a central report has found that India bears the world's highest health and economic burden due to lead poisoning.
The report, prepared jointly by government think tank Niti Aayog and the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR), was published in July this year. A meeting was organised by Pure Earth and The Energy and Resource Institute in the national capital October 11, 2022 to discuss the findings of the report.
