WINDS OF CHANGE 

Hundreds of thousands of young leaders are organizing around the world to demand greater action on climate change to protect the earth and make it a better home for everyone. The one who comes to mind on thinking about these young leaders is GRETA THUNBERG. She is a Swedish environmental activist who is well-known for urging politicians to take immediate action on climate change. When she was 15 years old, she started standing outside the Swedish Parliament to call for stronger action on this issue, holding up a sign saying " school strike for climate ". She then got noticed for her youth and her strong determination.

“You say that you love your children above everything else. And yet you are stealing their future.” - Greta Thunberg

 Many people after hearing about this incident were inspired. Students in different areas started taking part in the school strike as well. Greta felt strongly enough about climate change to take action. Her continued effort and passion has helped climate change gain more prominence and awareness. Numerous people realized the dangerous situation we are in.

We can learn so much from her. Starting a strike alone without any support is a very brave thing to do. We all should realize that earth is our home and currently it is on fire. We should all take inspiration from Greta, and try to find different ways in which we can help the cause. Any small action can make a huge difference in the future, such as walking short distances instead of taking a car, carpooling, planting trees, and just spreading awareness. Only we can protect the earth for a better future. Not only for us but for future generations as well.
