                      Peace.
For me peace is being free from abuse,                     
the abuse we feel each passing day ,                       
the abuse from which abused wants freedom , 
the abuse which let us unspoken.
The coercion we get from society,
the coercion we get from friends,
the coercion we get from intruders,
the coercion ,we want liberty from.
Only if we learn to say no,
I,we,all will be set free.
Abyss,place for papers of this taboo,
together we can freed from it .
