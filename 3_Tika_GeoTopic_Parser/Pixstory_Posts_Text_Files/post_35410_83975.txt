During my almost years in ownership of Chelsea I have always looked upon my role as guardian of the Club whose job it is to ensure we are as successful as we can be today as well as build for the future whilst at the same time playing a positive role in our communities I have always taken I make decisions with the interests of the club at heart I remain true to these values That is why I am today entrusting the trustees of Chelsea Charity Foundation with the management and care of Chelsea FC I believe they are currently in the best position to look after the interests of the Club players, staff and fans This is the official press release that appeared on the official website of the London club Abramovich&#39;s decision was drastic and forced as he was forced by European sanctions to leave the presidency of the Club England is in fact increasingly tightening the measures to sanction the Russia after Putin&#39;s invasion of Ukraine A historic day if we will for Chelsea which historically has always been linked to its President over the years
