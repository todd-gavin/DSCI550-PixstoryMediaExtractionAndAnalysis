Now the negotiation is concluded and Robert Lewandowski is a Barcelona player exactly as he wanted and as the Catalan club strongly wanted Relations with his former team that Bayern Munich of which he made history and will remain in history are completely worn out after the previous weeks to the transfer He spoke about it himself interviewed by ESPN Everything that happened in the last few weeks was politics The club tried to find a way to explain to the fans why the transfer I had to accept it even if a lot of bullshit was said a lot of wrong things about me It wasn&#39;t true but in the end the fans even during this period supported me Some people didn&#39;t tell the truth they said something different Lewandowski left Bayern Munich after scoring goals in games and winning the title of top scorer in the league recent seasons and a whole host of trophies including a Champions League in 2012. For me it was always important to be clear and honest And perhaps for some this was a problem I finally realized that the time was right to leave Bayern Saying goodbye to the rumors about Haaland No that wouldn&#39;t have been a problem
