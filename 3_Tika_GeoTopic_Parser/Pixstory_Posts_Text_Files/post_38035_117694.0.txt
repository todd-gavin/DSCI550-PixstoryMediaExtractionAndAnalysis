PSG star Neymar was reported to be in talks for a potential move to Manchester City. But Pep Guardiola, the City boss has dismissed these rumours and has made his feelings clear in an interview on Wednesday. 

French news agency La Parisian had earlier stated that Neymar is in talks with Manchester City and would be heading there in the summer. Some reports claimed that Bernardo Silva would be moving to PSG in a trade deal. However, Pep Guardiola dismissed these rumours. 

As per the Mirror, Pep Guardiola said, "I am so sorry forÂ Le Parisien, but it is not true. I am sorry for them because the information they have received is false. Neymar is an incredible player and by my information, he is a nice guy. Let him express himself at Paris."

Hence the Man City manager has confirmed that Neymar would not be joining the Premier League club this season. The Brazilian star is reportedly unhappy with the PSG board and is hence looking to move. The board has also given him a green signal as per reports. 

Chelsea have popped up as Neymar's potential suitors however it is yet to be seen if a deal is made between the PL club and the player this summer.
