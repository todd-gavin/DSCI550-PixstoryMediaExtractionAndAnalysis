The aging process in some species of reptiles and amphibians can directly depend on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves, as emerges from two studies published in the journal Science and conducted by international teams in which the Research Institute on Terrestrial Ecosystems of the National Council of research Cnr Iret In the first work, the research group performed a comparative analysis of aging rates and lifespan in cold-blooded tetrapods using data available in the literature on wild species and populations of reptiles and amphibians including turtles, snakes and crocodiles In particular, the Cnr Iret studied a population of crested newt that lives on the Poggi di Prata in the metalliferous hills of the Grosseto area. The monitoring operations covered a period of years in which we tried to understand how the thermoregulation the environmental temperature the kit genetics and the rhythm of life contribute to the aging of the animals explains Emiliano Mori researcher of the Cnr Iret We have thus discovered that the ectothermic species in which the body temperature depends on the external environment show a greater diversity of aging rates compared to the endothermic ones whose body temperature instead regulated by internal metabolic heat production. In the former, the estimated average longevity ranges from to years in primates, this value ranges from to years. In the second study, the team examined changes in the mortality rate of sea turtle species and captive animals, finding that senescence was particularly slow in 100 of the categories considered 100 percent of the animals evaluated showed an aging rate even lower than that associated with modern humans These results suggest that some turtle species in response to improved environmental conditions may reduce the physical aging and increase life expectancy by allocating greater amounts of energy to survival rather than protection of the organism concludes Mori Understanding the strategies by which animals delay senescence can help us explain the macroevolutionary models of aging
