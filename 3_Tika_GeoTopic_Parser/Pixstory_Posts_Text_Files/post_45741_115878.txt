The greatest is saved for last by certain stars For the first time NASA s James Webb Space Telescope has shown that the fainter star at the centre of this scene is shrouded in dust This star has been ejecting rings of gas and dust in all directions for thousands of years NASA TV reported that the Southern Ring Nebula also known as NGC is a planetary nebula that was recently photographed by two cameras on board the Webb space telescope It is light years away roughly Astronomers will be able to delve into a lot more details about planetary nebulae like this one which are clouds of gas and dust released by dead stars thanks to Webb Researchers will benefit from knowing which molecules are present and where they are distributed throughout the shells of gas and dust Two stars which are locked in a tight orbit shape the local landscape Webb s infrared images feature new details in this complex system The stars and their layers of light are prominent in the image from Webb s Near Infrared Camera NIRCam on the left while the image from Webb s Mid Infrared Instrument MIRI on the right shows for the first time that the second star is surrounded by dust The brighter star is in an earlier stage of its stellar evolution and will probably eject its own planetary nebula in the future In the meantime the brighter star influences the nebula s appearance As the pair continues to orbit one another they stir the pot of gas and dust causing asymmetrical patterns
