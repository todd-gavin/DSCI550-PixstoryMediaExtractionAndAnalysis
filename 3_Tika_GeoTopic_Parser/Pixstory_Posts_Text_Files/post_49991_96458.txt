This is Just to Say I have eaten the plums that were in the icebox and which you were probably saving for breakfast Forgive me they were delicious so sweet and so cold This is an example of an imagist poem See I told you anyone can write a poem This appears to be a found poetry and was greatly parodied Readers see that the poem isn t focused on the speaker s apology but rather on the satisfaction the speaker derived from eating the plums in the first place But seriously I believe it s just a note to his wife which he made into a poem This happens when you take rejections too seriously Yes you can revolutionise and reject traditional aspects of poetry Give something to the reader I mean just because you have hatred towards traditional aspects poetry why are you settling for less Bring on something meaningful And again I will be questioned on my status to determine what s meaningful So guys who are you with With me or Willam Carlos Willams
