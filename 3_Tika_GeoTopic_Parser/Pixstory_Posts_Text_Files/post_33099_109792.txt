A revised film that we hope will have a different ending Francesco Bagnaia&#39;s Dutch Grand Prix pole position the Ducati rider with the new Assen track record For Pecco the fourth pole position of the year his career Behind the Italian as at the Sachsenring there is Fabio Quartararo and in the front row with them Jorge Martin who could have tried to attack pole if he hadn&#39;t slipped with his Ducati before the second attempt The second is opened by a very good Marco Bezzecchi with him Aleix Espargaro will start with the Aprilia and perhaps Jack Miller with the other Ducati When time ran out, the Australian involuntarily hindered Maverick Vinales&#39; last attempt and could possibly be penalized. Third row for Johann Zarco&#39;s Ducati, Miguel Oliveira&#39;s KTM and Alex Rins&#39; Suzuki, while in fourth in line there will be the other KTM of Brad Binder the aforementioned Vinales who among other things was seen canceled due to yellow flags a lap that would have put him in seventh place and Taka Nakagami with the Honda Only an unfortunate Enea Bastianini behind Marini and Bastianini The Ducatista the bike stopped in Q and had to run to the pits on foot being able to do only one run with a bike that until minutes before had a wet setup
