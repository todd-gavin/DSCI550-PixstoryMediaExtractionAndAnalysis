The veteran Congress leader warned Prime Minister Narendra Modi "would die Hitler's death if he continues on his path" during the party's 'Satyagraha' event at Delhi's Jantar Mantar. 
"I feel that PM Modi has gone beyond all that (Adolf) Hitler did," he remarked, referring to the BJP and Modi's dictatorial ways. Hitler had also established a 'Khakee' organisation. If Modi continues on Hitler's road, I believe he will die Hitler's death. Modi, keep this in mind."
