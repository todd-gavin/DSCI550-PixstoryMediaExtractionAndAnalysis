Yeah, everyone in their life sometimes panics or has the anxiety to overcome them everyone has their way. 
My way is to color. The coloring book has been my best friend for so long. It calms me and distracts me from things that are bothering my mind. 

Once I cool down and feel like the pressure on my mind is released then I can think straight and do the work right.

If this works for you then happy to share this post with you all. If it does work find something that calms you like for some people music ðŸŽ¶ helps them to calm down.
