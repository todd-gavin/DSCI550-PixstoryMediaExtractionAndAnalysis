Praising Modi, the delegation members said he is not just the prime minister of India, but the "prime minister of the world" as he understands the difficulties faced especially by Hindus and Sikhs across the world and makes all out efforts to provide immediate help in all such cases.

Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri and Union Minister of State Meenakashi Lekhi were also present on the occasion. The delegation members presented the PM with traditional Afghani attire and a headgear, which he wore and remarked that former Afghan President Hamid Karzai would be very happy to see him in that attire.

A large number of Afghan Hindus and Sikhs have been living in India, and the Indian government recently evacuated many of them following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.

The Modi government has often asserted its commitment to the minorities of Afghanistan who have faced religious persecution, especially from the Taliban.

The CAA, which facilitates granting of Indian citizenship to persecuted non-Muslim minorities of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, was passed by Parliament on December 11, 2019 and the Presidential nod was received the next day.

Meanwhile, the Afghan Ambassador here, Farid Mamundzay, thanked Prime Minister Modi for wearing "chapan and Afghani lungi" which he said were an inseparable part of their identity.

"Style is a way to connect with the masses and respect cultural diversity without saying much. Cultural diversity brings collective power and benefits the whole humanity," he said in a series of tweets in Hindi.

Fashion will fade but this style of 'Chappan' and 'Lungi' will remain immortal, Mamundzay said. "As you say, India-Afghanistan is as old as history: today we are very much impressed by your Afghan style," he said.
