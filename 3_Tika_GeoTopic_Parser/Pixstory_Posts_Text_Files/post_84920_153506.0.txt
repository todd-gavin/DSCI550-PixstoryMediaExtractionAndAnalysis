Brest will be hosting Lorient on Sunday at Stade Raymond Kopa. 
The encounter will be between one of the table toppers and one of the strugglers. Brest are languishing in 18th place in the standing whereas Lorient are flying high up in the table standing in the third position. Brest have been struggling from the beginning of the season. They lost 3-2 against Lens and have only won once since then against Angers. 
Meanwhile Lorient have been ligue's surprise package as no one expected their performance this season. They finished 16 th last season and are currently third in the current season. They are on a five game winning streak including a 2-1 win against Lille just last weekend. 
Recent results between these two teams have been balanced with three wins for each team in the last six meetings. Recently Brest defeated Lorient in a friendly match this July.

Though the last few games are mixed for both the teams, the current form of Lorient makes them the favourites for winning the game. The visitors are riding a wave of momentum and are looking deadly. Though their defence is not that strong, it doesn't seem that Brest could break it to take the team over the line.
