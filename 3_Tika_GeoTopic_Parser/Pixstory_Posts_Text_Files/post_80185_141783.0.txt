As the world embarks on living a normal life post the pandemic amid declining cases, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned that one person with Covid-19 is still dying every 44 seconds globally.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General, said that this virus will not just fade away.

"The global decline in reported cases and deaths is continuing. This is very encouraging. But there is no guarantee these trends will persist. The most dangerous thing is to assume they will," he said in his latest remarks.

Why this is the most dangerous time?
Explaining this, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, a downward trend can be the most dangerous time, if it opens the door to complacency.
WHO continues to recommend that all countries persist with a tailored combination of public health measures, testing, research & targeted vaccination, where vaccines are available, the WHO chief added.

Vaccination coverage has increased but…
Tedros also pointed out that COVID-19 vaccination coverage of high-priority groups has improved vastly but a large section of the population is still unprotected.
It’s great that COVID-19 vaccination coverage of high-priority groups is improving, but still 1/3 of the world’s population remains unvaccinated, including 2/3 of health workers & 3/4 of older adults in low-income countries.
