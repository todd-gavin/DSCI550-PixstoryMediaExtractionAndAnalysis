The National Basketball Association is aÂ  professional basketball League, formed in the United States in 1949 by the merger of 2 rival organizations. In 1976 the NBA absorbed 4 teams from the ABA. By the early 1980s the NBA was plagued by money losses, low attendance, declining T.V ratings and limited national appeal. The league soon rebounded under the leadership of David Stern, who helped the league to an international entertainment company in 1984. Top ranking teams at the end of the season engage in a playoff to determine the NBA championship, which claims the title of world championship. Probably the most dominant team in the history of the NBA is Boston Celtics, which won 11 of 13 titles from 1956-1969; however, the league only had 8 to 14 teams and the team owners widely avoided signing (recruiting) african-american players at the time. In the years to come, aggressive marketing as well as signing players without discrimination, only focusing on the basketball skills the player had to offer. Star players like Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Michael Jordan amazed fans worldwide, leading the pavement to more players like Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, Stephen Curry and many more, leading to the NBA being the most popular tournament in the world.
