On April 14, Sudarshan News claimed during a broadcast that Pawan Hans Limited is indulging in “job jihad”. The channel’s editor-in-chief Suresh Chavhanke asserted that the government-owned company was only recruiting Muslim aspirants and Hindu students were being discriminated against. Pawan Hans Limited is a Category I Miniratna company under the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Government of India.

In a subsequent broadcast of its flagship show ‘Bindass Bol’, Chavhanke said to his viewers, “After studying aviation courses from all across India and spending lakhs of rupees in fees, people are still unemployed. But Jamia Millia Islamia! Pawan Hans has a partnership with the Delhi campus [of Jamia Millia Islamia]. I have the agreement documents. But in the recent recruitment drive, Pawan Hans has taken 100% of students from Jamia. No advertisements, not even an appeal was circulated [regarding the drive]. As if the company is owned by some sheikh and whoever caught his whims has been taken. There are more questions regarding the company’s violation of recruitment protocols set by the Indian government.” During the show, Chavhanke asked for serious measures to be taken against the company.

Ashok Srivastav, senior editor at DD News, tweeted an image of a list on April 7. The list carried the names of nine interns recruited by Pawan Hans, all of whom hailed from the Muslim community. Srivastav wrote that the company did not release any official declaration of an upcoming recruitment drive but directly contacted the authorities at Jamia Millia and the university’s coordinator sent them this list. His tweet drew over 7,000 likes.

OpIndia and Sudarshan News’s Sagar Kumar amplified the claim.

An aspirant named Ansh Aggarwal’s father Rajiv Aggarwal tweeted that his son had the highest CGPA in the mechanical branch, yet he did not get selected. He urged the government to pursue an inquiry into the matter.
