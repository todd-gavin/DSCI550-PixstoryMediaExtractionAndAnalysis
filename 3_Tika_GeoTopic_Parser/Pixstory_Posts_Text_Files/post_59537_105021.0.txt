Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said that Kashmiri Pandits were being forced to leave the valley due to the targeted killings and demanded the centre declare an action plan to stop the attacks.
Addressing the Aam Aadmi Party's 'Jan Aakrosh Rally' at Jantar Mantar in Delhi, he said Kashmiri Pandits were facing a repeat of what happened to them in the 1990s.

"The BJP can't handle Kashmir, they only know how to do dirty politics. Please don't do politics over Kashmir," the AAP chief said.
