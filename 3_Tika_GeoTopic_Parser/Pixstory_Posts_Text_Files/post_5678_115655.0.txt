Guru Purnima is celebrated as a festival by Hindus, Jains & Budhhists. It is dedicated to all the 'gurus' or teachers in a person's life.

Traditionally, Guru Purnima has been celebrated by Buddhists to commemorate Gautam Buddha’s first sermon to his first five disciples. However, Hindus & Jains also celebrate it in respect of their teacher.

In Nepal, it is celebrated as Teachers Day. 

The festival holds a deeper meaning and fascinating history. Gautam Buddha, the founder of the Buddhist faith, is believed to have given his first sermon on this day. After five weeks of achieving enlightenment under the Bodhi tree, Buddha went from Bodhgaya to Sarnath, Uttar Pradesh. There he gave a sermon on the full moon day.

Guru purnima marks the relationship between students and teacher as it is said that a teacher or 'guru' plays a vital role in person's life. 'Gu' in guru means darkness and 'ru' means removal of darkness. Thus, a guru is someone who brings their desciple out of darkness and lead them to light. As Saint Kabir writes, "Teacher is even greater than God. If it hadn't been for the teacher, I'd never be able to see God."
