Privacy is a myth in this era where your communication travels by air We get promises of privacy from all the browsers and apps The US government has regulations and training that prevent them from collecting storing and using this data without a warrant for any purposes But we are almost forced to give access to access the apps Even though the government have rules signal intelligence is not a difficult task with the correct equipment We think our conversations are private but they aren t Everything you say or browse anywhere can be obtained and can be used to track stalk steal and monitor your activity Even all the allows we do in apps control us and work on mental consumerism Think or speak of a Bluetooth speaker you will be cluttered with ads on different Bluetooth speakers or online sites that have Bluetooth speakers forcing you to buy them Do you know that Google employees have access to your emails Yes as a result of the agreement you agreed upon when you create an account Browsing history is associated with your identity and is nearly never private even when you ve gone incognito The data that can be pulled out by installed applications operating systems and if you have your name tied to your machine or installed You re probably not withstanding an offensive attack but having your personal information used for marketing and demographic purposes feels offensive and invasive
