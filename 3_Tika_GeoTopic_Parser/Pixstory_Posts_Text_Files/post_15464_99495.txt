If dispersed into the environment rather than correctly disposed of in the compost, bioplastics also have very long degradation times comparable to those of non-bio plastic materials. This is demonstrated by the results of an innovative experiment conducted jointly by the National Research Council involved with the Cnr Institute for Chemical-Physical Processes Ipcf and the Institute of Marine Sciences Cnr Ismar National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology Ingv and the Ligurian District for Marine Technologies Dltm with the support of the State Police Nautical Center and Scuba Divers La Spezia CNeS The study published in the open access journal Polymers concerned the behavior long-term analysis of different types of virgin plastic granules resin pellets used to make commonly used objects Two polymers among the most used in plastic objects HDPE and PP and two biodegradable plastic polymers PLA and PBAT were compared, verifying the degree of aging and degradation respectively in sea water and sand in both environments over six months of observation neither traditional nor bio polymers showed significant degradation The observation of the samples together with the results of spectroscopic and thermal chemical analyzes conducted at the CNR Pisa laboratory Ipfc coordinated by the researcher Simona Bronco shows that in the natural environment bioplastics have much longer degradation times than those that occur in conditions of industrial composting Given the very high diffusion of these materials it is important to be aware of the environmental risks that the use of bioplastics poses if dispersed or not appropriately conferred for disposal, it is necessary to correctly inform, explains the researcher Silvia Merlino of the Cnr Ismar of Lerici La Spezia, project coordinator. has been in force in Italy since January in implementation of the European Single use plastic directive which has led to the progressive marketing of disposable products in biodegradable plastic such as the polymers examined adds Marina Locritani researcher at Ingv and co-coordinator of the study
