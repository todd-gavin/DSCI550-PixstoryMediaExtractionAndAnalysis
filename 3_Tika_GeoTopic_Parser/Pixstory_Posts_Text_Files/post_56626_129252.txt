Rugby league s showpiece will remain in Sydney this year the game s boss says after a deal was struck to keep the NRL grand final in NSW Australian Rugby League Commission ARLC chair Peter V landys has confirmed the decider will be played at Olympic Park on the first weekend of October Mr V landys has been locked in a battle with the NSW government for several weeks after it abandoned plans to upgrade suburban stadiums He had threatened to move the decider interstate in revolt claiming the government had backed out of a deal to revamp ageing infrastructure After extensive negotiations we have made a decision which we believe is in the best interests of our fans and that is to hold the game in Sydney this year Mr V landys said The ARLC supremo said the state government had come to the table with an additional investment to secure the event However he stressed the agreement was only for this year and floated the idea of a Super Bowl type concept where the decider could be moved around the country The Queensland government was eager to bring the event to Brisbane where the match was held in due to pandemic restrictions in Sydney It is really now put on the table for the future Mr V landys said It hasn t been because we were hoping we would have an exclusive arrangement with the New South Wales government Unfortunately that is no longer the case It opens the door for a Super Bowl type concept or who can give us the best deal for the game Mr V landys said negotiations with the NSW government had gone down to the wire with Queensland s bid coming close to success Up until last night s commission meeting if you asked me then I would say it would go to Queensland he said NRL chief executive Andrew Abdo said it was important to draw a line in the sand to give fans certainty about where this year s game would be played But he said the concept of taking the grand final around Australia was exciting for our fans across the country
