Anna Faris has an astonished look on her face in the first trailer for her new movie, The Estate.
The 45-year-old actress stars with Toni Collette, David Duchovny, Rosemarie DeWitt, Ron Livingston, and Kathleen Turner in the upcoming film, directed by Dean Craig.
Here's a summary: Two sisters (Colette, Faris) attempt to win over their terminally ill, difficult-to-please aunt (Turner) in hopes of becoming the beneficiaries of her wealthy estate, only to find the rest of their greedy family members have the same idea.
The Estate will hit select theaters on Friday, November 4.
This will be Anna's first major role since she departed CBS's Mom ahead of the final season in 2021.
