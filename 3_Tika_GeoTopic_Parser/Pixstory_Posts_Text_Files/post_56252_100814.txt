 Liz Truss has confirmed the plans to ditch Northern Ireland Protocol she also asserted that the east west relationship between Great Britain and Northern Ireland has been undermined by the Protocol The bill is not anticipated to be published for several weeks but if enacted could spark a trade war with the EU Liz Truss also said that the priority of the government is to uphold Good Friday Agreement She said referring to opposition from the Democratic Unionist party The Northern Ireland protocol does not have the support necessary in one part of the community in Northern Ireland She pointed out issues like veterinary checks and EU rules that deterred the Treasury from cutting taxes so that there should be a balance in the agreement She proposed legislation that would establish a green channel for goods going to Northern Ireland from Great Britain that would not go on to the Republic of Ireland with mandatory checks halted for these exports Goods moving onwards to the Republic would still face checks via a red channel This is referred to as a dual regulatory system In this time of high end inflation we need fewer taxes but will it invite the wrath of the EU and make the conditions even worse
