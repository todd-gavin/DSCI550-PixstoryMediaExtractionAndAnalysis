Just finished watching the first episode of the new Marvel web series “Moonknight” and one thing I want to say about Marvel is, they tried something new for sure but to make a series for children of age 13+ they didn’t show too much action in this episode.

In the first episode, I got to know about the character of Steven (played by Oscar Isaac) working in a gift shop. He ties himself with ankle cuffs, he put tapes on the front door, an organization named ‘staying awake’ helps him not to sleep but every story needs a conflict and in the first episode there is a CONFLICT.

When Steven sleeps, we met another character named Marc (also played by Oscar Isaac) and in this reality, he is a mercenary and running to save his life from Arthur (played by Ethan Hawke) because Marc has a Scarab (scarabaeid beetle considered divine by ancient Egyptian) and Arthur want it, why Arthur want it? We will get to know in the coming episodes.

Scenes where Oscar Isaac is struggling to know his real self and trying to know what is reality and what is a dream, create tension in viewer’s mind too. The last ten minutes of an episode were gripping and hold you tight.

Background music in the first episode is really good and complements the scenes very well.

One thing I didn’t like about the episode is, that the producers wanted to make a dark web series but to attract more audience, they showed very little action and skipped to the result of that particular fight scene. As a viewer, I want to see more fighting if the character is so dark.

Let’s hope, the upcoming episode will not disappoint Marvel fans.

The second episode of Moonknight will premiere on 6th January and you can stream it on Disney+ Hotstar.
