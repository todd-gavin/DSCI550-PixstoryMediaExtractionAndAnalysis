In a recent interview with the Hindu, Karan talked about all the hate he gets for Koffee with Karan. He said, “So, I don’t know how much of the hate and trolling is actually about the show; it’s really more about the fact that a show like this exists, and has this kind of abandon. ✅✅A lot of the hate sometimes is entertaining, because I wonder why they are cursing it so much, but also watching it? I read the threads on Twitter and other portals; reels and reels of discourse that people are having about KWK… and I feel very moved and touched. I’m like, that’s a lot of time you have taken out of your lives to write such a long column on something you hated so much.” ✔️✔️

“I’ll be honest; I’m definitely not justifying anything to anyone, but I feel like I owe it to myself to talk about it. It’s cathartic for me. I feel sometimes, if I don’t talk about it, people may think that I’m actually still affected by it,”he said. 🥹☑️☑️☑️

Karan has also been at the receiving end of hatred and trolling for the show. However, the filmmaker feels that this hate is entertaining sometimes as people are still watching the show☑️☑️☑️☑️☑️☑️
