The book It ends with us was my recent read. The book is by Collen Hoveer. She's the new york times best-selling author. The story of this book is something that will keep its readers interest till its ending. The story involves physical and psychological abuse, emotional imbalance. In addition, to that the story also talks about how the lead character of the story (lily) deals with all of that, the theme of the book also talks about generation cycle.This story has the ability to draw a new perspective. This book is definitely worth a read. I remember when i started reading, i read for about 6 -7 hours at stretch. Also, the sequel of the book is also in the making
