 Will Sachin Pilot replace Ashok Gehlot as next Rajasthan chief minister or is it CP Joshi The Congress Legislature Party CLP in Rajasthan will on Sunday elect the successor of chief minister Ashok Gehlot who finally agreed to relinquish the post and contest the upcoming party president s polls Gehlot will then submit his resignation to Governor Kalraj Mishra and is likely to file his nomination papers for the Congress president s post on Monday Congress President Sonia Gandhi has appointed Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge and party general secretary in charge of Rajasthan Ajay Maken as central observers Gehlot s bete noire Sachin Pilot is hoping to replace him But Gehlot wants one of his loyalists Bulaki Das Kalla known as BD Kalla or Mahesh Joshi to be sworn in as his successor Both are at present ministers in his cabinet To stop Pilot he could even agree on his known baiter and Speaker CP Joshi who is also the second choice of the Congress leadership after Pilot So far Gehlot has maintained a firm grip over a large number of legislators but the big question is whether he would be able to sustain that hold and force the leadership to accept his choice But if the Congress high command manages to get Pilot installed as the chief minister it would also put a question mark on Gehlot s authority in his future role As seen in Punjab all the legislators who were loyal to Captain Amarinder Singh till a few days ago changed tack the day the Congress leadership summoned the CLP meeting Amarinder subsequently resigned from the post in September last year and Dalit leader Charanjit Singh Channi replaced him However the Congress badly lost the assembly elections earlier this year with the Aam Aadmi Party AAP registering a stupendous victory
