Looking For Alaska by John Green 
A best-selling novel also adapted to a drama
The book is written in changing tenses, which I've never read anywhere before, and didn't quite enjoy. The storyline is just pure, raw talent. It ends with a twist, there's joy, heartbreak, humour, so many contrasting adjectives that I can use to describe 261 pages of literature. If you're thinking twice about reading this, as it might not be for your age, then I guess it depends on your maturity. Not going too much in detail about that. My favourite quote, which is now one of my all-time favourite quotes is : "If people were rain, I was drizzle and she was hurricane.” —John Green" Happy Reading!
