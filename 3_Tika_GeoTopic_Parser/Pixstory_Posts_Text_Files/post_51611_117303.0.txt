For the second straight match on their pre-season tour, Raphael Varane is not included in the Man United lineup.

After taking a knock in practise, Manchester United decided not to risk Raphael Varane once more.

Though Varane is in the gym but he is not included in the team for the team's last game against Crystal Palace.

The Frenchmen began  last week's 4-0 victory against Liverpool but was absent from the team for Friday's 4-1 success over Melbourne Victory. 

Erik ten Hag, the manager of United, stated that Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez would be his first choice defensive pairing.

When asked if Maguire will be the team, 
Ten Hag said, "I think he is. "He's proven it in the past, but he also needs to prove it now and in the future."

"He has played 60 times for England. Harry is really impressive and I expect a lot from him. But there is also internal competition and that is what a club like Man United needs. You cannot win with 11 players.

I prefer Raphael Varane and Harry Maguire in the Top starting line up,
Hoping that soon after these Exhibition matches Raphael Varane will start in the Starting 11 line up.
