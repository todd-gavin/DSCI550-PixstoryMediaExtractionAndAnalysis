With less than 75 days left for the World Cup to kick off, Carlos Queiroz has returned to coach Iran for a second spell. Having coached Iran twice before, Queiroz is back on the same hot seat thanks to the change that took place in the Iran football federation (IRIFF). Recently, Mehdi Taj was elected as the new president of the IRIFF for a four-year term on Tuesday. He ran on a ticket promising to bring back Queiroz to the national team and Taj delivered within days. The Portuguese coach’s return also spelt the end of Dragan Skocic’s tenure, who guided Iran’s qualification for the 2022 edition, and won 15 of his 18 games in charge since taking over as the fulltime replacement for Marc Wilmots.
Skocic, who was fired and then rehired in July in a sign of the turbulence at the IRIFF. The uncertainty and political manoeuvring complicated Iran’s World Cup preparations with the IRIFF’s financial resources limited and difficulties in planning warm-up friendlies because of the country’s isolation. Queiroz however is immensely popular in Iran after leading the team to two consecutive World Cups in 2014 and 2018. 
Iran will be up against USA, England, and Wales in Qatar 2022 in Group B.  Queiroz brings the experience of working across five continents with different clubs and national teams. These include Africa, Europe, North America, Asia, and South America. He left Iran in January 2019 after the team went down against Japan by 3-0 in Asian Cup Semi-Final. Defeated, Queiroz headed to Egypt, intending to take the team forward. The experience did not turn out as per his expectation, as many major players went abroad after getting picked by clubs. In club football, reputed clubs like Real Madrid and Manchester United had him for 297 matches. Queiroz worked at Manchester United as an assistant to Sir Alex Ferguson and as the head coach at Real Madrid. Iran came close to going past the first round in Russia 2018 but got short by one more goal against Portugal.
