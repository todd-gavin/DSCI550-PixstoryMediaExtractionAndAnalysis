Nehru’s Folly and the ‘Loss’ of Tibet continues...

With the increase in Chinese military activity all over India’s northern borders, more new forward posts were ordered to be opened, and on 2nd November 1961 a high-powered meeting was held, chaired by the Prime Minister himself. Pandit Nehru ‘decided that Indian forces should remain in effective occupation of the whole frontier from NEFA to Ladakh, and they should cover all gaps by setting up posts or by means of effective patrolling. No longer should the Chinese be allowed to encroach surreptitiously into our territories not occupied by Indian troops or police. He, however, ordered that our troops should not fire except in self-defence’. This policy directive has been quoted as the beginning of the ‘forward policy’ in many accounts.

Though this was not directly related to the British frontier policy with the same name, it had became a convenient descriptive name, and therefore stuck. Army HQ on December 5, 1961, issued an order regarding Ladakh to HQ Western Command in which the Command was instructed ‘to patrol as far forward as possible towards the International Border as recognized by us. 

This will be done with a view to establishing additional posts located to prevent the Chinese from advancing further and also to dominate any Chinese posts already established in our territory.’ The same instructions further stated: ‘This “forward policy” shall be carried out without getting involved in a clash with the Chinese unless it becomes necessary in self-defence.’ From now on began what the Chinese call the Indian ‘nibbling policy’ (Chinese ‘canshi zhengce’ ) in an allusion to the nibbling of mulberry leaves by silk-worms till the entire leaf is eaten.
