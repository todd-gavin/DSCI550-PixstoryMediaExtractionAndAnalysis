Donatella Versace appears on the cover of Vogue Italia and finally takes everything that has been owed to her for twenty years The Lady of fashion will always be Miuccia Prada but Donatella doesn&#39;t give a damn about being a lady The eternal Patty Pravo fan managed to become recognizable and at least as much an icon as her darling After taking over the company in following her brother&#39;s assassination she continued her brother&#39;s feminist mission by inventing new styles that instantly became new classics She took the family maison to its zenith she sold it while remaining the face and creative mind Indeed we can say that for two years now the Versace brand has been paradoxically tailored to Versace Donatella almost as if this sale had never taken place Criticisms in Donatella&#39;s case are of little interest to us because she has made her dreams come true and happy
