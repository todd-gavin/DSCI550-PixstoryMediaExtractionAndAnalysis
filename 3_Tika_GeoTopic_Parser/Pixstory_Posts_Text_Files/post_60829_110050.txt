I had made this painting long back for this fellowship I was doing at that time It was made as part of a series aimed at spreading body positivity and awareness about different body conditions that affect many people around the world Yesterday th June was observed as World Vitiligo Day This year s theme was Learning to Live with Vitiligo World Vitiligo Day was started by VR Foundation and VITSAF in The date was chosen in memorial to Michael Jackson who suffered from vitiligo as well The primary focus of the day is to raise awareness to prevent any social stigma associated with the skin condition The skin condition affects of the world population The condition occurs because there s a lack of pigment melanin which gives your skin colour in the skin It often causes white patches to form patterns on the skin There are various types causes and risk factors associated with vitiligo and reading up about the same is important It s important to educate ourselves about how the skin condition affects people in all aspects physical emotional mental and social and how to take proper care for the same Having close ones with the skin condition has made me realize how emotionally taxing it can be for them During such times it s important that we are there for them and give our unconditional support and love
