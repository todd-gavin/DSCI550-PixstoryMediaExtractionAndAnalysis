Snow falling and night falling fast oh fast In a field I looked into going past And the ground almost covered smooth in snow But a few weeds and stubble showing last The woods around it have it it is theirs All animals are smothered in their lairs I am too absent spirited to count The loneliness includes me unawares And lonely as it is that loneliness Will be more lonely ere it will be less A blanker whiteness of benighted snow With no expression nothing to express They cannot scare me with their empty spaces Between stars on stars where no human race is I have it in me so much nearer home To scare myself with my own desert places Robert Frost
