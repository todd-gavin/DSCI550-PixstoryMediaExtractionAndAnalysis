Kaafir is an underrated web series based on real events I personally like this movie because it is an inspirational to watch how a mother living in a Kashmir jail as she was declared a terrorist and spends eight years behind the bars giving birth and raising her daughter in a jail where she sees her child everyday as well behind those bars with no freedom to live just like any other child Although being deprived of all the facilities she raises her child very well She taught her Namaaz the national anthem of both India and Pakistan and taught her how to pay respect to others and this was the best part of the series for me I really like how this web series has portrayed the character of a mother that a mother can go beyond limits for her child No mother can see her child facing struggles especially in her childhood and this web series was best to showcase that
