The Eiffel Tower The world knows this monument and comes from all sides to see it When I first arrived in Paris my family and many of my friends told me to send them his photos It looked like a new tourist adventure Yet today this tower is part of my daily commute I went to see it shine after my first heartbreak in Paris Even though deep down it&#39;s just an iron structure it&#39;s a reminder of all I&#39;ve accomplished I&#39;m just smiling a bit when I cross it on my way to my internship The symbol of this city of lights
