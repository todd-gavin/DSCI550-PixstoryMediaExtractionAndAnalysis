What a lovely story Mr Howard It is amazing how people use social media to do such selfless acts of kindness With all of its problems it has been such a blessing for so many people in need It s proven to be an excellent platform for both volunteers and those in need of help It s almost as though people used to build communities to stay in and help each other without expecting anything in return The internet s simple accessibility and affordable expenses have allowed you to reach people you never thought you could In any other case for example if social media didn t exist no one would have known that someone was in need of life saving assistance but here we are Who could have thought some years ago two strangers living so apart would find each other to have a story like this Without social media there was no way of knowing that he needed this help or someone was willing to go to these lengths to help him The internet being such a rapid real time medium makes it so much easier to make something like this possible It s also incredible how people in ordinarily isolated or even inaccessible locations are able to connect to cities and seek support I ve seen innumerable examples of people particularly youngsters using social media to make a decent life for themselves For many people social media has proven to be a blessing in disguise Thank you very much for sharing this story with us It truly brightened my day People gain greater faith in mankind as a result of stories like this which we seem to be losing at an alarming rate
