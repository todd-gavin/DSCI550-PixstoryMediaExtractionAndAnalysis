Technical Nous


Frenkie de Jong is very good on the ball. Standing at 5 '11 and weighing 150 lbs, he loves to body feint. He is the perfect mixture of intelligence and physical strength and his close control with the ball poses danger for the opponents to defenders and while in possession. He is able to dribble past opponents, having a dribbling success rate of 67.8% while attempting 1.58 dribbles per game.


De Jong usually uses his first touch to progress with the ball when he is dribbling. His ability to gain extra yards without having too much of the ball. Frenkie is able to progress the ball at ease whether he is carrying the ball or passing the ball. He ranks 94 percentile in progressively carrying the ball and 6.82 per 90.He has progressively carried the ball at a distance of 4130 yards and completed a total of 179 progressive carries.

De Jong is rather good while carrying the ball into the final third. His ability to carry the ball at ease is what makes him dangerous. He ranks 94 percentile and 2.43 per 90 in carrying to the final third. He has made a total of 59 carries to the final third.
Frenkie has been recently linked with Manchester United due to   incoming Dutch boss Erik Ten Hag. Looking at Man Utd’s midfield woes he fits the bill perfectly. 


He is able to progress with the ball, pass the ball, defend for his team by tracking backwards and helping his team. His market value is 70 million pounds and he is one for the future. 


He will be a much better option in midfield over Declan Rice who is going to cost United upwards of 100 million pounds. The only caveat of the deal is that Manchester United won’t be able to provide him Champions League football. 

Will Frenkie be a red devil, a Bavarian or Cityzen or will he still be  a Catalan? It remains to be seen.
