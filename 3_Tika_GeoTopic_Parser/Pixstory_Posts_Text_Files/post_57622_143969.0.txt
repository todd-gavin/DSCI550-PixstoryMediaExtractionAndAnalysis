Roger Federer's retirement announcement surprises everyone who wishes to see him playing for many more years.
Federer, along with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, are undoubtedly some tennis stars that no one would want to lose, but now the retirement news has brought all the sadness.
In an audio message posted on social media, he said, "I am 41 years old; I have played more than 1,500 matches over 24 years. Tennis has treated me more generously than I ever would have dreamed, and now I must recognize when it is time to end my competitive career."
He would be making his final appearance in London at the Laver Cup, "the annual team event he helped create as part of his legacy to the game that he once ruled alone before the emergence of Nadal and Djokovic shifted the balance of power."
