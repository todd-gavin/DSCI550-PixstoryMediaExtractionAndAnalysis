Excuse me, what? Do you really think people are choosing to die on the streets just because they don't want to work? Or do you not know the unemployment rates in America?

This is not the first time I'm hearing this reasoning but I am never not surprised just how absurd it is every single time this reason is used. Are people really that hard in the head?

Why do you think somebody with a job should not have a house? What exactly do you draw this conclusion from? Like, under what circumstances is "life" legal? It's crazy how life is SO IMPORTANT to the right wing of our country that all of them are collectively against abortion, but they have no craps to give about what happens to the same lives when they're on the streets.

What happens to the disabled population who can't work? Should they never have a home? Or children? So many children are homeless, do they need to go out and do some labor in order to deserve a roof over their head? What exactly does this logic imply? Homelessness is a product of other human rights abuses such as poverty, violence and a lack of affordable housing. Not a "choice".
