My yearning for peace,
Lead me to wanderlust. 
I stared at the skies,
Roamed through woods,
Still couldn't find peace. 
I sailed down the rivers,
Climbed up hills,
Still couldn't find peace.
I flew with birds,
Crawled with turtles,
Still couldn't find peace. 
My wanderlust continued, 
And I yearned for;
Peace.peace.peace.
