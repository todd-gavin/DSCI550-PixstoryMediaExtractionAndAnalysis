We are approaching the two-month mark since the Philadelphia 76ers traded Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Andre Drummond and two first-round picks to the Brooklyn Nets for James Harden. Simmons has not yet played for the Nets, and somehow we are left wondering if the Sixers would take a mulligan on the trade.

Harden is not the same top-three MVP candidate he was for four straight seasons from 2016-20, when his general manager informed us, "It's just factual that James Harden is a better scorer than Michael Jordan."

That same executive, Daryl Morey, left Houston for Philadelphia in 2020, spent his first two seasons with the 76ers trying to reunite with Harden and succeeded at this year's trade deadline. Morey either ignored Harden's production in the meantime or felt confident the 10-time All-Star was sandbagging the rest of us.

From 2016-20, 28.4 of Harden's league-leading 32.4 points per game (55.4 effective field-goal percentage) came inside of 8 feet, on pull-up 3-pointers or at the free-throw line. He was a one-man offense, spending possessions breaking down his defender off the dribble, looking for a step into a layup or out to a jumper.

Losing a step is a bigger deal when one in either direction was your signature.

Harden's points from inside of 8 feet, pull-up 3s and free throws are down to 19.5 per game (49.6 eFG%) this season. Of the 294 players who have attempted at least 200 shots inside of 8 feet, Harden's 48.8% success rate ranks 273rd, right between Devonte' Graham and Dennis Smith Jr. Among the 72 players who have attempted at least 100 pull-up 3s, Harden's 33.7% shooting ranks 39th. His free throws, which had risen to 11.8 per game in 2019-20 — the most by a guard since Jordan's 11.9 in 1986-87, are down to 8.3.

Where once Harden was a historic foul-drawing machine and an exceptional scoring guard at high volume from both beyond the arc and at the rim, he is now a mere mortal at getting to the free-throw line, a below-average shooter from distance and a poor finisher around the basket. That combination is a slippery slope.
