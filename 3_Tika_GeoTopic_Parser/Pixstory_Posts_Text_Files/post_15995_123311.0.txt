Abstract

Hydrogel products for chronic diabetic wounds, a serious and prevalent complication of diabetes, show limited effects on disability and remain nonspecific. Thus, improvements in the usage of pharmaceutical molecule in the hydrogels are highly desirable to increase the therapeutic effect of hydrogels. In this study, thioctic acid (a common medicine molecule in diabetes treatment) is used for preparing regenerative antibacterial hydrogels (RAH) which contains in situ synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The RAH shows regenerative, self-healing and injectable ability, because of the reversible hydrogen and coordination bonds. With good regenerative capacity, RAH can be stored as powder to avoid the water loss and facilitate storage availability. Owing to the antioxidant properties of thioctic acid, the RAH can decrease the oxidative damage and retain cell proliferation efficiency. Due to the in situ synthesized AgNPs, the RAH also exhibits extraordinary antimicrobial capacities against MDR bacteria. All of these superiorities enable RAH to be a promising therapy for chronic diabetic wounds.
