Recently, the California State Assembly passed a bill establishing California as a "refuge" state for transgender children and their parents facing discrimination in other states â€“ discrimination being denied access to a sex change (or "gender-affirming" procedures, as they call them) and facing criminal prosecution for the decisions they make regarding their children.

In short, the bill would reject out-of-state court orders mandating the removal of parental rights due to a transgender-related situation, and it would bar the arrest and extradition of anyone who broke other state laws relating to giving or permitting someone to have a sex change.

It is frightening to think that a person who flagrantly violates the law by providing a child with a sex change may escape to California and find asylum without fear of prosecution. Why has this become an exception when we do not do this with other laws? States should not use their authority to overrule criminal judgements made by other states. This is a blatant misuse of power that fosters divisiveness among states that should be united.
