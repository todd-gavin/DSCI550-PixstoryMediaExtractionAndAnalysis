Do you feel like you will always be "the girl
with acne"? 

Are you exhausted, mentally drained, and
defeated after you look in the mirror or see a picture of
yourself?

This was me.

For so many years I was in a constant state of stress
worried about my skin and skincare routine, and had a
deeply embedded negative mindset.

Through years of mindset work, I feel like I am finally free from the shackles of my skin. I refer to this a lot as acne freedom- Where I no longer let it run my life, or let it consume my every thought!

Why on earth am I wasting precious moments and energy stressing about acne! Seriously! I am SO much more than that girl with acne.
