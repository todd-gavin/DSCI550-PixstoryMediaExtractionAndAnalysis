Attacking woes continue for Manchester United The Red Devils failed to score at home even though they had a few big chances in the game Their best chance fell to Jadon Sancho who couldn t convert after Bruno Fernandes found him with an acute ball Raphael Varane had a glorious chance in the second half as well But the Frenchman could only fire his header near Oblak who pulled off a fabulous stop The Red Devils have now won just one out of their last five games in all competitions Atletico Madrid keep Cristiano Ronaldo silent Diego Simeone s side managed to keep the Portuguese striker silent in both the legs Hence this proved the biggest positive for Atletico as Cristiano Ronaldo has haunted him in the past Ronaldo has previously scored two hat tricks against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League But the football icon was not even able to take a single shot against the Spanish team this time around Atletico Madrid show a professional display Los Rojiblancos played out a professional game against their opponents at Old Trafford Following Renan Lodi s goal in the first half Diego Simeone changed his team s entire gameplay Atletico Madrid played a more defensive style of football in the second half Questionable substitutions from Ralf Rangnick The German manager brought in the likes of Mata and Matic in the second half But he took out Bruno Fernandes and Fred who were playing very well in the game With goals needed taking out Bruno Fernandes was a questionable decision The Portuguese midfielder is easily one of the most creative players on the team Hence this cost Ralf Rangnick dearly Will Manchester United return to the Champions League next season The Red Devils are currently out of the top four in the Premier League Hence it is very likely that they could miss out on the Champions League bus for next season Arsenal are currently the favourites to secure the fourth place in the league Mikel Arteta s side have a three game advantage over United Hence it has to be seen if Ralf Rangnick can lead them back to the Champions League or not
