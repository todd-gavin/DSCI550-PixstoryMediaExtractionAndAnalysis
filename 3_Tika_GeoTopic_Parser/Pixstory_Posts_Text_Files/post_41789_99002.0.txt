Daniel Faalele recently made news after becoming the latest Australian to be picked into the multibillion-dollar NFL. The five Australian women who had already become among the first to play in the women's semi-professional equivalent created fewer waves. 

The Guardian reported that the newly formed US Women's National Football Conference (WNFC) is the NFL's female counterpart. There are 17 teams around the country, and the women play the same full-contact, 11-a-side game that has Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes supporters enthralled.

“You do get comments like, ‘oh why are you doing that to your body?’,” says Renae ‘Red’ Hahn, a gridiron player of 10 years who moved from Sydney in February to play for WNFC team the Mississippi Lady Panthers.

“I’ve been in corporate offices and had bruises on my arms and people say, ‘Why are you doing that to your body, darling?’ I’m like, ‘you don’t say that to old mate over there who’s playing rugby’.”

Hahn, 30, is smashing glass ceilings across the Pacific as part of Mississippi’s new Global Panthers Program. She and her four Australian teammates – Liuanga Halaifonua Palu (30), Hayley Tagaloa-Smith (30), Amanda Howsan (36) and Shiloh Phillips (29) – were drafted to the Panthers after playing at Australia’s highest representative levels in the annual Australian national championships, and the International Federation of American Football (IFAF) World Championships.
