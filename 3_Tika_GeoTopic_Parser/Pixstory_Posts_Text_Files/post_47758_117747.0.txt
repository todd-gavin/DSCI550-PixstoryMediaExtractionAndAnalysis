New Delhi: Initially, when Navneet Shetty, co-founder of The Hemp Factory, told his family and friends about his plans to partner with the Bombay Hemp Company (BOHECO) and set up The Hemp Factory, he was not taken seriously. “My parents and friends thought we (the founders) had lost our minds and are selling psychoactive drugs! We had to make them understand the difference between marijuana (psychoactive) and hemp (non-psychoactive) which is legal now under the Food Safety and Security Authority of India (FSSAI),” he remembers.

Established in April 2022, The Hemp Factory (THF) is India’s first cloud kitchen brand serving exclusive hemp-infused foods. It has partnered with BOHECO and the chief goal is to introduce hemp foods and derivatives into the dietary lifestyle of people. “We believe in the power of hemp, a 9,000-year-old plant native to the Himalayas. Being an extraordinarily sustainable and nutritious plant, it is an upcoming juggernaut in the health and nutritional space. Essentially, hemp is a miracle resource empowering modern-day lifestyle by providing you with wholesome nutrition,” says Shetty.

As of November 15, 2021, the FSSAI issued a notification that hemp seeds, oil and flour shall be sold as food ingredient as long as it conforms to their standards. “Until recently hemp was primarily used in the medical industry. But now, consuming food made of hemp is perfectly legal and safe! Since hemp has tremendous nutritional benefits, we wanted to introduce this super-food to the masses,” adds Shetty. The supply of hemp leaves is, however, controlled by the government, with only a handful of companies having an Ayush licence to manufacture hemp that’s supplied to retailers.
