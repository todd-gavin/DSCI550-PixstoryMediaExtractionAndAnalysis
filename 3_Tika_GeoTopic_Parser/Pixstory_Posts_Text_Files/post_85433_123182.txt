A complete day dedicated to honouring and praising one of humanity s oldest and most cherished companions the cat is known as International Cat Day Any cat would likely agree that every day should be designated as a day to honour cats worldwide if they were to humble themselves to speak with a mere human But humans have set aside this particular day every year specifically for that purpose International Cat Day is arrived No matter the nation or temperature there is a good chance that every extended family has an aunt who has more kittens than ex husbands due to the estimated million cats thought to be lazing in neighbours gardens worldwide And that s fantastic because studies have shown that having a cat can reduce stress anxiety and depression So on International Cat Day any black ginger Persian Siamese Burmese Bengal Shorthair Munchkin Balinese RagaMuffin or any old stray cat will do the trick when it s pouring cats and dogs outside and there is no one to cuddle with Source DOY
