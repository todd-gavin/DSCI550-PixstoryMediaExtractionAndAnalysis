I loved Dabangg Salman Khan s portrayal of chulbul pandey was fantastic It has all the elements of a classic masala film done right Chulbul s comedic timing action scenes the conversations of the supporting cops in the background his relationship with his step father were very engaging Plus Sonakshi sinha as rajjo and Sonu sood as the antagonist were the cherry on top Not to mention the movie s album has such beautiful songs
