M Venkaiah Naidu, a former vice president, stated on Friday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should meet with party leaders more frequently to help clear up any "misunderstandings" the opposition parties may have regarding his strategies.
Speaking at the publication of a book on the Prime Minister's speeches, Mr. Naidu praised him for his accomplishments in a variety of fields, including technology, foreign policy, and healthcare, and claimed that the world was now recognising India's development.
"India is now a power to be reckoned with, and the world now hears its voice. It is unusual for something so brief to happen. This is due to his acts, the direction he is providing to the populace, and the advancements India is making, Naidu remarked following the publication of the book "Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas - Prime Minister Narendra Modi Speaks (May 2019-May 2020)" ".
Naidu claimed that despite the Prime Minister's accomplishments, some groups continue to be sceptical of his approaches "due to some misunderstandings, possibly as a result of some political compulsions."
