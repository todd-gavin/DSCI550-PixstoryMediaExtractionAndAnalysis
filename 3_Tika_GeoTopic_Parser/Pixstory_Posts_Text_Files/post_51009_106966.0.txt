Your Guide to Tucking Your Shirt In Properly

The Front Tuck:
The front tuck or half tuck is probably the most popular and easy option when it comes to tucking in your shirt. The goal is to not have a super tight tuck but also not too much fabric out.

Do —front tuck when you have a thinner top that is not too long paired with mid to high rise pants or a skirt. Front tucks are most typically done casually with jeans though not out of the question with other items.

Don’t —front tuck with a thick top that will create a pouch effect in the front because it doesn’t tuck nicely. The only caveat to this is if you have a cropped sweater that will easily tuck. 

The Full Tuck:
In practice, I fully tuck in my shirt less than I do a half tuck/front tuck. When considering when to tuck and not tuck your shirt, I typically reserve this for dressier occasions. This might be when I want to look more tailored for work.

Do— a full tuck for a tailed look with a high waisted bottom and slim top or when the waistline calls for it.
Don’t —do a full tuck with a low waist or a chunky top.

Don’t Tuck – Leave Your Shirt Untucked:
Sometimes the best thing to do is nothing! Don’t tuck your shirt at all leaving it untucked and loose. The reasons for this would be if the shirt has a specific hem like a peplum, a band at the bottom Another reason not to tuck would be a long tunic made to be worn out or a peasant style blouse

Do —leave your blouse untucked when the shape is made to be that way.
Don’t —tuck when your pants are lower rise and will accentuate your hips.
