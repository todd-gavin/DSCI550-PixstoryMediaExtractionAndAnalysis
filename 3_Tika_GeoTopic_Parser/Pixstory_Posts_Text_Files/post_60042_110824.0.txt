The lookalike of  Drake, also known as "Fake Drake," has declared his desire to compete in a boxing match against the actual rapper.

The lookalike made headlines recently for showing up at several occasions intended to trick the audience into thinking he is the multi-platinum-selling Canadian star, including nightclub appearances.

I'm challenging Drake to a boxing battle," "Fake Drake" claimed on the We In Miami show. With Celebrity Boxing, I recently signed up. I'll go by just Izzy instead of Izzy Drake if you win.

Izzy is requesting $1 million from Drake and a record deal with Drake's record label OVO in exchange for defeating the rapper because "I'm just trying to feed my family" he mentioned.

Despite booking a number of public events based on his alleged visual similar to the rapper, "Fake Drake" openly declared that his style and character are all his own.
