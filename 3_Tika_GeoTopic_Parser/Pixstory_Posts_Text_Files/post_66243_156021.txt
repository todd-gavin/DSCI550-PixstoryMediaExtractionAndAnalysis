While it may not be as flashy refined or impressive as the rest of the films in the franchise Sorcerer s Stone or Philosopher s Stone for the Potter purists deserves immense credit for setting up this series so wonderfully and laying a fantastic foundation off of which the other films could be built Director Chris Columbus was not only responsible for putting together the incredible cast but he also captured Rowling s wizarding world on film in a manner that felt relatable and wholly transfixing Sorcerer s Stone is told through the eyes of an year old and so the film was always going to skew a bit younger than subsequent installments but Columbus refuses to talk down to his audience and wisely sidesteps delving into cartoony kids movie land And even though it s tonally the lightest film of the bunch Sorcerer s Stone still works wonderfully as a fantastic entry in the Potter franchise The winning combination of charm and smarts permeates throughout and Columbus nails the founding friendship of our three heroes culminating in a grand finale that lets each one of them shine Who can resist adorable Ron Weasley commanding a giant chess set with gusto as he sits atop a stone knight
