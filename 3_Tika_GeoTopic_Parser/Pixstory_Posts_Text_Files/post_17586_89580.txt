There are many reasons the Los Angeles Lakers have struggled this season but perhaps at the top of the list is the number of games Anthony Davis has missed due to injury Davis has played just games this season first missing time due to an MCL sprain in his knee and then most recently with a mid foot sprain after landing on Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert s foot while battling for a rebound The injury happened on Feb so Davis has been out for more than a month now although a return seems to be on the horizon Davis was recently cleared to do some on court shooting and it seems that his workload is increasing with each passing day as he ramps up for a potential late season return According to Dave McMenamin of ESPN Davis is targeting the first week of April for his return If everything continues to progress well in Davis rehab the All Star big man could be suiting up for games by the first week of April at the earliest sources told ESPN Frank Vogel also gave an update on Davis before Wednesday s game against the Philadelphia ers supporting the report that a return could be near It s really just he s getting evaluated on a daily basis based on the amount of work he did the day prior Vogel said Not like imaging and things like that Just how is it responding to the increased workload and he s coming along really well At this point it s safe to say that any championship hopes the Lakers have rest on Davis getting healthy in time for the playoffs The team has struggled greatly without him going and not winning back to back games since January
