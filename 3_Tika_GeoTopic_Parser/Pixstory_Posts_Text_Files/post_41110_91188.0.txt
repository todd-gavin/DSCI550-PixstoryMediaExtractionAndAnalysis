The Black Lives Matter movement is still a work in progress, but many Catholics believe the church should be willing to look at, talk about, and even participate where possible in order to take a close look at racism and try to find a positive path forward.

The Tablet reported that Bishop Edward K. Braxton, now retired bishop of Belleville, Illinois, wrote a pastoral letter in 2016 titled "The Catholic Church and the Black Lives Matter Movement: The Racial Divide in the United States Revisited," in which he acknowledges the church's conflict with the Black Lives Matter movement in terms of church teaching on abortion, sexuality, gender identity, and other issues. 

In an interview with Catholic News Service, he emphasised that the Second Vatican Council encourages dialogue with people and groups who have opposing viewpoints. 

As Chaz Muth has pointed out, when it comes to Catholic engagement with Black Lives Matter, several leaders agree that separating the larger movement from problematic organisations bearing the name is a good place to start.

During the height of Floyd's death protests in 2020, then-Bishop Shelton J. Fabre of Houma-Thibodaux, Louisiana, told The Catholic Spirit, the archdiocesan newspaper of St. Paul and Minneapolis, that the phrase "Black lives matter" fits within Catholic social teaching about the value of each person and "places before us this reality that Black lives have not always been afforded intrinsic and equal value." 

Many Catholics who have participated in Black Lives Matter-affiliated rallies have stated that their goal was simple: to protest police use of lethal force against Black people and to demand reform. They claim that subjects that alarm other Catholics about Black Lives Matter — Marxism, transgender ideology, and even support for abortion legalisation — aren't discussed.
