Many North Americans plan to travel this summer to catch up on lost experiences, following two years of COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions. This so-called revenge travel has the potential to raise the number of drownings, as more people choose to enter the water, even when the conditions aren’t ideal.

Recent history shows that every time government lockdowns were lifted across North America, people flocked to the nearest beach, often their only opportunity for an impromptu vacation. Despite travel restrictions, the Great Lakes region had a greater-than-expected number of fatal drownings in 2020.

A combination of reduced funding to lifeguarding programs, cancelled swimming lessons, large beach crowds, warm weather, high-water levels and self-isolation fatigue all contributed to the increased number of fatalities.

A new Smart Beach pilot program on Lake Huron, in Kincardine, Ont., will help beachgoers stay safe. Smart Beach uses innovative technologies to collect and analyze water and weather conditions to provide beachgoers with real-time information on local water conditions, including rough surf and rip currents.

The cost of drownings

Rough surf and nearshore currents are associated with approximately 50 drowning fatalities per year in the Great Lakes. Boys and men under the age of 24 make up a disproportionate number of those fatalities, and most occur on unsupervised beaches or during periods where lifeguards and other active warning systems are absent.
