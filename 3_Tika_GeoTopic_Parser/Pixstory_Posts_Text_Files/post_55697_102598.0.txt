The Black Lives Matter movement has raised serious concerns about the extent to which racism exists in the criminal justice system. 

Its message resonated around the world, with people in Canada, France, the United Kingdom, and Australia identifying with the same issues raised by BLM supporters in the United States â€“ that criminal justice systems in their respective states exhibit systemic bias in police response, with cascading effects on minority groups' physical, social, political, and psychological well-being. 

As per UNAA, While the causes of these systemic issues are complicated and may vary depending on cultural context, many Australians have seen similarities between Australia's and the United States' criminal justice systems.

Similar incidents have been reported by Black Lives Matter in Australia, adding to a growing body of evidence of widespread police wrongdoing and discrimination. Since 1991, 437 Indigenous people have died in detention, according to the Guardian's Deaths Inside database.

Since the Royal Commission's recommendation that "imprisonment be utilised as a discipline of last resort," 338 Indigenous people have died in detention 

Veronica Marie Nelson Walker, 37, was caught for stealing in 2020 and held in maximum security, where she was found dead three days later, according to BLM activists in Australia.

The BLM movement draws upon the representation and the instances of deaths in custody in the U.S. and Australia to demonstrate the significance of this issue across borders.
