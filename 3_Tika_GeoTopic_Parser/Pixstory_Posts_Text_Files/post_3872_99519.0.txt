I’ll tell you outset—I hate the summer season. There’s almost nothing to like about the endlessly warm and muggy days of Delhi in the summertime. But, because the summer season makes up the bulk of the year in the city where I’ve always lived, I have no choice but to make my peace with it. 

Here are some of my preferred summertime activities:

— Savouring a range of cooling beverages: iced cold brew coffee, aam panna, fresh lime soda, lemongrass iced tea 

— Eating mango and mango-based dessert! 

— Reading a book in a cool and quiet library 

— Sitting at an indoor cafe with a good view 

— Occasional getaways to the mountains
