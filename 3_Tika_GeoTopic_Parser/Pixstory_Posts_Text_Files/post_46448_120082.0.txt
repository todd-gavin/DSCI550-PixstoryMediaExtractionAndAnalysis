She is last to the table 🥺
She is busy making sure everyone has what they need . ❤️

She is last out to the car . 
She has been searching for missing shoes and hurrying to get everyone else ready . ❤️🥺

Often , she is last to get to whatever she is doing .
She has got good intentions , but she is getting used to being late . 👩‍👧

Yet , when you ask her children who's always been there ; their cheerleader ; their safe place .... ❤️👩‍👧

Her name comes first ! ❤️

When the world looks around and notice the most influential voice in the live of the next generation ....

Her name comes first ! ❤️

When it's been a hard day , 
And her family needs someone who will listen with compassion and grace ... 🥺❤️

Her name comes first ! 👩‍👧❤️

" Hey Mom " 🥺❤️

You are perfect , 
You are messy and frustrated ,
But you keeps getting back up , 
And you keeps going , 
You keeps giving ! 🥺❤️

You are doing such a good Work , ohh mom !! 🧿❤️👩‍👧

You may not hear a ' thankyou ' today but one day you will .. ❤️👩‍👧

Love you Mom 🥺❤️👑👩‍👧
