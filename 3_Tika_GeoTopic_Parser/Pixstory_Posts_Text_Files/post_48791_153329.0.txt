At the end of the month, the Supreme Court will hear two cases challenging the racial admissions practises of Harvard University and the University of North Carolina.
Students for Fair Admissions, the plaintiff in both instances, is requesting that the Supreme Court reverse its previous ruling (Grutter v. Bollinger), which permits the limited use of race in college admissions decisions.
The Supreme Court has experience handling cases similar to these. The high court previously upheld that race and ethnicity can be taken into account in the college admissions process at the University of Texas and the University of Michigan Law School in cases from 2003 and 2016.
However, the Supreme Court's composition has substantially changed during the administration of Donald Trump, and the court currently has a six-to-three conservative majority. Although the case's verdict is anticipated before next summer, educational institutions are preparing for a potential alteration to their admissions procedure.
The last term came to a close with contentious decisions that eliminated the right to abortion, undermined the effort to combat climate change, expanded the right to carry firearms, increased the role of religion in schools, questioned the requirement that workers receive the Covid-19 vaccination, and reduced the authority of federal agencies.
The three progressives lost to the court's six conservative justices. It's pretty obvious where the US is headed, and it's heading their fast.
