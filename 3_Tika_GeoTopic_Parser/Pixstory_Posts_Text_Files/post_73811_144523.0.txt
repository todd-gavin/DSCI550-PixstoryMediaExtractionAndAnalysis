Remember the days when you used to listen to songs on 9XM ? Had to wait for your favourite song to come 😂 and put whatever task you were doing at hold till the song finished? 
Those were the days , relive the moment with this beautiful ❤️ song from Jannat 2 . If you were a music lover then guess you would remember the lyrics by heart. The song is simply marvellous.
