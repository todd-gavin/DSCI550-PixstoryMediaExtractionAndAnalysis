Jujutsu Kaisen vol 0 released in india today in PVR cinemas and your girl caught on to it on the first day itself.
My rating ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Even 5 stars can't describe my experience
First of all, it was in sub (Japanese audio with English subtitles) that's a win-win
And i had literal goosebumps on all the fight scenes, it was that good.
This was the first anime movie ever that I watched in theatre and I'll remember it forever!!♾️
Demon slayer: mugen train was released in India too but they didn't release it in my hometown and it was released in English dub so I wasn't pumped up about it either ways but this one was crazy 🤌🤌
