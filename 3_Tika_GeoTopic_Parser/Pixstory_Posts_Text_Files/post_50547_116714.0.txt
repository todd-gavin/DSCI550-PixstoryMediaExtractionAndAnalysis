Well...last few years everything went online😪.I got into college and since Covid was there we could not meet each other. So all the communications went through WhatsApp and social media. 🤗
I started making friends with people whom I never ever met in real. But when I met them in real, they complimented me that I am way more sweet and generous as they previously thought I was rude and egoistic.🫣 I was shocked after listening to them 😶as I always tried to be nice with everyone and then I understand that people interpret WhatsApp messages with their own perception and since I don't use emojis much, they interpret in an other way. 🙆🤷

So now when I text 🤗I make sure to put emojis as it can actually tell you with what consent someone is talking to you.🌝
