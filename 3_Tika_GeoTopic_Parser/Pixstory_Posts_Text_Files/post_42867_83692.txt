Friday th February It s early morning in the UK and I wake up and read the news to find the stories and updates surrounding the Russian invasion of Ukraine My only thought is how one man can make a decision that will affect millions across the world How do these people get in power positions they hold not just in Russia but across the whole world Here is my take on political figures Why do countries and civilians allow for political figures to dictate and decide the fate of their future Whether left right or in the middle we vote for the person who represents our views the most yet how many times are these views changed while in power These figures ultimately make decisions based on their own and individual judgement with guidance from those around who are placed in these positions by said figures How are we in a democratic country when the say we have means nothing once there is a political figure in place Across the world there have been demonstrations against leaders and opposing their decisions With Russian entering Ukraine there is another leader sending thousands to their death for his own ego or personal judgement It s clear that the democratic system in place doesn t work for many The public become alienated by those in power and their surrounding group There must be a better way to run a country which enables everyone to have a voice Politics is a mess worldwide We ve advanced from monarchs ruling countries and in most cases dictatorships but the general public still lack any control
