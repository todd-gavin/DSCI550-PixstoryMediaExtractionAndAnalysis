Here are some of my favourite moments from the book, i read this an year ago but its still one of my favs. It is the second part of the kiss quotient series, but can be read as a standalone. I read the kiss quotient first and then the bride test. And now I can't decide which couple I like more? Michael and Stella or Esme and Khai ðŸ˜Œ
