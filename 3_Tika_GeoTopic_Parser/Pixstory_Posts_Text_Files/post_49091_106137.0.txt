Never before in American media and politics have words like White Nationalists, White Supremacists, Women of Color, and Black vs White been used so openly. To become a champion of racial equality, the Democrats use racial tones. They distract you from real issues so that they can make you a part of their propaganda and take you away from your American roots, make you oppose your American heritage. Every right-winger who isn't a neocon is labelled as a Neo-Nazi, white supremacist, and so on. Every conservative or nationalist is portrayed negatively, and the majority of the content on these platforms is slanderous. We don't have much time before they take over, we need to strengthen our roots now.
