The Italian champions Milan restart with a victory but the home success for Udinese also showed some weaknesses on which the coach Stefano Pioli will have to work on At the end of the game the Rossoneri coach analyzed the game like this I didn&#39;t like conceding the goal after a while we have to start the games better Then we played half an hour of great football against a very dangerous and physical opponent We take away many positive things and many to work on as normal given the period In view of the next game an already important test against Atalanta Pioli underlines the aspects that need to be improved We conceded two goals from set pieces we needed to work much better We will review everything and deal with these situations better Sometimes we are more determined when we defend ourselves high up instead of in front of our penalty area This is a serious mistake And we cannot we have to repeat it next Sunday against an opponent like Atalanta
