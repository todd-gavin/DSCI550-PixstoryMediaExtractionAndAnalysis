Jammu and Kashmir Lt Governor Manoj Sinha on Friday performed the “Samapan Pooja” marking the end of the annual Shri Amarnath Yatra.
The pilgrimage began on June 30 during which more than 3 lakh people visited the cave shrine.
“I truly admire and appreciate the selfless contribution of all stakeholders and citizens for making this difficult Yatra hassle-free for the pilgrims,” the Lt Governor said.
The Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board facilitated the carriage of the Holy Mace (Pavitra Chhari) to the shrine.
