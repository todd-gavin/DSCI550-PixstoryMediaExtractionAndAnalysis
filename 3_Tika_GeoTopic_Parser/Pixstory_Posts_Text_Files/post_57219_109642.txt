Being a man myself I would completely agree with the idea that men should equally be a part of the movement As every responsible man should hear and adhere to this we are equally associated with an unwanted pregnancy foisted upon a woman If they could rally or rant about their rights then the least someone could do is to support them and instead become a part of it It would not become this treacherous if the both of them joined the hands in the fight Moreover if we speak of political change it could only be brought if we have more people talking and fighting for it American women in politics don t hold much power they are of the population in the U S but makeup only of Congress at large of the U S Senate of the U S House of Representatives of presidents of the United States of statewide elected executives of any kind of state legislators of the largest cities mayors of mayors in cities with populations over While the men make most of it nevertheless keeping political numbers aside we still get another point how every men s voice would transform or change the mind of all the other lawmakers and political decision makers who are men So the involvement of men in the movement and the fight for abortion rights could have improved the situation
