The mix between the African heat in great anticipation and the scarce availability of water due to the prolonged drought risks causing the crops in the field to go haywire as noted by Coldiretti Lombardia with reference to the Hannibal anticyclone which is bringing typically summer temperatures in mid-May to a so far it has recorded halved rainfall Special observation corn explains Coldiretti Lombardy which is starting its growth A delicate phase in which Coldiretti specifies with temperatures above centigrade degrees the plant goes into blockage to avoid dehydration If we add to this the difficulties of irrigation that farmers are forced to face due to lack of water, there is a risk that the normal development of cultivation and therefore of production will be compromised. A similar situation for wheat continues the regional Coldiretti which is instead in the final stage of growth months of says Coldiretti on Arpa Lombardia data, millimeters of rainfall have accumulated on our territories less than in the same period last year. The result continues Coldiretti that in Lombardy the water resources currently stored in the large lakes in artificial reservoirs and in the form of snow are lower than the average for the period The level of the river Po at the Ponte della Becca Pavia according to an analysis by Coldiretti has dropped to meters below the hydrometric zero, lower than on August 15 a year ago The largest Italian river is practically unrecognizable with a large expanse of sand that occupies most of the bed of the river which is fundamental for the ecosystem of the Po valley where, due to the lack of water, Coldiretti is threatened by more than half of the national agricultural production and half of the breeding that give rise to the Italian food valley known in Worldwide
