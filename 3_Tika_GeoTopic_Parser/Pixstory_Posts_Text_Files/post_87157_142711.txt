Marcus Rashford Aaron Wan Bissaka and Donny Van de Beek did not take part in training today ahead of Manchester United s Europa League fixture tomorrow This was reported by Simon Stone and it remains to be seen if the players are not taking part in sessions due to injury concerns There is also a possibility that they are undergoing private training with individual programmes but in regards to Marcus Rashford he did appear to limp off as he was substituted in the second half Donny Van de Beek has once again hardly featured for Manchester United this season and it will be interesting to see if he is eventually given an opportunity to impress under Ten hag who he knows from his time at Ajax In a press conference while he was at Ajax Ten Hag stated it was a mortal sin committed by United for not giving Van de Beek opportunities Of course it is still early days for Ten Hag at Manchester United and it seems he is prioritising results which is the right thing to do It may be better for him to continue this winning streak further and then slowly start to integrate Van de Beek into the side which will be a smoother transition for the player also Aaron Wan Bissaka is also struggling for gametime as Diogo Dalot seems to have won the battle for the right back spot and Is Ten Hag s preferred man However we have seen the Dutchman bring Wan Bissaka on towards the end of games to provide defensive solidity to the backline and in all them matches the right back performed the role well and helped make sure the clean sheet was intact Both Van de Beek and Wan Bissaka will hope to get minutes for United in the Europa League therefore hopefully for their sake they do not suffer from any injuries
