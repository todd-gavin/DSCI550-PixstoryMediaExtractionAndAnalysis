For me home is a place where all your memories belong it is a place where you developed yourself it is a place where you see the joys and sorrows of your life it is a place where your loved ones exist when the world gives up on you it stand by you You know what i mean A home can be anything a school a college an office a temple a friend s house or an individual s house as well It is a place where you live life hardships ups and downs which heeled your pains and made you comfortable and the better man everyday I think i am getting dramatic but it is true
