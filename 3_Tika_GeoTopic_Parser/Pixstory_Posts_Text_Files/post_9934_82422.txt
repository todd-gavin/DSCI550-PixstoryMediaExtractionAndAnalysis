A woman enters a clothing store Suddenly her eyes fall on a poor man who looks at the clothes through the shop window The lady called the man and asked the shop owner for permission to enter the shop and the poor man entered the shop And the lady asked the owner of the shop to let the poor man choose the clothes he wanted The poor man looked very shyly at the children s clothes and at the same time the lady supervised him Later he told the salesman to bring two kinds of children s clothes The poor man after taking the clothes he wanted and thanking the lady very much left the shop and the lady got up and went to pay for the clothes Suddenly she saw that the bell was white and in one corner of it It is written by the owner of the shop that we do not have an arithmetic machine that calculates the price and value of humanity Note The more charity and charity increase the more sustenance increases The more humility and submission in prayer the greater the happiness And the more it is on the parents the more success in life is gained
