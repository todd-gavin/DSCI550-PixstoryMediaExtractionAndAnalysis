Xabi Alonso appointed as Bayer Leverkusen head coach
The Former Real Madrid and Bayern Munich Legend Xabi Alonso is appointed as the head coach of the club Bayer Leverkusen ( Bundesliga - Germany) 
Xabi alonso said...
“I know Leverkusen as an excellent club from my time in Germany. Bayer Leaverkusen has always had great players, I also see a lot of quality in the current squad. This task excites me a lot,”
The club sacked former head coach Gerardo Seoane after Tuesday’s 2-0 defeat to Porto in the UEFA Champions League.
The team has also seen a dismal start to the new season in Bundesliga, having won just one out of its eight games so far. Leverkusen sits in 17th spot and has conceded 16 goals.
“The separation is not easy for us. However, in our current situation, we see no other option” 
Fernando Carro said this on sacking the former manager Seoane.
The head coach role at Bayer Leverkusen will be Alonso’s first senior team role. The former midfielder has worked as a youth coach at Real Madrid and as a manager of Real Sociedad B.
Thank you ⚽
