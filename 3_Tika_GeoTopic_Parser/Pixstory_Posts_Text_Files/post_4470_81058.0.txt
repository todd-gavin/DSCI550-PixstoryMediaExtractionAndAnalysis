The question of whether Hijabs oppress women or not is a completely different one! These women are being forbidden from universities not because they believe Hijabs are a tool of oppression, but rather to eliminate the visibility of their religion. They don't do it to free these women; they do it to effectively outlaw their religion. 
They are unconcerned about their liberation from oppression. And anyone who uses the "Hijabs oppress women" argument as an excuse for this is doing more harm than they realise. 

Why are there conversations about what the hijab means here? The conversation should be, girls were denied their right to education as well as religious expression. What the hijab means is defined by the wearer. 

Some wear it as a symbol of their closeness to God, some wear it to defy unrealistic euro-centric beauty standards, some wear it for cultural expression, some wear it for modesty, some wear it for comfort, some wear it because it is a connection for them with the Muslim women who came before us, some wear it because their God tells them to and ofc some wear it because they are forced (which I do not advocate for). 

What a thing means to someone should be decided by the person wearing the thing.

Discussion of what belongs on someone else's body again is just "you are oppressed, let me save you" type of talk. 

Let me decide which practice is oppressing me and which isn't?
