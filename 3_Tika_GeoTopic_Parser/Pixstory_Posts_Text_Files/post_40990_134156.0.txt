Ask a classic-movie fan what they think of actor Fredric March, who starred in acclaimed films like Inherit the Wind, The Best Years of Our Lives, and the 1937 version of A Star Is Born, and it's likely that they'll respond with generally effusive praise for the Academy Award-winning performer and his work both on and off-screen. 

Hollywood Reporter said that due to two separate decisions made in recent years to remove March's name from two performing-arts theatres at two campuses of the University of Wisconsin, March's alma mater, numerous moviegoers, members of the Hollywood community, and activists have expressed perplexity, annoyance, and fury.

Among those weighing in on the controversy: Turner Classic Movies primetime host Ben Mankiewicz, who will address the issue during a tribute to the actor on Friday, Sept. 30, marking the 125th anniversary of March’s birth. “To me, two actors from Hollywood’s golden age really stand in a tier above the rest, and that’s Spencer Tracy and Fredric March — both, oddly, from Wisconsin,” Mankiewicz says. 

“There’s an authentic humanity to every performance they deliver. Fredric March had a unique ability to embody a character. So yes, when I heard this news, my gut reaction was, ‘Wow, you’re kidding me. No way. How could Fredric March have been in the Klan?”
