Cancer is a non-infectious disease. There is no medicine yet to prevent the cause of cancer. There are so many chemicals and environmental fact that contributes to the cause of cancer. 

Does sugar have any role in cancer development? 

For energy, every cell in our body utilizes blood sugar( glucose). Almost 200 times more glucose is utilised by the cancer cells than normal cells because as we all know cancer cells grow rapidly for that they need a huge amount of energy. 
There's no way to enable only healthy cells to consume glucose without enabling malignant cells to do so as well. There is no evidence that a "sugar-free" diet reduces the incidence of cancer or increases the odds of a cancer patient's survival. There are also no studies that show a direct relationship between sugar and cancer. 

There is sn indirect link that exists. Consumption of a huge amount of sugar over a period can cause obesity or overweight which increase the risk of 13 different kinds of cancer. Inflammatory proteins are released from fat cells resulting in the growth of cancer cells or tumours. Maintaining desirable body weight is essential to reduce the risk of lifestyle-related disorders. 

Omitting sugars completely is not possible because our body requires the sugars which reach from whole foods but reduce the risk of cancer by maintaining weight.
