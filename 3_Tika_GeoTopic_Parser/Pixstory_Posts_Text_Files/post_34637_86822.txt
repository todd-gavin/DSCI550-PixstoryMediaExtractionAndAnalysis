Jannik Sinner&#39;s debut at the Indian Wells ATP is just a few hours away There is so much curiosity to see him on the pitch especially in light of the coaching change that took place a few weeks ago He is growing and training to make a further leap in quality and why not position in the standings Currently tenth in the world I&#39;m always the same I&#39;m always the same That is, a person who in any case wants to have fun in what he does and who at the same time always tries to improve himself, said in an interview with Repubblica about his growth in the last period and the change of coach I did what I thought was right for me even if the decision wasn&#39;t easy and it wasn&#39;t We did an incredible job I know where I started from a boy and a half years old I left home to go to Bordighera and I arrived in the first ten in the world His new adventure with coach Simone Vagnozzi at the beginning With Simone Vagnozzi it goes very well I seem to have known him for a long time We don&#39;t tell each other jokes he has personality and I think he can give me what I was looking for Then everyone thinks and says what he thinks I understand that I have to look only at myself Then what some say I don&#39;t even read it anymore I&#39;m sincere You get out of the difficulties that are inevitable or at least I get out with work Then of course victories also help and trust increases But work is the basis and what we are doing
