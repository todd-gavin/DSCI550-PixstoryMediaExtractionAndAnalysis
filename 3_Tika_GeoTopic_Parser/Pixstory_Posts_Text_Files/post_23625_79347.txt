Belle in short is the Citizen Kane of animation I know as I have watched all things animation Whether it be common films like Disney to the obscure like Brothers Quay Belle is the closest we get to a contemporary Fantasia and I say this because the negatives I have seen come from people who expect a more narrative and musical approach such as Disney s own take of Beauty and the Beast Instead like Fantasia is an experimental art piece that combines D and D animation very well The music have an reoccurring motif throughout the film heighten greatly based on the emotional mindset of Suzu The movie is really about life death trauma and love And like those things it comes episodic in real life which a lot of people fail to even realize that but there is always that underlying narrative that pushes us It is something we experienced in our own lives especially at a time where social media is prevalent helping us to escape those factors but the drive is there when we face the music in real life The visuals are absolutely stunning the music is beautiful and often haunting and the characters are down to Earth They are realistic people that you rarely see in a lot of animation today
