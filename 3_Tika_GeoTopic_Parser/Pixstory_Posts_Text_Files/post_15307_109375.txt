The twenty-sixth edition of Festivaletteratura will be held from Wednesday to Sunday in September After two years of forced containment but also of courageous inventions, the Festival is trying to regain more space in the city at a time when the need for literature is growing all around Literature knows how to read the world he interprets their fears and hopes he sees clearly what we still don&#39;t know how to name he remembers and looks beyond Lost in the face of the disassembled tiles of a present that we are unable to interpret to the literature we ask to draw a drawing try to make sense offer us new points of observation Festivaletteratura looks at national histories and global tensions identity crises and paths of emancipation basic rights and landscapes in transformation through novels poetry collections journalistic narratives memoirs author&#39;s correspondence comic books theatrical texts that often feel first and most strongly what is happening or is about to take place next to us or a little further An exploration that of the Festival which certainly does not isolate itself in the stories but which leads to continuous and inevitable encroachments towards the other arts the sciences the new expressive languages the most disparate disciplines thus arise the unprecedented comparisons at daring times among writers researchers activists women and men of art and ingenuity who release their energy of thought in the squares of Mantua Squares that this year the Festival wants to open more than in the past to the participation of readers bills of popular initiative projects for schools possible censuses of other living species for a new environmental pact construction of temporary playgrounds are some of the initiatives in which all the participants will be actively involved, finally regaining possession of the public space which had been impracticable for a long time
