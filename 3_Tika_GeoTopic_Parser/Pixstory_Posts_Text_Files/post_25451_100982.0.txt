Since we are talking about movies, why not shows now? This is one of my personal favourite shows- Sex Education. And it truly gives you a lot of it, to me it did even though I try to be aware of all of it.
It really gives you an insight as to what happens in the lives of people who don't conform to typical gender norms and sexuality.
Experiencing it in real life could be much better but i haven't seen many people around me who are open about this stuff, its India afterall, the first step we gotta take is the legalization of homosexual marriages.
But the show is pretty great, its a high school drama bur not your typical one. Give it a watch, and its not that long either, just 2 seasons.
