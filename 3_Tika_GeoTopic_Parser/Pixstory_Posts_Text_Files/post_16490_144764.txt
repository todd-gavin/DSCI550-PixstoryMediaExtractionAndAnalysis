Pushpa star Rashmika Mandanna who is making her Hindi cinema debut with Amitabh Bachchan and Neena Gupta in Goodbye said her character Tara is the complete opposite of her and also shared anecdotes about working with the Big B She said in fact that Tara is more like her sister Shiman who is years younger than her and demands a rational explanation for all that she s asked to do Talking about her first foray into Hindi cinema Rashmika Mandanna told IANS I think initially it was very intimidating But after that I think it came to a point when we all sort of just blended in so beautifully as a family even if we re just a couple of actors coming in and performing On sharing screen space with the Big B Rashmika said I think for me Bachchan sir was the picture of professionalism Of course he has his own aura but he is most professional and at heart a simple man The combination is so beautiful
