As the Omicron wave recedes in the United States, public health officials are faced with a new round of decision-making on the best way for the country to move forward.

It's a critical moment to rebuild the trust that has been lost among weary Americans over the past two years, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
But the best way to gain that trust -- offering a transparent, metric-based approach -- is challenged by a fractured and undervalued health data infrastructure. It's problem that has long plagued the United States and one that has hindered the ability to respond swiftly and pointedly to the Covid-19 pandemic since the beginning.

"It's difficult not just during pandemic times, but even more difficult during the pandemic," Freeman said. "Our data modernization infrastructure for governmental public health is just really nonexistent. So when you think about having to pivot quickly with new metrics and how that data gets collected and reported and accumulated, aggregated, de-aggregated, it can be daunting."
The data failings of America's public health system are many and varied, tainting nearly every decision-driving metric in one way or another.
"Lack of accurate, real-time information was one of the greatest failures of the US response to the Covid-19 pandemic," Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in March 2021.

Holding on to what progress has been made will require states to keep up their own efforts, as well as federal commitment to the investment of resources, but signals are mixed.
