On January 23, BTS posted a video where Jungkook adorably mispronounced the world Chipotle as “Chicotle…”

Well, if ARMYs thought it was cute, Chipotle couldn’t seem to agree more and even changed their username on Twitter to match what Jungkook said! It seems as if “Chicotle” has much more of a ring to it than first expected.

Yet, from there, it seems as if the popular brand continued to showcase just how much of an ARMY they are. On their social media, they definitely picked the right person to run the account because they were radiating BTS in their tweets…

Well, it seems as if the love didn’t end there. On January 25, one ARMY wanted to see how much Chipotle loved BTS and cheekily asked, “Chipotle discount code exclusively for ARMY when?”
Although it was a long shot, Chipotle replied, “Tomorrow?” and although many didn’t believe it, it seems the brand stuck to its promise.

On January 26, US BTS ARMY proved that the brand had kept its promise, sharing that they were partnering with Chipotle to give 7000 ARMYs a free Chipotle bowl!

- its BTS' world and we're all just living in it😂😂🖐️
