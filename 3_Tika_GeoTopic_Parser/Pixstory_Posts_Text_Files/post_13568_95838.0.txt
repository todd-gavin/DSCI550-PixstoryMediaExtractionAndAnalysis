I am Hazara!
My throat was cut in "Zabul"
My hand is in "Deh mazang" with me
Said goodbye
 My Quran in "Al-Zahra"
They set it on fire
And my geography in "Sayed al-Shuhada"
My math in "Abdul Rahim Shahid"
Was reduced to ashes
My pen is in " Mawoud center"
And my feet are full of "Championship clip"
I left
Yes, I am a Hazara
And every piece of me
  Buried somewhere in this land
This grief
For us, the homeland is not
It was just a good cemetery
This ........

This poem narrates several bloody incidents of The genocide of the Hazaras people.
