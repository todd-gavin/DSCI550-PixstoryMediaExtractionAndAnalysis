Sheryl Sandberg steps down as the chief operating officer of Meta as she intends to refocus her work on women's issues and philanthropy as Roe v Wade is under the onslaught.

She said, "This is a really important moment for me to be able to do more with my philanthropy, with my foundation".
Sandberg is a pioneer in the field of technology and has worked in meta for 14 years. She is the co-founder and board chair of the Lean In Foundation, which acts as a global community devoted to helping foster leadership, development and inclusion for women in the workplace.

Despite the communication policy of Meta that banned employees from discussing abortion she condemned the leaked report on overturning roe v/s wade.

 	She said her priorities have changed and it is her time to focus on advocacy. She also noted that in this political state she has to stand for women. It is said that she has no plans to become a CEO anywhere else and even remarked that Zuckerberg was supportive of her departure. 

'I'm going to miss running this company with Sheryl,' he wrote. 'I'm sad that the day is coming when I won't get to work as closely with Sheryl. But more than anything, I'm grateful for everything she has done to build Meta.'

Zuckerberg in a lengthy note said that he doesn't plan to replace Sandberg in the company's standing structure. Javier Olivan will serve as Meta's new COO.

Sandberg lead Meta's advertising business and was responsible for nurturing it from its beginning into an over $100 billion-a-year powerhouse.

Neither Sandberg nor Zuckerberg gave any information that Sandberg's resignation wasn't her decision. But she's also appeared somewhat sidelined in recent years, with other executives close to Zuckerberg, such as Chris Cox — who returned in 2020 as chief product officer after a yearlong break from the company —becoming more central.
