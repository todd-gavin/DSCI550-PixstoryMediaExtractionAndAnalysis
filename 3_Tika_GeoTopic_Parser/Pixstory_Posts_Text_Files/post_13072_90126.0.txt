The Ministry of Promoting Virtue and Prohibiting Virtue of the Taliban has banned men and women from entering amusement parks at the same time and has set aside time for men and women to have fun.

According to the Taliban, men have one more day than women to have fun, and women in amusement parks must observe the "religious hijab."

📍: The Taliban have instructed amusement park owners to dedicate Sundays, Mondays and Tuesdays to women and Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays to men.

Optional 🚫
The statement stressed that men are not allowed to enter the parks on special days for women. 🧐The Taliban are also not allowed to go to the resorts with weapons and military uniforms, and park owners will be dealt with if they violate them.
Families should refrain from "mixing with foreigners" in recreational places such as Paghman Valley, Shakardareh and Stalf Valley, and women should observe the "religious hijab".

Dear couples 👫
According to the Taliban order, your esteemed couples are no longer allowed to go to amusement parks together!

🤔 With the publications that the Ministry of Taliban denies every day, I wonder where they came from?
What kind of creatures are they?
Are these names mentioned in the form of humanity?
They still do not understand the concept of freedom, that is why, until the brain thoughts become what they are!
