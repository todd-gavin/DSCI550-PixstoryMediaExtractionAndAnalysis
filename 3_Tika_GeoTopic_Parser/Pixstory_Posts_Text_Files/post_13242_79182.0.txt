UNAMA, the UN special mission in Afghanistan, has called on the Taliban Interior Ministry to respond immediately to the arrest of two other women protesters in the past 24 hours. UNAMA said in a Twitter message that it reiterated its commitment to all active women who have "disappeared" and their families.

On Wednesday, Morsal Ayar, one of the protesting women, was arrested at her home, and yesterday, Thursday, 14 Aquarius Zahra Mohammadi was arrested.
The Taliban have continued to crack down on and abduct protesters, especially women, in recent weeks, despite international demands and international norms.
