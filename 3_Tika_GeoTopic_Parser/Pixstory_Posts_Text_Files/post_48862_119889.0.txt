Many men often ask, "Why must we take accountability for what men in the past did?" And the answer to it is simple. Because you still exercise the privileges men in the past kept for themselves. It is ironic to complain about being "blamed" for patriarchy when you're an active participant of the system and are consciously or unconsciously benefitting from it. Denying that you are profiting off of it is ignorance at its best because you know in your heart that's not true.

Also, asking such questions is an exercising of your privilege. Asking a group, that's oppressed till date for their gender or sex (just read the headlines!), questions like that is putting the burden of emotional labor on them instead of doing your own research. What's more privileged than that? Men are so used to be spoonfed for their gender that even the answer to an "oh my god, am I somehow contributing to someone else's oppression" is something they demand from that very oppressed groups. We shouldn't have to constantly school grown men why they should start behaving like decent humans or why they should be empathetic to other's pain. Men demand empathy for the oppression they engage in, but do not want to show any sympathy to the oppression women go through. That is hypocritical, uneducated and grossly entitled. Get your head out of the ground and look around.
