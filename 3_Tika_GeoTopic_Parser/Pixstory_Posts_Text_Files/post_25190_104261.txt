One of the best anime I ve come across I watched it last year and by chance in April only covid was on rise in India that time and I was away from my family for studies and all my family got covid and I was really sad that I couldn t meet them or something so I wanted to cry my heart out and a friend recommended this anime And even though I anticipated the ending it completely shattered me Its a sad story where the characters had immense love for each other but couldn t be together because life happened
