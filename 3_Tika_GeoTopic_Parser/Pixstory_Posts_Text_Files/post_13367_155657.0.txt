The twin suicide attacks on Hazara peaceful demonstration in Dehmazang square43 was the deadliest and horrific incident in recent decades in Afghanistan. The first coverage of the public media and the UNAMA’s investigation recorded at least 85 deaths and around 413 injured of Hazara civilians44. Another report which published after the event recorded around 100 deaths and several hundreds injured in Dehmazang attacks45. As eyewitness, I along with the supporter team enumerated 84 deaths and 500 injuries only in hospitals of western part of Kabul hours later after the incident. Some families transferred coffins of their victims to their birthplaces as soon as possible according to Islamic burying rituals. Tens of other deaths were buried in subsequent days which mad hard to know the real figure of casualties except those available official record.The demonstration was organized by the “Enlightening movement” in order to mobilize Hazara people against the government decision for the route change of trans-regional electricity power line from Bamyan – Kabul to Parwan- Kabul through Salang Pass. The Hindu Kush crossing route through Bamyan to Kabul had been already chosen according to technical assessment, but an abrupt decision of Afghan government to reroute the line was resonated as truly discriminative act. The collective protests of Hazara people provoked large civil and social movement called “Enlightening movement”. The attack on Enlightening movement’s peaceful demonstration was truly alerting for Hazara people and it was the beginning of overt suppression and oppression of civic and peaceful demonstration thereafter46. The government either neglected to provide security services for the demonstrators -when the most of such demonstrations targeted by terrorist groups thereafter- or directly targeted people’s gathering and demonstration in different ways after Dehmazang incident.
