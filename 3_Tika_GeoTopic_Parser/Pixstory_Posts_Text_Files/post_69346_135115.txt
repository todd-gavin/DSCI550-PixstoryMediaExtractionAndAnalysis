In Kashmir which is administered by India the traditional kangri or firepot keeps people warm during the bitter winters when the temperature drops as low as minus Kashmiris keep it in their pheran a long knee length woollen cloak worn by people in the chilly winters It is a portable and mobile heater The kangri is a portable personal warmer made of pottery blazing embers and attractive handcrafted wicker baskets Manufacturing the kangri involves work and local artisanal craftsmanship Twigs are gathered from deciduous plants peeled and scraped then soaked dried and dyed before being weaved around the pottery bowl The earthenware is roughly six inches mm in diameter and is embellished with vibrant threads mirror work and sequins Kangris costs between Rs and Rs and it can be ignited with just grammes of charcoal It is less expensive than oil gas and wood fired heaters In the present period while electrical heating devices are available the classic fire pot is an efficient and cost effective heating system It does not let down people in the absence of energy or load shedding and keeps them warm in bitter winters There is still kangri for the rescue
