Its UP Elections day today, since i live in Gaziabad NCR , i voted for the first time.

Being a responsible citizen it is my duty to vote for the right candidate, to the right party.

Honestly, i don’t understand politics, their agendas and all, we know all the political parties have same agendas, everyone is talking about Women empowerment, girls safety, education and yet we see nothing. No execution on such issues.

How could you talk about women’s safety, and woman’s eduction when we are not safe inside our education centres also? We do not have a right to wear whatever we want to, yes, i’m talking about Hijab issue which we have been seeing nowadays.

i feel sad how these political leaders manipulates the common people, the common public , the tax payers.

I was shocked today when i went to give my vote, the people who were assigned the job by election commission, they were forcefully asking  people to cast their vote to BJP, they told me “vote kamal ko hi jana chaiye”, my father told him that we can file complaint against them, because this is not right, i mean who are you to tell us? This is how you contest free and fair elections? 

I saw these parties giving bribes, alcohol to common people to buy their votes. so sick!

Who ever wins, i just want we have a better place to live in, so that if we walk at night or in a day we don’t have to  twice, we don’t need to ask our brothers or man of the house to drop us, our parents could freely allow us to go out. 

We could become humans first than Hindu, muslim, Christin, sikhs. We could accept people with open heart without asking  for their identities and religion.

I hope we become independent.
