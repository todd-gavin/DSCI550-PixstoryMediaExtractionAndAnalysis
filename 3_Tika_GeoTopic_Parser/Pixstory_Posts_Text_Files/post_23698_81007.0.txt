Two years into the pandemic, governments across the world are eager to put Covid-19 behind them. But for scientists and public health officials, some of the toughest work is yet to come. 
World Health Organization Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan sees a long road ahead not only to determine the origins of the coronavirus outbreak, but also to educate people about public health and garner international support for the WHO.
Here is one of her interview.
BLOOMBERG: Was the politicization of science a surprise? 

SWAMINATHAN: That was one of the things I was most surprised by. It was very disappointing to see the attack on scientists and science. And it got stronger over the course of the pandemic and it has a potential to do a lot of damage. We really need to work with young people to improve scientific literacy, health literacy, and get them to think more rationally to question information they see.

BLOOMBERG: What do we know about the origins of the coronavirus?
SWAMINATHAN: Almost all viral infections that newly emerge have been zoonotic infections. From HIV, the Zika virus, Ebola, SARS and MERS, the other two major coronaviruses that have infected humans. They emerge from an animal and then sometimes through an intermediate host. In this case, the genetic sequences still point toward an origin, perhaps from bats. What we haven’t got is the exact how, when and where did that jump happen from animals to humans. That’s important to understand in order to prevent future pandemics.
BLOOMBERG: Is it unusual that the initial cause of the outbreak is still unclear?
SWAMINATHAN: It’s not that odd because even in the past, it’s taken years to understand the origin of viruses. It took several years to know that SARS came from civet cats and MERS was spread from camels. And for HIV, it took a long time to understand that it came from chimpanzees
