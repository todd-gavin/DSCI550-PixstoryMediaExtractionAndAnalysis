Day 4 

Right after having our breakfast we were all set to leave for Rohtang pass. It was a two-hour drive from our property. Rohtang pass is situated at a distance of 51 km from Manali and is on the Manali-Leh highway. It is one of the highest mountain passes in the world and connects the Kullu Valley with Lahaul and Spiti valleys of Himachal Pradesh. 

We decided to book a cab and not drive there ourselves due to the weather and traffic. The view was breathtaking. With air flowing, mountains rising above clouds, surreal and dreamy landscape of glaciers made our day! 

After we reached there, we enjoyed the cold winds with a cup of tea and Maggi. A trip to the mountains is surely incomplete without having  ‘Pahado wali Maggi’. We all then went skiing and had fun in the snow. 

It was now getting colder and time to leave. On our way back, we did paragliding at Bir Billing. It was the craziest experience ever. The bird-eye view left me stunned while I was navigating in the air and could see all the beautiful views. They performed the sport with utter safety and have skilled pilots to help us enjoy the experience. It was getting dark and our stomach was yelling for food. 

On our way back from Bir Billing, we also stopped by a waterfall to get some photos clicked.

We then visited the very famous cafe in Manali called 1947. It had the best view with very tasty food and drinks. We sat, enjoyed the ambiance and vibe there without having the track of time. This is how we ended our day!
