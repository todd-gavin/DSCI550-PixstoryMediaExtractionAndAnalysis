At 8:51 IST, the Orion spacecraft and SLS (Space Launch System) rocket for NASA's Artemis 1 mission departed launch pad 39 at the Kennedy Space Center and started their 6.4-kilometer trip back to the Vehicle Assembly Building. IE reported that the latest weather forecasts related to Hurricane Ian did not indicate expectations for better conditions, thus the space agency chose to roll back the rocket. From the Kennedy Space Center's YouTube channel, you can see a webcast of the rocket being rolled back to the massive Vehicle Assembly Building. “Managers met Monday morning and made the decision based on the latest weather predictions associated with Hurricane Ian, after additional data gathered overnight did not show improving expected conditions for the Kennedy Space Center area. The decision allows time for employees to address the needs of their families and protect the integrated rocket and spacecraft system,” said NASA in the Artemis I blog.Originally scheduled for September 27, NASA opted to cancel the launch attempt owing to the storm's risk.
