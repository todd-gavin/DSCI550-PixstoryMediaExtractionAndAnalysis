How would you feel if Martin Luther King Jr were alive in 2015 and celebrating his 86th birthday in the United States? Undoubtedly, he was pleased with the legal and political advances of black Americans, such as the election of Barack Obama. But King was annoyed by the racial differences that still remained. There are still two types of black Americans in terms of US opportunities.

There are racial differences in all social and economic dimensions and it is much more than what was mentioned in these cases; Imprisonment, learning, having children, going to school, racism in attitude, employment and the list goes on. Of course, some progress has been made. But one thing is certain. An inescapable need to build a community of opportunity increases the chances of black Americans living.
