Hustle Culture is the mentality that one must work all day every day in pursuit of their professional goals.

WHY AM I CALLING IT TOXIC?
Authorities like WHO warn that Overworking is dangerous. According to them working atleast 55 hours a week kills more than 7 Lakh people in an year and increases the risk of stroke and heart diseases. Point being that overworking is not good for Physical Health.
 Coming on Mental Health, this culture equally detrimental to Mental Health. If we don't relax our brain and keep on working , our productivity will decrease. The tired and pressurized feeling will rob away our happiness.

HOW TO NOT GET TRAPPED IN THIS CULTURE?
We have just one life and we should enjoy it. We should study , learn new things, work but while doing all this we should not forget to LIVE THE LIFE while we are healthy and blessed with the resources! 
We should not be in a rat race. We should go with the flow and do what we like. We should take breaks now and then. And in the midst of work, we should definitely not forget our family. Thus quality time with family is a must to break away from this. 
We should introspect every day about how much we have achieved already and remind ourselves that this is OUR LIFE and we need to make the best out of it because -
