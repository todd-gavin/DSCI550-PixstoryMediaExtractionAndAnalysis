A study on the differences in memory between the two sexes coordinated by the Cnr Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology and the Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine of the Telethon Foundation in collaboration with other Cnr Institutes and other research structures has allowed us to identify the mechanism brain through which we decide how much information to remember during spontaneous learning The research published in Nature Communications What happens when we have so much information to remember For years we thought that we could memorize it by repeating studying and reviewing But what happens with the unique experiences that we do not live with the intention to remind them For example, a restaurant where we ate very well but whose name and address we cannot remember. Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine Tigem of the Telethon Foundation which revealed how the amount of information affects our ability to remember in the long term under conditions of spontaneous learning For example on average we are all able to remember a telephone number of digits for the time needed to write it down but how many of these numbers we remember an hour later or the next day In the work we studied the biological mechanisms underlying this process in a mouse model following the casual discovery that males and females, when exposed to the maximum number of objects that they can memorize in the short term, i.e. the following day they tend to remember them in a different way males remember them all females explains De Leonibus We therefore wondered why females place a limit on this transfer of information and what are the mechanisms activate in the brain to impose it We have therefore discovered that males activate more the hippocampus, the cortical region responsible for the formation of long-term memories, while females activate more the nuclei of the midline of the thalamus located under the cortex, in particular the nucleus reuniens, a region older than the brain
