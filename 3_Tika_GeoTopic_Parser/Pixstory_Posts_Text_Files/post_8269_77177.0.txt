A sculpture of the NBA great Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna “Gigi” Bryant was brought on Wednesday to the helicopter crash site where they died alongside seven others on a hillside near Los Angeles two years ago.

The 160lb (73kg) bronze statue depicts Gigi holding Kobe’s hand as it rests on her shoulder. Both are wearing basketball uniforms.

Engraved on the statue’s steel pedestal are the names of all nine victims of the crash, which occurred early in the morning on 26 January 2020, amid foggy weather. It also includes an inscription of Bryant’s famous quote: “Heroes come and go, but legends are forever.”

Sculptor Dan Medina said he hoped the statue could help Bryant’s many fans. “On this day, the second anniversary of the accident, I decided to bring it up from sunrise to sunset and create a bit of a healing process for fans,” he said. “Today was special because I witnessed a lot of that. People would come up and they would leave with some sort of satisfaction.”

A five-time NBA champion in his 20 seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers, Bryant’s death at age 41 shocked the world of professional sports and sent his legions of fans into mourning.

Bryant, who lived in the area for most of his life often used helicopters to beat Los Angeles’s heavy traffic, and on the day of the crash was taking Gianna to play in a basketball game at his academy outside the city. His daughter was 13 at the time of the crash.
