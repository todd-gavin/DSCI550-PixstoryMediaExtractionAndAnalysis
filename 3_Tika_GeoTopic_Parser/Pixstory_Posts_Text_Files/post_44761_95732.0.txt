Mantra-Sacred chants for energizing Ruby

Given below are two effective mantras for energizing your Ruby for best results. A detailed method to consecrate your gemstone is given in a separate chapter.

MANTRA FROM RIG VEDA

Om aa krishnen rajasa vartamaano niveshyannamritam matrayam cha. Hiranyayena savita rathena devo yati bhuvnaani pashyann Tantrik Beeja Mantra
Om Hraang Hreeng Hroung Sah Suryay Namah
Gemstones that are incompatible with the Ruby

Those who wear ruby gemstone should not wear a blue Sapphire, diamond, hessonite along with it in general. Only in certain special conditions and gain of specific objectives, even mutually inimical gemstones are recommended. 

However this should happen only after thorough analysis of the chart in detail 
and the recommendation should come from an expert.

Donation of Ruby Gemstone and other remedies for the Sun

Those individuals in who’s chart Sun is not well placed and is giving bad results in the Mahadasha or the Antradasha should donate wheat on Sundays, perform Surya Namaskar (Sun salutation), Chant the Surya Gayatri Mantra, Recite Aditya Hridya Stotra/hymn composed by Sage Agastya and offer Arghya/offering to the Sun God. This will ensure peace and prosperity.

There is a method of pacifying pratikula planets (planets that give adverse or malefic results) by way of Gem donation. This is known as Ratna Daan or Ratna Arpana.

The following things should be offered along with a beautiful unheated 
and untreated Ruby:
