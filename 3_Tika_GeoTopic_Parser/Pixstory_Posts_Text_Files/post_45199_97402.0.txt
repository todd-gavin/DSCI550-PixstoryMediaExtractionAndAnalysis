Laurent Koscielny

Koscielny was a dedicated Arsenal player for nearly a decade, winning three FA Cups with the club. After being forced to return to France in the summer of 2019, the centre-back is now in his second season with Bordeaux.

Kieran Gibbs

Gibbs, a Lambeth native, departed Arsenal in 2017 after ten years in and around the first team, having made well over 200 appearances.

He signed for West Bromwich Albion and has remained at the Hawthorns ever since, with the 
Boing Boing Baggies living up to their moniker. Relegation for the second time in four years 
appears to be on the cards.

Jack Wilshere

Wilshere's farewell game for Arsenal was also Arsene Wenger's â€“ a 5-0 victory against Burnley.

He was released soon after and signed a two-year agreement with West Ham after 17 years with Arsenal.

He was released at the end of the 2019-20 season after being limited by injury issues, and he is now a free agent. The 29-year-old is now training with Bournemouth, where he was on loan for the 2016-17 season.

Aaron Ramsey

Ramsey scored two second-half goals in Arsenal's 3-1 win at the Stadium of Light on that day, and he remained a key player for the club in the years after, not least in their FA Cup triumphs in 2014, 2015, and 2017.

In 2019, he completed his contract and departed on a free transfer, which Juventus took advantage of, as they regularly do. With Maurizio Sarri, the Wales international was a bit part player when the team won their ninth Scudetto in a row in 2019-20, but under Andrea Pirlo, he is a key player.
