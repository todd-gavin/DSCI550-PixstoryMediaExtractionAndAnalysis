‚ö†ANXIETY & PANIC‚Å£
Does seem to just happen , it happened to me & I was not having any clue of it !‚Å£ ü§î

SO it came as a huge shock , leaving me to BELIEVE it all just happened that day , out of the blue , for no reason ! All of it exhausted me Mentally and Emotionally ! But i was not having any clue that im having anxiety ! All I was doing is more panic with fear .‚Å£ üòµ

Just wanna share with you all the signs i have noticed in myself when i was mentally Exhausted ;

1 Getting Irritated easily 
2 Feeling Completely demotivated Even To do Things you normally Enjoy 
3 Experiencing Anxiety or panic attacks
4 Trouble in sleeping either it takes you hours to fall asleep or your sleep is broken by your through at mid night 
5 You have Almost No patience 
6 you are experiencing indigestion . You have low grade stomach ache all the time or feel like there's butterflies in your stomach .
7 You start crying Unexpectedly .

It takes alot to get out of all this trust me ! And I know it tough ! I ignored all the drama and Stress of life I was choosing before ! Be honest with yourself , be kind ‚ù§‚Å£
Don't worry about opinions they don't know about your life .‚Å£
You can decide to change life & action it .‚Å£ ‚ù§Ô∏èüí™
