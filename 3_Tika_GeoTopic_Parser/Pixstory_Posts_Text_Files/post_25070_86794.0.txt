Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur are all set to lock horns against each other in the Premier League battle on Saturday evening. This fixture is of particular importance in regards to the top four race. Manchester United cannot afford any slip-ups from now on, given that they are one point behind Arsenal who have three games in hand.

The Red Devils will look at this fixture as a tool to get back into form, after being defeated by Manchester City last weekend. Moreover, this could be a confidence booster for Manchester United who host Atletico Madrid on Tuesday for the reverse leg of the Champions League Round of 16.

Meanwhile, Spurs claimed a 5-0 win over Everton in their last fixture, but their form has been topsy-turvy. They have lost four of their last seven league games, placed seventh on the points tally.
