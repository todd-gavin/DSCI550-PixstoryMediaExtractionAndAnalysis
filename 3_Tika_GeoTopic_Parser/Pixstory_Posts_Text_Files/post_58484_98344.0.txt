About the Conference:

In recent years, there’s been a growing push to make medical education trans-affirmative in the backdrop of Madras and Kerala High Court judgements. But transforming India’s healthcare system comes with the need for a roadmap towards achieving this goal.

Through a systematic, participatory, and inclusive effort, TransCare MedEd has developed a set of draft trans-affirmative competencies on trans-affirmative healthcare in India. 

The upcoming TransCare Med Ed National conference on May 5th and 6th is aimed at disseminating and discussing the draft competencies, highlighting best practices and building consensus on the way forward.

Watch this space for narratives by transgender people navigating healthcare settings, and for thoughts and pathways on the way towards creating access to trans-affirmative healthcare.
