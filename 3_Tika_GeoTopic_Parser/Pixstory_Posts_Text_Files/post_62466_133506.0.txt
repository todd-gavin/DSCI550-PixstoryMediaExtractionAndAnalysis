Foxes may not be Mr Fox but yes, they are indeed very clever animals. Studies have shown that they outperform dogs in almost every category, including problem solving, memory recall, spatial reasoning and general intelligence.
One of the best ways to measure intelligence is through IQ tests. These tests are designed to measure how well a person understands complex concepts and solves problems. In some cases, foxes have been found to score as high as human children on IQ tests! This demonstrates just how intelligent these animals truly are.
Another way that scientists have measured fox intelligence is through the use of puzzles and games. These exercises require the animal to think ahead and plan several steps ahead in order to solve them successfully. Foxes often do better on these types of tests than dogs, which once again reinforces their cognitive superiority.
So there you have it - proof enough that foxes are indeed very clever animals! If you're looking for an animal that's able to think intelligently, then you should definitely add them to your list of choices.
