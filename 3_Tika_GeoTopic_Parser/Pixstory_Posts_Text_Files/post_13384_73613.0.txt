A large part of human life is mental. For a while, this mental life has an external meaning, but from an age onwards, the external meaning and importance of our life diminishes and fades. Life is dull and very dull if we are not aware of the mental dimension of our humanity.
But when we realize the subjectivity and loneliness of this life, then we do not tie the meaning of life to others and external objects, we know that the creator of this mental dimension of our life is to a large extent ourselves, then we ourselves are equally able to Give our eroding life some meaning and dynamism.
