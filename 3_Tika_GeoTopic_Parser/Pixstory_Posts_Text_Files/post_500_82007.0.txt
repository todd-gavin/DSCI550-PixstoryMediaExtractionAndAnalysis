Not a kind of person whose days wouldn’t end without listening to music. I can go without doing that for days even months, I do have my favourites, old Lata/Rafi/Kishore/Asha songs some Mukesh. Some SRK ones . 
So Bappi Lahiri songs might figure in my list of peppy and full of energy , hummable . Sometimes makes you happy listening but not many except for the “pag gungroo bande “ .  “‘Yaad araha hain tera pyaar.  Or the songs of dirty picture more recently. 
They are energetic, I am sure no dance floor would be good enough without playing out one of his foot tapping numbers. 
I am sure  a Bappi da song is good to lift your mood in a bad day. 
 But I loved Bappi Lahiri energy off screen. 
The dangling chains , the dresses , the laughter which seemed so real and so infective . 
Iconic Bollywood singer-composer Bappi Lahiri, dies at 69.  The “Disco King", died in a Mumbai hospital today following multiple health issues, news agencies reported. 
Second major loss to the music industry after the Lata Mangeshkar . 
Rest in Peace . Legend.
