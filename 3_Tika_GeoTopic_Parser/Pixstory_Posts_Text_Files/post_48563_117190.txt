The Bible makes it clear that there are some things worth fighting for By definition truth and lie are not the same thing We must take a stand against deceptive teachers and contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to God s holy people Jude Issues that promote another gospel a salvation message that differs from what the Bible teaches must be condemned Galatians Corinthians As heresy any revelations publications or opinions presented as infallible or equal to the Bible must be rejected Revelation Jeremiah We are also to destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God and take every thought captive to obey Christ Corinthians We do not compromise God s Word or water down the gospel If it is a matter of salvation or holy living we should take a strong stand Other matters may be handled differently First Timothy instructs Christians not to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies Such things promote controversial speculations rather than advancing God s work which is by faith So the Bible gives us some guidelines about what is worth debating and what is better left alone
