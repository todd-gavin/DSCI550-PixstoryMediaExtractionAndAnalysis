A video of some men hurling eggs and flour at a woman in a burqa is being shared on social media with the claim that the incident took place in Karnataka amid the hijab row. The post below has over 6 lakh views.

Alt News has received several verification requests for the video.

Video also viral in 2020
Governor of Pakistan’s Punjab Mohammad Sarwar had shared the video in 2020. He claimed that a Muslim woman was manhandled and harassed by RSS workers.

The clip was also shared by other Pakistani politicians.

The same clip was earlier viral in India with an identical claim alleging the incident took place in the country — “ये हो क्या रहा है इस देश मे इतनी नफरत मुसलमानों से इस तरह से जीतोगे सबका विश्वास क्या यही है आपका न्यू इंडिया” (What is happening in this country such hatred for Muslims is this how you will win everyone’s trust is this your New India?)

The above tweet, posted on July 7, 2019, has now been deleted. The handle had tagged PM Narendra Modi, UP CM Yogi Adityanath and the PMO in the tweet.

Alt News found that the same video had been uploaded by a Twitter user in November 2015, claiming that the incident took place in France.

On Facebook, the video had been posted in October 2015 by a Moroccan social media influencer calling the young men seen in the video “animals”. The video has been viewed over 475,000 times since then.

Those who have shared the video had suggested that this is an instance of bigotry and hate against the Muslim community. The video and message were also being shared on WhatsApp two years ago.

FACT-CHECK

Alt News found that the video in question is not from India. An October 2015 article published in Morocco World News claimed that teenage boys attacked a woman with eggs, flour and water on Ashura Day in Casablanca, Morocco. Ashura Day is the tenth day of Muharram.
