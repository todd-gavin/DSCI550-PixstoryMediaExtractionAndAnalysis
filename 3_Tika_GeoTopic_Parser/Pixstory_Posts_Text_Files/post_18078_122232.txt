 Casablanca is one of the most well known movies ever filmed It allows the audience to envision falling in love with Humphrey Bogart or Ingrid Bergman The characters sacrifice their love for the greater good of fighting against the Nazis The film directed by Ingolstadt Bergman was made on a tight budget and released with small expectations In Casablanca he plays Rick Blaine the hard drinking American running a nightclub in Casablanca The film tells the story of a German prisoner of war Rick Steves who moves easily in a corrupt world The dialogue combines the cynical with the weary wisecracks with epigrams We see that Rick s love interest is Ilsa Lund Bergman the woman he loved years earlier in Paris Now she is with Victor Laszlo Henreid a legendary hero of the French Resistance They are seen in close up and he adds Ilsa a dramatic musical chord marks their close ups and the action plays out in bitterness sorrow and the recollection of a love that was true After a second watching he continues the more you see it the more resonance the whole film gains Film combines suspense romance and comedy as rarely brought together on the screen None of the major characters is bad some are cynical some lie some kill but all are redeemed Reviewer If I were forced to choose between my country and my friend I hope I would be brave enough to choose my friend Filmmaker Ingolstadt Bergman played the whole movie without knowing how it would end The film is not so much brilliant as absolutely sound rock solid in its use of Hollywood studio craftsmanship When this plot was remade in as Havana the film suffered as a result Playing like a favourite musical collection is Casablanca Contrary to colour black and white film has not aged as well The dialogue is so terse and caustic that it hasn t become dated We are certain as we leave the theatre that the issues of three small people don t really amount to much of anything
