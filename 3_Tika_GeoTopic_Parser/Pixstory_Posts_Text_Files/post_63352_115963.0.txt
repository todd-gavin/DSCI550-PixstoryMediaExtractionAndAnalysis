We all know that alcohol places excess burden on the liver, but what does that actually mean?

It means your estrogen and androgen metabolism are put on the back-burner and progesterone is depleted, even after just a drink or two, resulting in:

* Increased inflammation
* Period problems like heavy/painful periods and luteal
phase defects
* Acne and hirsutism
* Weight gain
* Heightened anxiety and depression

Studies have also shown the profound effects of alcohol intake on the gut microbiome: intake leads to gut dysbiosis AND leaky gut, which can present with symptoms like

* HA axis dysfunction (compromised stress response &
sleep cycles)
* Poor immune function
* Obesity
* Increased susceptibility to pathogens
* Gut-derived inflammation -Constipation, diarrhea, chronic bloating

If you're struggling with any of the above issues that are feeling impossible to solve but you still haven't cut out the social drinking or your glass of wine with dinner to "wind down", it's time to take a hard look at the FOMO and figure out if the risk is worth more than the reward.

This is not to shame anyone who socially drinks, but just like you can't expect to improve your health on a fast-food diet , we need to align our behaviours with realistic goals.
