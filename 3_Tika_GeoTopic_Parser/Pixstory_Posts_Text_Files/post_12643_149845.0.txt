We all have a variety of different characteristics and things floating around in our heads. But when you dig down deep to the core, what is it that makes you, you? 
Each of us are unique in our own way and sk these different characteristics and things happen different to each of us. But when we go deep down into it, what makes us, ourself ? 
A major portion of the foundation lies in who we are and in the life experiences we have gained. No one can have the same combination of life experiences one may have. We don't have just one memory of an event but rather a great amount of knowledge and skills are also a part of us. 
And so here is a self reflection exercise which you can  practice during this hour end of this day. 
Here are few questions of this exercise 
• Who are you outside of your work and your relationship to others ?
• In what space do you feel most comfortable with who you are ? 
• In what areas are you not showing up as your full self ? 
• What feelings are you avoiding and what ones are your seeking ? 
Find and you shall seek, Happy evening. Good night ❤️
