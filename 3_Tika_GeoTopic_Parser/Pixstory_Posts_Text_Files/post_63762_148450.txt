In a recently unveiled scene from Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness Scarlet Witch is kicking all sorts of ass with director Sam Raimi using his Evil Dead influences in the most brutal way possible once again bringing in the horror theme of the movie and of Scarlet Witch In the newly revealed behind the scenes video by stunt choreographer Liang Yang on his Instagram shows stunt performers rehearsing a violently awesome in the works video of the Kamar Taj massacre scene that unfortunately didn t make it into the final cut The video shows Scarlet Witch during her assault on Kamar Taj massacring sorcerers left and right controlling corpses and using them attack other wizards brutalizing bodies controlling other s body movements and even crushing them to bloody pulp Unfortunately the movie was going for a PG rating and this scene was never going to make it in the cut with perhaps the Illuminati killing scene alone pushing the violence scale for Marvel Going back to this deleted scene the choreography is amazing and there is definitely a lot to appreciate in the work that was put into this even if it didn t make it into Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness though frustratingly enough it feels like we have been robbed off a great chance of truly seeing the horror and brutality that Scarlet Witch is capable of inflicting
