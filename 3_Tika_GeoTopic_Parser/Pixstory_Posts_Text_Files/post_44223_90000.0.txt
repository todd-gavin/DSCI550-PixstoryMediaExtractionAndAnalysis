Dean Henderson claims that if he hadn't been sent out on loan to play in the lower leagues, he would never have made it to Manchester United's senior team.

The goalkeeper rose through the English football ranks, from the National League to League Two, League One, and finally the Championship, before joining Man United as David De Gea's backup.

The 25-year-old believes his loan spells with Stockport County, Grimsby Town, Shrewsbury Town, and Sheffield United were crucial to his growth and progression.

"I remember going [to Stockport] when I was a young kid, " he told Manchester United's website.

"To be fair, I absolutely loved it. It was tough, really hard, as a young boy. Going into that division was an eye-opener for me. I’m thankful for the opportunity given to me by the manager at the time, Jim Gannon, for sticking by me because I didn’t play too well.

"I was really getting smashed on crosses, kicking the ball 80 yards on to the striker’s head and, if I didn’t do so, the manager was screaming at me from the touchline. It stood me in good stead and I really appreciate the opportunity they gave me.

“I think my debut, in the first five minutes, their big striker said: ‘Stick it on the goalie, he’s pooping himself’. I thought: ‘Right mate, I’m coming for this’. So I made my mind up I was coming for it and, before I even got there, he flicked it over my head. These are the things you learn and move on. It was great for me.

“It's why I'm sitting here today. If I didn't [go out on loan], I'd probably be in League One now, just going out on my first loan. I fought for it and I stand by it, the best decision of my life."

He has not played in the English top-flight this term, but has featured once in each of the Champions League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup.
