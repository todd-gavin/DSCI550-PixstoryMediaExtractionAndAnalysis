Barbecue is probably the world's oldest cooking method.  It has come a long way from the traditional pit BBQ that originated in the Caribbean to the great Indian tandoor. Australians have taken to the 'barbie' with great gusto. It is a fun and fiery way to eat hearty and stay snug, perfect on a nippy night or for a breezy brunch.
