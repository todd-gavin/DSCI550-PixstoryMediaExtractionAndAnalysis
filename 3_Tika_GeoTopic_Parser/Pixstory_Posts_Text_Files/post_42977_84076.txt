The idea of Slum Soccer came to my mind all of sudden when I saw some kids from a slum playing football in mud Coming to the story of that day it was I was going out of my University and it was raining so naturally I took shelter under a tree I could hear some kids shouting To my surprise they were playing football with a plastic bucket in the rain the ground was full of mud I was a bit set back I always saw these kids doing something which they shouldn t have been Sometimes they were stealing sometimes breaking things unnecessarily and other times drinking or smoking For the first time in my life I had seen them do something that wasn t a bad I decided that I would help them in any way possible So I told them that I ll get them a football so that they can play a proper match I had never seen them more happy I told them to come to the college ground after some days and also got a team from another slum and these kids reached before time I wanted to help these children and society I remembered my father s words about helping people I got an idea to start a big tournament with these kids from slums and went to my journalist friends so that they could publish articles on it After the publication many teams from different slums came to play The rules were made simple by me there wasn t the offside rule so that there would be no fights I got watchmens and other staff to act as referees because the federation didn t allow their ones to join The football federation was against this they thought it was a publicity stunt even today my only reason to do this is to help society This is the story of how Slum Soccer started back in and now after more than years its story will be show to people The only reason I agreed to do this movie is so that more children can be helped from underprivileged areas
