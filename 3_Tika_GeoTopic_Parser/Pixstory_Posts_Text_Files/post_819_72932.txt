The aviation industry and transportation regulators are worried about new G antennas interfering with a key type of aircraft altimeter that s essential for landing planes in bad weather But wireless carriers and telecom regulators have said there s nothing to fear The President of Emirates Sir Tim Clark told CNN on Wednesday that the airline was not aware of some of the potential G rollout issues until yesterday morning calling the situation one of the most delinquent utterly irresponsible he has seen in his aviation career Telecom companies have rolled out G networks to various locations across the United States over the last few years delivering the next generation of cellular phone data speeds But on Wednesday Verizon and AT T turned on their C band G networks an important set of radio frequencies that will supercharge the internet as we know it Unfortunately the C Band sits near the band of frequencies used by aircraft radar altimeters an instrument that tells pilots how high their plane is off the ground and is crucial for landing airplanes in low visibility conditions The Federal Communications Commission auctioned off the C band spectrum to US wireless carriers last year an billion sale But airlines warned of dire consequences for transportation and the overall economy over concerns that the C band technology could interfere with the radar altimeters that pilots use to land in low visibility conditions Airlines estimated flight disruptions would occur each day following the rollout On Tuesday Emirates Air India All Nippon Airways Japan Airlines Lufthansa and British Airways all announced changes to some flights citing the issue Some have added back flights or switched aircraft International carriers seemed to be caught off guard and had to act quickly because of the length of these long haul flights CNN reported Aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus also weighed in warning Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in a December letter that the G rollout will cause interference that could adversely affect the ability of aircraft to safely operate That new rule could keep planes from getting to airports in certain circumstances because pilots would be unable to land using instruments alone and it affects more than US airplanes and dozens of aircraft manufacturers
