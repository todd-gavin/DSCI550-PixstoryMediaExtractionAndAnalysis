Super Giants were batting first and it was an amazing knock by the Captain K.L. Rahul to start the innings, he scored 68 of 50 balls, he solidified the innings with Hooda, as the other three top order batsmen only scored 13 runs together. Hooda scored 51 runs of just 33 balls. The lower order scored a meager 33 runs. The total in the end was 169. Shepherd and Umran gave away too many runs for Hyderabad. 

SRH's openers were looking good at the beginning but then they couldn't capitalise on the momentum, Avesh Khan took out both  Abhishek Sharma and Williamson without letting them get in the twenties. Tripathi launched a counter attack scoring 44 of 30 balls, Pooran also managed to score 34 of 24 falls. Due to fall of wickets at crucial junctions SRH fell short by 12 runs and lost the match. Avesh Khan was declared man of the match for taking 4 wickets and giving away only 24 runs.
