‌According to The Guardian, Boris Johnson is foreseen to sacrifice the head of the civil service Simon Case in the desperation to save his job, as both of them are facing criticism in the partygate issue.
‌
According to several sources, Sue Gray's report will point out blame on Case to UK’s most senior civil servant, for allowing a drinking culture to improve in which rule-breaking parties became commonplace during lockdowns.
According to Guardian, a source said that the report could also prove more damage for Johnson than the fine he was given in April for attending his birthday party because it will make clear the PM’s involvement in several other events which may have breached rules, but for which he was not fined.

“That is probably why he [Case] is still there [and not moved from his post already],” said one source. “Because Johnson needs a body.” If Case were to lose his job, however, it would mean that a civil servant who has not been fined would have lost his job, while the prime minister, who has been fined."

‌Johnson has promised to publish the report of Gray in full and without delay. The publication is now expected this week, along with a statement to the Commons by Johnson.
‌
‌Johnson is in a state wherein he will be ready to do anything to save his position.
