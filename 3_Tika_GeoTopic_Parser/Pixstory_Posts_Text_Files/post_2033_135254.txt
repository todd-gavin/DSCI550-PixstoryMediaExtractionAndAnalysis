New York Governor Kathy Hochul recently made waves with a remark that echoed uproar similar to Hillary Clinton s characterization of Republicans as a basket of deplorables during the election In a speech in which she criticized Trump her upcoming opponent Lee Zeldin and Marc Molinaro a republican congressional candidate she urged their allies to just jump on a bus and head down to Florida where you belong get out of town because they don t represent our values This is a troubling comment that does nothing to encourage her fans to support her but rather helps to pit them against Republicans It demonstrates that she has no appreciation for the viewpoints of others and has fallen for the narrative that Republicans like Trump and Zeldin are despicable people whose positions are racist and cannot be justified Predictably many on the right lambasted her for her comment after all over million New Yorkers or of the state s population voted for Trump Does she really feel that more than one third of the people in her state have abhorrent beliefs and should leave Eventually she clarified her comments and emphasized that it only applied to Zeldin Trump and Molinero Nonetheless more than a third of her state voted for Donald Trump and continues to vote for his allies so her comment still has the same weight
