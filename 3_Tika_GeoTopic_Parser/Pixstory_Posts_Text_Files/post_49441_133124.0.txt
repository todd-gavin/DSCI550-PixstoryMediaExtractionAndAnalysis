A heavily redacted version of the affidavit used to get a search warrant for former President Donald Trump's estate Mar-a-Lago was made public by the Justice Department on Friday.
According to an agent who filed the 32-page affidavit, the FBI had reason to suspect that documents holding sensitive national defence information would be discovered at the Palm Beach, Florida, home.
Despite the DOJ's objections, a federal judge had ordered the disclosure of the important document because it contained extremely sensitive information regarding the ongoing criminal investigation into Trump. One day before it was made public, U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart approved the DOJ's suggested redactions to the affidavit.
“There is also probable cause to believe that evidence of obstruction will be found” at Trump’s home, read an unredacted portion of the affidavit.
“The government is conducting a criminal investigation concerning the improper removal and storage of classified information in unauthorized spaces, as well as the unlawful concealment and removal of government records,” reads the first line of the affidavit. After that, the agent said that the investigation was started as a result of a referral from the National Archives and Records Administration in February, following NARA's receipt of 15 boxes of records from Trump's Florida mansion. When a president leaves office, all presidential records are required by law to be transferred to the National Archives.
