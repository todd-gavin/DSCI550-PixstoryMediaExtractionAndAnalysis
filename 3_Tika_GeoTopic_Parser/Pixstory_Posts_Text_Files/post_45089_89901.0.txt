Lionel Messi says he may rethink his soccer future later this year, but that "many things will change" after the World Cup in Qatar in November and December.

Argentina defeated Venezuela 3-0 in the penultimate round of South American World Cup qualification on Friday, prompting Messi's comments.

"I don't know what I will do after the World Cup. I am thinking about what is coming," Messi said.

"After Qatar I will have to reassess many things."

He went on to say that his reservations had nothing to do with his previous disappointments while playing for Argentina. Last year, he won his first trophy with the team, the Copa America, in a final against Brazil.

"It has been a while that I am happy here, since before winning the Copa. I am thankful for all this they make me feel every time I come to Argentina," Messi said.

Asked about him continuing with the national team after Qatar, Messi, who turns 35 in June, said: "I don't know, the truth is I don't know. I think about that is coming, which is close, Ecuador (on Tuesday). The preparation matches in June and September."

"Let's hope these go the best way possible. But for sure after the World Cup many things will change."

Messi, who was previously booed by PSG fans, was thrilled after scoring the game's third goal and received rousing applause from the crowd at the La Bombonera Stadium in Buenos Aires on Friday.

Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, and Uruguay have already clinched the four direct slots for the region in Qatar later this year. On Tuesday, Peru (21 points), Colombia (20 points), and Chile (19 points) will compete for fifth place, which will qualify them for an international playoff with an Asian team.

After Barcelona's Champions League round-of-16 loss to Real Madrid, both Messi and Brazil's Neymar have experienced criticism in France.
