Mantra is a form of meditation using a sound, word, or phrase. The oldest known mantras can be found in the Vedas, which are ancient religious texts from India.

Mantras are continually recited silently or aloud and are often combined with breath and rhythm. The practice of mantra meditation is said to help slow down thoughts, improve mental clarity, and enhance peace of mind.

➖Scientific benefits of mantra meditation: A 2016 study of 45 inexperienced chanters and 27 experienced chanters found that chanting “om” for 10 minutes can help:
• reduce stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms
• improve attention
• enhance positive mood
• foster feelings of social cohesion

****While they may be a useful and effective complementary tool, mantras aren’t a substitute for mental health treatment. Be sure to talk to your doctor, therapist, or psychiatrist about your symptoms and a treatment plan that’s right for you.

➖Types of mantras
The word ‘mantras’ is sometimes used interchangeably with ‘affirmations.’ Affirmations are a self-help technique that doesn’t stem from a specific culture or religion. They’re positive statements usually directed at the self and meant to calm, soothe, motivate, and encourage.

There are common affirmations you can use to help relieve symptoms of anxiety or depression. You can even make up your own. Classical Sanskrit mantras offer similar benefits to affirmations, but remember to take culture into account if you go that route.
