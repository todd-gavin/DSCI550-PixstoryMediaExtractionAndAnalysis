Fabinho, a midfielder for Liverpool, spoke about how he was caught off surprise in his pyjamas at his first meeting with Jose Mourinho before signing for Real Madrid.
In 2013, the Brazilian midfielder joined Madrid on loan from Rio Ave, making just one appearance for the first squad and another 30 for Real Madrid Castilla.
Now that Liverpool has won the Champions League and the Premier League, Fabinho can chuckle about how his major move to Real Madrid was preceded by a meeting with Mourinho in less-than-formal apparel.
What exactly happened?
“We arrived in Portugal, but I stayed around at Rio Ave for just two weeks, maybe three at the most,” Fabinho told FourFourTwo.
“I had a barbecue with other Brazilians and then my agent called to say that Real Madrid Castilla [Real Madrid reserve team] needed a right-back and wanted to know if I was interested.
“Then one night, Lucio [Araujo, brother of former Chelsea and Barcelona midfielder Deco], came and told me to pack my things because Jorge Mendes was on his way by car in the early hours of the morning.
“I was like, ‘Is something wrong?’ Nobody said a word, but then at some point in the car, Mendes said we were traveling to Madrid and that I would sign for them.
“I called my mum in Brazil to tell her about that and she started to cry.
“No-one had expected something this huge to happen in such a short time. It was a very special moment for me.”
He continued: “We headed to the hotel in Madrid, and while I was still sleeping, I woke up to somebody knocking on the door.
“I looked through the peephole and couldn't believe it. It was Mendes and Jose Mourinho!
“I was still wearing my pyjamas, not at all prepared to meet him. I didn't even know what to say.
“He wanted to welcome me. I was still a bit shy and never thought I would meet him like that!"
