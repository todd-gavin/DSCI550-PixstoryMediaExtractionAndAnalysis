Can professors not have personal lives Additionally can someone teach this guardian what objectifying means He states that he had tried to shield his son from objectifying women Sadly he appears to have failed It s not objectifying for a woman to post photos of herself but it IS objectifying for everyone to treat her like a sexual object because of an Instagram photo and to judge that her body makes her unfit to do her job Disgraceful I get so tired of seeing things like this in a country where women s bodies are somehow more shocking than sexual assault on those women Rape is not shocking but bikinis are Great
