France's President Emmanuel Macron has been on overdrive on the Russia-Ukraine crisis. He went to Moscow just days before Russia invaded rebel-held areas of Ukraine. This was after he assured the world that Russia had pledged that the crisis would not be allowed to go out of hand and that it would result in de-escalation. Nothing of that sort has taken place.

In fact, the Russian President rubbed it in when he suggested in an aggressive speech in Moscow that Macron may have been out of the loop when he suggested that the U.S. had changed its stance for the better on Russia. Putin indicated that Macron probably did not know what the change was. (https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1569675/vladimir-putin-humiliate-emmanuel-macron-russia-war-joe-biden)

Macron had also suggested that a diplomatic solution was very much possible by saying that President Biden had agreed "in principle" to meet Putin to defuse the situation. But White clarified that Biden could consider talks only if Putin didn't invade Ukraine. But that didn't happen.

Macron has tried to build a personal relationship with Putin, but there is no evidence it has made any headway.

With French presidential elections only two months away, Macron could have been busy with campaigning, but his statesman-like role has irked many European countries. Even his rivals in presidential elections are mocking him. 'I wondered whether he was really acting as president in this whole process or whether he was looking to win the Nobel Peace Prize,' said the far-Right National Rally leader Marine Le Pen. Macron's supporters have defended him, saying that it is Putin who has not kept his word. (https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10540799/Emmanuel-Macrons-rivals-mock-summit-failure.html)

Macron had told journalists that the crisis in Ukraine was taking up "more than half my time, the bulk of my time" because the world stands "at a tipping point" of history. He probably has not achieved much despite spending so much time on it. (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/12/world/europe/macron-putin-ukraine.html)
