- Get to know the locals. This is the most important thing that you can do when travelling – learn as much as you can about the people and culture of the place that you're visiting. You'll be able to have more fun and make new friends, which will come in handy when it comes to finding your way around and getting what you need. 
- Try out the local foods and drinks. Not only will this help you get closer to the culture, but it will also give you a better understanding of how the locals live their lives. Not all food is going to be great, but by trying out a variety of items, you'll be able to make an informed decision about what's best for your palate. 
- Meet up with locals for chats or events. There's no better way to get to know someone than through conversation – so go out and network! You might even find some amazing new friends along the way! 
- Live like a local during other aspects of your journey too – for example, their local trains. How they travel, how they live. Do they have to go without electricity for some hours? Do they have to fetch water from a particular place? Not only will this help you understand their lifestyle but also their struggles.
