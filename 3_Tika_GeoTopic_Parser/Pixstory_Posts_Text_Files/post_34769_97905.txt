Only a year ago they were about to celebrate the scudetto won in front of Barcelona and Real Madrid Today, however, Atletico Madrid risk not even qualifying for the next Champions League even if at the moment they are in fourth place in the standings But last night&#39;s defeat against Atletico Bilbao is worrying because Betis is only points away and has one game less Goalkeeper and captain Jan Oblak took care of photographing the moment of Simeone&#39;s men There are only four games to go until the end of the season and we have to qualify for the Champions League a must because otherwise we will have big problems but it is no longer possible to enter the field without a head as happened tonight I don&#39;t understand Everything seems fine in the locker room then you enter the field you get two yellow cards in five minutes an own goal and everything gets complicated We keep telling ourselves what we have to do better but if we don&#39;t do it it&#39;s useless I have no answer about what&#39;s going on but we can&#39;t go on like this My teammates have personality and desire but we don&#39;t show it on the pitch I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on we have to find the problem and fix it quickly
