Drug abuse is the kind of evil that people no matter how much they talk about and no matter the methods of therapy they can never fully rid society of this plague Much like movies and stories music too has been an outlet for many musicians to vent their own messages regarding drug use While many musicians in the rock and metal community have partaken in drugs and outright promoted it many have spoken negatively against it Regarding drug music or musicians doing drugs people likely know artists like Pink Floyd Eric Clapton and Ozzy Osbourne People also know how cool rock musicians have made smoking weed putting a needle in your arm and going crazy by getting lost in another world What many don t know are the rock metal albums which target drug use to create the genuine feelings of loathing disgust and hate that addiction can create in a man With drug abuse day having been yesterday people should listen to these musical gems which perfectly target drug abuse If you want to experience the loathing and hatred that drug addiction can give a person just listen to Dirt by Alice In Chains Behind this dreary metallic sound is the screaming of a man so lost in hating himself and the crushing abyss of getting to the point of no return that it is surreal with the band s open production and Sabbath like dreary metallic doomy riffs not exactly acting like a rainbow Dirt through its heaviness and authenticity just speaks that getting hooked to drugs is the worst kind of mistake because it is not just addiction it is self inflicted torture Other albums to look forward to are Black Sabbath s vol where the slow heavy doomy Master of Reality worshiping riffs speak of cocaine itself showcasing a spiral of excess and loathing that led them to break up The industrial sound of Nine Inch Nails has always been a weird package but their most famous The Downward Spiral really just captured Trent Reznor s nihilistic bleak and hopeless worldview perfectly capturing the feelings of a junkie who is simply too far gone
