We are all into having some sort of beverage often. Be it tea, coffee, etc. But what is your go-to drink? 

Mine is coffee for sure. So, let's talk about its benefit and side effects!

Benefits:
i) Coffee boosts our physical performance as the caffeine in it drives the adrenaline levels in the body. 

ii) Moderate intake helps stay focused and alert.

iii) It helps you lose weight as it contains magnesium and potassium, which is used to regulate blood sugar levels. 

Side Effects: 
i) Coffee can cause insomnia. Again, because of the caffeine in it.

ii) Bad quality coffee extracted from beans could be toxic and unhealthy, upsetting your stomach.

iii) It can grow addictive, with over 80-100 or cups or 23 liters becoming lethal enough to kill. So be wise!
