Har Hindi film ek jaisi hoti hai, aapka role 19-20 ho sakta hai idhar udhar but basically humari pictures kyu different nahi hoti hai, kyunki hum basically love stories banate hain, musical love stories. Ab usme aap police ka role karlijiye, ya lawyer, ya doctor ka role kar lijiye, aap gaane to gaoge hi gaoge. 50 dancer to aapke peejhe honge hi honge. To kyu hum kahte hain ki different hai (what's different in this, all Hindi films are the same. Your role can be slightly different but basically our films are not different because we make musical love stories. You do the role of a police, lawyer or a doctor, you will definitely sing a song with 50 dancers dancing in the background,” he told the channel.The video was shared on Reddit around the release of Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt's Brahmastra. The film has been praised for its VFX and action scenes but not for its story and treatment of plot. The film currently stands at a worldwide gross collection of ₹160 crore.
