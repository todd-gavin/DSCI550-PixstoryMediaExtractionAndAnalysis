We ponder fight and debate with ourselves and with others over Timing in both of its definitions the time when something is planned to happen and the skill of doing something at exactly the right time Perhaps what we have constituted and found Time to be is the actuality of it but even then our capability of identifying and defining the right time is dependent on the factors that we have found and created Many depend on philosophical and psychological factors for assurance of what the right time is others on logical calculations and conclusions they find to be right We do all of this just to be able to identify and achieve what we find to be our purpose our goal for this life Many a times we lose parts of ourselves during this search for a purposeful timing we neglect things that could open our minds to so much more to maybe even a greater purpose because of our tunnel vision towards this limited contained purpose and conquest of timing it correctly But all of this is what we spend the rest of our time thinking about when we could be observing the beauty of the mesmerising life around us that doesn t include various components that we humans have created behaviourally or physically in and around us It is a Trust fall with life destiny fate whatever you call it They are your choices the trajectory is what it should be for you Trust this You don t need to get overwhelmed by all that you have to do ease yourself through it step by step you ll reach where you have to By whatever means we end up finding the right Timing it does not become right without us placing our Trust in it to be right whatever our reasons may be Trust in yourself in what is happening and in knowing that come whatever circumstance in front you you will make the right choice for yourself at the right time Images Source Pinterest
