A few wrinkles and creases start to show up behind the eyes as we age. Numerous factors, including stress, insufficient sleep, dehydration, cosmetics, and even poor sleeping positions, can cause wrinkles.

There are underline behaviours or natural causes that result in eye bags -

Genetics 
Consumption of alcohol and tobacco
Not getting enough rest
Excessive makeup
High sodium intake causes the body to retain water.
Getting older causes our skin to lose its suppleness and fall out.
Allergies
Sun damage
Other medical issues

But luckily, you can help to reduce it, maybe even at home.

Cold compression is a great way to reduce inflammation. Do not put an icebag directly under your eyes though, it can lead to irritation. But cold green tea bags, cucumber or its juice, rose water, a cold wash cloth, or something like that works great. Tea, rose and cucumber even have other beneficial properties.

Caffeine has always been our best friend, isn't it? (Actually, not so much! Reduce the intake!) It does help in eye bags, which is why tea bags can be so beneficial. But why? As a vasoconstrictor, caffeine tightens blood vessels. Other than tea bags, you can also apply coffee pads!

Sunscreen! Sunscreen! Sunscreen! Do not skip that. NEVER skip that! Hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, Vitamin E , Vitamin C, Alpha hydroxy acids peptides, ceramides etc are some ingredients you can add in your routine.

If the problem becomes too bothersome, do check with your dermatologist!
