Shawn stated, in part, "After consulting with my team and working with an excellent set of health professionals, it has been evident that I need to take the time I've never taken personally to ground myself and come back stronger. Unfortunately, I must cancel the remaining North American and UK/European tour dates."

He went on, "We were hoping that with some much-needed recuperation, I would be able to resume the remainder of the dates, but at this moment, my health must come first. This does not mean I will not be creating new music, and I hope to see you on tour in the future. I know you've all been waiting so long to watch these concerts, and it kills me heart to tell you that I won't be back until I've had enough time to recover. I adore you all and am grateful for your love and support along this trip."
