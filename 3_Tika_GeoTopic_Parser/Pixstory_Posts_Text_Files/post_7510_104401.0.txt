1. Diversity

One of the city's greatest attributes is its diversity, and NYC is often thought of as America's melting pot. About 36 percent of New York's denizens hail from other countries, and you can hear as many as 800 languages spoken. I love how each person has his or her own New York Story, whether they're a native, an immigrant or a transplant.

2. Energy

There's no other city on the planet with an energy that can compete with New York. The fast pace, the buzzing traffic, the hustle and bustle of the people, the 24-hour life, and the creative spirit make NYC one of the most vibrant places in the world.

3. Inspiration

New York has a way of giving me a feeling that I can accomplish anything I set out to do. On an ordinary day when I step outside my apartment building, I might find inspiration in any place – on the street, in the subway, at a Broadway show or in a sidewalk café. A plethora of inspiring, smart, creative people dwell in the nooks and crannies of this city.

4. Opportunity

It's true that there's more competition in New York than in most other cities, but there's also a host of opportunity. Gotham is a city in which you can make that opportunity. You can come here with a dream and work hard to achieve it. I can vouch that dreams do indeed come true here every single day.

 5. Variety

New York City offers so much variety that you could live here your entire life and not eat in every restaurant, see every Broadway show, hit every jazz club, or live in every neighborhood. You never run out of new things to do, dishes to eat, places to visit, or people to meet. NYC is an ever-evolving city, and that's the beauty of living here.
