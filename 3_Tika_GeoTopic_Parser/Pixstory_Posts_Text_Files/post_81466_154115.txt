 But despite helping the side to a sixth straight home win this season the Brazilian warned that there is still plenty of hard work ahead Here s a full transcript of his post match interview I enjoyed it a lot it was a great game and I think it s a game that everyone wants to play and not just me but I think all of the players enjoyed the game To be fair I was a bit afraid I think B was offside no he wasn t offside but they were checking B for offside But it was a great feeling and the assist after just before the end of the first half I think we deserved the win and I m so happy Yeah I always try to give my best on the pitch to try to help my team mates I think we need to keep our feet on the floor and go game by game and try to win all of them Yes of course it s a big game it s we won the game and we are happy I m feeling fresh ready to go
