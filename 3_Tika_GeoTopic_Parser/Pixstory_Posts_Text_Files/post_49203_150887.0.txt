If one wishes to live in a free society where people are free to pursue their own goals and reach their full potential, capitalism is essential. A world that is not capitalist is not fit to dream. A minority will always achieve far more than the majority, and a few people in each field will do much more than the vast majority of others combined. If not, there's no point of aspiring. Dream career, dream job, dream living. What will you fight for?
These things would not exist in a really free market. While it is not true that where there is disparity, there is freedom (as in the Soviet Union), there is inequality where there is freedom. Capitalism is not a bad thing, it's a necessity for a functioning society. Nobody will want to work in socialism, thus we will have nothing.
