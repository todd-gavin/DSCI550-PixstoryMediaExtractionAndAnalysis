Mikel Arteta, the Arsenal manager, refuses to believe that a top-five Premier League finish will suffice in his pursuit of Champions League qualifying.

The Gunners go to Newcastle on Monday evening for their last game of the season, where they will face Tottenham Hotspur, who kept the pressure on with a 1-0 win over Burnley on Sunday after winning the north London derby 3-0 on Thursday.

When asked if fifth place would be a cause for celebration, Arteta was unambiguous.

"No," he replied.We want to compete in the Champions League, and that is all. We've come a long way.

"It's in our hands now, and we want to take advantage of it." The excitement and opportunity are there, and we'll want to go for it. "

The trip to St James' Park, where the Magpies have kept their Premier League status despite 
losses to top two Liverpool and Manchester City in their past two games, is followed by a home 
match against Everton on the last day.

Arsenal has not placed in the top four since finishing second in the 2015-16 season, and has had to settle for eighth place in each of the previous two seasons.

On the other hand, Arteta is sure that his players should appreciate the chance to lead the club back to the top of European football.

"It's not pressure, it's enthusiasm," he explained, "and that's what we've generated over the previous several months."

Rob Holding is suspended following his red card in the derby, while Ben White and Gabriel are both injured, leaving Arteta with a choice at the back.

"Absolutely, sure," the manager answered when asked if he would have taken the current position at the start of the season. It's a pleasant place to be.It is, as I already stated, in our hands. We've worked hard over the last six months to get here, so let's go for it. "
