Thirty days may seem like a lot of days , a lot can happen in thirty days ! If you aspire to lose belly fat or overall weight in 30 days , you may achieve some percentage of it by doing these things ; ✅👍
1 Healthy Calories deficit ; 
Burn more calories than you eat or vice versa . 
2 Be active ; 
or for weight training , if not then start some form of exercise . More importantly do physical activities other than in the gym too . Eg : walk during calls .
3 Sleep properly ; 
get your 8 hours of sleep , it is necessary to recover from the physical workout and will energise you for the next day .
4 Avoid Stress ; 
as it increases the hormone cortisol , which can increase your cravings for caloric refined carbs and comfort food , which will prevent you from losing weight (especially in your belly) .
5 Limit indulgence ; 
I know we are only humans . Limit your indulgences to one meal a week , cutting back on eating after dinner (like that late-night scoop of ice cream you just can't resist) , and limiting caloric beverages such as alcohol , soda , and other sugary drinks !
When you lose weight , you lose inches not only on your belly but on your waist , hips , chest , arms , legs , shoulders , and neck . Don’t aim for target area reduction but for a lifestyle change . But do not expect a miracle in 30 days . Anything drastic may disrupt your body’s balance and hormones .
Save these tips and watch yourself transform ! ✅
