“The United States is coming to an end,” says Stephen Marche, a novelist and columnist, at the start of his much-talked about new book, ‘The Next Civil War: Dispatches from the American Future.’ The title – and the central idea – echoes another new work, by political scientist Barbara F. Walter, ‘How Civil Wars Start,’ which is also hogging op-ed comments these days. Is the nation so polarized and on the verge of a breakdown? Or is it just the liberal intelligentsia’s exaggerated fears?

“Running battles between protestors and militias, armed rebels attempting to kidnap sitting governors, uncertainty about the peaceful transition of power—reading about them in another country, you would think a civil war had already begun,” writes the former Esquire columnist. As a Canadian, he argues, he has an outsider’s perspective to notice what’s so obvious that Americans might be missing it. 

Reviewers describe it as a work of speculative non-fiction: https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/03/how-politics-got-so-polarized There’s reporting mixed with imagined future scenarios, a series of entirely possible disasters, each has the US sinking in anarchy (a future president is assassinated, a bomb destroys Capitol, white-supremacist militia in gunfight with US army…) 

Marche’s diagnosis: The nation has become irreversibly divided and no leader in foreseeable future will be able to bring the two sides together. A sense of shared purpose is missing, and the institutions are failing. He doesn’t predict but rather considers a possibility that the US could disintegrate into four countries: roughly the Northeast, the West Coast, the Midwest plus the Southeast, and Texas. 

Most reviewers are sympathetic but one commentator disagrees. Ross Douthat, the conservative columnist at the New York Times, finds the civil-war fantasies rather far-fetched, hinging on too many ifs: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/12/opinion/civil-war-america.html He admits there’s deep division in opinions, but argues that it’s limited only to beliefs and has not translated (mostly) into actions. Also, he questions Marche’s definition of a civil war, which “starts at twenty-five deaths within a year.” Acts of anti-government violence killed more people than that annually in the later 2010s, Douthat adds.
