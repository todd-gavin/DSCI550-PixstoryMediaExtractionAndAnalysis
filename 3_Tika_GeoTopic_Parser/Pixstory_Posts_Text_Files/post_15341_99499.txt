In the first full year of operation, the Ecopolietilene consortium recorded exponential growth. In the collection made by the consortium for the management of waste from polyethylene goods, it reached nearly a thousand tons, while the consortium members reached companies including manufacturers, importers, brand owners and distributors Active since June when it was recognized by the Ministry of Ecological Transition Ecopolyethylene in a few months has thus established itself as one of the most dynamic realities in promoting real circularity for the particular type of plastic that makes up polyethylene goods The consortium is making an important contribution to the process of circular economy said the president of Ecopolietilene Fabio Pedrazzi in the recent annual meeting The numbers of the first year of activity describe a decidedly lively consortium and ready to play a leading role together with the member companies in environmental challenges Polyethylene goods are very important not only due to the great diffusion and presence they have in our daily life but also due to their circular value they are in fact recyclable at logistical commitment the missions carried out throughout Italy were almost touching on this is a fact that reveals the important investments that the consortium is making to guarantee a correct treatment path for this type of waste. The traceability system put in place by the autonomous system allows us to affirm that all the almost thousand tons were in fact sent for recovery through partner plants
