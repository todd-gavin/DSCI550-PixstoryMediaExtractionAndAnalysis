Dear soulmate,



It has been a year since we were together, I had so much laughter with you and we had so much fun together.  The time we spend with each other is way more than the time we spend with ourselves. we have shared all the possible details about each other and the career i am pursuing because I got to know about these unless you told me. And I wanted to express my love and care for you through the possible little things I can do for you and i am very happy that you came into my life and i am so thankful for you. Thank you so much for having me in your life. It has always been an amazingly wondrous time we had together. the times we spent talking into the night, the times we spent laughing from inside the bed sheet at 3 am, and the way we used to tease the same person and make fun of our friends and you came into my life with happiness and gave me so many things to enjoy and the best of all is your love. And not just you gave me happiness also you introduced me to your generous friends and made me talk freely to them and I don't know if anyone would do that. You will always be the special person who brought me so much happiness into my life. With that one smile of yours can make my bad day into a good one.you are someone who will always be in the book of my memories. You are the first person i am being myself without showing any extra. We have crossed the first stage of our friendship today and I am so happy we are still together despite all the fights and arguments and misunderstandings we have. I want you to know that no matter what i will go to any extend to save the precious and sacred friendship of ours.  I love you so much and this is from your soulmate AKA your best friend.

-With love
