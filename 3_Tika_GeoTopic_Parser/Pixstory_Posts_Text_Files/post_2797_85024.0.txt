Presidential elections in France will take place in April. Opinion polls show that President Emmanuel Macron is leading them despite failing to stop the war between Russia and Ukraine and facing embarrassment within his country over the issue.

 Macron may not have successfully stopped Russia from invading Ukraine, but the invasion has put his right-wing rivals Russophile Marine Le Pen and Eric Zemmour. Their support for Vladimir Putin in the recent past vanished after invading Ukraine. Both are finding it hard to defend their previous statements, and the French media is rubbing it in.

The latest opinion polls show that Macron has six to seven points ahead of Le Pen, Valerie Pecresse of the centre-right Les Republicains and Zemmour. (https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-crisis-shapes-french-presidential-race-/6463264.html)

As Macron is seen to be working very hard for stopping the war and leading European efforts, his rivals feel constrained to criticise him as that would be construed as being "anti-Frace." 

As far his rivals are concerned, the far-right was riding high on anti-European Union sentiment and a strong push for nationalism. They had also taken pro-Putin position, but not any longer. For instance, Le Pen had supported Russia's annexation of Crimea and claimed that she admired Putin and is now criticising Putin. 

At a time when the French people have come out largely to support Ukraine, one of Macron's like rivals in the polls, Zemmour has been criticized for suggesting that France should not take in Ukrainian refugees.
