Full match player ratings below (Real Madrid):
Andriy Lunin (6): Made a few crucial saves. Couldn't do much with Ferran Torres' goal.
Ferland Mendy (7.5): Comfortable with the box and sound in both offense and defence. His overlapping with Vini on the left flank proved effective over an unsettled Barca defence.
David Alaba (7): Covered well the likes of Raphinha and Lewandowski and rendered them helpless. Made 3 clearances and 6 recoveries.
Eder Militao (6): Despite a few lapses in concentration, the Brazilian proved to be a beast in the game. Didn't give Lewandowski a sniff in goal as he was always lurking with him. 
Dani Carvajal (7): Kept a continuous pressure on the Barca defence with his quick runs. 
Aurelien Tchouameni (7): Couldn't produce much in attack but kept his defensive duties on point. Rendered Pedri incapable to do his magic with his strict man-marking.
Toni Kroos (9): The German never has a bad day. Was brought down by Busquets but managed to put an incisive through ball for Vinicius which ended in goal from Karim Benzema. Set up the tempo of the game and synced well with Modric (as always).
Luka Modric (8.5): Kept the likes of Pedri and De Jong quiet with his skilled foot and in coverage. 
Vinicius (7.5): Rampaged through the Barcelona defence. Was covered by Barca most of the time but still contributed to a goal.
Fede Valverde (9): Another goal in the bag for the Uruguayan against Barcelona. Continues his stellar form this season and dismantled his marker Balde quite efficiently. 
Karim Benzema (7): A goal to the good before he flies off for the Ballon D'Or gala.
