It is often said that classic fashion never dies; it only renews and rejuvenates itself with time. 🫶🏻🥹 One of the most classic silhouettes of all times and a favourite of the 70s, ‘the bell-bottoms’ seems to have made a comeback in the fashion scene of late.✨️😉
Bell-bottoms, pants with legs that become wider below the knee, were an extremely popular fashion trend during the late 1960s and 1970s. The belled or flared legs on bell-bottom pants were originally a functional design, worn by those who worked on boats since the 17th century. 🌼💗
