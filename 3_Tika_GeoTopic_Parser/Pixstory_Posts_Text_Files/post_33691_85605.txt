After the home draw against Hellas Verona Vincenzo Italiano provided his analysis in the press conference Like Tudor I too could say that we deserved to win in the second half we had goalscoring and we grew exponentially by never letting Verona score The draw makes us look ahead we come from high-level performances but we sin with concreteness today we could have done more harm to Verona Ikon if he doesn&#39;t play he won&#39;t play if I remove him I&#39;m asked why he isn&#39;t used at the start of the match he had a problem with his adductor and was conditioned by this so I preferred to put in fresh players I think the three substitutions turned the game around The referee booked me because I had left the technical area I thought there was a foul but so for him it wasn&#39;t Torreira He has these insertions against certain teams that play man on man not easy for a point guard but I really liked it in the second half, too bad for the chances he had
