I bumped into a kind friend from highschool yesterday, who kept repeating something along the lines of: “Your glasses! Your whole look has changed. You look so cool, dude!”

As an awkward grin plastered itself on my face throughout our conversation, I kept saying: “Thank you, I’m just trying to be me!” followed by a shoulder shrug. 

A few years ago, the same interaction would have had me breaking into a sweat — any compliment would make me want to leave my skin out of the discomfort of being present in my body, in a character that didn’t represent who I was. 

I’ve always been hesitant of self-love and mindfulness because much of my identity and self had been built around the cycles of self-hatred and guilt that came from not understanding the disconnect between who I was and who I was performing to be. 

Finding the language to understand myself as a gender-nonconforming trans person, slowly has me unlearning the comfort I’d associated with self-hatred. 

I am grateful to be in a world with gender-nonconforming artist ALOK, whose words have taught me how to center love as a way of life — “The more that I learn and grow the more that I am turning to love as the answer. Healing and compassion as a politics. As I learn to embrace all parts of me, I feel increasingly compelled to extend that acceptance outward. The self/other distinction collapses. Because I am learning to love myself, I love you,” ALOK writes. 

I have a long way to go, but I’m understanding that reframing my headspace with thoughts that aren’t created by guilt, helps me feel that maybe someday I can get closer to leading my living with love too.
