Everyone wants to have a long and healthy life. Everyone has a wish to stay fit and young till we grow old and we often end up going to gym, doing aggresive workouts and trying to keep with different diet routines, but sometimes when we try to strictly follow such difficult routine and balance out our work life, we forget the most important thing to have a long and healthy life, ie enjoy life to the fullest. 

There's no need to put so much stress in our already stressful and exhausting life. Just breathe a little and go for evening strolls everyday. What's not to like about evening strolls? It's free, easy to do and easy on the joints. 

A famous book 'Ikigai' is about how Japanese people live a healthy and long life. The book itself says that 30-60 min walk everyday is good enough for the proper functioning of body. Evening strolls alone or with your friends can help to energize and refresh you body and mind. 

People who walk daily have less body fat than people who don't walk.Research finds that people who exercise regularly in their fifties and sixties are 35% less likely to die over the next eight years than their non-walking counterparts. That number shoots up to 45% less likely for those who have underlying health condition. Evening strolls also help to lighten up mood as walking releases natural painÂ­killing endorphins to the body. Walking not only helps in reducing weight but also strengthens our muscles. Women above 50 who cannot perform difficult excercises can walk for 30-45 min daily for better sleep and longer life.

As walking appears to cut the risk of death by eliminating toxics and strengthening immunity, people should rather go for evening strolls in open areas than working out in closed gyms. Walking can lead to longevity and healthy life and it helps to fight anxiety and stress. 
So what are you waiting for?? Wear your shoes and go out for a stroll with your friends and family because everyday counts.
