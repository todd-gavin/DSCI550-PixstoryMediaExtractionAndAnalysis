For many moviegoers, the December 2009 release of Avatar marked their first exposure to digital 3D. Hollywood Reporter said that the film would go on to become the most successful of all time, grossing over $2.8 billion worldwide. Now that their pioneering film has been beautifully and completely remastered for today's theatres, director James Cameron and producer Jon Landau will reintroduce audiences to it. Beginning on Friday, viewers will return to a Pandora full of vibrant textures and colours that they didn't see the first time the film was in theatres, when many of them were outfitted with old 3D systems and first-generation digital cinema projectors. Additionally, for younger moviegoers, this may be their first chance to see Pandora in 3D on a large screen. Landauâ€™s Lightstorm Entertainment remastered the film in 4K in a high-dynamic range, with select scenes at 48-frames-per-second.
