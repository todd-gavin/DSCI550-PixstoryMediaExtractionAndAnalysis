During the tense Champions League match between Manchester City and Real Madrid, Micah Richards and Jamie Carragher produced a television gold moment when the former almost vomited up his food.

After 90 exciting minutes at the Etihad Stadium, City won the first leg of the semi-final, 4-3. There was no shortage of individual brilliance or magnificent goals. Kevin De Bruyne's stunning diving header, which latched onto an inch-perfect cross from Riyad Mahrez, gave the hosts the lead after only two minutes.

The goal threw home fans into a frenzy, giving City the perfect start against the 13-time European winners as they seek redemption for last season's final defeat.
Given that the game had just started seconds before, the ex-England international may have assumed that he would have plenty of time to eat a dish of pasta after completing his pre-match punditry responsibilities. 

De Bruyne, on the other hand, was ecstatic to reach the back of the net, and his noisy celebrations nearly caused part of his supper to spill out as he said, "Yes, yes, yes!"

The humorous event was not televised live, but replays were shown later in the programme when co-pundit Carragher brought it up, leading to even more funny moments in the studio. 

The Liverpool great continued to analyze how Richards was able to "manage" his spaghetti and keep it in his mouth despite the fact that it appeared to be falling out.
After the game, the 2005 Istanbul hero rushed to Twitter to warn City that the second leg at the Santiago Bernabeu was going to be difficult. 

Carragher put it this way: "With the #MCIRMA game, the #ChampionsLeague is at its finest, and Real Madrid is really fortunate to still be in it! Throughout, the defense was poor, particularly from Madrid, but # BÃ©lhema keeps them alive! "
