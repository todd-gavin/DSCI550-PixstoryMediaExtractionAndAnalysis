Well, I think the President  of right. 

President Joe Biden on Friday said US Supreme Court committed “tragic error" after it overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade abortion rights decision and called the ruling ‘sad day for the court and the country’. In an address, Biden said the abortion ruling “took away" Americans’ constitutional right and called the decision the result of “extreme ideology".

“With Roe gone, let’s be very clear, the health and life of women in this nation are now at risk," he said.

The court has done what it has never done before, expressly take away a constitutional right that is so fundamental to so many Americans," Biden said. “It’s a realization of an extreme ideology and a tragic error by the Supreme Court in my view."

In a major setback for reproductive health rights in the United States, the Supreme Court struck down the nearly 50-year-old Roe v. Wade verdict, allowing states to ban abortions.
