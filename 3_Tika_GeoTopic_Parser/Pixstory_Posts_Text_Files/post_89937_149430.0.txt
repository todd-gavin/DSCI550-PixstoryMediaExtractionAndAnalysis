Eduardo Camavinga has been slated for a poor performance for France during their 2-0 defeat to Denmark in the Nations League.
Les Bleus rounded off a miserable Nations League campaign with a loss in Copenhagen. Their only win in six games was a 2-0 win at home to Austria last time out following which put on another dismal display against the Danes.
Didier Deschamps once again went with his favored 3-4-1-2 formation but experimented with a number of different players. Camavinga was handed just his second France start and his fourth cap, but failed to impress and was hooked at half-time.
The 19-year-old midfielder is considered one of the best young players in world football and has been in sparkling form for Real Madrid this term. But he looked horribly off the pace against an excellent Denmark side.
Some have speculated that he may have blown the chance to make the World Cup squad later this year.
A spot in central midfield for France has fierce competition for places and a such a performance will not do his chances of going to Qatar any good.
After the defeat, supporters took to Twitter to slam the teenage midfielder.
Before the clash with Denmark, Camavinga claimed that he owed his rapid rise in the game to the iconic Real Madrid duo of Toni Kroos and Luka Modric.
The former Rennes midfielder is seen as a long-term replacement for one the midfielder pair, but ensured to give credit to the legends.
