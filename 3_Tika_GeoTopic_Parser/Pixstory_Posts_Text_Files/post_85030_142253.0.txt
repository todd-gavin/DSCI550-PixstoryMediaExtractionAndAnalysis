My name is Sahaana. I'm an avid reader who easily gets attached to fictional characters.  I like draw the world with my brush and paints, and like exploring different forms of art. I'm a trained Bharatanatyam dancer, practicing for over 13 years, and also groove to hip Bollywood songs. I'm inquisitive and like to see life as glass half full. I want to try new things in life, and hope to spread happiness 💫
