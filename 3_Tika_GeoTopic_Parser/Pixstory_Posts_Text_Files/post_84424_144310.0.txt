With startups being more prominent than ever before, it's no surprise that more employment opportunities are arising on a daily basis. Of course, graduates have many more opportunities to get employment, but what about students, how can they gain an advantage in the competitive and merciless world? I'd say an internship would be a great way to gain that advantage, being only for a defined period students can experience how the adults keep the ball rolling. There are many more advantages, such as:
1. Experiencing different fields of work. 
2. Gaining experience
3. Learning from seniors and potential mentors. 
4. Building a stronger resume
5. Building Confidence
6. Helping in finding career goals. 
It is true that education is important for finding a suitable job with a good package, but it wouldn't hurt to have hands-on experience of how the office works.
