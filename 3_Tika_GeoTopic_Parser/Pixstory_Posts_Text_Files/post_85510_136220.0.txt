Paris Saint Germain Feminine have announced the signing of Chinese International, LiMengwen. The Chinese International has joined the French side on Loan until June 2023 fromJiangsu Club.

Her journey in the Chinese Women’s Football team has also been very special. Mengwen madeit through the ranks after going through the Under 17 and the Under 19 Selections and finally,she made her debut for the A side in August 2019 at the Asian Games in Jakarta.

Ever since, Mengwen has been associated with the senior Chinese Women’s football team andrecently, she clinched her 3rd Women’s Asia Cup title in India.

PSG Feminine have seen a topsy-turvy ride recently. They won the Couple de France Femininetitle back in May 2022, beating Yzeure in the final by a hefty margin of 8-0. After that, they werebeaten by Manchester United in the semi-final of the Amos Women's French Cup 2022. Theonly goal conceded by them in the game came from United captain Katie Zelem assisted by
Luis Garcia, the second-half substitute who made an instant impact from the bench.

They also drew against Barcelona Feminine. They recently beat Levante Women.

PSG Women were drawn recently against Swiss side Hacken, who will be facing them in theround two ties of the Women’s Champions League. Arsenal, Bayern, and PSG have tricky roundtwo ties to overcome before any dreams of Champions League glory can be pondered on.
