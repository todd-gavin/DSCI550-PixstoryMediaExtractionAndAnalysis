Opportunities
The appointment of Gerrard as manager was a bold move from the management and it is clear that they have ambitious plans for the near future. While Gerrard proved himself in Scotland with Rangers there are still question marks regarding his management and this gig at Villa is a good opportunity for him to prove his worth in management. As mentioned earlier, Villa possess a well-balanced squad filled with a mix of young talent and experience. They are a better team than the poor performances they have shown in the league so far and they will be looking to bounce back strongly and string a set of positive results together.
Threats
The quality of the Premier League is so high that it has become difficult for teams to compete consistently. In order to do this, many players need to be putting in strong performances on a consistent basis and Villa have seen the consequences of not performing well so far this season. Gerrard needs to find a way to ensure that they can compete aggressively consistently as they face the threat of finding themselves in a position that they should not be in given the quality of their squad.
