Cricket Scotland's board resigned a day ahead of the publication of a review of racism in the sport.
‌
‌The racism investigation was commissioned by funding body SportScotland last year and is due to be published on Monday. T is anticipated to report on institutional racism in the Scottish game. 

"We are all truly sorry and have apologized publicly to everyone who has experienced racism, or any other form of discrimination, in cricket in Scotland," they said.

They raised concerns that plans to find a speedy resolution to the racism issues, and to modernize the governance of the sport were "unachievable within the timetable proposed and the current governance framework".

The incidents happened after the allegations - some made by all-time leading wicket-taker Majid Haq - of racism and discrimination. 

He represented Scotland on more than 200 occasions but did not play again after being sent home from the 2015 World Cup. At the time he indicated he felt victimized on grounds of race.

Aamer Anwar, the lawyer representing Mr. Haq and Qasim Sheikh told BBC Radio Scotland "Many who have followed in their footsteps have complained about a culture of systemic bullying, of racism, of humiliation and there has never been any accountability and  transparency,"

Racism in the sports industry isn't new but this should not be promoted and should have a solution. Racism among sportsmen only destroys talents and reduces opportunities for people.
