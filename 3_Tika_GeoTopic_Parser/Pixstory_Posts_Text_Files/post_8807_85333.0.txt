Pak Invasion of Kashmir continues………

I had little sleep that night as the telephone kept ringing every minute. After His Highness left at 2 A. M. an officer came from the front and informed me that the Dogra Chief of Staff had been wound- ed and was lying on the road with six or seven bullets in his body. He had ordered the rest of his troops to retreat to a position of vantage but did not wish to leave the place where he lay. Though fatally wounded, he was determined to give a fight as long as he was alive.

Next morning Mr. V. P. Menon and I flew to Delhi. We arrived at Safdarjung airport at about 8 A. M. where a car was waiting. I immediately drove to the Prime Minister’s House on York Road. The Prime Minister and Sardar Patel both were there and were apprised of the situation that had arisen. In view of the advance of the raiders towards the town of Baramula and Srinagar, I requested immediate military aid on any terms. I said somewhat emphatically that the town of Srinagar must be saved at any cost from loot and destruction. During the talk, the Prime Minister said that even if the town was taken by the tribesmen, India was strong enough to re-take it. Its recapture, however, could not have undone the damage that would have resulted. I, therefore, firmly but respectfully insisted on the acceptance of my request for im- mediate military aid. The Prime Minister observed that it was not easy on the spur of the moment to send troops as such an operation required considerable preparation and arrangement, and troops could not be moved without due deliberation merely on my demand. I was, however, adamant in my submission; Prime Minister also was sticking to his own view.
