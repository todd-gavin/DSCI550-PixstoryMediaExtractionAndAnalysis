Although there is a heated controversy over whether Chicken Parmigiana should be reduced to 'parma' or 'parmi,' Aussies everywhere share a liking for this pub classic. 

The dish has been around since 1898, but it was originally an eggplant parmigiana brought to the United States by Italian immigrants. Until the 1980s, when the price of chicken plummeted and it became more available, the chicken variant became a 'fine dining' option. 

Despite the fact that "chicken parm" is popular in the United States, the Australian version is distinct. It's made up of crumbed chicken, tomato sauce, and cheese, then finished off on the grill until the cheese has turned a gorgeous golden brown. It's an Australian classic, served with chips or salad (and maybe a beer or two).
