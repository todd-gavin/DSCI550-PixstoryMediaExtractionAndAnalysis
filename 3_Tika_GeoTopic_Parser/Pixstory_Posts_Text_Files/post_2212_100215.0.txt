A former Congress leader, Manik Saha, will take oath as Tripura's new chief minister on Sunday, a day after Biplab Deb resigned from the post. 

Saha, a dental surgeon, had joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2016. Prior to that, he was a member of the Congress party. 

Interestingly, Saha is the fourth BJP chief minister who joined the saffron party after quitting the Congress. The other three are Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and his Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur counterparts Prema Khandu and Biren Singh. 

Another interesting aspect of Saha's political career is that he had taken over the Tripura BJP chief's charge in 2020 from Biplab Deb and now he has replaced him as the chief minister as well. 

Saha will have to resign from the Rajya Sabha and get elected to the state assembly within six months. The assembly elections are due in the state in February 2023.

The BJP leadership was apparently unhappy with Deb's style of functioning and had decided that the party cannot go to assembly elections under him. The infighting within the state unit had also escalated in the recent months. 

A glimpse of the factionalism was seen soon after Saha's announcement when Fire and Cooperative Minister Ramprasad Paul, created ruckus in the BJP office in Agartala.
