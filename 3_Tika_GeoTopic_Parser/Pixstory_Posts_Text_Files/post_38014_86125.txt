Owen Coyle is the name that is doing the rounds in Indian football as of now The former Republic of Ireland player led the Jamshedpur FC side to the Hero Indian Super League Winner Shield But the story could have been very different if Chennaiyin FC would have wanted it to be in Owen Coyle first came to India after the Marina Machans brought him in as John Gregory s replacement in the ISL season Chennaiyin FC were struggling near the bottom of the ISL table but Owen Coyle orchestrated a fairy tale for the South Indian club The manager won over the fans as he led CFC all the way to the Finals of the season just falling short of a well deserved title But at the end of the season Owen Coyle left Chennaiyin Why Because of contractual issues The manager demanded an improved contract with reportedly double the amount of what he was earning But the Chennaiyin FC management felt that it was too much and allowed him to leave Chennaiyin FC eventually replaced Owen Coyle with Csaba Lazlo in the season and Bozidar Bandovic in the season But both the managers failed to ignite the team As a result the Marina Machans failed to even qualify for the playoffs on both occasions Two years down the line the question remains the same in the mind of all the Chennaiyin FC fans What would have happened if Chennaiyin had agreed to extend the contract of Owen Coyle Was it Chennaiyin FC s biggest mistake in their short history
