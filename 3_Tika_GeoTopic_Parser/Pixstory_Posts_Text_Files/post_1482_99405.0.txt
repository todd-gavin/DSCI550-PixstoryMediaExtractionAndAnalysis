Zinc-ion batteries are built with zinc and manganese metals, which are mined and processed in North America. 

Zinc-ion energy storage systems have the same power, performance and footprint as lithium-ion, meaning it can work as a drop-in replacement for systems currently in the market. 

Interest in Zinc-based batteries as an alternative to lithium-ion appears to have grown in recent months.

Just last week, zinc-air battery storage company Eos Energy Enterprises secured a US$200 million investment commitment to commercialise and scale up production. Another company, E-Zinc, raised US$25 million in a series A at the start of April.
