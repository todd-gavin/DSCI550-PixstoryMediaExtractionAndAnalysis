It's hard to describe the current discussion on euthanasia and assisted suicide as "hilarious." But as the Guardian reported, Samantha Strauss, the show's creator and writer, turns tragedy into comedic gold with her timely and cunningly entertaining series that walks a thin line between morbidity and hilarity. 

The story of Kate (Frances O'Connor), a physician who works in palliative care and opposes assisted dying, is ultimately characterised by a humanistic spirit. However, after witnessing her mother Edie (Harriet Walter) attempt suicide, Kate's viewpoint changes. 

With occasionally breath-taking moments, the tone is provocative and slightly off-kilter. One such scene features Roy Billing surreptitiously climbing a ladder into the sky.
