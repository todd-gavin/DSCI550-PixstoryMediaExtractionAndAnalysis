Jayeshbai Jorder is such wonderful movie I reallyy enjoyed the movie The comedy was decent It s available on Amazon Prime Good movie with a great message Where it talks about how a girl child is equal to a boy And marriage is not just a thing to make babies It s having a partner to support and care for each other and express their love to each other with a kiss
