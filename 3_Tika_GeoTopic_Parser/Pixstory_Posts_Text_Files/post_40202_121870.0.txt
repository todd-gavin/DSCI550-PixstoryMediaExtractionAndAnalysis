It could be game over for Sarah Paulson and American Horror Story.

As per Metro Entertainment, created by Ryan Murphy and Brad Fulchuk, the horror anthology series centres on different spooky characters and locations, ranging from a witch coven to a possessed farmhouse. 

The 47-year-old joined the phenomenon more than a decade ago and has worn many masks, playing a psychic, a journalist, a witch, a two-headed twin and a junkie ghost.

But the Ocean’s Eight star implied she might be moving on to pastures new, citing several reasons including her ‘nervous system’ being no longer able to cope with the terrifying scenes. 

‘It’s not that I’m not open to it. I’m always open to it, but I feel like I’ve been doing it for a long time, and people might start getting sick of me in that world,’ she told Variety.

‘Let someone else scream and run and cry for a second. Other people can do that too! 

‘Also, my nervous system. There was a time when I was younger when I was like, “I can do this all night. I love it!” Now I’m like, “Momma’s tired!”’
