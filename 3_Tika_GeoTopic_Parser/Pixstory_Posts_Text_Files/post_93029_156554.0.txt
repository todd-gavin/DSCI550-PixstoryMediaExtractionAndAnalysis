Reading scripts is interesting, however analysing them and adapting them into plays of your own, may get challenging.So here’s what I do to analyse and understand scripts and adapt them into your own scripts.1. Learn the drama vocabulary:From plot, structure, vision, plot-hole to foreshadowing, metaphor, symbolism and so forth, one should know the drama vocab and know what they’re talking about.2. Read about the playwright and the era they were writing about:This gives one a clearer insight as to what the playwright actually meant.3. Reread the play multiple times:This will allow you to get new insights every time you read the play4. Make notes and write down your analysis5. Write character-sketches6. CHALLENGE THE PLAY:Now that you’ve understood the play to your best knowledge. Challenge the plot, adapt it into something you think is more relevant to your time. Read about the era you want to write about. Drop in socio-political hints of that time.Adapt the characters to be people that you feel give real justice to your plot.Find plot-holes and eliminate or adapt them into something more relevant and voila! You have your brand new script.
