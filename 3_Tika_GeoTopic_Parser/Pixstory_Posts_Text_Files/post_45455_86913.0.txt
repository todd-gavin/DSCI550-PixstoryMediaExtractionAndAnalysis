On Saturday evening, Cristiano Ronaldo made history by scoring a goal against Tottenham Hotspur.
Manchester United's talisman scored a hat-trick in a 3-2 win over Tottenham Hotspur, his 805th, 806th, and 807th goals in an incredible professional career.
With the last two of the three goals, he has now passed Josef Bican as the all-time leading scorer in men's professional football.
That's true, no one – no one – has scored more goals in his career than Ronaldo, which is quite incredible.
Despite the fact that he turned 37 in February, the Portugal international's excellent physical condition means he will most certainly continue to score goals for many more years.
So, in honour of Ronaldo's world-record-breaking performance against Spurs, we've compiled a list of the top ten goal scorers in football history to further emphasise the ridiculousness of his figures.
Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal)
806 goals in 1,110 games | 2001 to present
Josef Bican (Czech Republic)
805+ goals in 530+ games | 1931 to 1956
Romario (Brazil)
772 goals 994 games | 1985 to 2007
Lionel Messi (Argentina)
759 goals in 961 games | 2003 to present
Pele (Brazil)
757 goals in 831 games | 1957 to 1977
Ferenc Puskas (Hungary)
746+ goals in 754+ games | 1943 to 1966
Gerd Muller (Germany)
734 goals in 793 games | 1962 to 1981
Ferenc Deak (Hungary)
576+ goals (total number of games unknown) | 1940 to 1957
Uwe Seller (Germany)
575+ goals (total number of games unknown) | 1953 to 1978
Tulio Maravilha (Brazil)

What a fantastic accomplishment by Ronaldo.
Unless Messi rediscovers his scoring touch at Paris Saint-Germain in the foreseeable future, his everlasting rival's position at the top of the heap will likely be secure for many years.
