‌Britain has improved a lot since the Queen succeeded the throne. Britain has changed into a wealthier nation with a low level of poverty. 
‌
‌ Women’s participation in the workforce has more than doubled and Britain is today a far less racist country than it was then.

But the national mood is different from 20 years ago at the golden jubilee, or even the diamond jubilee in 2012. In the early 2000s, Britain looked like the last to be on an upward trajectory after the recession of the 1990s.

  British culture around the world has changed the establishment of the minimum wage and a more substantial welfare settlement, particularly for pensioners and families with children. 

Even Northern Ireland achieved peace and power devolved to Scotland and Wales. 

The product of all this is that the optimism of 20 years ago has been replaced with unhealthy levels of cynicism in our governing class; a sense things will proceed to improve has been edged out by the gloom. 

 Meanwhile, rates of child poverty are increasing after a decade of welfare cuts that have left parents reliant on food banks and charity in decree to ensure their children are warm and well-fed. The rule of law has been weakened by cuts to frontline policing and court hesitations mean some crime victims are pausing more than two years for their cases to reach court.
