Adoring people can be a way of life for most of us. 

The adoration comes from a sense of self inadequacy in many cases. That is  someone is doing something that we can only dream of. 

Perhas sports resembles life more closely than movies or literature. 

We see sportspersons as embodiment of qualities that makes life worth cherishing: grit, determination, ability to negotiate success and defeat stoically. 

Often the adoration gathers other reinforcing factors such as nationalism, ethinicity or a compelling ideological mooring. 

At the end we get drawn to sportspersons in a way that we dont even logically understand or could rationally look at. 

That makes sportspersons burdened with expectations that their feeble shoulders often fail to carry. 

Being fallible is a luxury for them. Often,  the human frailties do the champion athletes  in. 

Life is such for sporting fans. Then that never deters a fan to recoil in disgust or fume in frustration for ever. For,  life means more. Even if it entails encountering the more of the same.
