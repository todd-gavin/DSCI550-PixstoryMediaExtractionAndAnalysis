The Money Exchangers Union in Sarai Shahzada, the biggest money exchanging market in the country, said on Monday that based on a decision by the Islamic Emirate, Boli market has been closed in Sarai Shahzada.

According to the union, a few days ago the Economic Commission of the Council of Ministers of the Islamic Emirate made a decision to close Boli market.

Boli is a market inside Sarai Shahzada where large amounts of money are exchanged, where also the value of the afghani against foreign currencies is being determined.

Along with money-exchanging shops, individual vendors also used to do business in the Boli market.

“There were problems in Boli. Some individuals (vendors) were spreading fake reports and fake exchang rates in Boli,” said Abdul Rahman Zirak, a spokesman of the union.

As the Boli market has closed, vendors have also been pulled out of Sarai Shahzada.

Meanwhile, a number of venders said the closure of Boli has led to dozens of vendors losing their jobs and will lead to problems determining the real value of the Afghani against foreign currencies.

“Now we cannot change our money into dollars or Pakistani rupees. To whom we should sell? Boli is no longer active,” said Farid Ahmad, a vendor.

“The Islamic Emirate has closed Boli market, while people are trying to make a living,” said Sayed Hashim, another vendor.

In the past months, especially in December when the afghani plunged in value against the dollar, Boli was also closed. However, the vendors were allowed to do business inside Sarai Shahzada market. Now, it is not clear when the venders will be allowed back to the market.
