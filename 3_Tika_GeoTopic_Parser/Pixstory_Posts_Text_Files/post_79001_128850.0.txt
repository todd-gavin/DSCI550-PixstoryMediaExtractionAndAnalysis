My dog was sick for a very long time. It was almost 2 months since he had been that way. He would not go for a walk, would not jump or wag his tail, and he would not bark or shake hands. He would just spend hours sitting under the sofa chair. We all were worried.

We took him to the vet like 7 or 8 times over these past 2 months but there was no improvement. His body was covered with bruises and cuts and blood all the time. He had some kind of allergy or something. He would start to bleed even if we touched any part of his skin with a finger. His entire body was shattered.

My mother thought he was going to die soon. I did not believe it and the very same day she said that I told the Universe that I wanted him to be back to normal with a healthy body.

Then suddenly, yesterday, after we gave him a bath, all the bruises were cleared and there was no blood for the first time. He was so filled with excitement and so cheerful. He jumped and ran and barked. And he is sitting right now, not under the sofa looking hurt but in front of the main door. I could not be happier when I saw my familyâ€™s eyes and smiles when they saw him being the way he used to be yesterday. He is completely normal and does everything he used to do. I am overwhelmed with happiness. I was not shocked because I knew that he would be well soon. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

All you need is to have faith in the Universe and the law of attraction. Thank you. Thank you so much to The Secret. Thank you so much for The Secret Super App. Thank you, Rhonda. The Secret has changed my life completely. Thank you so much!
