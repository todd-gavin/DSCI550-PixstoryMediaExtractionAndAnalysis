Kerala: Under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act for sexually abusing a nine-year-old boy, the special fast track court convicted a 54-year-old man to five years of rigorous imprisonment.

‌The boy, reportedly told the court that he was able to distinguish between ‘good touch’ and ‘bad touch’ because he had learnt it in school.

 He told the court that Vijayakumar had touched him with a bad motive and hence he ought to be punished.

‌The child was abused at his own house near Thumba in November 2020. Vijayakumar, who came as domestic help, abused him when he was alone.

‌ The boy realized that it was a bad touch by the man and immediately let his parents know about the episode. 

‌The parents complained to the Thumba police.

‌The accused Manacaud native Vijayakumar, was sentenced by judge R Jayakrishnan at the court.

‌ The special fast track court also inflicted a fine of Rs 25,000 on the convict.

‌The incident has made the state talk about the need for sex education among children.

‌ Sex education isn't something obscene, but a very important part of upbringing wherein the acknowledgement of the facts at the right age would help the character development of an individual.

‌We live in a country wherein the chapter on Reproduction, prescribed by the syllabus is ignored by teachers. 

I wasn't taught in school and hence was very much unaware and considered everything as crude until a very recent age which I am not very proud of.

‌Kudos to the parents of the boy who stepped up in the issue for their child.

‌ Abuse faced by all genders should be discussed and taken into consideration.
‌Appreciation to the teachers who are mending the ways to the children.
