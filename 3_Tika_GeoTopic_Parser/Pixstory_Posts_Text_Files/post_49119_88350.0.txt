Retaliation, or the historical idea of 'an eye for an eye,' is one of the most essential goals of criminal punishment. As a result, many individuals believe that the death sentence is the only just punishment for a willful murder. In general, criminal sanctions are tailored to the severity of the offences. That is why property offences, such as shoplifting, have low fines whereas personal crimes, such as kidnapping, have high sanctions.

Families of victims are overwhelmingly in favour of capital punishment. Although not all victims' relatives accept the death penalty, many claim that the execution of the culprit provides closure and helps to ease some of their pain.

Most aspects of the death sentence have changed in order to comply with the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. The crimes that are eligible for the death punishment have been narrowed significantly, and the selection procedure has been overhauled. Even the methods of execution have evolved over time. Hangings, gas chambers, firing squads, electric chairs, and deadly injections have all been utilised. It's worth noting that numerous jurisdictions have imposed a moratorium on executions while the efficacy of a new lethal injection formulation is studied. This should reassure people who believe the death sentence is inhumane or obsolete.

Rather of going to trial, up to 90% of all criminal cases are settled through plea bargaining. In most capital cases, perpetrators are offered life in prison in return for pleading guilty. This saves both the criminal and the prosecution money and time by avoiding a costly and time-consuming trial.
