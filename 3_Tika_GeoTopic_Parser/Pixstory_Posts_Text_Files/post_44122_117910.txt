Manchester City s opening offer of million for Marc Cucurella was rejected by Brighton The Premier League champions are interested in the year old due to his performances but according to Sky Sports City s first bid is much below Brighton s million asking price Cucurella is wanted by City as the Premier League champions aim to expand their left back options with Oleksandr Zinchenko nearing completion of his Arsenal transfer Joao Cancelo played left back for much of the previous season and was selected for the PFA Team of the Year but City is looking to bolster their lineup with a natural left footed player ahead of the current campaign The versatile year old Cucurella s contract with Brighton runs up in thus the club has no need to sell The transfer fee is now City s roadblock but if the two clubs can reach an understanding he may be the final piece in Pep Guardiola s puzzle Joao Cancelo will probably continue to be Guardiola s first choice left back and Oleksandr Zinchenko may stay despite interest from other teams but Cucurella would give Guardiola s game plan more diversity City supporters will tell you that the team has been in desperate need of a left back for years Benjamin Mendy is the first player to fill the position since Gael Clichy did so years ago Trophies have been won by using inverted right footers but perhaps there is another aspect of their game that could be revealed by using a more conventional wide attacking full back The reason they attacked more frequently down their left last season may have been because they liked to overload the left before switching the ball to the right where attackers could face up against defenders one on one Small percentages count more though since City are so good
