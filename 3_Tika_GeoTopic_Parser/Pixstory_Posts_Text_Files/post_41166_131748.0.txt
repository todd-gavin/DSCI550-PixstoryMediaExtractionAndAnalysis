The thick cheese topping, crisp, delicious onion, and splash of tomato that pull it all together with a pickle tang finish are proof positive that burgers are the source of true happiness. 

If you're feeling braver, you might choose their burger topped with onion rings, authentic Western-style barbeque sauce, and a dash of blue cheese. Burger Day was created to honour the burger in all its splendour because, regardless of the circumstances, it's difficult to argue that it isn't the ideal cuisine. 

 One of the simplest, most enjoyable, and tasty holidays we can think of is National Burger Day. You consume burgers. Yes, it is that easy. Enjoy a good, juicy burger as frequently and in as many different ways as you choose.
