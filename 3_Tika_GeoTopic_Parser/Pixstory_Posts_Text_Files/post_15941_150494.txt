Abstract Aims Pemafibrate a novel selective peroxisome proliferator activated receptor modulator was shown to ameliorate lipid abnormalities in a phase III clinical trial of patients with type diabetes mellitus T DM However its efficacy has not been demonstrated in real world clinical practice in patients with T DM Methods We performed a multi center prospective observational study of the use of pemafibrate in patients with T DM and hypertriglyceridemia versus conventional therapy with or without a fibrate The primary outcomes were the changes from baseline in fasting serum triglyceride TG and high density lipoprotein cholesterol HDL C concentrations at week Results We recruited patients and data from per group were analyzed after propensity score matching In the pemafibrate group both TG and HDL C showed significant improvements p lt and several indices reflecting TG rich lipoproteins low density lipoprotein cholesterol particle size and liver enzyme elevations were significantly ameliorated compared with the control group but there was no difference in glycemic control markers One of the key secondary endpoints showed that switching from conventional fibrates to pemafibrate improved eGFR but increased uric acid concentration Conclusions In patients with T DM pemafibrate has superior effects on lipid profile as well as liver and renal dysfunction to conventional fibrates Sources
