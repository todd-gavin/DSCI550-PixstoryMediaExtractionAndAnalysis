There has been lingering chaos around the railroad system in America, which has given rise to the ongoing dispute between the railroad companies and the unions.
The problem has reached the heights where freight railroad workers may go on strike, eventually influencing the US economy greatly.
The two main unions involved in the dispute are SMART and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen(BLET). 
The heated negotiation is a thing of the past, as all of it has been going on for nearly three years. 
If the deal is not sorted by Friday, unions will be planning to go on a strike that will happen after 30 years, and this threatening action can impose a real loss on the economy.
In a news report of Washington Post president of the BLET, Dennis Pierce said, “All we’re asking is folks to be able to go to routine doctor’s visits without pay, but they have refused to accept our proposals. The average American would not know we get fired for going to the doctor. This one thing has our members most enraged. We have guys who were punished for taking time off for a heart attack and covid. It’s inhumane.”
