#2. Antony adds quality and balance to Manchester United’s forward line
In pre-season Ten Hag went with the front three of Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Jadon Sancho and they were all effective. The fluidity of United’s attack was clear to see and Antony’s inclusion will only add further balance to this. The Brazilian is left-footed and likes to cut in from the right which United were lacking. This will create a different dimension to the team’s attack which can produce goal-scoring opportunities for the side.
Jadon Sancho has the ability to play on both flanks and many argue he is a more dangerous player off the left. Antony’s signing means Sancho can operate on the left where he could potentially be more effective. 
#3. Antony possesses the ability to become a World Class Star
Ten Hag seemed to be the driving force behind Manchester United’s pursuit of Antony this summer which highlights the amount of belief and faith he has in the youngster. Antony played a huge role in Ajax’s success last season under Ten Hag and was one of the team’s standout players. The 22-year-old excelled in Ten Hag’s system last season contributing to 16 goals with 12 goals and 4 assists. 
While the stats are not mind-blowing, they show there is potential there and one thing for certain is that there is huge potential in Antony. The Brazilian is still young and there is an expectation Antony will only improve and get better. Ten Hag and Manchester United fans will hope he is able to make the transition into the Premier League swiftly. It will take some time to adapt to the physical demands of the league as we saw with Sancho last season.
At Manchester United, Antony has the ability to increase his stock massively with good performances. The player clearly has an excellent relationship with Ten Hag after forcing a move to Old Trafford. It will be interesting to see if the Brazilian can fulfil his immense talent and become a world-class star at Manchester United.
