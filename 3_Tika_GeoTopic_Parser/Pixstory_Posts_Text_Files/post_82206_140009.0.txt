My hometown Siliguri is situated at the foothills of Himalayas. It hardly takes few hours to reach popular hill stations, with smooth roads offering unmatched sights of natural beauty. It also boasts of perfect 
landscapes, small destinations on the outskirts of this evergrowing towns. One such beautiful place is Debi Chaudhurani's Temple. This quaint little temple located near Goshalamore on the outskirts of the 
town has a history worth recounting. 
The name Debi Chaudhurani might sound familiar to few, it is novel by renowned Bengali author Bankim ChandraChatterjee. Many people like to believe that she is just a mere fictitious character, but there are 
many records of British East India Company proving her exploits and existence. 
Prafulla was abandoned by her family when she was young and luckily crossed paths with Bhavani Pathak, head of the dacoits. He mentored her and trained her. Soon she became the leader of dacoits. 
She was the â€˜Robin Hood' of Bengal. She only attacked Officials of British East India Company and Zamindars who were torturous on the peasants. She started the Sanyasi Rebellion along with Bhavani 
Pathak against the British exploitation. 
Though she was painted like a dacoit, she was revered and adored by the local people. It is believed that she and her group worshipped Goddess Kali in this very temple before starting their mission. This temple is the proof of the brave Queen of Dacoits was not just a mere character of a novel, rather a revered and adored leader.
