The Los Angeles Lakers had an outstanding performance in Cleveland on Monday night as they picked up a huge victory over the Cavaliers completing a season sweep of one of the NBA s surprise teams Of course the Cavaliers are also the hometown franchise of LeBron James and he made sure to put on a show for his fans though his good friend Kevin Love may not look back on this night quite as fondly LeBron posted his sixth triple double of the season with points assists and rebounds but the highlight of the night and perhaps the season came in the second quarter After Austin Reaves grabbed an offensive rebound off a missed Russell Westbrook free throw LeBron would cut to the basket where Reaves would find him James would rise up and throw down a huge tomahawk dunk over Love using his former teammate s body to propel even higher before throwing it down But even LeBron had to admit that he didn t want to do that to his good friend To be completely honest I hate that it had to be him James said after the game That s my guy that s my brother Hope I m still invited to the wedding Of course James and Love were teammates with the Cavaliers bringing the franchise their first ever NBA Championship back in and remain good friends to this day But once James gets on that runway to the basket he isn t going to stop for anyone even a good friend like Love For his part Love took the moment in good spirits having a smirk on his face in the moment as he knew he would be on every highlight reel Before the second half began he even went over to LeBron and put him in a playful headlock as both laughed it off While that was clearly the biggest highlight of the night for LeBron it wasn t the only one as he hit big shot after big shot many of them coming at the expense of Love himself
