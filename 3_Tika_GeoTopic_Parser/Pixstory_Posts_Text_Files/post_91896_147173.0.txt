A Cafe but you get to read freee Books-PARADISE!!😍
This book cafe is ny favourite around my locality, I frequently visit it and spend almost the entire day eating, reading!!
 The experience is one of a kind ,the ambience is beautiful and they made it comfortable enough for anyone to read in peace! My favourite thing is that they keep books of all genres and also multiple languages,so you can always find yourself something you can suit...
  My favourite things to order are their Momo Platter and Spicy red chutney and Cold Coffee!Its the ideal place for a Solo date as well as to hangout with your friends , or just to read !
