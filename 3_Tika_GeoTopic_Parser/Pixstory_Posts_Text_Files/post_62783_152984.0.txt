Song of Myself is probably something everyone who likes reading should read sometime. It has some elaborate musings that almost everyone will connect with.
This poem is a classic, timeless especially because of the themes and ideas in Section 6, such as the connection between grass and graves, graves and uncut hair of people, a kind of transcendence of life in death, and love for the young men buried there in those graves, as someone said. All of these themes and ideas are expressed in a lively language with inventive images. An American epic, in a sense, can be found in Whitman's this magnificent poem. The poem's ego-tickling elements and lovely writing make me reflect on who I am as a person. I mean, we all have that little devil on our shoulder, don't we?
