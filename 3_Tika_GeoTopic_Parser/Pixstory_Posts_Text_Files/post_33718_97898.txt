After the announcement of Mino Raiola&#39;s death, the sporting director of Salernitana wanted to express his condolences to the agent&#39;s family and dedicate a thought to the agent via the Campania club&#39;s Facebook profile. Mino you wouldn&#39;t have given me the opportunity to do it in life you would have argued as as usual You and I quarreled quite a bit Mino but I can&#39;t forget that when I was seriously ill you called my wife offering to take me to America at your expense An act of extraordinary generosity not due and silent Thank you Mino
