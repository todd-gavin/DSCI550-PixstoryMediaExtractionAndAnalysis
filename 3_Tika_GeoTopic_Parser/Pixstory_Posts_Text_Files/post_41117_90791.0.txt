The Black Lives Matter movement has spread to a number of other nations, with BLM chapters and comparable social movements. Blavity reported that the movement has been around for a while in the United Kingdom, which has a long and distinct history of racism and inequality when it comes to its Black and brown people. Protests have recently erupted in the United Kingdom.

A storey that a 15-year-old Black girl was strip-searched at her East London school has shocked people across the United Kingdom. After school administrators stated she smelled like marijuana, the girl, who has been publicly identified as Child Q, was taken to an office. She was then searched by two female Metropolitan Police officers, who ordered her to remove her clothes and even her sanitary pad and invasively probed her body; no narcotics were discovered during the check. This incident, which is said to have left the girl traumatised, happened in December 2020 but has just recently become a significant news item. The student is currently pursuing legal action against the police department and the school for the injury caused by the search.

As Christopher Rhodes has rightly pointed out, the disclosures regarding Child Q's abuse come at a time when the United Kingdom is grappling with widespread prejudice. A government investigation has suggested delaying public financing for cricket until the England & Wales Cricket Board cleans up the sport after comprehensive proof of ongoing racism from both coaches and fans. Furthermore, the Royal Society of Chemistry recently published evidence revealing widespread racism in academia, with nonwhite researchers obtaining much less funding for their work, among other instances of discrimination. There is only one Black chemistry professor in the entire country, demonstrating extreme racial imbalance.
