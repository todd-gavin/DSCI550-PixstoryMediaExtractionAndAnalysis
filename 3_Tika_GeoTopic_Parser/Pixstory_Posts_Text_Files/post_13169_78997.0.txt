In November, Bhavini received an audio file from his friends in the clubhouse room that referred to his underwear.

Clubhouse is a live voice chat app that allows users to create virtual rooms or join other people's chat rooms.
In these files, men auction off parts of a woman's body, including her body.
But Bhavini, who lives in India and whose real name is preserved, was not surprised.

"In this app, men have been harassing me for months, building rooms every week, calling me names and insulting me," said the 33-year-old political researcher. "You have to pay."

What is a  Clubhouse?
The story of Indian Muslim women who were auctioned off
What is behind the thousands of suicides of Indian housewives?
According to her evidence, she is one of at least four women from the majority of India's Hindus who have been named in a fake auction house at the Clubhouse. This room lasted for about two hours and was attended by about 200 users.

Clubhouse told the BBC that the accounts of the people who created the room had been suspended or closed, and had warned them.

Women say Hindu nationalist trolls in the app have been targeting them for months and labeling them traitors because they criticize Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party, Bharatiya Janata (BJP).

They are not the only ones exposed to these harassments. Muslim women living in India, many of them social activists critical of the government, have also been subjected to harassment and online charges twice in the past six months, leading to arrests.

In all these cases, there was no auction, and the purpose of these rooms was only to harass and stifle the voices of the women who were the target of these actions.
