After the farewell to Kalidou Koulibaly Aurelio de Laurentiis made some peremptory statements about African footballers No more Africans, I won&#39;t take any more Or I give up the African Cup the words of the Napoli patron with reference to the many matches that players arriving from that continent miss when the African Cup is held Koulibaly himself responded very politely to his former president during the presentation press conference organized by his new club Chelsea It depends on him whether or not he wants to buy other African players For me the main thing is respect and if that&#39;s your opinion I respect it When I was playing in Naples I also represented Senegal I&#39;m sure it was tough for the team when we went to the African Cup but you also need respect for the African national teams and as captain of Senegal I think it&#39;s not right talking like this about an African national team I respect what he thinks if he believes his team can go ahead without African players it&#39;s his right But I know for sure that in Naples there are many people who don&#39;t think like him I take these words as his opinion I don&#39;t like what the city or society itself thinks
