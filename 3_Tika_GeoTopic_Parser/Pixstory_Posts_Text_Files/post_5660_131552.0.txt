Homes of three Rashtriya Janata Dal ( RJD ) leaders were raided by the CBI in connection with the Land for Job case that took place during the tenure of Lalu Prasad Yadav as Railway Minister.
The raids are conducted on the day when Nitish Kumar's new government with RJD's support will be taking a majority test in the assembly.
Homes of RJD's Rajya Sabha MPs Ahmad Ashfaque Karim and Dr Faiyaz Ahmad, and a MLA in Bihar, Sunil Singh were raided today morning.
"They're scared. A new government has been formed under the leadership of Nitish Kumar. All parties, except BJP, are with us. We have the majority. The CBI (raids) are just to scare us. We won't be scared. This isn't happening for the first time." Said former Chief Minister Rabri Devi
"This is being done intentionally. There is no meaning. They are doing it hoping that our MLAs will join them out of fear," said Sunil Singh
The case alleges that Yadav and his family recieved lands as bribes in exchange for giving out jobs.
