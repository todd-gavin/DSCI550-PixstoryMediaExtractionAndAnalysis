TIPS TO INCREASE YOUR WATER INTAKE!

While everyone knows that it's important to stay hydrated, doing so can be difficult at times!

1. SET A REMINDER ALARM
Try setting a reminder to take a few sips of water every 30 minutes, or set a reminder to finish drinking your current glass of water and refill it every hour.

2. DRINK A GLASS OF WATER WITH EACH MAIN MEAL 
If you eat 3 main meals per day, this adds an extra 3 cups (750mL) to your daily water intake.

3. FLAVOUR YOUR WATER
If you dislike the flavor of water, or just need a bit of flavor to help you drink more, you have many choices, such as Diet Cordial or adding slices of fresh orange or lemon.

4. EAT FOODS HIGH IN WATER 
Fruits and vegetables that are particularly high in water
include lettuce, celery, zucchini, watermelon, rockmelon, cabbage, and honeydew melon.

5. KEEP A REUSABLE DRINK BOTTLE WITH YOU
When you have a reusable water bottle, you can easily
drink water in any setting, whether you're running errands, traveling, or at home, work, or school.
