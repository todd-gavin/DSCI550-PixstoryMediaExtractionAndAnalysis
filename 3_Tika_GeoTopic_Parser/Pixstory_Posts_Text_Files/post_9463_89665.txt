There was nothing unusual at Manana s home on that day Her mother handed the provisions list Her teenagers were in some argument Others of that huge family were involved in own stuff Things changed with an announcement from Manana without much ado A totally embarrassed situation now Separating yourself from a third generations house isn t easy But Manana was firm and serious on it The disciplined social fabric of a Georgian joint family need to unlearn certain norms here which is not Manana s concern anymore She wants some fresh air for herself When a year old woman from a traditional family decides so only thing could support her is financial stability Luckily she had a job A happy family is maintained by a peaceful mother that s what even TV shows feed Georgian people So a Supra is still relevant in their households They gather happily dries wine glasses and interact each other Manana is being questioned here but the kith and kin couldn t break her free will That patriarchal protection from her brother when she moved to a new house and lives peacefully there is annoying It just reminds you even an independent woman of own voice cannot escape it More tactical was her husband s approach He visits there against her wish and do some carpentry to please her That was a place found and setup by her Their conversation here is really touching and it leaves a permanent black mark in his heart He gets it really My Happy Family shows you what exactly it is when you stay far from it People and emotions were they real Are you stuck in routines and same faces around Do you even remember what were you in your past Do you have friends Manana actually finds answers for all these at her new moderate habitat That caressing wind at her balcony even redefines her life This slow paced movie is keen on what a middle aged woman wants and misses in a busy household she left behind Ia Shugliashvili wins our hearts wearing all worn out feelings of a forlorn woman in an intricate household
