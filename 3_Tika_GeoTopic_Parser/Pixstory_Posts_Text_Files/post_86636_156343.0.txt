Playmakers are crucial to a team's fortunes on the football field. The big stage such as the FIFA World Cup presents the very best a chance to showcase their skills and realise their dream of glory. Onmanorama takes a look at five maestros who could dazzle at Qatar 2022.
Lionel Messi
The Argentine magician has confirmed that the upcoming edition will be his last World Cup. Qatar presents Messi with one final chance to win the elusive crown. The 35-year-old has won almost everything else. One thing is for sure, he'll be giving his all as Argentina attempt to regain the title after 36 years. The Paris St Germain star needs to be at the top of his game for La Albiceleste to win a third crown.
Frenkie de Jong
The Dutch are returning to the World Cup after missing the last edition. Barcelona's Frenkie de Jong pulls the strings for the Oranje in the midfield. The 25-year-old has donned the national colours 45 times and is an experienced player. The expectations are high and de Jong will have a big role to play if the Netherlands are to make it to the final stages of the competition.
Kevin De Bruyne
The Belgian talisman is one of the most influential players around. On his day, the 31-year-old De Bruyne can hurt the opposition big time as Brazil found out in the quarterfinals in Russia. The Manchester City star will be leaving no stone unturned as the Red Devils hope to break the jinx of not having reached the final of a major competition.
Bernardo Silva
There is no death of talent in the Portuguese ranks and Bernardo Silva is one of their outstanding players. The 28-year-old has 72 caps to his name. If Silva is on song, it will make Cristiano Ronaldo's job easier. The Manchester City player creates goal-scoring opportunities and is a smart operator.
