I am a boxer and I'm from Assam. I won the Gold Medal at the AIBA Youth Women's World Boxing Championships in 2017. I also won a Gold Medal at the North East Olympic Games that were held in Imphal inÂ  2018. I've also won many other medals. In 2017 at the AIBA Youth Women's World Boxing Championships, I was given the Best Boxer title.
I started boxing in 2012 but couldn't participate in the Nationals as the Boxing federation was banned so I participated in my first Nationals in 2017. Women are getting good opportunities in boxing in India. I'm proud to say that Women have got medals in both Olympics and Commonwealth in Boxing. I believe that we can win even more medals if we continue to work hard like we have so far. I also think that Women in Assam get more support in the form of facilities and funding but there are some places where women dont get the same support and I believe if given the opportunities they will shine for sure.
