 The Satanic Verses is not a history book or biography of Prophet Muhammad It is a rich and complex literary novel which is ironic fantastical and satirical The book does not take any direct aim at Islam or its prophet Those sections that have caused the greatest controversy are contained within the dreams or nightmares of a character who is in the grip of psychosis It s the fictional story of two men infused with Islam but confused by the temptations of the west The first SALADIN Chamcha survives by returning to his roots The other named GIBREEL Farishta poleaxed by his spiritual need to believe in God and his intellectual inability to return to the faith finally kills himself The novel features a Mohammed like character named MAHOUND a derogatory name for the prophet frequently used by Christians of past ages Rushdie s Mahound puts his own words into the angel Gibreel s mouth and delivers edicts to his followers that conveniently bolster his self serving purposes Through Mahound Rushdie appears to cast doubt on the divine nature of the Quran It also includes a scene where prostitutes take on the known names and personalities of Mohammed s wives One of the most important things the novel was doing at a crucial moment in time was exploring the experiences of immigrants in England A key thread of The Satanic Verses is one of the protagonist s failed assimilation into English culture Paradoxically the community that Rushdie was trying to explore and give voice to in the novel is the one who ended up being most offended by his writing That blind that dumb is religion
