To mask or not to mask? That is no longer the question. On late Friday, the CDC has fine-tuned its advisory to nudge people towards N95 or KN95 masks, instead of cloth masks, for better protection against the virus infection.

Since the omicron variant is highly transmutable and is spiking the numbers, the agency has urged people to seek better protection. While it has maintained that “any mask is better than no mask”, it has clarified that some types of masks and respirators provide more protection to the wearer than others. While ‘surgical N95’ masks should be reserved for healthcare settings, it said people can choose respirators such as n95 and KN95: https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/01/14/cdc-masks-best-protection-guidance/

Unlike cloth masks, which can be homemade too, the special kinds of masks may be beyond someone’s budget (especially when they have to be frequently changed) and they have been in short supply too. However, in the face of the omicron surge, the Biden administration too has addressed concerns about their availability. On Thursday, the president announced plans to make high-quality masks available for free. The federal government has a stockpile of more than 750 million N95 masks: https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/14/world/omicron-covid-vaccine-tests#cloth-masks-covid-cdc

Cloth masks can work if the fabric is not too thin. The CDC and experts say that unlike cloth masks, N95 and KN95 are made with high-tech filtering material that can prevent 95% of the airborne particles (hence the name), including micro droplets carrying the virus when used properly. What’s more important than its type is that the mask should be fitting, leaving no gaps around the side of the face or the nose, forming a seal. 

Better:

*Wear two masks: Disposable one underneath AND cloth one on top,

*Combine either a cloth mask or disposable mask with a fitter or brace

*Knot and tuck ear loops of a 3-ply mask where they join the edge of the mask: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzTAZDsNBe0

*Use masks that attach behind the neck and head with either elastic bands or ties (instead of ear loops)

Secondly, any mask should be discarded as soon as it appears soiled or is wet or torn.
