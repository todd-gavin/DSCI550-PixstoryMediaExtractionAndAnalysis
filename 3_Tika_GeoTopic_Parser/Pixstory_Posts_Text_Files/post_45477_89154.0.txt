Brazil vs Colombia (11th November)
So far, Brazil has gone undefeated in their FIFA World Cup Qualifying campaign for 2021. They do, however, have a difficult series of fixtures during this international break. On Thursday night, they will face Colombia.

The Selecao leads the table after winning 10 of their 11 qualifying matches so far. Colombia was the only South American team they couldn't beat, as the two sides fought out a goalless draw in October.

Portugal vs Serbia (14th November)
Despite Cristiano Ronaldo's heroics and international goalscoring exploits, Portugal is not the group's top finisher in the World Cup Qualifier. Portugal is in second place in Group A, behind Serbia. On November 14th, the two teams will face off at the Estadio Da Luz.

Portugal has a game in hand on Serbia, and a win would put them ahead of their opponents. Since Euro 2020, Fernando Santos' team has won all five of their games. They have 16 goals and only two goals surrendered in their five games.

Serbia, on the other hand, will not be taken lightly. The Serbs are also unbeaten in their last five games and have a number of in-form players into this encounter.

Spain vs Sweden (14th November)
Sweden currently leads Group B in the European World Cup Qualifier. They have 15 points after six games, two more than La Roja, who are in second place in the group. In the first round of the World Cup Qualifiers, Sweden defeated Spain 2-1 at home.

After Carlos Soler's early fourth-minute opener for Luis Enrique's side, Aleksander Isak and Viktor Claesson scored for Sweden. The two teams had previously played in a Euro 2020 group stage match. They were held to a goalless draw in that match.
