The 26-year-old Ivorian winger came in as a second-half replacement but failed to impress as Arsenal came away with a crucial win.

When provided with a clear sight of an empty net during Arsenal's 2-1 Premier League victory 
over Leeds United at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta could not understand why Nicolas Pepe did not take aim.

Arsenal's assistant coach, Albert Stuivenberg, quizzed the 26-year-old Ivory Coast international after the game in north London about some dubious decision making.

Pepe, who came on in the second half with Arsenal ahead 2-0 thanks to Eddie Nketiah's early double, had the ball bounce sweetly to him after a late Leeds corner that left goalkeeper Illan Meslier stranded and out of position.

A route looked to have been cleared for an Ivorian striker to send the ball towards goal, securing the points, but Pepe chose to check onto his stronger left foot, allowing Daniel James to sneak in with a vital tackle.

Arteta, on the other hand, was pleased with Arsenal's tight victory, saying, "Well, we are finding ways to win football matches." Today's performance, particularly the opening 30 minutes, was outstanding.

Pepe has struggled for playing time under Arteta, making only 18 Premier League appearances this season and accumulating 652 minutes of action. Over the course of the Gunners' 35 games, he has only started five of them and has been used as a replacement 13 times.

He has scored one Premier League goal and contributed one assist in 2021-22. On February 
24, he scored his first goal of the season in a 2-1 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Pepe made 29 Premier League appearances for Arsenal last season, scoring 10 goals and providing one assist. He made 74 league appearances for Lille before transferring to England in August 2019, scoring 35 goals and providing 15 assists.
