#7 Johan Cruyff
Cruyff changed the dynamism of modern football, and now many top managers use hisapproach in their teams. He was another unforgettable legend who couldn't get his hand onthe FIFA World Cup trophy.
His heroic performance came in the 1974 World Cup when he drove the Netherlands toWorld Cup runners-up. En route to the final, their total football dominance knocked outArgentina, Germany, and Brazil.
However, Cruyff retired from football after helping the Netherlands again reach the 1978World Cup, where the Netherlands again finished runners-up.
#6 Ruud Gullit
A phenomenal player who failed to deliver when needed the most, Gullit was a Dutch starwho won every possible trophy with his clubs. The Ballon d'Or winner had his eyes set onthe World Cup trophy, but when it counted, the player came under pressure with mountingexpectations.
Guilt only World Cup for Dutch came in 1990, when Netherlands crashed out of the round of16; it was his last ever as he left the training and weeks before 1994 World Cup and neverreturned.
#5 Gabriel Batistuta
The poacher scored goals for fun but never won the coveted football accolade. Despiteplaying in two World Cups, 1994 and 1998, Batistuta never won the trophy; his performancein those World Cups was praiseworthy.
In 1994 they were sent home packing in the last 16 against Romania, and in 1998 WorldCup Argentina failed to qualify from the group stage for the first time since 1962.
#4 Eric Cantona
Eric Cantona always had a bitter-sweet relationship with French managers, who often didnot call him during important matches. Under Michel Platini and Houllier, France failed tobook their berth in 1990 and 1994 World Cup.
And most of the time, he was benched; by the time it felt like he could play for the nationalteam, the new manager had replaced him with Zidane, and Cantona never played in a World Cup.
