President Joe Biden said that he was “deeply disappointed” in the Supreme Courts' decision on New York new gun law. Joe Biden has issued a statement condemning the supreme court’s decision that greatly broadens the right to carry concealed weapons across the United States.

“Since 1911, the State of New York has required individuals who would like to carry a concealed weapon in public to show a need to do so for self-defense and to acquire a license. More than a century later, the United States supreme court has chosen to strike down New York’s long-established authority to protect its citizens. This ruling contradicts both common sense and the constitution, and should deeply trouble us all,” Biden said.

He supported the efforts of the states to respond to the court ruling with new regulations. 

President also wrote that“As the late Justice Scalia recognized, the Second Amendment is not absolute. For centuries, states have regulated who may purchase or possess weapons, the types of weapons they may use, and the places they may carry those weapons. And the courts have upheld these regulations,”

Concluding with a plea for action, Biden said, “I call on Americans across the country to make their voices heard on gun safety. Lives are on the line.”

The President of America recognizes the need for gun control. He calls for it to stand against the gun lobby groups and those who are in high support of guns. We are at a point where we need strict gun control to survive. We have seen enough.
