As per Manchester Evening News, Ralf Rangnick has all but confirmed that Paul Pogba will leave at the end of the season. The midfielder's appearance against Liverpool could have been his last in the United jersey. 

The Manchester United manager attended a press conference before the Premier League game against Arsenal. Ralf Rangnick stated here that Pogba may miss out on the rest of the season. 

Paul Pogba was named in the starting XI against Liverpool in the midweek fixture. But the midfielder had an anti-climatic end to his game as he suffered a calf injury in the 10th minute of the game. Following tests, reports suggest that Paul Pogba would not be unable to play in the remaining games for Manchester United. 

Apart from this, Ralf Rangnick had another shocking revelation for the press. The United manager would then go on to reveal that Paul Pogba won't be a part of the club next season. 

Ralf Rangnick said, "As it seems right now, Pogba will not renew his contract. I don’t know, maybe the club or Erik Ten Hag will not want to renew his contract. It’s most likely he won’t be here anymore next season."

Paul Pogba rejoined Manchester United from Juventus before the 2016/17 season. Since then, the midfielder has scored 40 goals in 226 appearances for the Red Devils. Hence it has to be seen who would replace the Frenchman in the summer.



Where will Pogba be heading to? 

Paul Pogba Transfer News: The Frenchman has been linked with Real Madrid and Juventus in the past few months. But as per reports, Pogba could be heading to Ligue 1. 

Rumours have suggested in the past few weeks that Paris Saint-Germain have already agreed to terms with Paul Pogba. PSG are desperate to win the Champions League and hence they feel that the midfielder's expertise would be useful. Hence it has to be seen what the future holds for Pogba.
