The ocean sustains all life on our planet It provides food to eat and oxygen to breathe while playing a key role in moderating our climate But marine life is increasingly threatened by climate change The ocean is becoming considerably warmer affecting its ability to sustain life The searing temperatures seen around the Mediterranean this year are indicative of rising global temperatures This is set to continue over the next century contingent on how much CO we continue to emit The International Energy Agency reported that global energy related CO emissions rose by in to their highest ever level The Mediterranean has been subject to intense thermal conditions in recent years This has taken a further severe step this year with sea temperatures reaching a record C off Course A marine heatwave is defined as an extended period of abnormally high sea temperatures relative to the seasonal average They have doubled in frequency since the s Because of the delay between undertaking and publishing ecological work the most comprehensive study we have on Mediterranean marine heatwaves covers the period The study found that the sea temperatures recorded in the Mediterranean over the period were the highest since recording began in Of almost a thousand field surveys conducted researchers found that of them contained evidence of the widespread mortality of marine life tightly linked to periods of extreme heat The research provides an insight into the future ecological impacts of marine heatwaves elsewhere This is significant as substantial temperature increases are forecast for tropical and polar regions in particular While the ocean acts as a large carbon sink we still face increases in the surface temperature of the sea ranging from C before the end of the century Linked to this overall warming are marine heatwaves of increasing frequency and intensity Read more
