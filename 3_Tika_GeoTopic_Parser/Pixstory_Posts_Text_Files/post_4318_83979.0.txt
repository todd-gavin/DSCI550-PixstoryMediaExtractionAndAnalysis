I would have loved for the outcome of last night's game to be a win. With that being said I want to take this opportunity to spread the message of always being ready mentally, physically, spiritually and emotionally for what life presents you. I look forward to continuing to build on this opportunity and turn my performances in to an intrical part of our teams success. I encourage everyone to spread this same energy and apply it in your lives.
