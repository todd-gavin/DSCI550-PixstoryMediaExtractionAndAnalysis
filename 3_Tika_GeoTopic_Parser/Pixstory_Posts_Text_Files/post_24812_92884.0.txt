If Arsenal thought they would overturn a humiliating 3-0 defeat against Crystal Palace last weekend at home to Brighton, they were wrong. Two goals in either half gave Graham Potter's men a much-needed win after seven long games and inflicted more misery on the Gunners. A late deflected effort from Martin Odegaard made no amends for a lacklustre display in a 2-1 loss. 



Mikel Arteta felt reluctant to field left-back Nuno Tavares for the game after an average display against Crystal Palace. Granit Xhaka stepped in that role at Selhurst Park in the absence of Kieran Tierney who is out for the season with a knee injury. That blow became hard to digest as Xhaka was embarrassingly exposed high on the pitch for Brighton's first goal. A simple long ball from Lewis Dunk under pressure let Mwepu into the space vacated. He then cut back to set up unmarked Trossard to put them in front. Xhaka, as he is a midfielder by nature and Thomas Partey injured, drifted inside leaving no one overlapping on the left. A key component of Arteta's tactics. Cedric also failed to do the same on the right. It further blunted the attack. 



Everything went against Arsenal including a tight VAR call that marked Gabriel Martinelli offside when he seemed to have pulled his side level just before the break. That became a factor as Mwepu turned scorer from provider in the second half. He gambled onto a cross from Caicedo and struck with a sweet volley from the edge of the box past diving Ramsdale. Arsenal increased pressure from there on and looked a lot better in the last ten minutes or so. Odegaard struck the post from a free-kick with Nketiah doing the same on the rebound before pulling one back from long range. Robert Sanchez then pulled off a class save at the death to deny Arsenal any points on the day.


The loss and a subsequent win for Spurs meant Arsenal are three points off the top four places but with a game in hand.
