There have been plenty of violent conflicts in this world that have taken many lives and left many more grieving Every place you visit has tales of how someone s ambition for power or money led to the murder of innocent people and the devastation of lovely cities Even battles that were fought for just causes like the American Civil War which led to the abolition of slavery have resulted in a high number of fatalities The International Day of Non Violence honours those individuals who thankfully have gone about enacting the changes they believe are required without resorting to violence or outright coercion Wherever you live there is no denying that a day celebrating non violent ways of making a statement and bringing about change is long overdue and that these peaceful strategies for fighting injustice more than definitely deserve their own day Source DOY
