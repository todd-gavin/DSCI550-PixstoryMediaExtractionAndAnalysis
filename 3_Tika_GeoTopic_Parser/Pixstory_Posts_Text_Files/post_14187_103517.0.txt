If last summer’s transfer window was the most important for Crystal Palace in a decade, then this one may have a similar level of significance attached, even if so much has changed.

No longer is there any concern or anxiety over the future of senior players whose contracts were expiring last year. Confidence in the club’s hierarchy to make the necessary recruitment is strong, but there will still be a continuation of that overhaul which began a year ago. With that comes an element of risk, but Palace have a clear idea of where they need to strengthen and add cover.
