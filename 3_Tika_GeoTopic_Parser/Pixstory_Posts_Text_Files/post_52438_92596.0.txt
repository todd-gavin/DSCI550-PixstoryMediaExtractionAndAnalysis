Hip hop - Just after listening to this word the basic idea which comes to our mind is a dance style or a clothing style which involves loose and baggy outfits. 
But this is not what it actually signifies. 
Hiphop is a  worldwide cultural movement which was started in late 1970's. Hip hop basically compromises of 5 elements known as Deejaying, Emceeing, bboying, graffiti and beatboxing. Deejaying further spreads into basic deejaying, turntablism, music production etc. Emceeing refers to all the rap and hiphop artists. Bboying joining hands with breaking. Graffiti also shows some unique wall art and other creative arts on different displays. Beatboxers go individual but they also work with djs and producers.  There is another misconception that people carry and that is Hiphop means only Rap. This is just a statement and has no connection with the reality. Although rap is a big and main part of the hiphop culture today because among all the elements, rap has grown and evolved with a different approach. Rap is loved by more people if compared to other elements of hiphop. Rap is a part of hiphop culture but not the whole culture itself. Just like that some say breaking and bboying are the real hiphop elements. Some say graffiti is the true art of hiphop. But these are just statements passed by people to people who love to believe that hiphop is a just a single thing having a single identity. 
But in reality, hiphop is a culture, it's a community which attracts people and makes them a part of a cause which believes in unity and a peaceful environment. These 5 elements all together brings life to the entire hip hop culture around the globe and make it a worthyful culture worlwide.
