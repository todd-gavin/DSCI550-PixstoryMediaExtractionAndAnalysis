Kim Ji-won of “My Liberation Notes” is the most talked-about actress at the moment with her role of a dull character living in a harsh reality.
This is the ending scene from the 2nd episode of JTBC’s Saturday and Sunday drama “My Liberation Notes.” Yeom Mi-jung (played by Kim Ji-won), who is living a harsh life, suddenly said those words to Koo (Son Seok-gu), a man in the neighborhood who doesn’t even know his name. The ratings of the earlier part of the series were in the 2% range, perhaps because of the unfamiliar “confession” that was not even “love” but “worship”. However, the 10th episode aired on May 8th has risen to 4.6%. It’s not a figure that can be proud of, but viewers all agree on the fact that they replay and replay the drama non-stop through OTT services rather than watching the actual broadcast. Actress Kim Ji-won is at the center of this viral “quiet” topic.
