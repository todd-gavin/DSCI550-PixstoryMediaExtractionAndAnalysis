Whenever it is Eid my mind is filled with mehendi designs, foods and sweets and a great outfit. Definitely Eidi is also a major part of Eid and this day is filled with lot of happiness and joy that we share with our friends and family. 

Eid always felt like any other festive for me which I celebrate. I always make sure that the day becomes special by doing something in relevance to the festive. 

Have been always curious in knowing how festives are celebrated in different styles. Like, eid in Kerala is different from the Eid celebrated in Dubai and so knowing how it is, I have always felt much of the Eid vibes from Dubai. 

The prayers done in the early morning and the crowd on the streets, hugging each other with the greetings of the day and visiting our family friends have been a great memory for me ever since I know about Eid. 

Various food items from the Arabic cuisine was known mainly through my eid visits to our family friends. The authentic taste, especially of the sweets like Baklava, kunafa just makes heaven in my mouth on that first bite. 
By the end of the day, we count on the Eidi and spend more time with family and friends maybe with a movie or by having a great time with them. 

Share your thoughts and memories on eid and how you are celebrating it today through support. 

I wish each and everyone a blessed and a prosperous Eid ❤️
