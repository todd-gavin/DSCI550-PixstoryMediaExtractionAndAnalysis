Yesterday I told you all about my opinion that who should win the Oscar for the best Actor in a supporting Role So if there s a nomination of best Actor In a supporting role then there has to be the nomination for the best Actress in a supporting role and yes there is a category in Oscars for the same This year five actresses got the nomination in the above category which are as follows Kirsten Dunst The Power of the Dog Ariana DeBose West Side Story Jessie Buckley The Lost Daughter Aunjanue Ellis King Richard Judi Dench Belfast There is a noise that is saying Ariana DeBose should win the Oscar but my point of view is different in this category I think Jessie Buckley played the character of Young Leda in the movie The Lost Daughter Why I think Jessie Buckley should win the Oscar because her role in the movie is very important because she was the one who portrayed the role of young Leda perfectly and because of that role of old Leda played by Olivia Colman left a strong impact on me as well as the viewers of the movie Jessie Buckley showed her strength as well as a weaker version with the same dedication Her scenes with her daughter will bring a smile to your face her scenes with her husband will bring the emotion of anger inside you and when she leaves her daughter then also you will root for her Please note down your views and who you think can win the Oscars for the best Actress in a Supporting Role on th March
