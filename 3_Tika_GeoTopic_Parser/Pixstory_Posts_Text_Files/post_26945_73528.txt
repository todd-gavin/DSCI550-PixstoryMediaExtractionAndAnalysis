The era of Virgil Abloh at Vuitton has finally come to an end today January saw the eighth and last collection created for the French maison by the designer who died last November called Dreamhouse the house of dreams because the rarefied atmosphere mixes childhood and recent memories of the designer who there is no more We recognize the urban universe made up of sneakers and tracksuits the years that brought him to success followed by structured suits with eclectic proportions and iridescent colors The series ends with creations that are difficult to describe young men wear white wings halfway between heaven and skating park at home in Atlanta They are certainly not marketable outfits and no one expects them to be we like to think they are Virgil&#39;s greetings long gone but still interested in what happens down here to his friends A genius a revolutionary and now an inspiration
