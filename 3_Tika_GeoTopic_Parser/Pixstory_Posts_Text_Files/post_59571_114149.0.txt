The event was preceded by a similar event at Tiruchengode government hospital, located about 184 kms from Hosur.

AI: the gamechanger
The three devices donated at the Tiruchengode hospital have come as a huge relief for the hospital staff who have been relying on clinical screening, till date. "The advantage with these machines is that, since they are AI (artificial intelligence) enabled, we can generate reports with greater accuracy and speed. Interpreting data will also be a lot easier," said K Prakash, pediatrician, neonatal unit, at the hospital. According to him the devices will also allow the hospital to bring down the number of referrals to district hospitals by less than 10 per cent.

According to Ganesh Prasad, Founder, MD & CEO, Genworks, the technology partner, which provided the machines, post-covid, there is a greater emphasis on early health screening. "Today we are moving towards a wellness mindset, especially for women and newborns. Government too is taking a major initiative in these two areas," said Prasad.

"Genworks will provide training for doctors and paramedics on how to use the machines. The devices will help a paramedic connect with a specialist doctor working elsewhere, remotely," said Prasad. "Our mission is to provide healthcare connectivity at every primary health centre in the country through technology," he added.
