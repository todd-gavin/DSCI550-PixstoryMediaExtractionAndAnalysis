In the 3rd century BCE, a time when trade between India and other parts of the world was flourishing, Chandragupta Maurya began building a highway along what was known as Uttarpath or Northern Road. The road would connect Central Asia to important trade centres in India, including what is now Taxila in Rawalpindi, Peshawar in Pakistan and Allahabad in India. Years later, the British Empire named it Grand Trunk Road.  

The iconic road is now approximately 2,500 kms long and extends from Kabul, through Lahore, Delhi and Calcutta to Chittagong in Bangladesh.

In 1995, a hospitality and entertainment group called Piccadily set up a sugar mill and distillery just off the Grand Trunk Road, in a quaint Haryana village called Indri. It would have been impossible for them to foresee that their humble mill would go on to produce an international award winning whisky.

Indri may seem like an unlikely place for an award winning whisky to come out from. Itâ€™s not as glamorous as Goa, which is seeing a slew of new spirits, nor is it very well known. But in its own quiet ways, it offers the ideal conditions for a malt plant.

The Piccadily distillery is located on the banks of the Yamuna river, with access to freshly melted glacier water from the Himalayas. The extreme climate in the region allows for unique interactions between the malt spirits and wood barrels, bringing bold and complex flavours to the whisky.

The single malt is also made with six row Indian barley, grown indigenously in South Haryana and Rajasthan for thousands of years. Indri is also a derivation of the Sanskrit word Indris, which denotes the five senses. Trini refers to the three different wooden barrels that the whisky is produced in ie. ex-bourbon, ex-wine and PX sherry casks. 

The velvety drink has a nutty, full mouthed feel with an undertone of spices. Expect scents of oak, vanilla, caramelised pineapple and black tea, among others and enjoy the drink on the rocks or with water.
