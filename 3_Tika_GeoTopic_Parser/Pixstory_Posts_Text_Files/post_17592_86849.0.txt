One of the lone bright spots for the Los Angeles Lakers this season has been the play of LeBron James, and that continued on Friday night when he scored 50 points in a victory over the Washington Wizards.

James did so on an incredibly efficient 18-for-25 shooting, scoring in a variety of ways. It marked his second straight 50-plus-point game at Crypto.com Arena, becoming the first player to do so since Kobe Bryant in 2007.

The eruption began in the third quarter when James scored 12 straight points to give the Lakers the lead, and then he stayed hot until the end of the game.

In his walk-off interview with Mike Trudell of Spectrum SportsNet, James talked about what went into his hot streak, comparing it to the old video game NBA Jam:

“You just try to stay in that as long as you can. I don’t know if you remember the game, what did they used to say, ‘he’s on fire!’ NBA Jam. Sometimes you might want to take a bad shot and it gets you out of that hot streak, so I just tried to stay in that zone as long as possible and I was able to hit a couple.”

James then went on to further discuss his NBA Jam history in his postgame presser, elaborating on how he liked to play and what teams he enjoyed playing with.

“I would definitely try to get on fire. Back then, shooting from halfcourt was something that was unheard of and now guys are actually doing it,” James said. “Back then I would play with the Seattle SuperSonics because you would get Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp. I would play with the Bulls a little bit but obviously MJ wasn’t in the game because not that I found out when I’m much older and a professional.
