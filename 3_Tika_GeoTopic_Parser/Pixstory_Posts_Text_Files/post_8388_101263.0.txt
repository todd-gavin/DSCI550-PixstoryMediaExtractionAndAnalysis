Every day I explore myself, 
Layer by layer I understand 
Who I am, not someone 
Whom you met a few months ago
Not someone with whom 
You studied a few years ago, 
I'm not that person anymore. 
I have evolved as a person a lot
And I don't think this process ever stops.
Life is a path you travel to find yourself
Who you truly are.

You make mistakes, 
You take lessons, you learn them, 
You find yourself trapped in problems, 
You seek for solution.     
You see how different your approach is. 
It's like meeting someone you never knew 
you had in there.   
 
There is kindness in me, there is fear in me, There is love in me, there is a lot of rage in me, 
There are so many feelings in me. 
And most importantly the faith 
I hold in me for myself that I know 
I can push any mountain and 
Devour the sky, all this I didn't 
Having all this before, it occurred to me 
Like all the other things,

I'm still finding myself...
