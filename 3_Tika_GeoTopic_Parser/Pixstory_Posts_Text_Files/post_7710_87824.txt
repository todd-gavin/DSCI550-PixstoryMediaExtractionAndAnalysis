Tell me how it is Its been too long Since I felt a touch Since I heard a familiar voice There is no one to miss Yet nothing feels complete It s all empty My heart an abandoned city Fires erupting everywhere The silence is chaotic The sound of death Follows every avenue Come along with me I ll show you my city Don t be afraid of the screams Its just my soul You can venture away Wouldn t bother me I ve been left before Just let me know when you do There s nothing left here Not a picture left to decipher Just a bleak existence Wanting to be forgotten Don t pay heed to my words You wouldn t understand them This is the loneliness talking The thorn bird has already begun The sun sets on my heart The dawn will bring doom Its all going to fade away The night still belongs to me My heart swirls in madness The stars light the way Your ghosts dance to my tunes An illusion to keep me sane I don t want to escape the loneliness Moment of wanting have me crushed My desires let down my front Let me suffer in agony Everyone took their piece My soul belongs to everyone I m just a hollow shell Waiting for my misery to end I had a lot of time To contemplate my end The deed has already happened Right when it all made sense Mir
