In a shocking move by payment processing behemoth, PayPal, the company announced that it would fine users of their service $2500 if they promoted misinformation. This frightening and obviously totalitarian provision in their terms was quickly removed after considerable backlash by numerous individuals, including both the former CEO and founder of PayPal.PayPal stated that the change was done in error. Yet, this begs the obvious questions: 1. Who had the authority to put such a change into the policy? Did it not pass through multiple rounds of review? and 2. Why was their legal team or whomever was in charge of this update even permitted to consider something so disturbing and anti-free speech?Even though PayPal has reversed their decision to implement this policy, this gave us an eerie glimpse into the future. Had not been for the backlash, this policy they have stayed in place. Knowing this, it stands to reason that the only thing preventing banks, tech giants, and payment processors from placing speech restrictive strangleholds over our money is public opinion.Today, we have the ability to vote with our wallets and shoes to conduct business with companies who have our interests in mind, not the interests of being speech arbiters.Of course, misinformation is dangerous, but misinformation isn’t always a lie – it can be an unproven theory, or a simple disagreement on a highly political topic. PayPal gave themselves the absolute authority to enforce the rule as they pleased, so the outcome would’ve been chilling to free speech.
