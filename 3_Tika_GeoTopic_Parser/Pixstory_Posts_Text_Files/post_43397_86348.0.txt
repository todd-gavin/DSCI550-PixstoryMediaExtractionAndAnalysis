Oats Chills Recipe (Stepwise) :
1. Add 1 cup of oats to a grinder jar.
2. Grind to a slightly coarse powder. If the flour is too coarse the oats chilla can break.
3. Add it to a mixing bowl along with
• ¼ cup besan
• ½ to 3/4 cumin seeds (jeera) or carom seeds (ajwain)
• ½ teaspoon salt
4. Add
• 2 to 3 tbsps fine chopped onions
• 1 to 2 green chilies fine chopped
5. Make a batter adding water as needed. I added another ¼/4 cup this may depend on the kind of oatmeal used. If using rolled oats, you will need about 1 ½ cup water. The batter should be of spreading consistency similar to that of dosa batter. Adjust salt as needed.
7. Heat your pan well. When it is hot enough, drizzle few drops of oil and smear with a tissue or cloth. If using a non-stick pan you don't need to grease it.
8. Regulate the heat to medium flame. Mix the batter well. Pour 1 ladle full of batter. It will be about ¼ cup.
9. Spread it with a light hand. Do not spread it too much. If the batter is too thick, you won't be able to spread it as it will stick to the ladle as you spread. In this case add little more water. If the batter is too runny, the oats chilla will be too soft and limpy. In this case you may need to add a tbsp of besan.
10. Add half to 1 teaspoon oil or ghee around the edges. Cook until the base is firm and set well. Flip it.
11. Cook on the other side as well, pressing down gently with a spatula.
12. Cook well on both the sides. To make it lightly crisp, cook on a medium heat for few minutes. Repeat making the rest. With this batter you will be able to make 6 chilla. Stir the batter well before making the next oats chilla. If required sprinkle little water. You may need 1 to 2 tbsp more water as the batter thickens upon resting.
