With the ban in France on the use of names of products of animal origin for products based on vegetable proteins, a national law is now also needed in Italy to definitively shed light on fake burgers and other products that improperly use names such as mortadella or sausage. And what he says Coldiretti in announcing the publication in the French Official Gazette of the decree of the transalpine government which use the specific terminology of butcher&#39;s, delicatessen or fishmonger&#39;s and names a food of animal origin representative of commercial uses A decree that overcomes the uncertainties still present at a European level by closing the road to the presence in the shopping cart of fake hamburgers with soy, spices and enhancers of flavor or false sausages filled with chickpeas lentils peas beetroot juice or sweeteners thanks to the possibility highlighted by Coldiretti of using names such as vegan burger and vegan steak bresaola salami mortadella vegetarian or vegan with the only limitation of specifying on the label that these products do not contain meat A deception that affects consumers in Italy who do not follow a vegetarian or vegan diet The persistence of a situation of uncertainty unfortunately represents a favor to the lobbies of the multinationals who invest in fake vegetable or laboratory-created meat denounces the President of Coldiretti Ettore Prandini focusing on a sneaky communication strategy which deliberately takes advantage of the notoriety and tradition of the most successful denominations of the traditional Italian livestock supply chain to attract the attention of consumers and induce them to think that these products are substitutes for the taste and nutritional values of the meat and meat-based products In your opinion, it is correct to allow vegetable mixes to use the denomination meat on the label
