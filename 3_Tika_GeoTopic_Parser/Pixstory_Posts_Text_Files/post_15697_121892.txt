When Mick Miners a farmer in New South Wales Australia first saw a large black object sticking out of the ground in a remote part of his land he thought it was a dead tree But on closer inspection and verification from experts he learned it had fallen from space The Australian Space Agency ASA later said it came from a SpaceX capsule Experts described the discovery as rare and exciting but said such events may become more common The object landed on July in a large area of fields but was not discovered by Mr Miners until several weeks later Two other pieces were later found nearby and the ASA asked anyone who came across further items to contact a debris hotline set up by SpaceX Dr Brad Tucker an astrophysicist at the Australian National University was called to examine the object He is often called to similar discoveries the vast majority of which turn out not to be space debris This has been super exciting to see this all up close I ve never seen a piece of space junk fall like this he said in a video shared online Don Pollacco a professor of astrophysics at the UK s Warwick University agreed that it was very rare for space debris to hit land While objects fall from space to Earth every day the vast majority land in the oceans covering most of the planet he said What s more the only recorded case of a person being hit was Lottie Williams who was unhurt when a piece of space debris landed on her shoulder in Oklahoma US in Other incidents include damage to buildings in Ivory Coast in from pieces of a Chinese rocket However discoveries on land may become more common especially as the number of rockets sent to space has hugely increased in recent years The Sun is also moving into a cycle of being more active Prof Pollacco added a knock on effect of which may be more debris falling to Earth Source
