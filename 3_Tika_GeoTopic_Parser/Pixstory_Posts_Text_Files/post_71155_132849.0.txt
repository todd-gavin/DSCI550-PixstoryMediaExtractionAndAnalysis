Capt. Sami Ara Surury, a Sumbal Sonawari resident who obtained her CPL (Commercial Pilot License) in 1994, is the first Kashmiri woman to possess this qualification. 

Capt. Ara had to overcome the opposition of her own family, who wanted her to pursue an MBBS, become a doctor, and lead a quiet life, in order to achieve where she is now. It was a difficult road for the unassuming Kashmiri girl, who had less money than she needed amid the instability in the Valley in 1987, from applying and getting hired as cabin staff to becoming a commercial pilot.

Although this journey took her more than five years, she was ultimately successful in acquiring her CPL by finishing her pilot training in Texas, USA. She is a 48-year-old Airbus pilot and an inspiration to all young girls who wish to fly high.
