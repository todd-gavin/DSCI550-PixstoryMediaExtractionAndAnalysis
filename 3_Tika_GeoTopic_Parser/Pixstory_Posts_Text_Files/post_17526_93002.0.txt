With the Los Angeles Lakers missing its two biggest stars while simultaneously dropping out of Play-In Tournament contention, all eyes are on Russell Westbrook. When the controversial superstar’s career landed him alongside LeBron James and Anthony Davis last summer, the last thing Westbrook expected was to become the scapegoat for a failing Lakers season.

The Lakers point guard fell under constant criticism throughout the season from frustrated fans, which then later resulted in Westbrook addressing certain name-calling incidents, pleading with fans to stop harassing him and his family.
