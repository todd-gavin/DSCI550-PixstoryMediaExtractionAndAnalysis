Snoring is noisy breathing while you sleep. It’s a common condition that can affect anyone, although it happens more often in men and overweight people. Snoring tends to get worse with age.“You can’t get a full breath of air, so things start vibrating as they try to allow you to breathe — and the vibration is the snoring sound,” said Dr Kent Smith, a sleep dentist in Dallas and former president of the American Sleep and Breathing Academy. Men are about twice as likely to snore as women are, and several things, including allergies, can cause it, ageing, a cold or even just the distinctive shape of your throat. Your weight may also play a role.

These are some non-surgical treatments for someone who snores:
--Lifestyle changes: Avoiding alcohol before bed, changing your sleep position and maintaining a healthy weight can reduce snoring.
--Medications: Cold and allergy medications relieve nasal congestion and help you breathe freely.
--Nasal strips: Flexible bands stick to the outside of your nose and keep nasal passages open.
--Oral appliances: Wearing an oral appliance when you sleep keeps your jaw in the proper position so air can flow. Your healthcare provider might call it a mouth device or mouthguard. A mouth guard used for other purposes, like sports, won’t resolve to snore.

If the snoring is not mild, there are different ways of treating it.
--Laser-assisted uvula palatoplasty (LAUP): LAUP reduces tissue in the soft palate and improves airflow.
--Radiofrequency ablation: Somnoplasty, also called this technique, uses radiofrequency energy to shrink excess tissue in the soft palate and tongue.
--Septoplasty: This procedure straightens a deviated septum in the nose. A septoplasty improves airflow through the nose by reshaping the cartilage and bone.
--Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy: The surgeon removes excess tissue from the back of the throat (tonsillectomy) or the back of the nose (adenoidectomy).
