Terrible lyrics is nothing new , but over time there have been lyrics which  blatantly disrespect women and obejctify them . They often comment on her body and youth and in an obsence manner . Item songs especially are famous for this , songs like 'Munni badnaam hui' , 'Sheila ki Jawani ' even the latest aafat from liger even though its not an item song . 
These songs are more damaging than we think , though some dismiss it as being an element of masala film , they are being consumed by audience including many young people. They promote rape culture, cat calling, harrasment and pass it as romance. Which is very harmful for the society. It definitely influences to some extent the people who are exposed to them . They give a terrible message to young people who are impressionable. It is high  time  that we as the audience stop supporting and popularising such songs  .
