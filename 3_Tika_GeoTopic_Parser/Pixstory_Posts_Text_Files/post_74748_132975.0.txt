9. Caramelised fennel tart
"To reduce food waste and recycle vegetables, I like to slice off the core from a fennel bulb about an inch from the bottom. I then place it in a glass with 250ml water and pop it on a sunny windowsill. In a few weeks, roots will start to grow. Once this happens, you can plant it in your garden – in about 8-12 weeks you’ll have enough fennel to make another tart,” says chef Hamish Ingham.
