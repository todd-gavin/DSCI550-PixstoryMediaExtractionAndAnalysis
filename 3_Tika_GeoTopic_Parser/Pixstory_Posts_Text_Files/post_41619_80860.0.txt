Polo is a horse-drawn ball game, a traditional field sport, and one of the oldest team sports in the world. The goal of the game is for two opposing teams to score by hitting a little hard ball through the opposing team's goal with a long-handled wooden mallet . Each side includes four mounted riders, and the game normally lasts one to two hours, with chukkas (or "chukkers") interspersed throughout.
