After the January transfer activity there was an obvious and understandable curiosity to see how the new signings Dusan Vlahovic and Denis Zakaria would perform on their Juventus debut Well the two showed up with a goal each one in each half as Juventus collected a win over a Verona side that was always held at a safe distance It was the defeat of Parma in September that two Juventus players last found the net on their bows All eyes were on Vlahovic who took little time to endear himself to his new fans With his first touch he unleashed a powerful shot that Lorenzo Montip parried at full stretch With his second opportunity he gave the Verona goalkeeper no chance Paulo Dybala played the ball into space and using his pace and strength to hold off his marker Vlahovic lobbed the on rushing goalkeeper for his debut goal minutes on the clock and DV had already brought the house down On minutes the combination between the two almost led to Juventus doubling their lead but Vlahovic s touch ended just wide Another positive note was the personality of Zakaria covering plenty of ground in the centre of the park and keen to push forward as was proved in the second half Verona started the second half with greater conviction and kept the Bianconeri penned in their own field for a quarter of an hour but on minutes Zakaria who had already shown a remarkable personality in the first half followed Vlahovic with a debut goal Morata broke over the half way line and rolled the ball to Zakaria who took the ball in his stride inside the visitors penalty area One touch to steady himself the second to take aim as he drilled a low shot beyond Montip Vlahovic McKennie and Kean all tried to add another goal to round off the result but the two goals from the January reinforcements were enough to boost confidence ahead of the busy February schedule
