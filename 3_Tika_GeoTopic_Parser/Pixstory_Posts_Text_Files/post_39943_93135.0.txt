Rule 1: Buy Fresh Beans
Rule 2: Keep Coffee Beans Fresh
Rule 3: Choose Good Coffee
Rule 4. Grind Your Own
Rule 5. Use Good Water
Rule 6. Avoid Cheap Filters
Rule 7. Don't Skimp on the Coffee. 
The standard measure for brewing coffee of proper strength is 2 level tablespoons per 6-ounce cup or about 2 3/4 tablespoons per 8-ounce cup. Tricks like using less coffee and hotter water to extract more cups per pound tend to make for bitter brews.
Rule 8. Beware the Heat
Water that is too hot will extract compounds in the coffee that are bitter rather than pleasant. The proper brewing temperature is 200°F, or about 45 seconds off a full boil. (Most good coffeemakers regulate this automatically.) Once brewed, don't expect coffee to hold its best flavors for long. Reheating, boiling or prolonged holding on a warming platform will turn even the best coffee bitter and foul-tasting.
Rule 9. Keep Your Equipment Clean
Coffee is best served at a temperature between 155ºF and 175ºF (70ºC to 80ºC). Most people prefer it towards the higher end, at about 175ºF.
