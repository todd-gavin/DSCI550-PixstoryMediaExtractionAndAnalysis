As the time of demolition was near, locals surrounding the area of Supertech Twin Towers gathered to see the demolition of the skyscrapers.
People were trying to get past the barricades, there is a park adjacent to the towers, to get past the police, they were entering the areas through the park. 
The security measures were strict but the people somehow found a way to get past in excitement of viewing the demolition.
As the towers were demolished, locals were wooooing and dancing. They were huge roars of excitements from the crowd. 
The whole area outside the barricade was full with locals, it looked like as if whole villages came to see the demolition.
