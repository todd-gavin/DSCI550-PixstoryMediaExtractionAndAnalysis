It is hard to survive the days of severe pain and grief especially when you have so much of pain and you are not being able to shed it out through some way During these days let s be kind to ourselves and not put too much of pressure on us and do how we have it being said in our minds Because with weighed heart and body it s hard to do anything even if it is the simplest thing Don t push yourself so much and I hope it becomes a better day and a better start for you tomorrow All my love to those who are fighting that voices and pains Just know that this is a phase and this too shall pass
