Pak Invasion of Kashmir continues………

As we were groping for a way out, Mr. V. P. Menon, Secretary of the Ministry of States, arrived in Srinagar by plane. He came straight to my residence to see me and told me that he had come there to take me to New Delhi. Nothing about military aid, he said. could be decided till my arrival there. I told him that we had sent our Deputy Prime Minister to Delhi with a letter of accession. I reminded him that when I had come to the State to take over as Prime Minister. I had been assured of military aid whenever I wanted it. He told me, however, that without my going to Delhi, it was difficult to say that military aid would be available in time to save the city of Srinagar.

Mr. Menon and myself then went to the palace to meet His Highness. We apprised him of the situation and he told me that I should accompany Mr. Menon to Delhi early on the morning of 25th. He further told us that he had decided to send the Maharani and the Yuvraj, who was bed-ridden owing to a fracture of his hip- joint, to Jammu. His Highness himself did not want to leave Srinagar. He wanted to remain in the city on post of duty, and do his best to protect it from the invaders.

Mr. Menon and I suggested to him that he should leave for Jammu as soon as possible as the situation may demand his personal negotiations with India.  For this purpose it would be more convenient if he were in Jammu than in Srinagar. Eventually he was persuaded to leave Srinagar at about 2 A. M. on the 26th morning.
