Digital Extremes, the developers behind the multiplayer sci fi third person shooter Warframe revealed the trailer for their new upcoming game titled Soulframe, a kind of sister game or spiritual successor to Warframe in the same way Dark Souls succeeded Demon Souls. Where Warframe is a fast-paced shooter set in a sci-fi universe, Soulframe is a fantasy MMO with an emphasis on melee combat. Soulframe was announced during TennoCon 2022 and is being led by Steve Sinclair, the director of Warframe who is stepping down from his current role to help get the new game up and running. “Where ‘Warframe’ is focused on shooting, this one’s focused on melee,” Sinclair said.


“Where ‘Warframe’ is super fast and crazy high-speed, this one’s going to be a lot more slow and heavy. But it still has a lot of similarities to the genre that we have experience in.” Like its predecessor, Soulframe will adopt a free-to-play model  and will have a focus on exploration, featuring a hub world similar to Warframe's open-world planets.  “The conceit [in ‘Soulframe’] is that the world itself is a little angry about what’s been done to it, and the grounds underneath tend to shift throughout the day,” said creative director Geoff Crookes. “So there’s going to be proceduralism within the cave networks and crevasses and so on underneath the world.”


While combat will be slowly paced and melee-focused Sinclair and Crookes emphasized that they’re not trying to make a game in the vein of From Software’s genre-pioneering Souls series. “I think it certainly isn’t an inspiration for the initial ideas or what we wanted to do,” Sinclair said. “Ironically, other titles that were maybe borrowing from ‘Warframe’ might have been some sort of reverse influence. But ‘Elden Ring’ has absolutely been a subject of some conversation — maybe to do with camera, maybe to do with how excellent their combat pacing is. And you know, screw those guys, because damn, ['Elden Ring'] was absolutely fantastic.”
