‌ Experts have estimated that Boris Johnson could make more than £5m a year after he quits Downing Street.

Johnson’s £155,376 salary puts him in the top 1% of UK earners. His housing, transport and a huge part of his living costs are covered by the taxpayer.

It is said that regardless of whether his financial straits are real or imagined, there are two certainties as per her biographer, that he is hopeless with money and that he will have no problem making lots of it after he leaves office.

In Johnson’s backbench days, when he was earning about £830,000 for newspaper columns, books, speeches and TV appearances, he cited the £250,000 he earned for his Daily Telegraph column as “chicken feed”.

Andrew Gimson, whose second biography of Johnson will be disseminated this autumn, decides that Johnson’s major money-raising activities will be on the celebrity lecture circuit. “He will be able to command at least £100,000 per speech in America, Japan, China and Australia, and easily do 15 to 20 of those a year.”

Sonia Purnell, another of Johnson’s biographers, questions whether Johnson’s two great loves – power and money – could destroy each other.

“There’s a tension here: he doesn’t do resignation but the longer he tries to cling on, the lower his brand sinks,” she said. “The image of his fingernails raking against the wall of Downing Street as people try to drag him out and he’s trying to cling on isn’t good for his brand.”
