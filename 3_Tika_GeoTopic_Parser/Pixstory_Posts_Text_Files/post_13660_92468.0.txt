Taliban fighters beat a female student on the border of Islam Qala in the west of the country for "traveling without a Muharram".

The girl is a university student abroad and wanted to return to her studies after the Nowruz holiday.

She said that when the student reached the border of Islam Qala, the border between Afghanistan and Iran, She came across two Taliban fighters who arrested her and severely beat her.

The Ministry of Enjoining the Good and Forbidding the Evil had previously banned women from traveling without a Muharram by issuing leaflets.

With the rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan, severe restrictions have been imposed on women's fundamental rights. Human rights activists say they see the pressure as "gender apartheid" and call for an immediate end to restrictions on women.

Shahrzad Akbar, head of Afghanistan's Independent Human Rights Commission, said on Thursday that Taliban fighters were looking for an excuse to beat civilians on a daily basis. "The beatings of women, students, protesters and journalists show their inability to deal with civilians and their disbelief in human dignity," she said.

Ms. Akbar has warned that the consequences of this kind of treatment of people will be an increase in hatred, distance and hatred.
