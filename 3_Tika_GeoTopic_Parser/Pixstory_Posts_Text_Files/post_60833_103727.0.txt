Getting started with illustrating can seem a bit daunting but it's actually super easy!

People also think you need the right tools for getting started with digital art, but all you really need is an app on your phone!

Autodesk sketchbook is a free app you can install from playstore and get started with drawing whatever you feel. They have many brushes and tools you can explore with to create any kind of illustration you want.

It may seem a little tedious to draw with your finger on the phone screen but with consistent practice, you'll get better at it! Trust the process even if your initial works are messy.

Also, before you get started, I'd recommend you learn more about the layers and brushes first. Experiment with the different tools like select, fill, etc., to get a good idea before you start anything.
