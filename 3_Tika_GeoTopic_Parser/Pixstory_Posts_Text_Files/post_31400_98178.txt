What makes the sound of one violin preferable to that of another Some Stradivari violins really have a special sound To answer these questions, a multidisciplinary team coordinated by the Cnr involved luthiers in a listening experiment to evaluate the sound qualities of four violins among which a Stradivarius Findings published in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America suggest that a particular balance in the timbre properties of the instrument makes the Stradivarius the preferred sound Stradivarius violins are recognized worldwide as an excellence in craftsmanship a model for luthiers and a mirage for collectors and musicians However, various researches show that expert violinists, if blindfolded, seem to prefer modern violins to these instruments. The experiment devised by Carlo Andrea Rozzi of the Nanoscience Institute of the Cnr Cnr Nano Alessandro Voltini of the International School of lutherie A Stradivari from Cremona Fabio Antonacci from the Milan Polytechnic Massimo Nucci and Massimo Grassi from the Department of General Psychology of the University of Padua UniPadova helps clarify this apparent paradox The researchers invited Cremona luthiers to analyze and comparatively evaluate the timbre of four violins two modern one and a Stradivarius compared to the sound of a reference Stradivarius violin Based only on listening to five notes, the listeners showed a marked preference for a violin, in particular in this case the Stradivarius The researchers then identified a sort of signature that distinguishes the violin sound preferred by those considered less pleasant Thanks to an in-depth analysis of the descriptions provided by listeners and vibro-acoustic measurements carried out on the instruments, we were able to describe the preferred sound as the one that has a particular balance of openness, clarity and nasality clarifies Carlo Andrea Rozzi of Cnr Nano first author of the study
