Strangely enough I had this idea that not eating meat was a choice based in personal ethics I have heard vegetarians and vegans talk about why they don t eat meat and although I m not exactly vegetarian I ve always found their concern for animals compelling Sadly the right wing Hindus in this country do not seem to extend their compassion to human beings as well as animals How can you talk about Hinduism being gentle and compassionate and then thrash Muslim students for eating chicken chicken mind you not even the taboo meats as is their constitutional right
