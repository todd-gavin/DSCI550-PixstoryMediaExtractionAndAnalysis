I'm still an immigrant and a refugee, although for other purposes far from home I may have had different experiences, so I know what it tastes like to be homeless, a fugitive and a refugee. I explicitly say that the taste of this experience is very bitter, perhaps like the bitterness of dying, because it is a kind of dying, if not completely, one is partially uprooted from some part of one's own being. The consequence of this experience is liberating on the one hand because it frees a person from full attachment to certain geographies and identities to some extent, but on the other hand it can also be harmful because it is an emotional and valuable burden of relationship with homeland and society. The domination of the profiteering view of the world is likely to turn much of his wealth into material goods.
That is why today Afghanistan is facing all these unfortunate events. Because the generation of society's thinkers is involved in brainstorming. The generation that makes the foundation of a strong society more stable is all fleeing the homeland.
