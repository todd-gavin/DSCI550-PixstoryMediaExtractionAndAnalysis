Arsenal

Grade - F

This was a dreadful transfer window from Arsenal, which saw them fail to sign a striker or a central midfielder.

The only positive for the Gunners was that they managed to trim some of the deadwood with the likes of Sead Kolasinac and Callum Chambers leaving.

However, they spent pretty much the whole month trying to sign Dusan Vlahovic from Fiorentina, but he only wanted to join Juventus, and that is where he ended up (90min).

Once this deal went through, the Gunners were left with a short amount of time to try and find another forward.

Instead of signing anyone, they decided to cancel Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's contract so that he could join Barcelona.

Now, Mikel Arteta had clearly had enough of Aubameyang, but to allow him to leave without a replacement in place seems like an odd decision.

The Gunners will have to rely on Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah for the rest of the season as they try to push for a spot in the top four.

Now, Nketiah has scored zero Premier League goals this season and Lacazette has three goals (transfermarkt).

That doesn't seem like enough to me, and the Gunners will have to hope that the likes of Emile Smith Row and Bukayo Saka can come up with the goods.

In central midfield, Arsenal allowed Ainsley Maitland-Niles to move to Roma on loan and then didn't sign a replacement.

This leaves the Gunners with four players who can play in that role, but I would argue that only Thomas Partey represents a top-class option.

Arsenal were linked with new Newcastle United midfielder Bruno Guimaraes, but they decided against a move, and I wouldn't be surprised if they regret that.

You would have to say that the board have left the squad woefully short, and it would be a surprise if they even finish in the top six now.
