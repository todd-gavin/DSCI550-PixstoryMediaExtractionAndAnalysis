Ralf Ragnick is not expecting the World Cup to return to his squad after receiving a blow against Liverpool. Paul Pogba may have played his last game, with Ragnick revealing a
calf injury looks set to bring the French midfielder’s 2021-22 to a close.

With the World Cup winner running down his contract at the Old Trafford, free agency
beckons when the summer transfer window opens.

It is unlikely that Pogba will again play for the Red Devils, but before that the
29-year-old is set for another enforced spell on the sidelines.

Will Pogba play for Man Utd again?

When asked by some reports, ahead of a trip to fellow top-four hopefuls Ragnick said
that” Paul Pogba is out, it seems even after the scan it is very unlikely that he will play
before the end of the season.”

“The doctor told me it will take four weeks minimum and the last game is the end of
May, so I don’t think it will be very likely.”

What happened to Pogba vs Liverpool?

The Frenchman lasted only for 10 minutes in the last meeting against Liverpool. He
was forced from the field early on at Anfield in a 4-0 defeat for the Red Devils and
headed straight down the tunnel.

After the match, Ragnick told MUTV, “He pulled his calf, and it seems right now, this will
not be an injury like the one Fred has which was gone in a week.”

Big things were expected from him in Manchester but struggles for form and fitness
have blighted a second stint with the Red Devils.

Pogba made 226 appearances across six years, scoring 39 goals while helping to
deliver Community Shield, League Cup and Europa League in 2017.
