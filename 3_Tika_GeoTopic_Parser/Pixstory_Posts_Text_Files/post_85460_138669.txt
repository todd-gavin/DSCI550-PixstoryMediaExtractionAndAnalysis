 BUKAYO SAKA Sources close to Bukayo Saka have informed me that he is extremely close to agreeing a new bumper deal with Arsenal The young star has been with arsenal since a toddler and has gone from strength to strength since appearing as a left back under emery he s amassed over appearances for the first team and broken into the England national team He s rise from prospect to indispensable first team player hasn t been taken for granted by arsenal and they ve offered the winger kpw over years it s thought the player is committed to Arsenal and sees he s long term future with the club This is a real boost for Arsenal tying down one of there biggest assets on a long term deal shows a step in the right direction It s just a matter of time before we see that contract signed What s your thoughts on this id love to hear Con
