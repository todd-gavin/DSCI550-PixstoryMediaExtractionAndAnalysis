Kacha Moog'er Dal is a mild dal made with moong lentils that is perfect for summer when the more indulgent Bhaja Moog'er Dal is too hot to stomach. Bengali’s also eat Sona monger dal which is smaller in size unlike the normal moong dal. Sometimes it is first dry roasted and then further boiled with a little turmeric and salt. This is also distinct from the Lau diye Tetor Dal (dal made with bitter gourd and gourd) in terms of the tempering—plus it's incredibly quick and easy to make. Simply combine the kacha moong dal with some aloo seddho or aloo bhorta for a quick but filling meal.

Add the boiled dal. Also add salt, sugar, and turmeric. Stir everything together and let bubble for 6 minutes on medium heat.
