Built during the reign of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in 1656, Shri Digambar Jain Lal Mandir is the oldest Jain temple in Delhi. Made in the honor of the 23rd Tirthankara, Parashvanath, the temple is made of red sandstone.

Standing right across the Red Fort, the temple consists of a charitable bird hospital, which have different wards for different species, a research laboratory and an intensive care unit.

The hospital came in to being in 1956 and exemplifies one of the basic principles of Jainism, which states that all living beings, no matter how small or insignificant have a right to freedom.
