Sullivan produced two albums. He released his first album, ufo, in 1969. The record didn't do well at the time, but the 29 minute piece became a cult classic over the years – not before something strange happened. His career didn't get much notice at the time. Despite this, he pursued a career in music. Jim Sullivan, his second album, was released in 1972.

Sullivan use to sing at the Raft, a bar in Malibu and became a sort of a celebrity there. His talent was recognised by a group of sponsors, who funded his first album. In his words, he exuded all of the otherworldly presence that, according to the artist, was necessary when composing 'ufo'.

Jim Sullivan was said to be obsessed with UFOs and such extraterrestrial presences – which became pretty apparent after his album.

Sullivan continued to perform at the Raft and other bars for the next six years. His life, on the other hand, was starting to fall apart. Some of his songs, he suspected, had been stolen. This, coupled with a number of other factors, contributed to his melancholy and alcoholism. In 1975, Sullivan packed his belongings and drove to Nashville alone in his Volkswagen Beetle in search of job. He told his wife, Carol, and their son, Chris, that they would join him once he was financially secure.

That was the last his family saw him.

He was last seen in a motel on Route 66. 

Polie reports suggested he had not slept on the bed in his room, which was locked from the inside. Jim Sullivan's car was discovered 25 miles from the motel, outside a property. Jim's wallet, guitar, clothing, tapes, and cassettes were among the items discovered in the car.

Sullivan's manager, Robert Ginter, later alleged that they were discussing what they would do if they had to disappear in the early hours of the morning. Jim declared that he would go into the desert and never return.

The manager's statements along with 'ufo' lyrics only prompted people to have one explanation – alien abduction.
