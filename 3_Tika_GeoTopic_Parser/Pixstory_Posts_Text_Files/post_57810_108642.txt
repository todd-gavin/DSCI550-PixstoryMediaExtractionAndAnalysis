This is so annoying Especially when it s a work file something you actually need to send by a deadline and it s just gone Poof Scouring through all your folders you just don t see it It s like the file never existed Even searching in Everything becomes so difficult cause you start questioning yourself about what the name of the file was That s why you should just look for a sec where you re automated saving feature saves the files Otherwise finding the file is too mammoth of a task of its own
