Twitter is a live in the moment activity It s not something that can be worked on in the next few hours or days If you made a mistake you made a mistake spelling or facts because that s what you did at the time So if you re having trouble with that simply be a little more cautious and double check before pressing the Send button An edit button would jeopardise the integrity of the online conversation Twitter must not give one The Twitter timeline is a record of billions of conversations throughout the world These are intricate dialogues that often involve a large number of people thanks to threading enabled by responses and retweets If a user has the ability to edit a tweet they can fully alter the conversation s content It would be a total disaster and bring the platform to its knees People frequently retweet like and comment on tweets It is its most important feature If someone could subsequently edit and completely change the meaning of a tweet like this it could alter the complete experience As a result engagement would quickly go down It s such a bad idea that I m surprised to see it presented so frequently If you send a tweet that you later regret or that contains a misspelling or other error simply delete it and resend it with the changes Or correct it in the following tweet Making mistakes isn t the end of the world However an edit button would totally ruin what twitter stands for
