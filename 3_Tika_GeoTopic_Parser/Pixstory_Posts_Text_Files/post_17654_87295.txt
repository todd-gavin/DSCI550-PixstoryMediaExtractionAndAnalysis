It was a frustrating night for the champions Manchester City And it was perfectly summed up by De Bruyne venting out his frustration at one of his teammates The Cityzens had the giant share of possession compared to Palace s But the blues were not able to carve open Palace s resolute backline City had lost their earlier fixture against Crystal Palace and this draw is a homage to the work Viera has done at Palace After the highs of the Manchester Derby everyone expected City to make light work of Crystal Palace But the Eagles have been a different animal under Patrick Viera Since arriving at Selhurst Park Viera has given this Palace side a new identity Before Viera s arrival Palace was just another midtable side With many of its players in their twilight years The dark clouds of relegation always seemed to loom over Selhurst Park And their playing style was obsolete as well The Eagles were a proper Old School counter attacking team that emphasized defending more than attacking Other than the odd wins against the big six the Palace faithful s had little or nothing to cheer about The work Viera has done at Palace is highly underappreciated The Frenchman has reduced the average age of the squad significantly With signings like Gallager Edouard and the list goes on The Arsenal legend has also transformed Palace s playing style and its different policies Viera has introduced a more attacking style of play at Selhurst Park that includes little triangles and one touch possession football The Frenchman has also given his players the freedom to express themselves And the Palace players and fans are relishing every bit of it Selhurst Park also seems to have found a new voice and there is a breath of fresh enthusiasm among the Eagles Liverpool has the opportunity to cut down the margin to point if they manage to overcome an Arsenal team who are on the up With everything at stake for both teams the clash between two of Engand s most iconic clubs seems to be a nail biting affair Will Liverpool reign supreme Or will Arsenal stun its old adversary
