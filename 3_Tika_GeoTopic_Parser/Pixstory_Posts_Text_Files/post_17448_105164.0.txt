Paris Saint-Germain defender Presnel Kimpembe has a contract with the capital club until 2024. In the last few weeks, the soon-to-be 27-year-old has also seen his name in the rumor mill, linking him to a reunion with former manager Thomas Tuchel at Chelsea. 

With a new regime set to take over at PSG, with Luis Campos coming in as the sporting advisor and having full power in the transfer market for the French club, there are many within the squad wondering if they’re part of the future. 

RMC Sport relayed the remarks made by Kimpembe when the central defender was asked about his future with his boyhood club. 

The France international stated that he understands the importance of where he’s at in his career. Kimpembe added that he’s eager to meet with the management to discuss his future. 

“Everyone knows my love for PSG. It’s mutual. I’m turning 27 in August, a key moment in my career,” Kimpembe said. 

“My next contract will be important. I’m waiting to meet the new sports management, to know the new project; I’m interested. We’ll have to discuss fairly quickly.”

There’s no denying Kimpembe’s love for PSG, but the inconsistency he brings can be frustrating; it’s why the departure of Thiago Silva continues to be felt. The Ligue 1 side rolled the dice allowing the Brazilian to leave, thinking Kimpembe would slide alongside Marquinhos and replace Silva. However, it hasn’t gone as planned. 

With Ramos having injury issues, it will be interesting to see if Campos decides to cash in on Kimpembe with a possible move to Chelsea or perhaps the Portuguese club chief feels he’s part of his plans. This summer will tell what the future holds.
