With up to million scent receptors dogs are among the best smell detectors in the animal world The human nose by comparison contains only around million scent receptors Dog brains also devote more brain space than humans to analyzing odors That s why people train dogs to search for diverse targets via smell from illegal drugs and agricultural pests to missing persons endangered wildlife species and more Dogs accomplish this by successfully recognizing the odors of substances called volatile organic compounds that are specifically associated with these targets Not only can trained dogs detect these volatile organic compounds but oftentimes they can do it with greater sensitivity than analytical instruments Volatile organic compounds can be produced by living organisms as well as by natural or synthetic materials In humans they are produced by the body s metabolic activity then enter the bloodstream and are finally released into the air through blood urine feces skin or breath Scientists have found that dogs can be trained to successfully recognize unique volatile organic compounds called biomarkers in the exhaled breath of patients with certain diseases or chronic medical conditions including cancer and diabetes as well as for pre seizure detection in epileptic individuals Our team of canine scent scientists at Florida International University wanted to figure out whether COVID is among the diseases that trained dogs can detect Our recent study which we carried out with our colleague forensic biologist DeEtta Mills confirms that it is We believe that dogs hold great promise as a rapid screening method that used with other measures such as rapid tests can help stop COVID spread and end the pandemic Some of the dogs trained during our research have already proved their abilities at airports and public events Training dogs to detect COVID Read full story at The Conversation Image courtesy
