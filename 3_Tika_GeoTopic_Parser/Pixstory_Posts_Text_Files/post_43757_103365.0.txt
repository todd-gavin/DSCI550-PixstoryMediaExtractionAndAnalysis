It was a heartbreaking defeat for Liverpool against Real Madrid in the UEFA Champions League finals held at Parc des Princess. The English Premier League runners up went on to lose the 14 time Champions of Europe 1-0 at the end of the 90 minutes. Few players have already played their last game for the Reds and few might be on the verge of transfer. Despite these, Danny Murphy, the PL legend has asked Jurgen Klopp to be not harsh on the players because of the defeat but also gave advice for the German manager. 

On one of the sport news outlets, Danny Murphy mentioned: 

There is no need for Jurgen Klopp to go and rip this team up after 1-0 Champions League final loss. Liverpool should look to freshen up midfield but European conquerors Real Madrid show Reds they don't have to overreact. 

Defeat will naturally bring its own inquest but Liverpool have to remember they have been phenomenal this season. To have a historic Quadruple talked about until the last weeks of the season is remarkable

In the finals, Liverpool again shred Real Madrid apart throughout the first half but were unable to get past Thibaut Courtois in Paris. After Real Madrid went ahead, they never looked comfortable on the ball and failed to be clinical in front of the goal. 

Liverpool have dealt with multiple injuries throughout the season and midfield is going to fall apart after the season. They have aging players like James Milner and Jordan Henderson in the midfield and Thiago is touching 30. The club needs to add a few pacy and crafty midfielders to keep up their pressing game in the English top-flight. 

Liverpool finished the 2021/22 season on a high with a FA Cup and Carabao Cup trophies. In both games, they went on to defeat Chelsea in the penalties. They eyed a historic quadruple but Manchester City won the Premier League title whereas their European conquest ended on a sad note.
