Devika Bulchandani, Global CEO, Ogilvy, is once again making headlines with her first visit to her home country after taking over the reins of the advertising agency in September.
Bulchandani landed in Mumbai and then went to Ogilvy’s office, where she received a warm welcome from the team along with advertising veteran, Piyush Pandey, Chief Creative Officer Worldwide and Executive Chairman, Ogilvy India
Both Bulchandani and Pandey, who have worked together for several years now, shook their legs to the ‘dhol’ and ‘sapp’ as they performed bhangra together.
It is also to be noted that the usage of ‘Dhols and Dhamaals’ is a must-have element for all major advertising events that take place in the advertising capital- Mumbai.
Post this, Bulchandani also suggested the team at Ogilvy’s Mumbai office to ‘Keep it going’ and ‘raise the bar for the network.’
Moreover, she also went on to reveal that her mantra in life is always a healthy dose of delusional optimism.
Bulchandani also highlighted that being human beings, it is not in our nature to wake up every day and say that we want to lead a mediocre life. Hence her biggest piece of advice for all team members at Ogilvy is to “Wake up every day in the morning and pursue greatness”.
“We will not get there every day, doesn’t matter. We have to wake up every day in that pursuit of greatness but doing it with goodness,” she stated.
In Bulchandani’s words, there is no other industry apart from advertising that has the power to wake one up and move realities and the world forward.
“Just imagine any other job, where you wake up every morning and you say I get to people who I love and actually get to have a living and make a living, but we get to do things that move all our realities and the world forward. I don’t know any other industry where we can do that,” she said.
