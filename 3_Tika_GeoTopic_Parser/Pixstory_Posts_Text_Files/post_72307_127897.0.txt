With 13 league titles won since 1992, Manchester United is unquestionably the most successful team in the Premier League era. The team never came in worse than third place under Sir Alex Ferguson, and in his last year at Old Trafford, United won the title. Since then, the Red Devils have been without a league championship.

Although it is early to speak of relegation, Erik ten Hag's Utd's consecutive losses raise one mystery: when was the last time Man Utd experienced the humiliation of dropping a division?

The Red Devils were most recently demoted in the 1973–74 campaign, finishing in 21st place with only 32 points. That season, the Red Devils went winless in 20 games, including their 3-0 loss to Arsenal in the season opener and their 1-0 defeat to Stoke City in the season finale.

The 2013–14 season, the one immediately after Ferguson's retirement, saw David Moyes lead United to their seventh-place Premier League result. The Red Devils also missed out on earning a spot in any European event for the first time since the 1989–90 campaign as a result of their subpar league record.

Their poorest Premier League point total was just 58, collected over 38 games in the 2021–22 season. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, a 1999 Treble-winning icon during his football career, was fired midway through that season when Ralf Rangnick's appointment as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's interim replacement failed to turn things around.

Although the United States has recently faced some challenges, they have faced worse in the past. Since their establishment as a club in 1878, they have been demoted five times, including once when operating under the name Newton Heath LYR F.C.

Manchester United spent most of their career in the First Division, the previous name for the highest division in English football, prior to the creation of the Premier League.

Manchester United were promoted back to the top tier in 1975 as winners after only one spell in the Second Division. Before the 1970s, Manchester United were relegated four more times: in 1894, 1922, 1931, and 1937.
