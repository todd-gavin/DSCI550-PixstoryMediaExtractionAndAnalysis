Australia defeated Peru 5-4 on penalties after a goalless 120 minute encounter to secure qualification for their fifth consecutive World Cup tournament.

The Socceroos were victorious in the qualification contest much thanks to substitute goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne’s dramatic penalty save that denied Peru’s fifth penalty kick.

The 33-year-old Sidney FC goalkeeper who started on the bench in the match was brought on during the penalty shootout went on to become the hero to hand Australia a place in the Qatar 2022 World Cup scheduled to take place in November.
