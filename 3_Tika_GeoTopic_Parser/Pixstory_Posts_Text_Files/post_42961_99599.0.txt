The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday conducted a nationwide operation at about 40 locations in connection with the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment Act, 2020 (FCRA) violation. The CBI was acting on a complaint by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).

Earlier, a detailed note was relayed on three FCRA-clearance networks, which have reportedly been operating and are believed to have links with government officials. They are also said to be charging speed money or problem resolution money.

An official letter read that it has been decided that the CBI should immediately investigate this, with the approval of the competent authority.

Operations are going on in Delhi, Rajasthan, Chennai, Hyderabad, Coimbatore, Mysore. The aim is to "nab representatives of NGOs, middlemen and public servants of MHA’s FCRA division who were facilitating illegal FCRA clearances in lieu of bribes.”

A senior CBI official said, “CBI has apprehended some accused, including public servants, while bribes were being exchanged. Half a dozen public servants and others are being quizzed. These individuals were allegedly committing a violation of the provision of FCRA and were facilitating illegal clearance of FCRA matters in exchange for bribes.”

Ten people, including six public servants, are being questioned. Transactions of Rs 2 cr have been allegedly found -- routed through the hawala channel -- during searches.
