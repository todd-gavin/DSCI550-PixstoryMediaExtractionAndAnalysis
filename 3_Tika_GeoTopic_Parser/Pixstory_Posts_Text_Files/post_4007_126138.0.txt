I came across this really different but a must try combo during my stay in Alleppey. My friend who took me around to enjoy the lushly Alleppey also took me to the famous Sree Krishna Swamy Temple, Ambalapuzha. The temple is known for its payasam (kheer) and the making of this payasam has a very interesting story. 

Other than the payasam, the other sacred food given to the devotees is this combo of banana and butter along with a sprinkle of sugar served on the banana leaf.Â  At first the combo may make us doubt, but trust me it was a delight to my mouth.
