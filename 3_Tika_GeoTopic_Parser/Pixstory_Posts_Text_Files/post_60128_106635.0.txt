Sholay, the classic 1975 film starring Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra, Amjad Khan, Jaya Bachchan, Hema Malini, and others, is undeniably one of the best Hindi films ever filmed. The Ramesh Sippy-directed film was the first in India to be given a silver jubilee (a 25-week run in a single theatre).
 But did you know that in its firstweek, it was labelled a tremendous flop by media critics?

In  a previous interview, sholay co-writer salim khan discussed the picture being branded a flop by trade analysts, according to an old report by glamsham. "yes, it is true that bollywood trade pundits wrote off the movie when it was released," he stated. in fact, trade magazines published a series of analytical articles delving into the reasons for the film's failure!"

Despite this, Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar felt confident in Sholay. "But I and Javed sahib were so confident of the film's success that in response to the negative reports, we had published a Full Page advertisement in all the trade magazines declaring that the film would gross Rs. 1 crore business in each territory of India!" the veteran writer was quoted as saying.

Do you want to know if their prediction was correct? Salim Khan, for one, conceded they were wrong, saying, "Actually, our prediction was also wrong..... because the movie did not do 1 crore business... However, it did more than 2 crores in business in each of India's states!!!"

Sholay grossed Rs 15,00,00,000 (Rs 15 crore), which, if converted to today's ticket prices, would be far over Rs 160 crore.

For its fantastic story, language, songs, and performances, the Ramesh Sippy directed film is still watched by young and old today.
