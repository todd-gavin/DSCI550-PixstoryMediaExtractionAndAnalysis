Chris Hemsworth has flaunted his ripped physique in a series of new photos on Tuesday to prove his health and fitness program Centr gets results.

The Thor star showed off his bulging biceps and eight-pack abs in several pictures to promote the site.

But there was one slightly awkward detail: the Aussie star seemingly didn’t know what to do with his hands – something he poked fun at in the caption.

“@centrfit has everything you need for your fitness journey,” Hemsworth wrote alongside the post.

“What it doesn’t have is advice on what to do with your hands in photos. I’m hoping this helps everyone out there. Here’s my 3 looks …”

The 38-year-old co-founded Centr – a subscriber-only fitness app – in 2019, alongside Fitness & Lifestyle Group’s digital division, Loup.

The app – which took off almost immediately – is worth a reported $US200 million ($A267m), and has involved big celebrity names including Special Ops trainer Joseph Sakoda aka “Da Rulk”, Hollywood trainer Gunnar Peterson, Hemsworth’s personal trainer Luke Zocchi, and his wife, fellow actor and fitness author, Elsa Pataky.

An estimated 200,000 people now use the platform, which was acquired by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ brother, Mark Bezos, in April this year, though the cost of the acquisition was not disclosed.

“Centr was created to provide people with carefully curated and integrated fitness, nutrition, and mindfulness programs, guiding beginners and more experienced users in achieving their unique health and fitness goals,” Hemsworth said in a statement referring to the acquisition.

“I looked forward to partnering with HighPost and Inspire to continue the success of Centr, inspire people to lead healthier and more active lives, and increase our strong subscriber base worldwide by developing outstanding new content and expanding our offerings.

“I would like to thank the teams at FLG and Loup for their many contributions to Centr and for their ongoing support.”
