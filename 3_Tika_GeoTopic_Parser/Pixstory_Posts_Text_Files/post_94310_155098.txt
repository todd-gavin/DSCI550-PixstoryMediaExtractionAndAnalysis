France U women s team and Canada U women s team started their tournament with a one all draw at The Fatorda Stadium in Margao The first chance came in the opening minute itself with France s Liagre attempting a shot from the edge of the box In the th minute there was further action in the Canadian box as a header from Marques had to be saved by Canadian goalkeeper Lallier but she couldn t punch the ball out properly and it needed a goal line clearance from the defence Although the best chance of the first half fell to Canada s Amanda Marie Allen whose pressing movement allowed her to latch onto a short back pass from France s No Bossiet Unfortunately for her her shot hit the cross bar and fell into the palms of the French shot stopper Interestingly even the French had a clear goal opportunity denied by the framework as Dumets yard curling shot kissed the right frame of the goal and out for a goal kick In the second half Canada took the ascendancy with substitute player Chukuwu dribbling her way past the defence only to attempt a timid shot But she wasn t denied moments later in the th minute as she beautifully finished from a through ball from her midfield It took France just six minutes to equalise as their striker Calba slotted home with a diving header of a cross from the right flank The match remained exciting in the last quarter of an hour as both sides looked to get the winner The final opportunity came to Calba again deep in injury time as she hit a shot from the six yard box but it had too much power as the ball went over the goal France would be the more disappointed team having had attempts whereas Canada on the other hand would be happy with the defensive effort they put in today
