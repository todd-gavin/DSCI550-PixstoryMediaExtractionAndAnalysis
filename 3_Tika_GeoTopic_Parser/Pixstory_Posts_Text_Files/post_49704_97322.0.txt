Covid cases are a surge in Taiwan and Congress appears as a saviour by unanimously passing legislation calling on the State Department to submit a plan to help Taiwan regain its observer status at the World Health Organization (WHO).

Taiwan is excluded from most global organisations such as the WHO, and the United Nations health agency, because of disapproval from Beijing, which considers the island part of its territory and not a separate country. Beijing sees President Tsai as a separatist and has stepped up pressure on the island since she took office, seeking to limit Taipei’s participation not only in the WHO but in other non-political organisations but many organisations.

The new measure passed by the HOR directs the secretary of state to solidify a strategy for attaining observer status at the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the WHO. Taiwan campaigned hard for an observer seat at the 2021 assembly but was futile. With the strong support of the US things might change for Taiwan.

Meanwhile, when China has expressed staunch opposition, this should be regarded as a blow by the US  to China.
