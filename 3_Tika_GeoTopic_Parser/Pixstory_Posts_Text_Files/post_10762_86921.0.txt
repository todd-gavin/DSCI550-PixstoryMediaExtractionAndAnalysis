Fear tactics is commonly used by marketers today.  Each and every brand uses the "Offer valid for limited time!" to drive sales. 

The concept of limited time offers is rooted in the psychological phenomenon known as loss aversion, which is the idea that people prefer avoiding losses over acquiring gains. These brands drive customers to make a decision on spot, and their sales thrive on such impulsive decision making adopted by the customers. Such tactics deprive customers of an informed decision making about the concerned product. 

Why subject someone to undue pressure because you want to make money off them immediately.
