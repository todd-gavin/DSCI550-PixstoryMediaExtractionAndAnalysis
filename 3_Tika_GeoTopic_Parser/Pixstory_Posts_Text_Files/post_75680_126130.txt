I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers From the seas and the streams I bear light shade for the leaves when laid In their noonday dreams From my wings are shaken the dews that waken The sweet buds every one When rocked to rest on their mother s breast As she dances about the sun I wield the flail of the lashing hail And whiten the green plains under And then again I dissolve it in rain And laugh as I pass in thunder I sift the snow on the mountains below And their great pines groan aghast And all the night tis my pillow white While I sleep in the arms of the blast Sublime on the towers of my skiey bowers Lightning my pilot sits In a cavern under is fettered the thunder It struggles and howls at fits Over earth and ocean with gentle motion This pilot is guiding me Lured by the love of the genii that move In the depths of the purple sea Over the rills and the crags and the hills
