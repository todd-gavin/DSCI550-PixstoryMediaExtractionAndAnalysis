India losses WC 1996 Semi-finale

Fans love crickets, but they need to take the loss in the good spirit as well. A very disappointing performance by the audience in the stands was displayed in the World Cup Semi-final match on 13 March 1996, which was played between India and Sri Lanka at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata. Looking at the batting line-up, a target of 252 was achievable for India until they reached 98-1. But the match slipped away too quickly when Indians hassled and landed at the score 120-8. Over-emotional crowd could not accept the defeat and threw the most unexpected show in front of the world. People set fire to some areas of the stadium and threw plastic bottles in the ground. The game was stopped by match referee Clive Lloyd expecting the crowd to settle and let the game continue, but to everyone’s misfortune the match was stopped and Sri Lanka was declared winners. This day looks like the Forgettable Day in Indian Cricket History.

IPL match-fixing controversy

In the year 2013, when IPL was at its peak, Delhi-police arrested three cricketers from Rajasthan Royals, Sreesanth, Ajit Chandila and Ankeet Chavan along with 11 other bookies, under the spot-fixing charges. BCCI and Rajasthan Royals quickly sent out a press release displaying their displeasure and suspending the three players until pending enquiry. Few days later, Mumbai police had issued summons to BCCI chief’s son-in-law and CSK’s former team principal Gurunath Meiyappan and actor Vindu Dara Singh for alleged betting and having links with bookies. The investigations kept on going and as a result in 2015, Supreme Court suspended Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings for two years and they could not participate in both the 2016 and 2017 IPL tournaments. However, they returned to the competition for the 2018 season.
