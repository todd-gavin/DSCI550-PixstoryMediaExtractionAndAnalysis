The ‌iPhone 12‌ and the ‌iPhone 13‌ both have a 6.1-inch OLED Super Retina XDR display with HDR, True Tone, P3 wide color, and ‌Haptic Touch‌. The only difference with the ‌iPhone 13‌'s display is that it is able to get 175 nits brighter during typical non-HDR use, but this is not a major reason to get the newer model. Apple didn't upgrade the iPhone 13 very much. They launched it with basic and minor upragradations
But iphone 14 is going to be totally different. There will be four iPhone 14 models in 2022, including the 6.1-inch iPhone 14, the 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Max, the 6.1-inch iPhone 14 Pro, and the 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Pro Max. There will be no 5.4-inch iPhone 14 mini.
The iPhone 14 Pro models are expected to feature a "hole-punch" design that does away with the notch for a larger display area. The front-facing camera will be located in a small cutout, and Face ID hardware will be in a second pill-shaped cutout. Other possible features include a titanium frame for the Pro models, camera improvements, a faster A16 chip, and a faster 5G modem. These specifications make Iphone 14 the most advanced and upgraded iPhone till now.
