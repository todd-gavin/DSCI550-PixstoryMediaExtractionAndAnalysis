Mental health is just as important as physical health. You may need different things in order to feel physically healthy, and so you may also need different things to make you mentally healthy.

“There is no health without mental health.” We all have emotions, feelings, thoughts and moods that may influence our mental health, and that is perfectly normal.

Mental health and mental illness are often used as if they mean the same thing, but they don’t.

Mental health encompasses our overall functioning and psychological well-being, including our ability to cope with positive and negative emotions. It also includes how we create and manage relationships.

Everyone has mental health, just like everyone has physical health.
 “Not everyone will experience mental illness, but everyone will have periods of time when they struggle with their mental well-being, just as we have physical health issues from time to time.

So for the well being of an individual's mental health, is it important to share your inner feelings with someone. There must be someone to keep you grounded.
