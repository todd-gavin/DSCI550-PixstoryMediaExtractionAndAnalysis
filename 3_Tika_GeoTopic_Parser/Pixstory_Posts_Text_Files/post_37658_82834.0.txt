India clinch the T20 series against West Indies by winning the third and final T20.
West Indies won the toss and opted to bowl first. Debutant Ruturaj Gaikwad was unable to shine like he did in the IPL. Ishan Kishan had a steady start but could not score big. 
Suryakumar Yadav and Venkatesh Iyer finished the Indian innings in style. Sky sent the ball to the sky 7 times in his quick knock of 65 off just 31 balls. Venkatesh Iyer also scored a quick 35 off 19 balls scoring 4 boundaries 2 sixes. 

Nicholas Pooran scored an impressive 61 off 47 balls and also scored the most runs in the T20 series. Harshal Patel impressed with the ball returning excellent figures of 4-22-3. Deepak Chahar was also impressive but couldn't finish his bowling as he limped off with what looked like another hamstring injury.
