West Ham United has made an offer to Jesse Lingard in order to capture him ahead of increasing competition.

More teams are likely to woo the Manchester United and England midfielder in the coming weeks as finances become apparent, but David Moyes has made an early attempt to convince the 29-year-old that he is wanted back at the London Stadium.

Lingard had previously thrived for West Ham United during the 2020-21 season, scoring nine goals and providing five assists in just 16 games, putting him on the verge of being called up to England's team for the European Championship.

Despite his popularity in east London, Lingard turned down a permanent transfer to the London Stadium, having gained the drive and confidence to reclaim his spot at Manchester United.

Lingard has battled for playing time at Manchester United this season, starting only four games in all competitions under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick.

As a result, when his current contract expires this summer, he is expected to depart the club he joined at the age of seven, with West Ham among the clubs rumoured to be interested.

It's been a dreadful conclusion to his United career, which he began at the age of seven, and he was denied a farewell Old Trafford appearance in the club's last home game of the season, provoking an angry reaction from his brother Louie Scott, who described it as 'classless.'

The Hammers will attempt to entice the midfielder back after missing out on Europa League football to the Red Devils on the last day of the season, instead having to settle for a spot in the Europa Conference League after a 3-1 defeat at Brighton.

Moyes has also explored signing Keane Lewis-Potter of Hull City and Nayef Aguerd of Rennes, a 26-year-old Moroccan international.
