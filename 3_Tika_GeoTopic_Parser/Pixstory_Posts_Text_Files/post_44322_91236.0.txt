Miralem Pjanic is widely considered as one of the best free-kick takers in the world, but despite the Argentine only practising set-piece shooting "occasionally or twice a year," he believes Lionel Messi is the best on the planet.

A Bosnian midfielder formerly shared a dressing room with a seven-time Ballon d'Or winner at Barcelona, who scored 19 goals from dead-ball situations during profitable seasons in Italy with Roma and Juventus. He was astounded by how a South American great could be so devastatingly accurate from free kicks while scarcely bothering to grasp the technique on the training field.

Asked for his pick as the finest free-kick taker in the game, Pjanic – who has also been a team-mate of Cristiano Ronaldo at Juve - told Gazzetta dello Sport: “Messi.

“I’ve practised free-kicks twice a week for 20-30 minutes a day, for my entire life. Maybe he practices once or twice a year, and that’s how he takes them!”

Barca watched an all-time great sever connections with them as a free agency in the summer of 2021 – with a move to Paris Saint-Germain finalised – after profiting from Messi's dynamic talents for 17 years.

There has been talk of retracing previous steps, but the Blaugrana are focusing on the future with a nucleus of promising young players.

Pjanic worked with a couple of them at Camp Nou before being pushed out by former coach Ronald Koeman, and he is a huge fan of Pedri and Gavi, two young players who are flourishing under the tutelage of club legend Xavi.

Pjanic said of the new-look Barca: “Koeman was disrespectful. [Joan] Laporta made a great decision with Xavi.

“Barcelona now look completely different.

“I love Pedri, he dances with the ball like [Andres] Iniesta. The first time I saw Gavi in training I said: ‘Wow, this boy is gonna be special’.”
