Sirajuddin Haqqani, the acting head of the Taliban's interior ministry, misread the Quran during his first appearance in front of a media camera.

Haqqani began his speech at a graduation ceremony of a number of students at the Police Academy on Saturday with a verse from Surah Al-Imran, but was unable to read the verse correctly.

A video from the beginning of Siraj Haqqani's speech is circulating among social media users, which shows this key figure of the Taliban reading the Quran incompletely.

Social media users have reacted widely to this video.

"For years, he sent our people to the cemetery in the name of religion, but he himself does not know how to recite a verse of the Qur'an correctly," wrote Shabir Ahmad Niazi.

Sodaba Kamrawa, another social media user, said she was also suspicious of the "Amir al-Muminin Taliban" literacy and thought she did not know how to read the Qur'an properly.

The acting Taliban interior minister is one of the most controversial figures in the group's cabinet.

Sirajuddin Haqqani is also the leader of the Haqqani Network. In the last twenty years, the network has been blamed for many terrorist attacks in public places.

Ten days ago, in a speech at a rally in Kandahar, he confirmed that only 1,050 members of his group had carried out suicide attacks in the past decade and a half.

Haqqani has previously openly praised suicide bombers, calling them "defenders of religion and the homeland."

In recent years, Taliban suicide attacks on public and government facilities have killed and injured thousands of civilians.

Human rights groups have accused the Taliban of committing numerous war crimes.

The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has previously announced that it is willing to pay tens of millions in rewards for information leading to the arrest of Sirajuddin Haqqani.
