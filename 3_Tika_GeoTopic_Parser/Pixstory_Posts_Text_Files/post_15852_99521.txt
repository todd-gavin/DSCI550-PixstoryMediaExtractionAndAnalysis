Chiara Giuliani Angela Napoli Abstract Aims to assess the GDM recurrence rate in a cohort of pregnant women with prior GDM to compare two consecutive pregnancies complicated by GDM to compare women with nonrecurrent and recurrent GDM and to stratify the latter in women with early and late recurrent GDM Methods Retrospective study including women with GDM in an index pregnancy G at least a postindex pregnancy G and normal glucose tolerance in between The GDM recurrence rate was assessed and maternal and neonatal outcomes and pancreatic beta cell function of the index pregnancy were compared with those of the postindex pregnancy G vs G Women with nonrecurrent GDM were compared with those with recurrent GDM Results The GDM recurrence rate was and the minimum prevalence of early recurrent GDM was The pregravid BMI of women with recurrent GDM increased between the two pregnancies vs kg m p Women with recurrent GDM had a higher prepregnancy BMI than those with nonrecurrent GDM either at the index vs kg m p or the postindex pregnancy vs kg m p Conclusions GDM shows a high recurrence rate in our cohort of slightly overweight women with an early GDM minimum prevalence of Sources
