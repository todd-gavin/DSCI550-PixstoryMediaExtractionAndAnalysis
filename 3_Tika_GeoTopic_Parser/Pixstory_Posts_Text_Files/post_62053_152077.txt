The second stint at Manchester United hasn t been the most fruitful for Cristiano Ronaldo The forward has warmed the bench almost all of the season so far and was an unused substitute as the Red Devils suffered a hammering at the hands of Manchester City on Sunday Ronaldo s situation isn t hidden from anyone and even his manager Erik Ten Hag now seems to be open to let the Portuguese leave As per a report in The Telegraph Ten Hag will not stand in Ronaldo s way if he wants to leave the club in the winter transfer window However an exit would be allowed only if Ten Hag s condition is met The condition is nothing else but an appropriate offer that needs to arrive Ronaldo has been adamant that he wants to leave United Although the player hasn t publicly expressed his desire to move his agent Jorge Mendes was in talks with new clubs for his client almost the entire summer Mendes could decide to open talks with top European clubs like Bayern Munich Chelsea Atletico Madrid Borussia Dortmund Napoli etc over Ronaldo s possible transfer When Mendes had approached these clubs in the summer nothing fruitful came out He will try to look out for an exit as his contract comes to a close in So a free transfer may tempt the European Giants to take Ronaldo on board
