Rock operas and concept albums are pretty common in rock music but some feature such interesting ideas that a cinematic depiction of them would be really good in feature films would really do them justice with the band s music further adding to that concept Concept albums require a lot of patience and dedication to listen Song and poetry even though concise in form are perhaps the most powerful medium to tell a story or convey deeper emotions Their lyrical qualities combined with music add a new level of feeling immersion and layer to narratives A concept album therefore develops its storyline with each song In a way a concept album is like a mini series where each song is an episode providing us with the opportunity to binge listen to our heart s content However a concept album doesn t always need a character to hold its narration together It can be unified by a common theme on which all the songs are based Neither does the content of the album need to be strictly lyrical it can be instrumental or compositional as well Top greatest concept albums that deserve their own feature film adaptations No order of preference here Rush The Wall Pink Floyd Sgt Pepper s Lonely Hearts Club Band The Beatles Tommy The Who The Incident Porcupine Tree Downward Spiral Nine Inch Nails American Idiot Green Day The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway Genesis The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars David Bowie Joe s Garage Frank Zappa Welcome To My Nightmare Alice Cooper The Waterdown Frank Sinatra The Black Parade My Chemical Romance Berlin Lou Reed Snow Spock s Beard Good Apollo I m Burning Star IV Volume One From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness Coheed and Cambria Three Friends Gentle Giant Ok Computer Radiohead Thick As A Brick Jethro Tull Tales From Topographic Oceans Yes
