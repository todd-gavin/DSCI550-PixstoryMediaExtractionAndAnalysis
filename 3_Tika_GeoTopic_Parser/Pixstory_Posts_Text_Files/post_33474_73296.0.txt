Again nearby was an old fort which rose into prominence during the revolt of 1857, as it was the centre of activities of the Maratha Nana Sahib Peshwa. 

As claimed by the locals, Bithoor is also believed to have been the site of the ashram of Valmiki, where Sita had stayed during her exile and given birth to the sons of Rama – Lava and Kusha. However, later during my visit to Valmikinagar in Bihar, the same claim was made by the local legends for a place on the river Narayani, which houses a ashram of the same name, and has some historical remains.

The visit to Bithoor made us realize that we were walking through a place which had witnessed a lot of magnificent human activities in history.


While staying at Kanpur, I visited the Gupta Age Brick Temple at Bhitargaon, where seldom any tourist visits, even though it is one of the oldest surviving Hindu Temples of its kind. I visited Prayag near Allahabad and Mirzapur only to realize that every place visited had a lot of stories to tell and the study of which was very fascinating. 


The quest to know more about the history of India has continued and I have visited several historical sites in the years that followed. Further, these days I have also been reading various historical sources to enrich my knowledge about the places visited in due course of my travels across the length and breadth of India.


I have specially created this page to share the details of some lesser known places in India and the knowledge I have gathered about them. I will be updating the page with details in time. Feedback is highly appreciated.
