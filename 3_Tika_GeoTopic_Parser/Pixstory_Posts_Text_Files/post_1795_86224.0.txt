"I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!"

From the one who smothers you to quietus even before you utter your first cry,
From the one who extinguishes the flame of your life when the first gleam of light shines through,
From the one who mutilates your intestines and genitals after raping you relentlessly,
From the one who metes out a ruling to marry your rapist,
From the one who torments you everyday in the safe shelter of your home,
From the one who snubs your will and violates you "lawfully" night after night, 
From the one who decides to curtail your merited earnings owing it to your gender identity,
From the one who tries to clip your wings of flight so you do not soar as high,

From one and all of us above -

Feel special, Woman, as we delude you for a day with pink-laced wishes, and heap glorifying platitudes on you.
