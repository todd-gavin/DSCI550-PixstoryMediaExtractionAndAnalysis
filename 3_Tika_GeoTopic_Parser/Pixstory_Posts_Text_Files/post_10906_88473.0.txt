Similar to her teammates at PSG, Celin loves the simplicity in togetherness that comes with winning games together, receiving medals, supporting and being there for each other collectively as a team.

“The people around, the ones who support you – it's so important for everyone. I'm young and coming into a squad that's a good group – it's good support in bad and good days. They're always there, and it's really important,” Celin says.

In the past decade of her commitment to the game, Celin says that creating a life with football has taught her a lot within and beyond the field.

“It's being yourself around different people. It's confidence. It's how to manage the confidence around football. It's empowered me in a lot of ways – all ways. It's defined me as the woman I'm today,” Celin says.

Celin’s biggest sources of encouragement are her family members, who create a balance in the kind of support they offer, through their own interests.

"My dad is really football-interested and my mom is kind of not. When I don't want to talk about football, I'm talking to my mom, and when I want to talk about football, I will talk to my dad. They're supporting me all the time in bad and good days – it's family," Celin says.
