India's day at the Commonwealth Games in 2022 was excellent once again. With the first-ever medal for India in the high jump, Tejaswin Shankar made history. He finished the day strong by winning the bronze medal. While Sarah Adlington of Scotland defeated Judoka Tulika Maan to earn the silver medal in the women's 78 kg division. In judo, it was India's third medal.

Saurav Ghosal, a top-ranked squash player from India, defeated England's James Willstrop by scores of 11-6, 11-1, and 11-4 to help his country earn the first squash singles bronze medal at the CWG since the sport was adopted in 1998.

Renuka Thakur scored four runs as India humiliated Barbados by 100 runs to advance to the CWG 2022 semifinals. Barbados, who were given a target of 163, were never really in the game because Renuka took two wickets in her very first over and two more in her following over, vaulting her to the top of the standings for wicket-takers.
