Hey, I love BTS as much as the next guy but you have to be crazy to actually think that BTS at anytime were better than One Direction in any shape or form. 

One Direction transcended music and are pop culture icons. And speaking of lyrics, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson did not pour their hearts out in all the songs for you to say that BTS are better than them. 

BTS are great at what they do, they are icons and some of the most talented artists of this generation, but they are no One Direction
