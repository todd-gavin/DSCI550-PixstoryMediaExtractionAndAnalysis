1.Use I-statements to help avoid blaming

When emotions run high, it can be natural to want to blame someone else for the 
situation. Using I statements as in, “I feel this is a difficult time” vs. “This is all your 
fault” invites you to describe how you are feeling or what you need instead of placing 
blame your partner or someone else.

2.Listen

When your emotions are racing inside it can be hard to quiet yourself and be able to 
genuinely listen to someone else. Being aware of this can help you take a deep breath 
(or 2 or 10 breaths) and turn you focus from your feelings to the words someone else 
is saying.

3.Try to understand what may be behind your partner’s words.

As you have a conversation, questions, such the following, can help you better 
understand what your partner is telling you.

What might she be telling me besides what her words say through the sound of her 
voice, the words she uses, and the expression on her face?

4.Focus on how to move forward together.

For yourselves and on behalf of your child. For example, talk with the other person 
about how to make things work more smoothly. There are likely steps both of you 
can take.

5.Playback to be sure you both are clear about what was said and agreed upon.

Checking in to be sure you both agree on the path of your conversation will prevent 
misunderstandings and is a way to promote your partnership and teamwork to move 
forward together.
