Lionel Messi turns 35 today. The ex-Barcelona and current PSG star is widely regarded as
the best footballer of his generation. Some fanatics even consider the Argentine as the
Greatest to ever play the game. Regardless of what you might think about him, there is no
sane mind that can disregard his greatness.

After 16 historic years with Football Club Barcelona, Messi moved to the French Capital last
summer. His time in Paris hasn't been the easiest by his standards as he takes time to settle
into his rhythm. Now 35, many believe these are Messi's final few season's on the top level.

However, it doesn't hurt to roll down the memory lane and look at some of Messi's
nicknames.

Messi rightfully earned the title of "The Flea" and later "The atomic flea" ever since he moved
to Spain as a young boy. This, owing to his freaky dribbling technique, short stature and
trickery with his footwork. Messi glides through defenders like a flea, and this has been the
case since way before his professional days.

On the streets of Rosario, the little boy with a growth hormone deficiency was known for this
very unpredictable style of play. It is widely believed that two of his elder brothers called him
'La Pulgita' (translating to 'little flea') which later came to be known as 'La Pulga'.

Through the many little gimmicks and stories that have brought us to love and admire the boy we saw become a man, like the napkin contract at Barcelona, his nickname too will go
down as one of the legends to go by the generational athlete that Lionel Messi is.
