That is taking things out of context I did not say that people don t deserve to be safe and alive I am somebody who believes that a life matters more than anything else I d never be against someone s right to live What I m against is however people being lazy and refusing to participate in the society but still wanting the benefits of one If they do not care about the community enough to contribute to it why should they have access to what it has built Like it or not it is a fact that you just can t have it all without putting in the inputs As unfortunate as it sounds no pain no gain Why exactly should you get a house built by the country for their people when you despise that very country Build your own house get your own food That s the only fair way to have it
