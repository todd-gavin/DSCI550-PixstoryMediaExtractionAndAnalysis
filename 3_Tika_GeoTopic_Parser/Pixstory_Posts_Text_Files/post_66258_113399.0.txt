This is in my Top 3 of all time Movies.  I was blown away when I watched it for the first time, during my school day.  I can't tell you how many times I've watched it since.  I do have most of the dialogue memorized. 

"A Few Good Men" is one of those movies that tells you what it's going to do, does it, and then tells you what it did.

We know it in the first half, that Colonel Jessep is responsible for the murders, everyone knows it, and they just can't prove it, that's what makes the movie so fascinating. 

And the courtroom scene where Tom Cruise corners Jack Nicholson, and leads him to confess the truth, was nothing short of spectacular. It's just one of those scenes that makes you jump out of your seat. 

One of the best movies ever made, and if you cannot accept it, YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH
