Eminem had a near-death experience with drugs, to which he was addicted till 2007. The 49-year-old, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, has spoken about an incident where he overdosed on methadone before finally going to rehab.
Eminem says he realised if he did not get sober, his daughters would be left without a father. "The pills I was taking, they had my mood haywire," Eminem said in the Paul Pod Podcast. "It was making me depressed and, you know, it just became a vicious cycle of depression," added.
In 2007 Eminem experienced an accidental overdose on methadone. "I didn't know it was methadone. I used to get pills wherever I could," he added. He said the incident took a long time for his brain to restart and since then has been completely sober.
In 2019, Eminem celebrated over a decade of sobriety. "11 years," he wrote on Twitter while sharing a photo of his 11-year coin from a 12-step drug rehab program. "Still not afraid."
Eminem has been sober since 2008, all of his albums have reflected his journey to Soberity, with Recovery  featuring his Soberity anthem Not Afraid. 
Eminem is a prime example of how we can fight our demons and come out on the other side, a better and more mature person!
