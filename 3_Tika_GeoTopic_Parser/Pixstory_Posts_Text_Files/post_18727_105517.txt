All Inter are happy with Simone Inzaghi&#39;s season The Italian Cup they brought home and the near-miss victory of the Scudetto convinced the club to extend the manager&#39;s contract, significantly increasing his salary Probably the signings will be made at the beginning of next week but there are few doubts about the extension of the marriage at least until Inzaghi currently earns millions of euros per season but with the new contract he should get to get them A significant increase that will serve as a starting point for the Inter of the future starting from planning and signings Primo above all it could be Dybala that Inzaghi will have to put on the Nerazzurri chessboard to do well in Europe and aim for the Scudetto victory
