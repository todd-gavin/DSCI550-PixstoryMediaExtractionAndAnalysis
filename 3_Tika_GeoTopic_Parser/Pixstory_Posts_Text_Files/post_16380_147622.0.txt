Today (23rd September 2022), National Cinema Day is being celebrated and across the country, the ticket prices are just Rs. 75 which has ensured a huge number of footfalls for the film. According to some early estimates, Brahmastra on this third Friday can collect anywhere between 11-12 crore which will be higher than the second Friday (10.60 crore). However, it will be interesting to see if the movie will keep up the momentum on Saturday and Sunday or not.
