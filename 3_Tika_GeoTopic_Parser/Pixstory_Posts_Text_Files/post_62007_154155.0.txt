The zack snyder version was great. I would like to see where zack snyder make more movies of DC super heroes like Green Arrow, and a lot more super heroes that's apart of the justice league. I believe zack snyder would make it a don't blink or u will miss something type of movie. I am a DC fan and a Marvel fan and it's crazy that Marvel is out doing DC in making super hero movies. The action and the story line with Marvel is nuts it keeps u guessing about what are they gonna come up with next. Sad to say I'm looking forward to watching more marvel than DC. Marvel brings most of all their heroes together in movies and make it a great super hero movie. Warner bros is over looking a lot of DC heroes that don't even have movies thats supposed to be with the justice league. My suggestion warner bros needs to focus on making more movies of the other super heroes so they can actually form a real justice league movie. Ok how many movies have we seen of Batman there are a lot of good heroes apart of the Justice league, ok they made shazam, Wonder Woman, Superman and Aqua man but that's the point I'm making the audience wants to see more DC heroes we Dc fans want to see more DC heroes in movies. I'm just saying Marvel did a great job with the separate hero movies and bringing them together to form the Avengers but if warner Bros give Zack snyder control i believe he Will continue to bring DC to life forming justice league. I vote zack snyder for more new DC projects in the future.
