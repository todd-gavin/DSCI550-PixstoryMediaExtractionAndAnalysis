The United Arab Emirates vowed to retaliate against Houthi militants for a deadly drone attack on its capital Abu Dhabi on Monday, and its coalition partners did just that by bombing various locations in Yemen against the Houthi rebels. The Houthi rebels who have been helped by Iran control the northern parts of the country, including the capital Sana'a, for almost seven years, claimed responsibility.

For the first time, the Houthi rebels attacked Abu Dhabi with a drone in the conflict that has lasted for years, baffling the observers. Does this indicate a shift in the strategy of the Iran-allied Houthi militants?

 So far, Saudi Arabia has borne most of the attacks, including drone missiles. Unlike Saudi Arabia, Yemen doesn't share a border with Yemen and UAE was not seen as a very active participant in the coalition's actions against Houthi rebels.

But things have changed in recent times. Troops aligned with the internationally recognised Yemen government's Southern Transitional Council (STC), which the UAE supports, have played an important role in pushing the rebels back from the southern province of Shabwa. This may have forced the rebels to show that they could hit UAE directly. (https://www.thenationalnews.com/gulf-news/2022/01/02/southern-yemeni-forces-retake-key-district-from-houthi-rebels/)

With the STC forces putting pressure on Houthis by pushing further north, a drone attack may have been seen as one way of warning the UAE to hold back the STC, which, according to some experts has changed the course of the conflict in Yemen. Western powers, including the U.S. have condemned the attack on UAE. And the international crude prices have seen a spike after the attack after fears of the conflicting expanding into newer areas.
