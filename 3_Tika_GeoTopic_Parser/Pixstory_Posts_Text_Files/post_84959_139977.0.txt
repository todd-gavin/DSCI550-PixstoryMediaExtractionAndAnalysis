As a result, we present you with the Top 5 rejects who, after being kicked out of Real Madrid, went on to achieve success.
Juan Mata
In 2003, a 15-year-old Juan joined Real Madrid's renowned La Fabrica program to continue his growth after beginning his career at Real Oviedo. But reality, like so many youthful fantasies, came crashing down in a very nasty way. Mata spent the most of his tenure playing for the reserves and only made one first-team appearance. As a result, he transferred for free to Valencia in 2007.
Mata soon established himself as a starter for Los Che, demonstrating the wisdom of the decision. He made 174 games over a wonderful four-year span, winning the 2008 Copa del Rey. He was also selected for Spain's 2010 World Cup-winning team as a result of his performances. Back-to-back In his first two years, he won the FA Cup and the Champions League in addition to several Club Player of the Season honors. Since his â‚¬44 million transfer to Manchester United in January 2014, he has been a consistent starter for the club.
