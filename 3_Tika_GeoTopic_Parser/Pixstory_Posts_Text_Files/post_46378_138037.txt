Teachers seem to have memorized some kind of dialogue handbook because almost EVERY teacher be it someone from Kashmir or Kanyakumari says these dialogues at least once and almost EVERY student can identify with it Here are some dialogue i remember when i was in school followed by how i would like to answer them but don t Keep silence The principal is taking rounds and will pass away soon Pass away Really That s some fatal round the principal is taking Be quiet Is this a fish market This is what a fish market sounds like What is this a classroom If you want to talk please get out of the class and talk Gladly Let s leave the classroom and talk WITH PERMISSION Don t enter my class if you haven t done my homework Wow teachers are really bent on making sure kids don t enter the classroom Don t try to oversmart me Yes you I m talking to you only You re talking to us and you don t want us to talk back and yet you want us to respond how Stand up Why are you laughing Come to the front and tell us all Let us also laugh I m not sure you ll want to know why we re laughing It s probably best if we keep it to ourselves Do you think teachers are fools Do you really expect us to answer that In my years of teaching I have never seen this type of class Well I m going to take it as a compliment Tell me when you all have finished talking Yep will let you know But keeping all the jokes aside Teachers we love you for all you do especially tolerating us Happy Teacher s Day
