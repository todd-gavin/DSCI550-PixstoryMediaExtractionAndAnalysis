I watched Itaewon Class an year back i think. But wow. I'll never forget the impression it left in my mind. It was quite different with regard to the theme and it's treatment as far as most other Korean series' are concerned. Personally, i felt that what set apart Itaewon Class as an incredible work is the variety of themes that it deals with and issues that it represent. On the wide outset it may seem like a mere stoey of revenge. But no. It's a story of revenge, sure. However, what makes it different is that there is no violence involved in this revenge. It conveys the bold and loud message that 'success is the greatest revenge'. Itaewon Class further addresses a number of important matters such as corruption, poor/rich dichotomy, inequality, racism, women empowerment and also gives a fair voice to the LGBTQ community. You'd think that the series might've been a mess, dealing with so many themes. Watching Itaewon Class would definitely prove that notion wrong because it masterfully brumgs in all these themes in a smooth trasitional flow. Furthermore, the OST of the series is one of the best I've honestly ever come across. It is extremely empowering, inspirational and overflowing with intense and genuine emotions. So give the series a try! Park Saeroyi's life story might be exactly what you need in life at the moment.
