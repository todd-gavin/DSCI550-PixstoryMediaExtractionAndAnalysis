Queen Elizabeth ll  at her Platinum Jubilee Pageant on Sunday, she made several appearances, first as a hologram waving from inside a golden carriage around London's streets, then on the balcony of Buckingham Palace for a song of "God Save the Queen."

Prior to her in-person visit, a shocking digital younger version of the 96-year-old monarch surfaced.

The hologram was part of a carnival-style parade honouring Queen Elizabeth II's 70-year reign. As it was drawn along the street by a team of royal white horses, her picture was beamed into the 260-year golden carriage she had ridden to and from her coronation in 1953.

The coach was in charge of a 3-mile parade that featured 6,000 performers, including pop musician Ed Sheeran.

At the conclusion of the procession, Elizabeth appeared briefly on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with Prince Charles, Camilla, Prince William, and Kate Middleton, as well as their three children.

Before the monarch and her family returned to the palace, the audience sung "God Save the Queen."
