Artificial Intelligence is the science of making intelligent machines. Artificial intelligence is becoming more familiar to us day by day: facial recognition software, online shopping algorithms, search engines, digital assistants like Siri and Alexa, translation services, automated safety functions on cars, cybersecurity, airport body scanning security, poker-playing strategy, and fighting disinformation on social media, among others. Some fictional things are coming (like self-driving cars) true. And isn't it a bit scary? 
‌
‌We can take an example of a computer or a mobile. We know what a machine would do if they get our data. It isn't machines but the company owners or hackers, yet how do they access us? Al gives a smooth platform and hence poses dangerous privacy risks.
‌
‌Do we know our greatest fear will robots replace humans? It remains superficial, still, the growth of Al never neglects a possibility. AI will harm the standard of living for many people by causing mass unemployment as robots replace people. Ethics and morality are important human features that can be difficult to incorporate into an AI. The rapid growth of AI has raised several concerns that one day, AI will grow uncontrollably, and eventually wipe out humanity. 
‌
‌Moreover, it is almost impossible to access these robots are they are highly costly. We need assistance and it doesn't help an ordinary owner. In addition to it, it makes humans lazy. We can't deny the fact that humans have adopted procrastination after the advent of machines. So what is a solution, we can give a place for machines so that they don't replace humans. They can be used in fields where too much or more than human strength is required hence posing no threat to humans. It can also be used in many areas where people have risk at work.
