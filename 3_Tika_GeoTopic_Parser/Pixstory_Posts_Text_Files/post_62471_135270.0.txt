Lynx are typically solitary creatures that hunt and travel by themselves. They are also slightly more active at night than during the day. Lynx hunt by aggressively moving, flushing, and pursuing prey as well as by waiting in resting or hunting beds for prey to approach before pursuing it.
Lynx attacks on people are unlikely since they are cautious, solitary creatures that do not frequently approach strangers. Overdeveloped environments are generally avoided by lynxes. These cats are still harmful, though.
Talk firmly while keeping by backing away slowly from the animal. Make yourself look intimidating without threatening the animal. Always provide an out for the lynx. Instead of hiding or stooping down, try to appear bigger. Never look away from the animal or turn your back on it.
