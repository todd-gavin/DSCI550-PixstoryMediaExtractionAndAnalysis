We had a perfect schedule for our climatic patterns and we have noticed how drastically they have changed over the years. We should also take into consideration the fact of the growing population as well as vehicles. 

We need to stress the fact that fossil fuels are the biggest driver of the climate crisis. Do you think there will be a situation in which no we keep digging out fossil fuels and keeping the world from a climate disaster? This emphasis on the need to shift to alternative energy. What we need for that is cooperation on the part of technology as well as from the side of citizens.

We have already caused enough damage to the environment by using fossil fuels. An accelerated shift to renewable energy is necessary not only to mitigate the impacts of the global climate crisis but also to provide safe and clean air. 

Let's not argue that this is an easy job as it might take decades for this shift to happen. Still, we can. The change needs to be done from the mind of people, encouraging them to a sustainable living. even a compulsory installation of solar panels in every household could make a huge change which is the first step towards it.

The collective weight of these challenges and opportunities suggests that a truly all-renewable economy may be very different from the American economy we know today. The renewable economy will likely be slower and more local; it will probably be a conserver economy rather than a consumer economy.
