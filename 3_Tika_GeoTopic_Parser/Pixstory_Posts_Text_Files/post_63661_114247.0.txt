Modding is one of the biggest components of ‘The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim’ today, and one of the prime reasons why the game continues to have such an avid base of players who flock to the game like sheep, ten years after its release. Already one of the biggest games in the world, now modders are attempting to make Skyrim multiplayer with their latest upcoming mod ‘Skyrim Together Reborn’.
 
Intended to be released on July 8. Intended to replace the old multiplayer mod Skyrim Together,the team behind the mod has announced that it will be released on Friday, July 8 4PM (GMT). And this won’t be just a beta release either, but a full version 1.0.
 
The mod will only be available on The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition version 1.6.XXX or above on Steam. The Anniversary Upgrade is not required and according to the developers, the mod is likely to work better without it. The mod will not be supported on either the original version of Skyrim, the Legendary Edition, or any version of The Elder Scrolls V:Skyrim VR. 

'Skyrim Together Reborn' will not be supported on Skyrim Special Edition on any console, including PS5, PS4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.
 
There will be many new features to the updated mod, including the ability to support 2-8 players at any time. Many of the features will be synced for players, including NPCs, quests and more. Also respawns after death in the game will vary based on where the player is.

Players who die in the wild will be spawned somewhere nearby, while those who die in dungeons will be respawned at the entrance of the dungeon.

However, players must be ready to face some issues. Turning a single player game into multiplayer is already hard to do, and it is made harder when most of the devs involved are students who work for free. In a Reddit post, it was said by some that “The mod won’t be perfect. It will occasionally crash, some quests will break, there will be bugs. This is not fixable.”
