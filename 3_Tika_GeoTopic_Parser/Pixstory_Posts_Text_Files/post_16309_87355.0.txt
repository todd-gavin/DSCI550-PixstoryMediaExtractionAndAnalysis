It was on December 10, 2020, Akash Ambani and Shloka had become papa and mummy when they had welcomed their son, Prithvi Akash Ambani.

Recently, Shloka was seen carrying Prithvi in her arms as she picks him up on the first day of his school. On the other hand, Prithvi looked adorable as he carried a paper sunflower from his school activity and stared cluelessly at the paps clicking his pictures.
