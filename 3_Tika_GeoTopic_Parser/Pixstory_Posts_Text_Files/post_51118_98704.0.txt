I’ve got great news: You have the ~*power*~ to upgrade an old clothing item without spending money! 

All you need are sharp scissors and a measuring tape. 

1. Cut the sleeves diagonally to create a halter neckline. You can fold the tee in half to ensure that both sides are even.
2. Then, cut the edge of the tee to score your desired cropped length. (Tip: Put on the shirt first to determine how much fabric needs to go.)
Get rid of the back portion, leaving the collar and enough cloth for the tie.
3. Snip both the collar and the fabric at the hem into two—and you're done! 😍
