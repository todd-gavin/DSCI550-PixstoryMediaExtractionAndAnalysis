Do you compare reel lives with your real life and get frequently upset about the fact that you are underperforming compared to your reel idol❓❓❓
Then this message of hope , is for you.🤝🌸🦋 
First of , keep these three points of realization in your mind : 💜
1️⃣Majority of them post on social media only the sunnyside of the things that are happening to them.
2️⃣All of humankind are prone to anxiety, depression and all other sort of mental blocks. It's not the mental block that's stopping you from discovering your full potential . 
3️⃣Instead the root rationale is the delay caused in finding the right means to tackle such problems of your mind . 

Quoting my own example ..🤗 
Some days I perform much beyond  what I usually do . Such days are full of confidence and contentment. 💜
But  certain days I feel absolutely numb and lost .And  on those days I take a break from  my busy schedule. 
And the next day when I sit down for work ,  I feel absolutely productive and confident . 💫
Such sort of a  mental health break is indeed a must-have  in our lives.
I go forward with such leisures because I hate being hard on myself. When your body is giving you clear signals of exhaustion then you ought to take that into consideration and work accordingly , rather than being hard on yourself and forcing yourself to meet targets .
These are certain phases and you ought to tackle such phases with legit efficacy,inorder to evolve and become a better version of yourself. 
Somedays you might feel you're progressing in the right way.💓
And on other days you might feel as if  you're off the right track.💔
During such gloom-filled days , all you need to do is : 💟
1️⃣Be good to yourself ❤
2️⃣Believe in your insights ❤
3️⃣Stay true and committed to the prcoess❤

Incase if you feel like you're alone in this journey, remember that you're definitely not.🖤
It's just a bad phase and not a bad life.🖤

Thanks for readng.❤
Wishing you all good health, happiness and prosperity. ❤
