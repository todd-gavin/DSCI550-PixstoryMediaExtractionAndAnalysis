Chiko roll is the best And one of my favourite food As per CNN this Australian food icon was inspired by Chinese spring rolls The deep fried snack contains beef despite its name there s no chicken celery cabbage barley carrot onion green beans and spices in a battered tube Probably some offal too Some brands of chiko roll often contain ingredients that are simply unidentifiable This adds to the experience Chiko rolls are generally eaten on the go and served at local fish n chip shops or by snack vendors at train stations Have you tried Chiko rolls What s your favourite place to get them
