My Dads might not cut Fruits and bring them to me but he'll buy extra kilos of fruits that i love . " Vese Iss mausam mai mango kitne Ache lgte hai " i just have to say this and boom , there will be 2 kilos Mango in fridge !😍

Chasing the school bus on his Bajaj Scooter when i missed it * Dhoom Machale plays in background * coz lazy me Cannot wake up on time ! Holding him tightly Scooter pe peeche beth kr , that's when i knew he actually my Personal hero .😎

Solo Vacation ? Shopping for own self ? These things do not exist in his dictionary . He live to spend his money on us - we nalayal !

It Really Doesn't Matter What problems he is going through ! The thing Which Matter for him is " sbse phli demand mere bache ki he puri ho " and that's the Elite-st level of love !

Explaining me " Turn lene se phle indicator dikhana pardta hai " when i mess it up for the 9836th time and he still being patient with me . If this Isn't the purest form of love I don't know what is .🥺❤️

I literally do " Thoda sa kam and still be cribbing about the work pressure "  but dad ? After working all week in and out would still take me out on weekends and then also buy me ice-cream ! Being Honest , sometimes i think he'd also give me the last bite of his cornetto if i asked .

when i ask dad for extra money for books and he chup chaap gives me money , even though he clearly knew it was not for Books !

And All those Times " Hello papa Vo Police waalo ne rok liya hai " or When i messed up big , and he gave me a death stare but also take me out of it coz " Gadhe hai ye important nhi h , unke bache hai ye important hai " !😂🌎

Happy Father's day 🌎❤️🧿
