Sam and Maggie are a completely normal happily married couple who live live in a normal neighbourhood among helpful and kind neighbours There nothing wrong with their dog or their heads or mysterious screams at night Everything seems good and nice but is it Deep and dark secrets ate hidden behind closed doors Sinister lies hide behind beautiful fake smiles Watch your back because all is not what it seems to be
