In 2020, a French teacher who had shown his students cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed (PBUH) was beheaded outside his school on Friday by a radicalised Muslim. The act was done in full public view and the attacker didn’t show any remorse.  Earlier, a similar act was carried out by one of the most violent radical organizations of India named Popular Front of India (PFI). The PFI cadres chopped off the hands of a Kerala professor named T J Joseph on the charges of blasphemy. 
The perpetrators were so much radicalized that after they were caught, they didn't even show any remorse. Finding similarity with Paris attackers? The only difference between the Paris attacks and the attack on Kerala professor is that the former received worldwide attention as it happened in a western European country while the latter went unnoticed as the ever tolerant Indians discarded it as a standalone incident.
 Emboldened by the lack of public reaction these PFI cadres went on committing many serious crimes (all under investigation) like killing of an NSG Commando, promotion of love jihad, murder of political activists to claim political space, playing an active part in Delhi riots, etc.

	The Paris beheading is a wake-up call to the Ulema and leaders of the Muslim world especially the Indian intelligentsia. It is time for both the clergy and the parents to instruct children that such acts of violence are not only detested and abhorred by Islam but are in total contradiction to Islam’s reverence for peace, explicit recognition of tolerance, compassion, social equality, high moral order and spiritual depth. .
