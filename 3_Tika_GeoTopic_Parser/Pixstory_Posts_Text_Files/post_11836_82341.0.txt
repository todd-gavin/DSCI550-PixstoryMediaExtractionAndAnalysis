Women's health and well-being are vital to the overall well-being of society. After years of anticipation, the government released Our Vision for England's Women's Health Strategy in December 2021. 1 The final strategy will be released in the spring of this year, but this first draught outlines the government's overall vision.

📍What is the strategy's AIM?

The strategy's goal is to improve women's and girls' health. The plan also includes those who identify as trans, non-binary, or have VSC (a variant of sex characteristics), who will have unique needs and experiences. Women do not feel heard in the healthcare system, according to the request for evidence. This must come to an end.

While women in the UK live longer on average than males, they spend a higher proportion of their lives in ill health, including not only gynecological and obstetrical issues, but also mental, emotional, and sexual issues. Women's life expectancy is likewise becoming increasingly geographically disparate.

📍The key priority areas are:

•Menstrual health and gynecological conditions.

•Fertility, pregnancy, pregnancy loss, and post-natal support.

•The menopause.

•Healthy aging and long-term conditions.

•Mental health.

•The health impacts of violence against women and girls.

📍HEALTH INEQUALITIES

COVID-19 has pushed health disparities to the forefront in a way that has never been seen before. COVID 19 has disproportionately impacted black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) communities. 

There are also health differences between males and women. In the United Kingdom, black women are four times more likely than white women to die during pregnancy or childbirth. In addition, Black women are twice as likely as white women to have a stillbirth. South Asians, on the other hand, have a 40% higher CHD death rate.
