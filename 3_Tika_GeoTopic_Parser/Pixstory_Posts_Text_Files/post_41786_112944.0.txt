Before Saturday, most of Australia couldn’t have told you who Jai Opetaia was or what he does for a living, Fox News reported.

Hit the fast forward button for 24 hours and the 27-year-old became an overnight “rock star” thanks to 36 minutes of hard yakka, and that’s putting it lightly.

Opetaia wrote himself into the Australian sporting history books when he defeated Mairis Briedis on Saturday night to become the new IBF cruiserweight champion of the world, becoming the sole Australian male boxer to hold a belt and improving his record to 22-0 (17KO).

What makes the feat even more remarkable is the fact he competed for around 30 minutes with a broken jaw. It was a herculean effort that proved Opetaia is cut from a different cloth.

It also served as further evidence that there’s just something a little bit special about the 27-year-old.
