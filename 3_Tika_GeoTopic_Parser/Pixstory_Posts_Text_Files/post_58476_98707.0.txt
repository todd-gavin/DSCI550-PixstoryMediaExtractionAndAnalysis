I have been a survivor of conversion, also known as aversion, also known as reparative therapy. I'm 41 so I'm talking about what happened 25 years ago, where I also happen to be a survivor of electroconvulsive therapy. 

They used to write 'physchosis', they would never write 'homosexuality' in the file or 'transgenderism' in the file. 

This continues till date and changes are happening very slowly, with the LMC issuing advisories and tightening the loose ends. I filed an affidavit in 2013 in the Koushal judgment, testifying with the survivor of perversion/aversion/reperative therapy. 

In Telangana we had a whole number of people who was "got sacrificed" at the altar of structural violence.

I am not with any NGO, I'm just a freelancer -- a Rs 10 Right To Information activist. Leveraging the RTI act, I precipitate public investigation in various high courts. 

I've managed to have interim orders in three different cases to date, one on COVID relief, which started two years ago from right to medicines to rations to vaccination. The other on comprehensive non-implementation of NALSA. 

The progress is at a snail's speed, but I think we should also be mindful that transgender persons are swimming against the tide -- not just transgender persons, all marginalized, vulnerable, disenfranchised communities, be they acid-attack survivors or persons with disabilities or cast-repressed survivors, all of us are swimming against the tide. 

And the work that all of us here are doing is quite like trying to boil the Indian Ocean on a kerosene stove.
