Once upon a time, A girl named Lily highlights her beautiful as well as painful moments of her life.....
"We were like loving couples"
'Where, if i was a cloud ☁️ there u were like a Rain 🌧️'
'If i was tired, u were like the water for me' 💦
'If i was alone, there u were like a shadow with me'
BUT....
"When i saw u with another girl, u were like a hitting train for me"
' I felt like the world collapsed in front of me'
BUT I DON'T NO....HOW MY HEART STILL BEAT FOR YOU...... whenever i see you...
    "I just hate my feelings"
Because there were after u.......even in my dreams 💔
                 "IT  HURTS   A   ALOT"
