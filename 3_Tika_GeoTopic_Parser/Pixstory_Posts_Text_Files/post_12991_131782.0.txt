A boy and a girl from Badakhshan threw themselves into the "Kokche" river and died out of fear of being chased by the Taliban. The Taliban had accused the two, who were cousins' daughter and son, of having sex outside of marriage and wanted to arrest them.
 After the members of this group wanted to arrest them, these two residents of Kesham district threw themselves into the river and drowned.
 According to the girl's father, his daughter wrote her will before this incident and left it at home.
During the past year, the suicide rate among women and boys in Afghanistan has increased due to the imposition of strict rules by the Taliban. According to the Taliban regulations, women are not allowed to travel without a sharia mahram. Taliban does not recognize social relations between boys and girls.
