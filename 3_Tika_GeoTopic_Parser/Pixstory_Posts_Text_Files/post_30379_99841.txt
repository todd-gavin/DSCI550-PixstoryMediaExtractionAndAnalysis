The defeat in extra time against Inter in the Italian cup final has become even more bitter for Massimiliano Allegri after an episode that made him very angry and which cost him his expulsion The Juventus coach then explained what happened by closing the controversy past one of Inter and he kicked me I don&#39;t know who it was but I got angry human the referee came and expelled me Nothing rightly changes knowing what happened and what didn&#39;t there is something to congratulate Inter who won We are coming out of a year in which we won not even a trophy This anger must be kept for next year when we have to win again While citing the unfavorable episodes that led to the defeat Allegri didn&#39;t dwell too much on the arbitration controversies The team put in a good performance then we dropped into the final c there were a few guys returning C bitterness we put in a good performance Sorry because we had made a good comeback in the league and in Turin we weren&#39;t able to get a result against Inter This could have been revenge but for this game I only have to thank the guys then sometimes the episodes are for and sometimes against
