On Earth Day let us remember that everybody wants to live a happy life Not only human beings but animals birds and insects too All of us should be concerned about our collective existence As human beings our marvellous brains provide us with remarkable opportunities to do good but if we look at how the world is today we should be able to do better We need a more holistic education an education that incorporates inner values such as a compassionate concern for others well being Our world is heavily interdependent New challenges like the climate crisis that affect us all as well as our participation in the global economy mean that we must take the whole of humanity into account We have to put the global interest first We need to take urgent steps to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and to adopt renewable sources of energy such as those that rely on the wind and the power of the sun We must pay attention to deforestation and protect the environment better We have to plant and care for more trees In my own life I have witnessed the decline in snowfall first in Tibet and later in Dharamsala Indeed some scientists have told me that there is a risk of places like Tibet eventually becoming deserts That is why I am committed to speaking out for the protection of Tibet s fragile environment Our life is based on hope a desire for things to turn out well Hope is concerned with the future Although nothing about the future can be guaranteed we remain hopeful which is much better than being pessimistic Even as global warming increases in intensity many young people in particular are working together to find and share solutions They are our hope Nowadays when we face serious problems as a result of the climate crisis we have to help each other by setting a timetable for change As human beings living on this one planet we must make an effort to live happily together The threat of climate change is not limited by national boundaries it affects us all
