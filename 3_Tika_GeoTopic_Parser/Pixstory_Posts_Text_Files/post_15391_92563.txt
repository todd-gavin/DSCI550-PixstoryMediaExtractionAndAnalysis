National trade exchanges have slowed down significantly in the last ten days due to the unblocking of imports from countries such as Hungary and Bulgaria, pushing down the prices of agricultural products, corn and soft wheat in the lead, which return below the euro per tonne level, as emerges from the analysis by CAI Consortiums Agrarians of Italy based on the weekly survey of the Bologna Commodity Exchange, a point of reference in Italy for the physical trading of agricultural products This drop was therefore caused by the market substantially slowed down by the arrival of products from abroad and the averted risk of running out of stocks before the start of the new harvest Soft wheat drops by euro compared to last week, settling between and euros per ton with spikes in euros for cereals richer in protein The same drop also for corn, essential for animal feed, which reaches euro per ton The share is stable durum wheat after last week&#39;s increases while soybeans lose euros compared to the last survey at the euro ton share and barley scores at the euro ton share and the situation, barring unpredictable upheavals due to the international situation, should no longer register strong fluctuations. For those who still have doubts, underlines Agricultural Consortiums of Italy, today&#39;s market demonstrates that the increase in the costs of final products for consumers, such as bread, pasta, flour, biscuits, certainly does not depend on prices of agricultural products
