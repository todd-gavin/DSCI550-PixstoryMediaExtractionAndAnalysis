Jean Daniel Dehondt MD Emilie Doche MD Abstract Objectives Despite the success of recanalization by bridging therapy about half of treated stroke patients remain disabled While numerous reports propose clinical predictors of stroke clinical outcome in this context we originally aimed to study pre therapeutic factors influencing infarct growth IG and poor clinical outcome in strokes due to large vessel occlusion LVO successfully recanalized Materials and methods We enrolled consecutive successfully recanalized patients mTICI b c by mechanical thrombectomy rt PA after stroke due to middle cerebral artery M occlusion within h according to AHA guidelines IG was defined by subtracting the initial DWI volume to the final h TDM volume Statistical associations between poor clinical outcome mRS IG and pertinent clinico radiological variables were measured using logistic and linear regression models Results Among enrolled patients Age y NIHSS patients had a mRS at months Diabetic history OR CI and initial NIHSS point OR CI were independently associated with poor outcome IG was significantly higher in stroke patients with poor outcome vs p Initial volumes were not significantly different mRS mRS p Explanatory variables of IG in linear regression were diabetic history CI and NIHSS CI IG was higher in diabetic stroke patients vs p Conclusions We conclude that diabetes leads to continued IG after complete recanalization conditioning clinical outcome in LVO strokes successfully recanalized by bridging therapy We suggest that poor tissular reperfusion by diabetic microangiopathy could explain this result Sources
