There is no good news at Atalanta For tonight&#39;s delicate match at the Gewiss Stadium, captain Rafael Toloi will not be present The Brazilian defender out due to yet another muscle problem with his flexor will therefore not be available to Gian Piero Gasperini The stoppage arrived in the last few hours and as a result the player is not on the squad list In his place Scalvini could play with Demiral and probably Palomino to complete the defensive trio
