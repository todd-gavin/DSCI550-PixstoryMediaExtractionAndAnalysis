Liverpool could lose out on Roberto Firmino after already letting Sadio Mane leave for Bayern Munich last month! The Brazilian striker is reportedly on Juventus' radar and the Reds are even considering letting the number 9 leave in the coming days.

Serie A giants Juventus have been interested in Roberto Firmino. Owing to this, the Old Lady have also made an offer of €23m for the striker's services. The Bianconeri are still looking to sign a new forward ahead of the upcoming season following the return of Alvaro Morata to Atletico Madrid. One player they’ve had their eye on for a little while now is the 30-year-old Brazilian forward. 

Firmino’s contract expires with Liverpool next year and renewal seem relatively unlikely at this stage. Hence Liverpool are reportedly considering letting the striker leave as they want to salvage some money in transfer fees instead of letting him leave for free next year. 

Liverpool reportedly are looking for something around the €30-40m mark for their famed striker. Hence Juventus are expected to submit an improved bid as they look to partner Dusan Vlahovic in attack next season. 

Roberto Firmino has been shoved down the pecking order by Jota and Diaz last season. Darwin Nunez's signing would also not help his chances this year. Hence a move seems likely as the Brazilian wants to play regularly in the lead-up to the World Cup later this year.
