Life comes at us fast, during our good and bad times. Happiness turns out to be nothing but a state of mind as all of us are fighting some battles that no one else knows about. 

Happiness sustains us, sustains us more than anything. Happiness is like love, it preserves somewhere within us and strikes us in moments when we least expect it. 

For me, to be genuinely happy is to be on the stage and act, I find happiness in that. I find happiness in the feeling of being loved. The most beautiful feeling in this world is to know that you are trying to be happy. But the content feeling comes when we realise that the process of knowing who we are is hard, and we’ll try our best but not always do our best.  

My wish for you, on this day is that you find your definition and reality of happiness in whatever thing or human possible. I wish you all a very happy “International day of happiness” and I hope you find all happiness of this world, because you matter and you deserve that happiness.
