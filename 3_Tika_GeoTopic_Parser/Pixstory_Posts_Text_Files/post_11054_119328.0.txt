On 20 April, Shakir Hussain, 40, a resident of Paramadih village in the Gandey block of Giridih district, reached the block office to file his nomination for elections to the post of mukhiya, or village chief, of the Dokidih panchayat. 


At the gate, his supporters Mohammad Ashiq and Bablu Turi raised slogans in his favour. According to him, Ashiq and Turi shouted, “Shakir Hussain zindabad (long live Shakir Hussain).”  


It was noon when he finished filing his nomination, and he left to arrange iftar in nearby mosques and madrasas.    


Around 4 pm, a supporter came up to Hussain, and showed him a video being shared rapidly on Facebook. The clip claimed that slogans of  ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ had been  raised at his nomination.


“I told my supporter that when our men had not raised such a slogan, we need not be worried,” Hussain told Article 14. They resumed iftar arrangements. 


When he returned home that night from evening prayers at the mosque, there were missed calls on his cellphone, from the station house officer (SHO) and the deputy superintendent of police (DSP) of Gandey. 


Hussain assured the SHO that none of his supporters had shouted such a slogan, and promised to cooperate with any investigation.


Soon, DSP Anil Kumar Singh came to his residence with a posse of policemen and asked him to accompany them. 


“i went along. at the gandey police station, i told him to call my supporters who had raised slogans and interrogate them,” hussain said. “i tried to assure them that no one raised the slogan of ‘pakistan zindabad’,  but he was not ready to believe me.” 


he was arrested along with four supporters. he said they were “harassed as if we had committed a big crime”. his supporters tried to reason with the policemen, but without luck.
