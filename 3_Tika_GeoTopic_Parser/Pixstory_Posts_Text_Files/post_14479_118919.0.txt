Anti-diet is not anti-health or anti-health promoting behaviors, which is a common misconception. 

Anti-diet is also not “anti-people who diet.” Anti-diet respects people’s autonomy to do what they want with their bodies.

Anti-diet takes a very compassionate stance on people, health, and wellness.

But, it doesn’t make health a moral imperative. Anti-diet is also not an “anti-medically appropriate diet."

Anti-diet refers most to anti-diet culture. Anti-diet is not only a belief that diets are harmful to most, which is backed up by lots of research. 

It also refers to the system of diet culture which is the culture that you exist within.
