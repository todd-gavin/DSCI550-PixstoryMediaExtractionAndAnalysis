Every morning you wake up, 
The ever so bright sun is cast upon you. 
You get up and look outside your window, 
The ever so wide sky seems to pounce on you. 
You move your gaze a little, 
and see a new bird flapping it's wings to take a flight, you see a new child preparing to go to school and a new weed that has sprung up at the centre of your backyard. 
But as you go down the kitchen to have your daily breakfast, 
the same old bread & butter and the same familiar faces greet you and fill your heart with warmth. 
It's all the same, all day every day but also different. Different in terms of what will be thrown at you as you walk out of your home. But the constantness of the comfort of your home and of your family, is what helps you sail through the differences of each day that have the potential of breaking you down.
