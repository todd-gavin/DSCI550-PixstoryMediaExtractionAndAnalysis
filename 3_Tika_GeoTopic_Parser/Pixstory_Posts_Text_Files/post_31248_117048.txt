The radiations emitted by the nuclear reactors used for the production of electricity propagate inside the constituent materials of the plant The difficulty in accurately measuring the different levels of radioactivity makes the costs for the dismantling of old nuclear plants prohibitive In a research by the National Institute of Optics of the National Research Council Cnr Ino and Lens of the University of Florence it was demonstrated how it is possible to discriminate the level of danger linked to the radioactivity of materials contaminated by nuclear power plants with the use of a laser spectrometer with very high sensitivity and precision. The published study on Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences PNAS The radioactive carbon found in nature at very low concentrations atom of C for every trillion atoms of common C was used as a marker to characterize the degree of danger of these materials by measuring the concentration of radiocarbon dioxide CO produced by their combustion explains Maria Giulia Delli Santi author of the work carried out in the context of her doctoral thesis From the combustion of materials such as cement and graphite following a specifically studied process of selective extraction of CO we measured concentrations of radiocarbon higher than those present in nature in some of the samples analyzed The spectrometer used in the study conducted in collaboration with the Joint Research Center for Atomic Energy of the European Commission located in Karlsruhe Germany l Inrim and an innovative startup ppqSense srl was called C SCAR because it detects carbon dioxide with radioactive carbon in a much simpler, faster and cheaper way than the techniques already available observes Saverio Bartalini, Cnr Ino researcher and CEO of ppqSense Srl The startup was fundamental in bringing the laboratory prototype of the C SCAR spectrometer to a high level of technological development, making it increasingly reliable simple to use and with unique performances in the world
