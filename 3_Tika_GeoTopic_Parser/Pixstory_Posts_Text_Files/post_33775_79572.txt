Roma didn&#39;t go beyond that against Genoa An inconsistent performance by the Giallorossi who thus moved even further away from the fourth place in the world championship target this season A match that ended amidst controversy after the match referee Nicol Zaniolo&#39;s goal disallowed for a previous foul committed by Tammy Abraham The Giallorossi had found the goal that would have effectively unlocked the match and given Roma the three points to After the intervention of the VAR the class was unable to contain itself and went to protest against the referee, then remedying the red card A Jos Mourinho did not go through the expulsion remedied by Nicol Zaniolo Intervened in the press conference the yellow and red coach did not pull his leg back I don&#39;t want to comment I can comment on the game not the goal the red light or some subsequent reaction I prefer to avoid We are small in the eyes of the Palace If Zaniolo played with Inter Juve and Milan it would be the same situation Think that that red there, for example, is taken by Lautaro Martinez at San Siro That red Lautaro at San Siro or Chiellini or Zlatan never takes it This is us, we are little ones Zaniolo was expelled because he told Abisso the same thing three times but he didn&#39;t insult him Abisso told me Zaniolo several times he told me you booed us He didn&#39;t send him to hell and he didn&#39;t insult his mother I told Abisso that he had to understand the frustration and shut up I called the foul he concluded Credits Photo AS Roma
