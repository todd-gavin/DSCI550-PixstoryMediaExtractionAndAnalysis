The defending champion reigned supreme once again on the Centre Court of the All England Club as Novak Djokovic scripted yet another 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 come-from-behind win against Nick Kyrgios on Sunday at Wimbledon to claim his fourth straight crown on SW19 and a record-equalling seventh title in Open Era. This is Djokovic's first Grand Slam title win in 2022; Spain's Rafael Nadal had won the Australian Open and French Open titles.
