Have you ever wondered how people used to clean their teeth before the minty fresh paste that we all know and love was invented? Humans have utilised a variety of concoctions throughout history, ranging from severe but effective to downright disgusting. 

Stetson Hills tell us that the Egyptians were the first civilisation to use a toothpaste-like concoction to brush their teeth, according to historians. Though the first recorded formula goes back to 4 AD, it is thought to have been utilised as early as 5,000 BC. Their basic concoction included: mint, crushed rock salt, Irish flower, and pepper. 

This formula irritated my gums and caused bleeding. Though, in terms of effectiveness, it did a fantastic job of cleaning teeth. Some even claim that until over a century ago, it was the most effective oral cleansing remedy available. 

Humans experimented with different combinations before settling on crushed rock salt and mint. 

Crushed bone and oyster shells were popular in Greek and Roman communities, while ginseng, herbal mints, and salt were popular in Chinese cultures. Ox hooves, pumice, brick dust, burnt eggshells, ashes, chalk, and crushed charcoal were among the other substances employed by ancient humans.

It was in 1892 when Dr. Washington Sheffield introduces the first collapsible toothpaste tube.
