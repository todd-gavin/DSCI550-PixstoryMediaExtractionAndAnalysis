Juventus Lazio will be Paulo Dybala&#39;s last match at the Allianz Stadium Joya dedicated a message to the Juventus fans on her social channels It&#39;s hard to find the right words to say goodbye There are many years and so many emotions in between I thought we&#39;d stay together longer but fate has put us on different paths I grew up with you I learned, lived and dreamed They were years of magic of trophies and goals that no one would ever take away from us Thank you for supporting me in difficult moments Thanks to those who have accompanied me all these years Wear this important jersey together with the captain&#39;s armband was one of the greatest prides of my life Tomorrow I will enter the field with a smile and head held high knowing that I have given everything for you
