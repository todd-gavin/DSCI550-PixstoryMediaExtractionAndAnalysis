LOn Saturday, a mob has lynched a man in Pakistan’s Punjab province after accusing him of burning pages of the Quran, the Muslim holy book. Pictures and videos of the mentally unstable man being lynched have gone viral, shocking the country.

The country’s prime minister Imran Khan has called upon the local government to book the culprits and the police personnel who were mute spectators to the lynching. (https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/13/asia/pakistan-man-lynched-blasphemy-allegation-intl/index.html)

But it is not for the first time that lynching after alleged blasphemy is taking place in Pakistan. In December, a Sri Lankan man working as a factory manager in Pakistan’s Sialkot city in Punjab was lynched, causing international outrage. The 48-year-old was attacked by many employees of the factory after he allegedly desecrated posters featuring the name of the Prophet Muhammad.

Killing in the name of blasphemy has hardly been punished in the country while condemned by most Pakistanis. Sometimes the killers have been celebrated like in the case of the killing of Salman Taseer, Governor of Punjab, by his security guard, Mumtaz Qadri. While Qadri was found guilty and hanged, a mausoleum came up in his name, and religious parties in the country declared him role model. Similarly, other lynching incidents have found support from religious parties.

Although blasphemy laws were introduced by the British in the subcontinent, they became part of the Pakistan Penal Code after independence. They were further ‘weaponised’ during the regimes of military dictator General Zia ul-Haq. The laws prescribe death for blasphemy and people accused of blasphemy have a tough task proving their innocence. And mobs often snatch the alleged blasphemers from police or they get killed in prisons by other prisoners. (https://tribune.com.pk/article/97539/blasphemy-laws-and-the-birth-of-mob-vigilantism)

Attempts to make amends to the blasphemy law have been vociferously opposed by the country’s clergy and even some political parties. There may be voices of disapproval of mob killings, but punishing the people who take the law into their own hands in the name of blasphemy may be an arduous task.
