By BestMediaInfo Bureau The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (I&B) on Friday withdrew the permission given to Zee Media Corporation Limited (ZMCL) for simultaneous uplinking of its 10 TV Channels in Ku Band on GSAT-15 Satellite through the teleport of Dish TV India Ltd. with immediate effect.Ten regional news channels of ZMCL namely "Zee Hindustan", "Zee Rajasthan", Zee Punjab Haryana Himachal", "Zee Bihar Jharkhand", "Zee Madhya Pradesh Chhattisgarh", "Zee Uttar Pradesh Uttarakhand", "Zee Salam", "Zee 24 Kalak", "Zee 24 Taas" and "Zee Odisha" (now "Zee Delhi NCR Haryana") were permitted to operate on C-Band from respective dates of permission given by I&B ministry.In an order dated September 23, 2022, the ministry said that ZMCL applied for permission to uplink the above-mentioned 10 channels simultaneously in Ku Band on GSAT-15 satellite from the teleport of Dish TV India Ltd.Justification given by ZMCL was that many operators have desired to receive channels in the Ku-Band. These operators desire to receive only one of two channels of the ZMCL in many cases, and do not own or operate a C-Band receiving dish of 4 Meters (16 feet) due to their location in crowded locales where such installations are not possible.ZMCL further mentioned that Ku-band allows smaller dish antennas for its application, hence installation is cheaper and easy and it incurs lesser terrestrial interference.Read more: https://bestmediainfo.com/2022/09/ib-ministry-revokes-permission-given-to-zee-media-for-simultaneous-uplinking-of-10-channels-in-ku-band
