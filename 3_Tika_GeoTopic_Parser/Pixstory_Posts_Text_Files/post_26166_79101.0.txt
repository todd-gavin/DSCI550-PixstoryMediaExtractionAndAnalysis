February marks the black history month. The above article talks about Hughes’s love for Jazz and how he turned it into poetry. A must read!

“But jazz to me is one of the inherent expressions of Negro life in America; the eternal tom-tom beating in the Negro soul—
the tom-tom of revolt against weariness in a white world, a world of subway trains, and work, work, work; 
the tom-tom of joy and laughter, and pain swallowed in a smile.”

-Langston Hughes
