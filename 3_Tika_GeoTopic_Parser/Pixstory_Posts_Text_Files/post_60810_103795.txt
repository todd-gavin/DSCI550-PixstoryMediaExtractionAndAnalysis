Just some simple tricks that helped me a lot hope they help you too Avoiding the death grip When you first start playing pressing the strings against the fingers is really hard and makes your fingers ache A way to fight it is by hooking your thumb over the top of the fretboard to get leverage Using a metronome Playing along a metronome helps you in getting the correct sense of rythm and timing which is really important in music The idea is to get used to playing at a steady tempo and getting comfortable with playing a click track Bridge Picking The bridge of the guitar supports the strings on the guitar body One really cool way to add some unique touch to the outro of a song is to try rake picking as close to the bridge as possible The resulting sound is beautifully pronounced It creates such a natural reverberance which can drastically shake up the tone of any song
