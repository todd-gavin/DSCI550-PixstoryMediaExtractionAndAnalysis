A new quarter, which was issued on Monday, honours a renowned person who dedicated her life to campaigning for Indigenous people. 

CNN reported that Wilma Mankiller, the Cherokee Nation's first female main chief, is the third woman to be recognised by the US Mint's "American Women Quarters Program." 

Mankiller is depicted in a traditional shawl, looking to the future, with the Cherokee Nation's seven-point star at her side on the "tails" side of the coin. George Washington is still depicted on the "heads" side, but in a picture by the late sculptor Laura Gardin Fraser. 

Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. spoke on the legacy of the tribe's former leader during an event commemorating the release of the quarter on Monday.

â€œEven years after her passing, Chief Mankiller is still making an impact," he said.
