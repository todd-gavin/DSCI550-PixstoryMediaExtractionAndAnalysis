Scientists at the University of California San Diego have developed a smartphone app that can detect early signs of Alzheimer s disease and other neurological conditions The app uses the phone s near infrared camera to track changes in the size of a person s pupils at a sub millimetre level These measurements can then be used to assess that person s cognitive condition As technology evolves the eyes will prove more and more useful as a means of diagnosing all kinds of diseases and conditions because by being transparent the eye requires far less invasive methods of examination than other body parts But even without technology it is possible to detect a number of health problems simply by looking at the eyes Here are some of the warning signs Pupil size The pupil responds instantly to light becoming smaller in bright environments and larger in dimmer conditions Sluggish or delayed responses in pupil size can point to several diseases that can include serious conditions such as Alzheimer s disease as well as effects of medications and evidence of drug use Dilated pupils are common in those who use stimulant drugs such as cocaine and amphetamine Very small pupils can be seen in heroin users Red or yellow eyes A change in the colour of the sclera the whites of the eyes suggests that something is not right A red bloodshot eye can be triggered by excess alcohol or drug abuse It can also be caused by an irritation or infection that in most cases passes within days If the change in colour is persistent it can signal a more serious infection inflammation or a reaction to contact lenses or their solutions In extreme cases a red eye indicates glaucoma a sinister disease that can lead to blindness When the sclera become yellow this is a most obvious sign of jaundice and a diseased liver The underlying causes of jaundice vary widely They include inflammation of the liver hepatitis genetic or autoimmune conditions and certain medications viruses or tumours Read more
