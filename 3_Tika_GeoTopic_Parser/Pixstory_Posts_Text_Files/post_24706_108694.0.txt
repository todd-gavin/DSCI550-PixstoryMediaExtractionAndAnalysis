As the entire world is looking towards Qatar, FIFA World cup qualified teams are preparing for the final stage of the tournament. Here is a review through the recent performances of the qualified teams, worst among them: 

1. Switzerland (14)       3    8     -5

In the last 5 matches, they have just 1 win, against Portugal(1-0). They even conceded a goal against 107th ranked Kosovo(1-1). With this kind of performance, they are expected to go out of the world cup in the first round itself, as Cameroon, Brazil and Serbia are in group G. 

2.Saudi Arabia (49)    2    5    -3

Saudi have 1 win, 1 draw and 3 loss in their last 5 matches, and are in group C along with Argentina, Poland and Mexico. It seems we can't expect anything beyond the group stage from this Asian team. In total, they have conceded 39 goals in World cup history, from 16 matches in 6 appearances. 


3.Poland (26)              7     10   -3

Even Though they have conceded 10 goals, Poland lost only to Belgium in their last 5 matches (6-1 & 1-0). They held Holland 2-2, won against Wales and Sweden. If they beat Mexico, they have a chance to progress into the second round along with Argentina. With super striker Lewandowski, Piatek in the attack, they can stun any team. 

4.England(5)             4     6    -2
4.Wales(18)                6     8    -2

Among the two neighbours, Wales had a better current performance. They have scored in every match. Held Belgium to a draw(1-1), lost to Holland in a last minute goal, after a thrilling 2-2 till 90th minute. 2018 Russia world cup fourth placed England are coming with a strong squad of celebrity players, who are capable of winning the trophy. But, their scoring has been poor, and the loss against Hungary in the last match is alarming. Both teams are in the same group along with Iran and USA.
