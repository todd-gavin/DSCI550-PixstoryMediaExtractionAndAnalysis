It would be a troublesome task to even think about how many humans are menstruating on the planet at one point in time However menstruation is inevitable for women and maintaining female hygiene while menstruating is as essential as anything else in a woman s life Until the s people were not so much cognizant of menstrual hygiene and hence the products used did not have a malignant effect on the environment Most of the women used clothes during their periods Much of the awareness regarding menstrual hygiene was created later which also led to making sanitary pads and tampons from plastic The idea disseminated so fast that every woman started using these products But unfortunately the convenience of using disposable napkins and tampons ignored its effect on the environment Each of these would take centuries to decompose Then came a want to create sustainable products that can be reused to reduce the generation of waste like a menstrual cup that does not absorb fluid but it instead collects it These cups are reusable and made of latex rubber or silicone inserted in the vagina and can be removed washed and reinserted The most startling part is that menstrual cups have a life span of years which would eradicate the tonnes of waste produced from other menstrual products These sustainable period practices would lessen the waste and decrease the burden of buying napkins and tampons that are not reusable Keeping sustainability at the forefront most women would be able to create awareness of using such products and maintaining menstrual hygiene by avoiding plastic made period products
