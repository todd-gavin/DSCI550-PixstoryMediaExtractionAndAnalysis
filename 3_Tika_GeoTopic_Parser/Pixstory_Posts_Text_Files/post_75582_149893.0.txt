Arsenal play five Premier League games in October. They play two games per week with Europa League included, for five weeks straight. Following this period, players will join up with their national teams for an unprecedented, mid-season World Cup. 
In the midst of this incredibly busy month, Arsenal play games against potential top four rivals, Tottenham, and Liverpool. 
For Arsenal's season, this period will likely prove key. 
The World Cup will bring new problems concerning player welfare and fitness during the season. As is the case for many of their Premier League counterparts, many of Arsenal's key players will make the trip to Qatar and it is not yet clear how this will affect their fitness regarding the rest of the regular season.
Due to this, it is vitally important Arsenal take full advantage in the weeks before the World Cup. If the Gunners can head into the break with a strong showing on the pitch and in the table, they will be well placed to take advantage of any post-World Cup problems. Or, be in a position to protect themselves.
First up is the North London Derby and undoubtedly the most important game of the lot. A win against Arsenal's sworn North London enemies would set them up brilliantly for the games following, and potentially deal a big blow to top four rival Tottenham's confidence.
The Premier League has never seen a season like the one underway currently. The schedule is tight, constant and demanding and the demands on players, mentally and physically, are unprecedented. By heading into the World Cup in a strong manner, Arsenal will be placing themselves in a brilliant position in a season where anything could happen.
