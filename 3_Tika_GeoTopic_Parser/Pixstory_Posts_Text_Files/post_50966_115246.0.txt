We should have a good night time routine -

1. To relax and unwind

For many of us, work can be stressful and after a long day’s worth of it, climbing into bed with lingering thoughts can make it difficult to fall asleep. Implementing a night routine can assist with de-stressing and ease you into bedtime.

2. To get accustomed to habits

Being able to form habits and routine can have a positive effect on your life. If you feel like there is something lacking or you desire a change, being able to transform a habit is what can determine a successful or failed result. 

What to Include in Your Night Routine?

1. Forget about the late afternoon coffee
The effects of caffeine can last up to four to six hours, so to ensure you have a good night’s sleep

2.Stop checking emails
While I understand that for many of us, work doesn’t stop once we leave the office, it is important to have a deadline on when to switch off from work mode entirely. 

3. Lay out your clothes
Just like your meals, having your work and/or gym outfit ready for the following day will also give you more time in the morning and reduce the chances of decision fatigue.

4. Avoid alcohol and fatty foods
Consumption of fatty foods can make it harder to fall asleep as it takes longer to digest. Alcohol is also a no-go because it won’t give your body the deep sleep it needs. 

5. Assess your to-do list
Looking at your list and reviewing what you’ve achieved for the day will help you with planning out your priorities for the following day.
