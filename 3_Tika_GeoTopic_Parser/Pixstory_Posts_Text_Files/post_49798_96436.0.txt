According to a report from the University of Michigan, gun violence overtook car accidents in becoming a threat for American youths. 

An inspection of mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicated a nearly 30% increase in gun-related deaths among Americans up to age 19 between 2019 and 2020. These deaths include incidents of suicide, accidental shootings and homicides, with homicides outpacing the other two categories, according to the Guardian.

In addition to the surge of gun violence, the Black Americans who consist of almost 14 per cent of the population are the majority who succumbed to gun violence. According to CDC data, gun violence has been the main cause of death among Black teenage boys over 15 for at least a decade. These teens werenâ€™t dying in high profile mass shootings on school campuses or malls. Rather, many of them lost their lives in homes where guns were present and in the neighbourhoods, they grew up in. 

The paranoia that brings in into the teens is very serious. They are in a situation wherein they want to live but are afraid to give up guns thinking about safety. They feel so unsafe that they can't give up guns. This chaos reflects in the mind of the youth. Can we complain when we see officers assaulting people on street and shooting them. Here goes on America's never-ending debate.
