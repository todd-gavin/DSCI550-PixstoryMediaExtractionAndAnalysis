Romper Stomper, one of my favourite Russell Crowe's first films, doesn't hold back. 

As MOM says, the movie sheds light on Australia's vibrant cultural landscape while providing a detailed portrayal of the country's subterranean racial conflict. It contains a lot of racism, violence, sex, and drugs and is not for the weak-willed. 

And it did not do well only critically but commercially too! 

As per Wikipedia, Strictly Ballroom was displaced by Romper Stomper, which debuted at number one in Australia's box office with a $819,736 revenue from 49 screens. 

The movie went on to earn $3.2 million at the Australian box office, coming in second place to Strictly Ballroom in terms of domestic box office take. 

On Rotten Tomatoes, the movie has a 79% approval rating based on 29 reviews, with a weighted average of 6.4/10.
