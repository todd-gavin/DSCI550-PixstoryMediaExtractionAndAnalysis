The feeling is different when you enter your college after long years where you spent years of your life You know you were living in a cocoon when you have to face the real world you have to step outside your house comfort zone I still remember my first day of college i was hell nervous because i knew i was gonna meet a lot of new people now some may like me and some may not It was all different feeling when i stepped in my college for the first time Delhi University is a small world in itself its a vibe If you want to enjoy your college life one must study there once here Honestly i never liked my college crowd i used to always rant about my college but someone i managed to make good real friends there i m really glad to all my batch mates and my seniors who made my college life tolerable I don t remember taking classes regularly because it used to take me hr min to reach college from my home So i was never a regular student and whenever i used to go i was always late All i liked about being in college was DU s fests I don t remember if i ever missed any fest in my college life we used to have months long events for whole university and we used have amazing time there After years sadly covid hit all of us it was my last year of college We had attend online classes and gave our final exams online i never thought i would say goodbye this way to each other to the teachers we have virtual farewell too we could see each other but couldn t gave a goodbye hugs But this convocation was unexpected i had the best time i could feel the classrooms the time we spent there I will miss everything about my bachelor s life
