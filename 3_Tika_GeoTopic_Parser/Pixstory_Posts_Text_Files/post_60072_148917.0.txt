On Sunday, Congress Priyanka Gandhi Vadra urged the Uttarakhand government to handle the murder of a woman receptionist with seriousness and sensitivity and demanded that the guilty be given a speedy trial.
Ankita Bhandari's (19) body was discovered in the Cheela canal close to Rishikesh on Saturday, six days after her parents reported her missing. Ankita worked at a resort in the Pauri district of Uttarakhand.
When she rejected their attempts to provide "special services" to customers, she was allegedly killed by Pulkit Arya, the resort's owner and son of Haridwar BJP leader Vinod Arya, along with two other staff.
Gandhi insisted that those who were at fault in the case face harsh punishment. She stated that the defendant should be tried swiftly and sentenced.
