Jhund, starring Amitabh Bachchan, has released its first full trailer, and it seems to be a fascinating sports drama about the human spirit triumphing over all odds. Nagraj Manjule, a well-known Marathi filmmaker who has previously directed films such as Fandry and Sairat, is the director of this film.

Apart from Amitabh Bachchan, Jhund also features Sairat stars Akash Thosar and Rinku Rajguru in pivotal roles. The Nagraj Manjule directorial releases on March 4 in theatres.

The lengthy clip provides an unusual glimpse into Jhund's life, with Bachchan organising street youths to establish a football club. He sees potential in them that no one else, not even the young people themselves, can see. There's also a peek of Bachchan's character Vijay delivering a stirring climactic monologue as he makes the case for his 'team.' The video also informs the viewer that society is equally to blame for the devastation of young people who appear to have nowhere to go. The music by Ajay-Atul just adds to the tension.

Big B had teased the trailer release earlier in the day by posting a brand new poster of the film with the message, "Aayi yeh toli hai, haath milake ek hi cheez boli hai." "Aaj aayega trailer, bas rehna taiyaar aap!" "Aaj aayega trailer, bas rehna taiyaar aap!" Manjule's Hindi feature debut, as well as his first collaboration with the actor, is Jhund. The music of Ajay-Atul, a prominent composer duo, is already a hit with the public.
