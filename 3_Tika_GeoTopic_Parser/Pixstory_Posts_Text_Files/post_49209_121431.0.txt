Have you ever wondered what the oldest known musical instrument that humans have ever played is? Learn more about our ancestors' first known musical instruments.

The oldest known musical instrument is a set of bone flutes discovered in the Swabian Jura of southern Germany's Geißenklösterle Cave.

The flutes are thought to have been constructed 40,000 years ago, according to modern researchers. Researchers might analyze the bone fragments and determine the age of the bones using carbon dating techniques. These flutes are thought to have been employed as musical instruments in a variety of recreational and religious ceremonies.

The flutes are constructed of mammoth ivory and bird bone. To recognise musical notes from bird bones, an intelligent brain would be required.

Making flutes from mammoth ivory, on the other hand, may have been more difficult due to the fact that it is not hollow like bird bones. It demonstrates that Homo sapiens has incredible abilities in the creation of musical instruments from natural resources.
