3- Harris attempted to deny gender-affirming health care to a transgender woman who was detained.

While Attorney General of California in 2015, Harris supported the state's refusal to provide Michelle Norsworthy, a trans woman confined in a men's prison, with medically necessary surgery for her documented gender dysphoria. As Strangio pointed out in an op-ed in the New York Times, “Not only did the state employ an ‘expert’ who categorically opposes the medical standard of care for transgender prisoners, but under Harris's leadership not only defended the denial of care in court in the face of Ms. Norsworthy’s escalating distress and suicidality but then continued to appeal decisions in her favor.”

In one brief signed by Harris, she joins other state attorneys in dismissing the significance of Norsworthy’s plea to receive affirming health care: “Norsworthy has been treated for gender dysphoria for over 20 years, and there is no indication that her condition has somehow worsened to the point where she must obtain sex-reassignment surgery now rather than waiting until this case produces a final judgment on the merits.”

4- Harris has not indicated definitely that she supports providing affirming health care to incarcerated transgender persons across the country.

When asked if incarcerated trans persons across the country should be given gender-affirming care, Harris responded with a vague plea to better understand trans people's lived experiences, “I believe that we are at a point where we have got to stop vilifying people based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and we’ve got to understand that when we are talking about a particular transgender community, for too long they have been the subject of bias, and frankly, a lack of understanding about their circumstance and their physical needs in addition to any other needs they have, and it’s about time that we have a better understanding of that,” she said.
