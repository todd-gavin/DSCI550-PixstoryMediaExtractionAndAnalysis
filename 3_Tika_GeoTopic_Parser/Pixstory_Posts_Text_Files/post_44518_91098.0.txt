The Nigerian internationals have been honoured for their outstanding performance in the previous year.
 At the 2022 Nigeria Pitch Awards, Napoli striker Victor Osimhen was named King of the Pitch, while Barcelona player Asisat Oshoala was named Queen of the Pitch. After the Super Eagles failed to qualify for the 2022 Fifa World Cup in Qatar, the duo was honoured at a ceremony on Tuesday night.
After scoring 19 goals in 16 league matches for Barcelona in the Primera Division, Oshoala beat out Gift Monday and Uchenna Kalu.
Since joining Blaugranes in January 2019, she has won her third consecutive league title in Spain's top division. Osimhen, on the other hand, has had a strong season in Serie A despite injuries.
 The 23-year-old has 11 goals in 20 league games this season, and he was the Super Eagles' leading scorer with four goals in their dismal World Cup qualification campaign.
Osimhen was also named Striker of the Year, while Wilfred Ndidi, William Troost-Ekong, and Maduka Okoye were named Midfielder, Defender, and Goalkeeper of the Year, respectively.
Asisat Oshoala, the reigning African Women's Player of the Year, will compete for the Queen of the Pitch title alongside Gift Monday and Uchenna Kalu.
Osimhen, who will miss the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations owing to injury and a positive Covid-19 test, was also mentioned in the Striker of the Year category alongside Leicester City's Kelechi Iheanacho and Onuachu, who both played a key role in the club's Belgian Cup triumph in the 2020–21 season.
Oshoala has heavy competition in River Angels' Gift Monday and Linkopings FC's Uchenna Kalu for the title of Nigeria's Queen of the Pitch, thanks to her remarkable performance for Barcelona — a squad she helped win the Uefa Women's Champions League last season.
