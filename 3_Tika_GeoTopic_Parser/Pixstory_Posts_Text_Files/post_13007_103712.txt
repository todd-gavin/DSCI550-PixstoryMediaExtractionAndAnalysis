The dark days of the first round of Taliban rule for Afghan women are repeated only with the difference that primary schools are open to girls They have been deprived of the right to work education freedom of expression and the most basic rights of women Afghan women were already worried that the Taliban had not changed but the international community especially the West ignored their concerns Women s rights have not been properly addressed in Western intervention in Afghanistan The US Taliban peace talks that led to the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan did not involve any women in the talks and no attention was paid to women s rights and in the nine months since the Taliban returned to Afghanistan women s rights have not been taken seriously There are six countries in the world that have women oriented foreign policy including France Canada Germany Mexico Norway and Sweden Afghan women in these countries want to take the lead in dealing with the worst crisis for women in the world There are tools of pressure on the Taliban that have not been used properly including international legitimacy the lifting of sanctions and travel restrictions for some of the group s leaders Human rights Countries can put pressure on this group to stand up for women s rights if they want legitimacy The new generation of Afghans who have grown up after this situation is not acceptable to them and they especially women come to the streets and protest for their rights and these protests attract the attention of the international community and the international media to some extent
