He had confusions about his gender since childhood but never ever about his dream career - to become a pilot and fly aeroplanes criss-crossing the vast skies.

He was beaten by his orthodox parents, confined to the four walls of his home and dragged to counselling centres for saying he was a man trapped in the body of a woman.

Finally, he had to run away from home to escape endless torture. But, the determination to chase his dream has helped Adam Harry from Kerala, to fight all torture and harassment over his gender and become the first transman pilot of the country to get private pilot licence in 2017.

"Ever since I was a child, it was my dream to become a pilot. Today, I am one – but I am a pilot who is not allowed to fly. Like a bird, whose wings are clipped off forcefully. Simply because some people are uncomfortable with the person I am," 23-year-old Adam Harry exclaims.

DGCA has ruled that Adam Harry is “temporarily unfit” to receive a licence to fly because of gender dysphoria, and has told him that he will not receive clearance until he is on medication. However, transpersons need medical support for their entire life. With no choice left except to seek legal recourse, Harry now works as a delivery boy for Zomato.

In his application form, Harry had no choice but to identify as female because the DGCA’s medical examination form does not have an option for transgenders!

Harry plans to file a writ petition in the High Court against DGCA for denying his medical certificate. Until then, he rides bikes delivering you food till he is able to fly planes and transport us from one city to another.
