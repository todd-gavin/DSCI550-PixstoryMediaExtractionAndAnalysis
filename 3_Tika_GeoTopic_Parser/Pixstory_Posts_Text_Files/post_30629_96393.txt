Liege Bastogne Liege last Northern Classic scheduled this year loses one of the favorites on the eve Tadej Pogacar communicated that he will not take part in the race that will be held tomorrow Unfortunately tomorrow he will not be at the start of Liege Bastogne Liege I have had some sad days but I want to thank everyone for understanding My special thanks go above all to the UAE Emirates Team to Mauro Giannetti and to the president Matar for their support in this situation The reason for the absence seems to be linked to a death in the family the death of the mother of his girlfriend Urska Zygart The UAE Team Emirates will field American Brandon McNulty in place of Pogacar
