Oriol Romeu

Bertrand was joined on the South Coast by Romeu a year after he left, and the two are now
crucial players for the Saints. At the time of the Wolves encounter, when he scored his solitary
goal for the club from the penalty spot, the former Barcelona teenager was just hoping to
establish himself as a Blue, but a devastating knee injury a few months later put an end to that.

Ramires

For much of the early 2010s, the Brazilian midfielder was the team's motor, but he proved to be
more than simply an enthusiastic presence, as two Goal of the Season accolades attested.

Ramires' great career as a Chelsea player came to an end over four years ago when he moved
to China, and he recently ended a brief run with Palmeiras in his hometown.

Victor Moses

Despite the fact that Moses had already made two appearances for Chelsea since coming from
Wigan Athletic, this was his full debut. The Nigerian international marked the occasion by
scoring the team's sixth goal, his first of 18 for the club.

In our 2016/17 title-winning season, he
reinvented himself as a wing-back, but he's currently on his third loan spell away from the
Bridge with Spartak Moscow.
