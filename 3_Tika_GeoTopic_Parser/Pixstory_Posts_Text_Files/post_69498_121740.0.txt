In Srinagar's Dal Lake, there is an island called Char Chinar that is encircled on all four sides by Chinar trees. It was built by Murad Baksh, the brother of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, and is also known as Char Chinari (char chinari means "four sides") and Rupa Lank. The finest way to experience the Char Chinar is from a shikara on Dal Lake. Three islands can be found in the Dal Lake, and two of them are encircled by chinar trees. One island, known as Roph Lank or Silver Island, is situated on the Bod Dal in addition to the Char Chinar. Sone Lank, or Gold Island, is the name of the other island, which is situated on the Lokut Dal. Kashmir is known for its Char Chinar trees, which are long-lived and incredibly beautiful.
