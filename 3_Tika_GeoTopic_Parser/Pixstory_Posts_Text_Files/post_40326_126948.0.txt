I love pohaa alot ! Its my favourite breakfast . I add peanuts and sprouts in my pohaa ! I make my pohaa even more healthier and more nutritious by cooking it in olive oil or coconut oil and by adding more vegetables to it . I also increase the satiety factor and make it protein-rich by throwing in some soya bean chunks . In short , the Indian pohaa is quite a rockstar on the health front and must be included more often in diet . ✅❤️
