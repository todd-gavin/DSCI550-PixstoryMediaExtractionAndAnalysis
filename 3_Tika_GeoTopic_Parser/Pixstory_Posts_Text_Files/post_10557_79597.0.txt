Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Sourav Ganguly and other office bearers of the Indian cricket board posted congratulatory tweets after Yash Dhull-led Indian team won the 2022 ICC U19 World Cup by beating England by 4 wickets in the final in Antigua on Sunday.

The Yash Dhull-led Indian team won the 2022 ICC U19 World Cup by beating England by 4 wickets in the final in Antigua on Sunday. This is a record-extending fifth triumph for India in the U19 World Cup. England's attempt to win their second title, since winning the tournament way back in 1998 ended in disappointment as the unbeaten Indian juggernaut steamrolled their opposition. India were tremendous with the ball, reducing England to 61/6, before rearguard from James Rew (95) took the team to 189 all out. India were made to work hard for their runs and eventually it was unbeaten knock of 50 from Nishant Sindhu and  another half-century from vice-captain Shaik Rasheed (50) that took the team home. Raj Angad Bawa was adjudged player of the match for his devastating spell of 5/31 and mature knock of 35 that set up the victory.
