Hadn t intended to read this one I m not typically drawn to prize winning works about which there happens to be an unprecedented hype This is not to say that I avoid certain works simply because they ve won a prize that s far from it I ve loved quite a few titles that have in their time won the Booker Coetzee s Disgrace is an all time favourite of mine But then my grandmother requested me to bring her a copy of Tomb of Sand and I happened to peruse the novel in the process Needless to say it s quite unputdownable and I m reminded that I have missed the pleasures of reading good fiction Are you planning to read Tomb of Sand Let me know if you are
