 As per the Mirror, The Magpies are looking to further strengthen their squad in the summer. Owing to this they are targeting Hojbjerg in order to improve their midfield as they push for the European spots next season. 

Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg has played an important role in Tottenham Hotspur's midfield this season. The Danish central midfielder has played 31 Premier League games for the club, scoring 2 goals and providing 2 assists this season. 

The midfielder joined the Spurs in 2020 after the North London side paid £15m to secure his services from Southampton. He started all 38 Premier League games last season and has again proved his worth under Antonio Conte. 

Emile-Pierre Hojbjerg still has 3 years remaining in his contract with Tottenham Hotspur. Hence, it would not be easy to secure the Danish midfielder's services. But Newcastle United have reportedly made the Danish international a "priority signing" 

Owing to their European aspirations for next season, Newcastle United are set to make a £30 million bid in the summer. But if the club rejects the transfer bid, the Magpies could add on to this offer. 

Earlier in the year, Emile-Pierre Hojbjerg had stated, "Antonio Conte is a special coach, with a special way of doing things, with a very high level of performing." But with rumours suggesting that the Italian could move to PSG in the summer, the midfielder may leave as well. 





Can Newcastle qualify for the UEFA Champions League next season?

With the owners looking to invest heavily in the club, Newcastle United surely have "sunny days" ahead of them. This also makes us wonder if the Magpies can qualify for the UEFA Champions League next season.

The answer to this is a very simple Why Not! Since January 22, 2022, Newcastle United have won 10 of their 14 Premier League games. This run has been impressive and the club has shown grit.  Hence a possible top-four finish next season looks very likely for the Tyneside club!
