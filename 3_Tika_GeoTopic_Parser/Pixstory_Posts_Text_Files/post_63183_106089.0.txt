Sunil Chhetri will celebrate his 17th year in international football in four days. In terms of skill set and hunger, the 37-year-old is still unrivalled. He scored twice in India's 2-0 win against Cambodia in the Asian Cup Group D qualifiers, bringing his total number of international goals to 82. According to the calculations, Chhetri is four goals short of Lionel Messi's 86. 

Not only did the seasoned marksman lead with aplomb, but he also played with the zeal of a 17-year-old who cut his teeth in big-time football for Mohun Bagan in 2002. His captain chastised Liston Colaco for attempting a shot from well outside the area rather than looking for a better alternative. When the referee gave him a yellow card, he was furious.
