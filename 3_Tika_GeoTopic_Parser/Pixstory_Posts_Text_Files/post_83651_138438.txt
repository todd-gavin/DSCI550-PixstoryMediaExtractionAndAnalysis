I m constantly trying to learn new things so every now and then something will strike my eye And when I m passionate about something I work endlessly on it I enjoy many different activities including writing bodybuilding cooking and mixed martial arts I enjoy working hard and I desire for never ending discipline Just as much as I value learning from others experiences I also enjoy sharing my own with them I m an excellent team player because I m extroverted but I also enjoy working alone I ve always loved helping people sometimes even at my own expense I would choose to hurt myself over the people I care about
