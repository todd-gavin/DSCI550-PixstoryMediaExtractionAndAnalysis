Earlier this season it was announced that the NBA had created a new Social Justice Champion Award named after Los Angeles Lakers legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The recipient of the inaugural award would be current Lakers forward Carmelo Anthony.

Abdul-Jabbar did present Anthony with the award, but it was via a video message. While the honor was still there for Anthony, especially as the inaugural winner of such an important off-court award, it doesn’t quite add up to being given the award in person from a legend like Abdul-Jabbar.

Prior to the Lakers’ contest against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday, Abdul-Jabbar himself would present Anthony with the physical award and afterward, Carmelo would discuss how important receiving the award is to him.

“I think we all know how important that award was when I first received it from Kareem,” Anthony said. “We all know how important that award is today, but the fact that he was able to present me with the actual physical award. Him being there just what that award means to myself, what that award means to my community to my people to my fans and to my family.

“At the end of the day, having that in the house and understanding everything that comes along with that. The responsibility that comes with that, the accountability that come with that, and to be able to say that I was the first one to receive that award. It’s hard to explain what that feels like. It’s an honor for me to receive that and I’m glad Kareem actually having an award that’s named after him.”

Kareem’s off-court work is undeniable and he is truly held in high regard amongst current players for everything he’s done. In fact, Anthony admits that he knew about Abdul-Jabbar off the court before he knew how great he was on it.

While he remains outspoken about issues he sees and has no issue calling out people when he deems it necessary, Abdul-Jabbar is still beloved and Anthony obviously gets great joy at being the inaugural recipient of this new award.
