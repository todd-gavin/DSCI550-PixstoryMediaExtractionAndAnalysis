Beautiful blonde hair hanging low A lover of guitars Most beautiful eyes that you ll get lost into She wrote songs about her life that helped millions to find their light Been through a lot but she remained strong Stars around her soul never stopped shining Happiness in her smile Cared for people not afraid to love She struggled through some stages had sleepless nights She cried so much but the world didn t hear But she smiled in those times cause she knew happiness is near There are going to be people who will try to undercut your success She said An inspiration for loads of people She stood up for herself no matter what Her kindness cannot be measured An amazing daughter a lovely friend a wonderful singer a caring sister a TRUE lover The leaves rustle as she sits under the tree She looks just like a dream
