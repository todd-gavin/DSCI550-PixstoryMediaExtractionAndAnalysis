Curd or dahi is a fermented milk product that we are enjoying since childhood . 😍
But dahi at night ?
It is very controversial topic . Many believe that it’s not good for you when you have it at night , while others give a thumbs up !
And this makes me confuse 🤔 and i know many of you are confused you about having at at night ! Well let’s see some facts and decide whether or not to have it at night ; 
1 Firstly curd is good for weight watchers , as it is high in protein and low calorie & low in carbohydrates . Instead of having creamy dip or soft drinks or dessert items post dinner , try having curd dip , buttermilk or curd- sugar as a healthy , low calorie option .
2 Curd boosts digestion as it is probiotic food . At night our digestion is sluggish and body is sleep ready . So during that time people with acidity , reflux and digestive issues must avoid having curd .
3 Curd is sour & sour food are known to accelerate joint pains .
4 It is also known to aggravate runny nose . So next time you have blocked or runny nose , try to keep curd at bay at night .
5 If you are eating curd at night , add sugar or some black pepper . It will assist in digestion and calm your digestive system .
6 Curd is a good source of calcium , phosphorus and folic acid which helps to keep your bone , teeth and blood in good health .
So don't get confused ! All of it depends upon your body . If it suits you ,  you can have it at night also . 😍😋
