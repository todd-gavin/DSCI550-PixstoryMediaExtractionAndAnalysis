Football is a very physical game with lot of physical encounters in it, That is why it is really important to play the game in the surveillance of an professional. 

To judge the physical tackles and to maintain  the discipline in the game their is a referee appointed. 

The Yellow Card and the Red card are used to  warn or to sent off the player. 

The Yellow card is shown to the player when the player misbehave or do some illegal challenge on other player, the card means a warning to the player. 

If the player repeats the same mistake or do any other mistake to disturb the discipline of the game another yellow card is shown. 

Two consecutive yellow cards means a Red card which means the player have to leave the field and even not allowed to sit on the bench. 

If the tackle is so dangerous or the player misbehave a lot a straight red card is shown to the player which means the player is sent off and the player have to leave the field. 

If the player still misbehave or create any problem after shown a red card. The player may be sued by the Judiciary court and my have to pay fine or Can be banned from playing. 

Which players comes to your mind when you hear the word " RED CARD " ? 

Let me know in the notes....
