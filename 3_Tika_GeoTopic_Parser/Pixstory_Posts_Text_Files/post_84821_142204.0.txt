Marco van Basten (ST)
Van Basten was regarded as the best striker in the world; with unrivaled qualities and attacking intelligence made him a devastating striker for AC Milan. He was always a threat in the box, with unsurpassed aerial ability, striking sense, and close ball control.

He wore both jerseys, but his best performance came for Inter, Ronaldoâ€™s goalscoring instincts saw him score 59 goals in just 99 games for Inter Milan.
