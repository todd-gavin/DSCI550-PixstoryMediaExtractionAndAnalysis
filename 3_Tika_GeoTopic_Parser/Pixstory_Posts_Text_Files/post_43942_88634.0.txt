The Argentine Primera Division match at Estadio Dr Lisandro de la Torre was first feared to be called off due to crowd unrest.

Before Newell's Old Boys' game against Rosario on Sunday, a grenade was thrown onto the pitch, and riot police were dispatched to protect the players.

Supporters launched explosives from the stands before to the start of the Argentine Primera Division match at Estadio Dr Lisandro de la Torre.

Despite the disturbing events, the game went on, with Newell's winning 1-0 courtesy to a goal from Juan Manuel Garcia in the 51st minute, but security was increased throughout the 90 minutes.

What went wrong?

Newell's documented everything that happened before, during, and after the game on their official Twitter account, starting with videos of the grenades destroying the pitch.

The game had to be delayed at first as the referee conferred with the matchday security chief, but the activity ultimately resumed, and the players were forced to overcome the distraction of a tense atmosphere.

Riot police were sent in.

Following Garcia's second-half goal, riot police were called in to defend Newell's team.

As the players celebrated, the officers surrounded them and utilised protective shields to deflect any objects thrown from the crowd.

Newell's managed to hold on for their first win at the Arroyito since 2016, writing on Twitter after the game: "We had heart and passion. You had grenades. Heart and passion won. Rosario is ours."
