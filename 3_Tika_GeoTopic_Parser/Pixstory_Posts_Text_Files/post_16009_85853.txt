Jas mine Seah Ruth P Lim Abstract Aims To compare levels of renal hypoxia measured by Blood Oxygen Level Dependent BOLD magnetic resonance imaging MRI with measured transverse relaxation rate R and renal structural changes including apparent diffusion coefficient ADC and fractional anisotropy FA in patients with type diabetes and healthy controls Methods Cohort study comparing MRI metrics in type diabetes n GFR ml min m and controls n Renal function and selected inflammatory renal biomarkers were also measured Results For BOLD we found reduced cortical s vs s p and medullary s vs s p R indicating more oxygenated parenchyma in type diabetes vs controls respectively We observed reduced cortical FA indicating decreased structural integrity in type diabetes p We found reduced cortical ADC reflecting reduced water diffusion in non hyperfiltering mm s versus hyperfiltering mm s type diabetes patients MRI parameters correlated with renal function and inflammatory renal biomarkers Conclusions MRI derived indices of renal function and structure differed between i type diabetes and healthy controls and ii between non hyperfiltering and hyperfiltering type diabetes patients providing insight into the role of hypoxia and renal structural and functional changes in DKD Sources
