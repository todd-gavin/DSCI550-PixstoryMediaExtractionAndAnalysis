Kelsey-Lee Barber, a twenty-nine-year-old reigning World Champion, achieved her ultimate goal of becoming an Olympic medalist in 2021 when she took bronze in the thrilling final of the Women's Javelin Throw in Tokyo.

Kelsey will go down in history as only the fourth Australian to win an Olympic medal in a throwing sport, and the only athlete to do so in the last 25 years. Kelsey is the sixth of only seven Australian women to win a medal in Field sports in modern Olympic history.

Kelsey admits to being a late bloomer in her sport, having only begun throwing javelins at the age of 17. She did, however, represent Australia by the age of 22. Kelsey made her international debut in 2014, winning a bronze medal at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Kelsey decided she had what it took to throw far and began travelling the world doing what she loved most.
