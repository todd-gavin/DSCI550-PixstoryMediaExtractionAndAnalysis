Kun Der Lin I Mei Lin Abstract Aim Patients with type diabetes mellitus exhibited autonomic nervous system ANS dysfunction and comorbidities with depressive or anxiety symptoms were related to poor glycemic control Heart rate variability HRV converted from electrocardiogram ECG has been used as the ANS index The study aimed to explore the associations between depression anxiety HRV and glycemic control in patients with type diabetes mellitus Methods The Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ and Generalized Anxiety Disorder GAD questionnaires were used to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with type diabetes mellitus mean age was years males The ECG raw signals were collected from a min sitting and resting baseline and then transformed to HRV indices referring ANS activation Blood glucose and lipid profiles including glycated hemoglobin HbA c high density lipoprotein HDL low density lipoprotein LDL and triglyceride were obtained from the electronic medical records Results Ninety nine participants had depressive symptoms and had anxiety symptoms Depression and HbA c were negatively correlated with parasympathetic activation Depression and anxiety were positively correlated with sympathetic activation After controlling for demographic data and lipid profiles depression was a significant positive predictor for HbA c levels and HRV indices lnLF and lnHF were the significant negative predictors for HbA c levels Mediation effect analysis showed that depression was a mediator between parasympathetic activation and glycemic control Conclusions Lower parasympathetic activation and higher depressive symptoms may affect glycemic control in patients with type diabetes mellitus Intervention programs targeting to increase parasympathetic activities and reducing depression could be further tested for their effects on glycemic outcomes for potential clinical use Sources
