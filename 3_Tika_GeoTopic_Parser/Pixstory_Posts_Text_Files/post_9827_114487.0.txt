If I just stopped to smell the roses, 
I would see that this world, 
is still a beautiful place. 
The turmoil inside this world, 
has placed a mask over my eyes, 
And this beautiful place, 
is passing me by. 

Well, all this is changing. 
My mask is finally fading. 
I can smell the sweet scent of the roses. 
There is no turning back. 

I will climb the highest mountain, 
Ride the biggest wave. 
This mask will dissipate and, 
I will finally LIVE in this beautiful place!
