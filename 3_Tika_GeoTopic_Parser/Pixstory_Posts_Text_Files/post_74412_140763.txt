Brahmastra starring Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt has finally released in theatres all across As expected the film has opened to an excellent response The initial box office momentum is definitely there Made on a budget of over crores the film has been promoted as a visual treat with never seen before VFX work D and D IMAX versions are showing superb responses all across the country Thankfully it justifies every single penny as the visuals are stunning and it s a whole new experience in Indian cinema It s an answer to all who have been asking for a film matching Hollywood standards It has hit the bull s eye in attracting its target audience and that s youth in the range of years Even though it s an experience for all the aforementioned age group will make for the majority of footfalls After talking about the positives let s discuss some minuses After initial positive reactions mixed word of mouth has now started flowing in No one is calling it a bad film but many are pointing out too much attention on grandeur and romance rather than the screenplay Shah Rukh Khan s cameo is doing its job of attracting the audience while some feel that he has been wasted Also the content will not appeal to all age groups and all centres impacting the span of the theatrical run On the whole Brahmastra has things working in favour and things not working in favour as well However the hype and the cinematic experience definitely have an edge over shortcomings So it s clear ground to score for Brahmastra at the box office and it is eyeing to make anywhere between crores Expect crores in the first weekend itself bringing back the good old days for Bollywood
