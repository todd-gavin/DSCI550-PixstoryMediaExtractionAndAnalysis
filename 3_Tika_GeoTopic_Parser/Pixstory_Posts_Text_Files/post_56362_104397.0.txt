We all have the fear of change. We all seek stability which is the greatest myth. Is there anything stable? Change is the only that that is stable. 

Change should not be something to be feared because it reflects growth. Some people get stuck in this endless loop in their lives which has no room for changes. You are human because you have to embrace the changes around you and change your attitudes. Change makes you realise many aspects of life that you have left unexplored. Change is necessary or else you will be stuck in a place and the whole world will be ahead of you. 

Changes are for good because people change every single day, and discoveries are made all this resonates in our society demanding a change. When weather patterns change won't we change our dressing style or will we stick on to summer clothes in winter? The same attitude is needed when societal changes come your way. We don't need exclusive but we need inclusive culture.
