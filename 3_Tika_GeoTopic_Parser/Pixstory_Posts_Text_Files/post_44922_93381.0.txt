Bukayo Saka has emerged as one of the more likeable footballers at the Emirates stadium in
recent seasons. Still in a relatively early part of his career, the Englishman has been at the
centre of Mikel Arteta's growing team alongside Martin Ødegaard, Emile Smith Rowe and
Kieran Tierney.

Saka was interviewed this week, about his favourite goals and one's he'd like to recreate as
a player. Without any hesitation, Lionel Messi's stunning piece of art from 7 years ago came
to mind.

"Because of the moment, I think I would say Leo Messi’s goal in the Copa del Rey final
against Athletic Club. The one where he dribbled everyone," Saka explained.

Even by Messi's astronomical standards, that particular goal was the crowning jewel in the
Argentine's goal collection.

"Now that I play, I can see how hard it is to score that goal. People are trying to kick him, to
bring him down in the process, and he just keeps going, and he still scored in the final, as
well.I was just like, 'wow'. When he says he’s going past you, you’re not stopping him."

The goal was nominated for that year's Puskas Award, alongside Roma's Alessandro
Florenzi and Brazilian forward Wendell Lira. Saka expressed admiration for Spanish
midfielder Sergio Busquets too.

"Sergio Busquets. The way he just so elegantly turned me. I came at him to press him, I tried
to fake this side then go to the other. And the way he just embarrassed me: I was just like,
yeah, this guy is elite," he added.

Saka came up against Busquets in a pre-season friendly two years ago.

"The way he just took me out of the play, I said, 'Respect.' [Busquets] is three steps ahead of
everyone and that's what makes you a top footballer. That's what I realised that day."
Learning from the very best.
