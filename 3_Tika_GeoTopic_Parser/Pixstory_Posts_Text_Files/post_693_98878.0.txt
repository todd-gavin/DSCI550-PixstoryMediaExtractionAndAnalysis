In India, almost all urban households (99%) and rural households (95%) have access to an improved source of drinking water. 
Improved sources of water protect against outside contamination so that the water is more likely to be
safe to drink.
Urban and rural households rely on different sources of drinking water. The main sources of drinking water for urban households are water piped into their dwelling, yard, or plot (54%), tube wells or boreholes (16%), and public taps or
standpipes (12%) 
In contrast, rural households rely most on tube wells or boreholes (46%),
followed by water piped into their dwelling, yard, or plot (23%). In rural areas, 68 percent of households have water on
their premises or delivered to their dwelling, compared with 86 percent in urban areas. 

In households where water is not
delivered or the source of water is not at the premises, women age 15 years and above are most likely to collect drinking
water (71%).

Clean water is a basic need for human life. However, 58 percent of households do not treat their water prior to drinking.
Treatment is less common in rural areas than urban areas; 66 percent of rural households do not treat their water, compared
with 44 percent of urban households. Boiling water and straining the water through a cloth before drinking are the most
common water treatment procedures used prior to drinking (16% and 15% of households, respectively).
