“You don't have to be positive all the time. It's perfectly okay to feel sad, angry, annoyed, frustrated, scared, or anxious. Having feelings doesn't make you a 'negative person. ' It makes you human.”— Lori Deschene
Mental health is emerging as a serious issue at the present, especially among young people. As the pandemic had taken a toll over our mental health and when everything is online and monotonous, people are not able to reach out and express themselves and as a result, the importance of venting out the pent up feelings is neglected. Not just this, people find it difficult to get refuge from their hectic schedules and are not able to find time for themselves. A study says that half of all mental disorders emerge by the time people are 14 years old and three-quarters by 25 years old – the same period when most people are in education.
Despite the fact that one in four people suffer from a mental illness world over, the fear and stigma associated with matters related to
mental health stop people from reaching out and seeking help; they simply continue to suffer in silence, and sometimes, even in ignorance. Society needs
to be sensitized to ground-level problems and pushed to come forward to create a right space where everyone can actualize our dreams and make unique world solutions thus bursting the bubble about mental health.
