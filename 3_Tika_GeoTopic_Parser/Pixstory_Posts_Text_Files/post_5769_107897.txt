Ittu si baat is a coming of age teenage romance drama or atleast it tries to be The story is about Bittu a small town boy and an upcoming cricketer from Varanasi and his crush on his childhood friend Sapna How he tries to confess his love for her and whether he gets successful in it or not Star cast includes some veteran actors like Farida Jalal and Tikku Talsania who haven t been seen on the big screen in a long time and in the lead is Ravi Chauhan playing bittu in his debut film with Gayatri Bhardwaj The movie starts strong with breaking gender stereotypes and standing against evil practice of dowry but as the end is near it turns out to be a little misogynistic The girl is at fault despite not knowing what has been going around and because she is from a small town she had to be dumb whereas the hero gives creepy vibes and offcouse he is violent Bittu won t confess his feelings to her childhood friend crush but will go to any length to buy an Iphone for her because it s easier to buy love The performances of all the lead actors and the supporting cast was fine There were some good punches few funny moments but all in all not a worthwhile watch If the makers have stayed on the path taken in the beginning we might have got another Bareilly ki Barfi but somewhere along the way they went astray
