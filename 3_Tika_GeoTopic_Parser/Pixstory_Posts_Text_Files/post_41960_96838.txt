Situated amongst the mighty peaks of the Himalayas Darjeeling is not only enveloped by serene landscapes But also the souls of themartyrs whose stories echo throughout the streets of this famous hill station The mountains of Darjeeling are home to the mighty Gorkhas For the past years Darjeeling has been fighting for its lost identity and statehood The Gorkhas do not dream the same dream as the Bengal government Since Independence the Gorkhas have been living as foreigners in their own country The country for which Gorkhas like Dal Bahadur Giri Helen Lepcha Krishna Bhadur Mukhia etc shed their blood sweat and tears The past three decades also saw the rise of three agitations The bloodiest being the Agitation of The memories of which still haunt a mother whose son was decapitated a wife whose husband never returned from the market a father whose daughter was shot dead before his own eyes The CPRF also torched houses raped women and silenced everyone that spoke against the government On th May an innocent Gorkha residing from Panighatta was denounced a terrorist and shot dead in broad daylight The events of Panighatta turned the tide of the agitation And what was once a peaceful protest now turned into a bloody warfare Another significant event of the Agitation was the massacre of th July On this day a peaceful protest was held at Main Road Kalimpong to challenge The Treaty of Nepal also known as Sugaulo Sandhi The treaty designed by the Indian government imposed restrictions on Gorkhas traveling to Nepal The peaceful protest turned into a bloodbath when the CRPF opened fire killing and injuring hundreds The incident also caught the eye of BBC who condemned the actions of the Indian government Whereas the government still continued to ignore the atrocities committed by CRPF According to the government record a total of Gorkhas were decimated And thousands were swept under the carpet To the day India will see us as their own To the day our people have their own identity and their land We are fighting not drowning Jai Gorkha Jai Gorkhaland Siddarth Kharga
