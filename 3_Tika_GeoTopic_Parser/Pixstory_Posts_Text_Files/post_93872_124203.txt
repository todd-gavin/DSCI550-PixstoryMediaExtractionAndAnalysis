There have been many great fast bowlers in the history of cricket but Shoaib Akhtar and Brett Lee regarded as real speedsters Their rivalry to breach the barrier of miles per hour is a stuff of legends But somehow both could not realise their full potential They were feared because of their speed but somehow speed was the only thing that defined them They were not complete fast bowlers like Imran Khan Wasim Akram or Dennis Lilly Shoaib Akhtar and Brett Lee have dropped several wickets down and resisted the batsmen from scoring They have made all the batsmen nervous about their deliveries Shoaib Akhtar went by the name of Rawalpindi Express for his super fast deliveries The Pakistan Right arm express fast bowler had amazed everyone with his speed In fact he was also known as the fastest bowler by many of his fans Shoaib has a delivery speed of km h which is a world record On the other hand Brett Lee the former Australian cricketer has been no less He was also one of the top fastest bowlers in the world The Australian right arm fast bowler has made several wickets drop on the field It was very hard for the batsmen to detect his fast bowls on the field km h was the speed of his fastest delivery on the field Akhtar and Lee were the fastest bowlers during their tenure on the field They have imprinted their name in the history of cricket with their actions But who among the two titans is the fastest Do tell me in notes or with a challenge or support
