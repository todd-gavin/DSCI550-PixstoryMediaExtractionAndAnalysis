What exactly happened during the game?

Real Madrid completed a spectacular comeback to knock Paris Saint-Germain out of the Champions League with a hat trick from Karim Benzema. PSG took a 2-0 lead in the aggregate scoring thanks to Kylian Mbappe's first-half strike, but Madrid won 3-2 thanks to Benzema's three goals after the interval.

PSG's heartbreak in the Champions League continues as they lose another game from a winning position, following losses to Barcelona and Manchester United in recent years.

After the game, Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti told Movistar:

"It's special above all because we won after a difficult game. It got more complicated after Mbappe's goal. We suffered a lot to get the ball back. We pressed them, we'd practised that in training, and then we got the first goal and the game changed totally, the fans started to believe more and more, it was spectacular, we're obviously very happy.
