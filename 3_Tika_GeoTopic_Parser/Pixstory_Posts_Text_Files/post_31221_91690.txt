In interpreting each new discovery, archaeologists often try to formulate detailed hypotheses drawing on their knowledge, experience and even their imagination. There are two particularly effective methods for testing these hypotheses and opening up new possibilities: experimentation, testing multiple alternatives, and ethnographic analogy, observing the behavior of other cultures in similar situations These approaches help establish which of the interpretations formulated work and in some cases also provide suggestions on the objectives to be pursued with future research Archaeological finds relating to agriculture in the Iron Age are scarce although Roman documents attest that Britain at that time it was a rich land that exported cereals and hides The research carried out in England at the Butser Ancient Farm an experimental reconstruction of an ancient farm made it possible to fill some gaps demonstrating the effectiveness of the tools used by the men of the Iron Age In a particular state verified that the ard or nail plow was suitable for working not only light soils but, contrary to expectations, also heavy and clayey ones Much of the research carried out in Butser had as its objective the reconstruction of a typical Iron Age circular house Source Giulia Civita Illustrated library of knowledge Archaeology
