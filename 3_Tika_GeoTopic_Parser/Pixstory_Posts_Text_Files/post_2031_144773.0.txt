The criticism surrounding Governor Greg Abbottâ€™s decision to send migrants to other states is completely hypocritical. That is typical thought of Democrats: they demand that others play by rules that they refuse to follow.If representatives and their constituents believe so much in the concept of open borders and accepting all illegal immigrants, then why are they so mad that Texas sent them to their states?They would probably be better off too. After all, liberals in East and west coast cities are clearly more willing to provide services to them. Far more so than Texas.Maybe Abbott made this a bit too political. Maybe he should have let each city he sent the migrants to know they were coming well in advance so that they could prepare. Whatever the case may be, he is absolutely right to out the interests of his own people above people in other states - people who caused the border crisis.
