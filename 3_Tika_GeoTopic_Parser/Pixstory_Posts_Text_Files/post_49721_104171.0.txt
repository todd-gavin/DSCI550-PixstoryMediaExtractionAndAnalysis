Some studies have shown that violent video games can have an optimistic effect on kindness, civic engagement, and prosocial behaviours.

A study published in Computers in Human Behavior discovered that youths exposed to violence in action games exhibited more prosocial behaviour and civic engagement, “possibly due to the team-oriented multiplayer options in many of these games".

There are many risk factors associated with youth violence, but video games are not among them. The US Surgeon General’s list of risk factors for youth violence comprised abusive parents, poverty, neglect, neighbourhood crime, substance use, and mental health problems, but not video games. 

Let's not underestimate our children they know what to adapt to. Violent video game players know the disparity between virtual violence in the context of a game and reasonable behaviour in the real world.

By age seven, children can distinguish fantasy from reality and can tell the difference between video game violence and real-world violence. Kids see fantasy violence all the time, from Harry Potter and the Minions to Bugs Bunny and Tom and Jerry. Their ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality prevents them from emulating video game violence in real life.

Violent video games provide opportunities for children to explore the consequences of violent actions, develop their moral compasses and release their stress and anger (catharsis) in the game, leading to less real-world aggression.

Violent games allow youth to experiment with moral issues such as war, violence, and death without real-world consequences. 

Studies claiming a causal link between video game violence and real-life violence are flawed.
Many studies failed to control for factors that contribute to children coming to be violent, such as family history and mental health, plus most studies do not follow children over long periods.
