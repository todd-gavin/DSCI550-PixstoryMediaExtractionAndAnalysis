 Excellent post Luci I agree with what you said I do have certain points of mine to add to it though because I think people truly don t understand the importance of protecting and conserving flora People have started to realize the importance of wild animals however they still don t understand that of wild plants Flora is important for a number of reasons First and foremost flora provides essential resources for the ecosystem For example flowers provide pollen that helps to fertilize other plants and trees provide wood that s used to build homes and furniture Flora also plays a role in regulating the climate by changing the way sunlight is absorbed Flora also helps to regulate the environment by absorbing and storing water This ensures that the plant kingdom stays moist and thriving through dry periods In fact over of all plant life on earth relies on rainfall for their sustenance which is why it s so important to protect rain forests Then flora helps to fertilize the soil with nutrients and water This helps promote a healthy ecosystem that can support other plants and animals And last but not least flora provides food for various creatures in the ecosystem from insects to birds to large predators like lions and tigers Protecting flora thus benefits all living beings in some way or another Additionally flora helps to create landscapes that are aesthetically pleasing Trees and flowers add color and texture to landscapes while their leaves also help to filter water and keep soil dry And let s be honest who doesn t want their planet to look all kinds of pretty When flora is destroyed or damaged it can have a negative impact on the environment overall If we damage or destroy flora it can lead to problems like increased flooding or less oxygen in the air which could cause major problems for human beings as well as wildlife So don t forget Flora is vital for our planet don t let it be destroyed
