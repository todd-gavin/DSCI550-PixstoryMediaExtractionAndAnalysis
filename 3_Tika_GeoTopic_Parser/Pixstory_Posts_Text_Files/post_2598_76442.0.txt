The Sukasapati (The seventy-two tales of the parrot) is a collection of stories originally written in Sanskrit.

The seventy-two stories were told by the parrot to the queen Prabhāvati in order to stop her going out looking for a lover whilst her husband Madana had gone on a long journey. The parrot dares to criticise the queen's intentions and is threatened of death, however eventually the queen consents to hear his first story.

By the time the parrot has finished his tale, it is quite late in the evening and the queen decides to go to sleep. This same situation takes place on the sixty nine following evenings for as many different tales until Madana returns home.

The king at first is suspicious about his wife, however the parrot calms him down with the seventieth story, after which the king's father proclaims a great festival in honour of Madana and Prabhāvati and the parrot ascends to heaven.

As with many Sanskrit texts, there are verses interspersed with prose that form part of the narrative.

"The rich man is wise, 
he is generous and good, 
the honoured kin of everyone; 
but when his money goes, 
so does his glory."
