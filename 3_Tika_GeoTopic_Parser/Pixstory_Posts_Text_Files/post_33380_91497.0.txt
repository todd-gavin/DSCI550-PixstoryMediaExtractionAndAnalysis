Looking at the descriptions in the video, the proposal looks promising keeping in mind that the initial stupas erected soon after the passing of the Buddha, were actually made of mud-bricks and were not of the latter types constructed with baked bricks (as at Nandangarh or Kesariya) or stone (as at Sanchi).

Also, what exists at Harsain is not just one stupa, but a complex of 4 stupas, which indicates the ancient importance of the site. The site continued to be important till the Pala period as indicated by some very fine blackstone images including of Varaha, Badri Narayan, Ganga, Shiva-Parvati and a column in blackstone, which are some of the best specimens of plastic art of the Eastern School of Medieval Sculpture (c. 800 - 1200 A.D.). Â  

However, such identification can be confirmed only through scientific excavation, which needs to be initiated at the earliest. Further delay in protection of the site may actually lead to the loss of precious heritage, since the site is seen to be continuously under the threat of locals looking for earth filling in other constructions. Moreover, in the process of such digging if anyone unfamiliar with the importance of the relic, would accidentally obtain it, there is a high probability of its being permanently lost.
