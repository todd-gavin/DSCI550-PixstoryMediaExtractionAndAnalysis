The Congress in Himachal Pradesh is in disarray with internal dissension on the rise and many state leaders on the brink of jumping the ship There is visible disconnect between the central leadership and the state unit Congress Himachal Pradesh in charge Rajiv Shukla who is said to be Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra s choice is under fire from local leaders for his alleged close ties with some BJP leaders including union minister Anurag Thakur and home minister Amit Shah s son Jay Shah Both Shukla and Jay Shah are in the cash rich BCCI Board for Control of Cricket in India The Congress high command had earlier rejected Shukla s proposal to appoint Mukesh Agnihotri as the state unit chief in place of Kuldeep Singh Rathore The party decided to rely on the legacy of late Virbhadra Singh and named his wife Pratibha Singh as the Himachal Congress chief Many state leaders have repeatedly complained to the Congress high command about Shukla s arbitrary style of functioning The inaction on the part of the Congress leadership is prompting a number of lower rung party leaders to consider the AAP as an option The emergence of AAP appears to have upset the Congress calculations The grand old party was expecting to convincingly oust the BJP this time given that Himachal Pradesh is a cyclic state where no incumbent government has returned to power with the exception of when late Virbhadra Singh had opted for mid term polls to encash the Indira Gandhi assassination wave and to consolidate his grip over the state Singh was made the chief minister in after his predecessor late Ram Lal Thakur had to resign over trees felling allegations a sensitive issue in the hills To make matters worse the Congress is yet to give a shape to it s campaign strategy or start the process of identifying potential candidates On the other hand the BJP to beat the anti incumbency against it is mulling to drop at least sitting legislators in it s bid to retain power in the state The saffron party had adopted this strategy in many other states in the past with considerable success
