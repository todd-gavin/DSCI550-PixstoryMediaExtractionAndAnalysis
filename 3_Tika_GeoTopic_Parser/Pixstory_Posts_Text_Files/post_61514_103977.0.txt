The song was released on May 20, the album secured the top spot on the Billboard 200 albums chart with 521,500 equivalent album units earned in the week ending May 26. According to Luminate this is the biggest week for an album in the U.S. this year, which may sound feel like a sigh of relief for the artists and their labels alike. 

Harry Styles in just saving the pop genre one album at a time, but with number like these, it won’t be far-fetched to call him the “saviour of music industry”.

Consequently, three other songs from Harry’s House have also debuted in the Hot 100’s top 10: “Late Night Talking” (No. 4), “Music for a Sushi Restaurant” (No. 8) and “Matilda” (No. 9).
