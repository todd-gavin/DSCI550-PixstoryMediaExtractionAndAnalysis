On Thursday the second half of Everton s match against Newcastle was called off when a fan charged the field and tied himself to the goalpost in support of the Just Stop Oil campaign In Liverpool s win over Arsenal on Wednesday a fan attempted a similar stunt but was quickly removed but this fan eluded security and tied themselves to the post with a cable tie around their throat The game was stopped about eight minutes as bolt cutters and scissors were brought out of the dugout to remove the protestor who refused to leave the pitch after being liberated The protestor had to be dragged off the field by security as other supporters in the crowd stormed the barriers in an attempt to approach the offending fan Just Stop Oil came to Twitter after the incident to identify the demonstrator as Louis It s and it s time to look up time to step up and not stand by It s time to act like it s an emergency the protester is quoted as saying Report after report is telling me that my future is going to be dire and my government is telling me not to worry and pay into a pension But we have a choice We can choose to highlight that our climate is breaking down we can choose to resist this government that is betraying us we can choose to step up and not stand by A fan named Kai attempted something similar at the Emirates Stadium just hours before In recent months the organisation has staged protests at a number of prominent events including the BAFTAs and large marches around London
