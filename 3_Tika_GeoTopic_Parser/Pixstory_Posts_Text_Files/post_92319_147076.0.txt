It also aims to end all of the ongoing conflicts in the world so that they can be resolved peacefully and thus can be prevented from spreading all over the world which can force all of our world into a major conflict which could cause serious consequences to humanity and our world. This day thus encourages people to refrain themselves from participating in violence and advocating for war as it is seen that many times people emotionally arvocates for war as without people support it becomes extremely hard for the leaders to start a conflict or war even if they are dictators. So as a people it is our responsibility to always speak against war and always advocate peace. Life is better in a world where peace exists and that is the motive of this day as well to advocate for peace and non-violence across the world. On this day we look to those who have been peacemakers and peacekeepers to pay them respect and tributes for their contributions and also to learn what we can each do individually to make the world a more peaceful place.The message of peace is a very simple message and we all must have listened about it and its importance since our childhood through parents and schools. But despite knowing it we must accept that reality is far different and everyone is kind of insecure of each other which leads to various conflicts between various states or people groups.And that's what is the problem with our world we know that war and violence is never an answer to resolve conflicts but it only increases the hatred for each other around the world. For now we have avoided a major world conflict since world war 2 but looking at current scenarios we can't guarantee that we are not gonna have a world war 3 still it is very unlikely to happen but why take a chance when we can stop fighting now only.
