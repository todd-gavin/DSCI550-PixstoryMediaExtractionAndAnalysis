Samu Castillejo has formally signed a permanent contract to leave AC Milan and has joined
Gennaro Gattuso's Valencia in La Liga.

The Rossoneri confirmed the departure in a statement
on Tuesday night and thanked the Spaniard for his professionalism and dedication while he was
a member of the team.

The statement said: “The Club would like to thank Samu for the professionalism and commitment shown during his time here and we wish him all the best in his personal and professional life,”
Castillejo transferred to Milan in 2018 from Villareal, Valencia's rivals, as part of a transaction
that also saw Colombian forward Carlos Bacca move the other way.

He has played nearly 90
times for the Rossoneri since the switch, scoring seven goals in the process.

The 27-year-old lost Stefano Pioli's favour last season, and during the Scudetto-winning
campaign, he only made five Serie A appearances. He is now actively seeking a move as a
result, and because he already has a solid working relationship with former Milan coach
Gennaro Gattuso, he has decided to do so.

The Rossoneri will be pleased to recover some money on the salary bill this summer, as has been reported by Calcio e Finanza, who focus on the financial side of the game, so that it can be used to help finance additional deals.

The precise sum Valencia paid for the Spanish winger is still unknown, but as of the end of June, his market worth was €4.3 million, and his annual salary is currently €2.6 million. This
implies that Milan will receive at least €7.1 million back before the upcoming season.

Every little bit helped, and those funds could theoretically be used to add another backup
defender to the defence to provide the Rossoneri greater depth given that money doesn't seem
to be in excess for them.
