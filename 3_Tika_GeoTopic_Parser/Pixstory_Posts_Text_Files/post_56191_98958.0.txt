Foreign Secretary Liz Truss declares a ban on services exports, including management consulting, accounting and public relations, to Russia. This is a huge blow to Russia as many countries including the US did the same and now it lost another powerful nation.

Russia is heavily dependent on Western services companies for the production and export of manufactured goods, this decision will further ratchet up economic pressure on Putin’s siege economy. More sanctions will also hit those behind Putin’s terrible disinformation campaign, including RT and Sputnik online. The UK has now sanctioned over 1600 individuals and entities. 

 Liz Truss said: "Doing business with Putin’s regime is morally bankrupt and helps fund a war machine that is causing untold suffering across Ukraine. Cutting Russia’s access to British services will put more pressure on the Kremlin and ultimately help ensure Putin fails in Ukraine."

The UK also put sanctions on social media platforms by Russia which promotes misinformation. The UK will continue to work closely with social media platforms and allies to uncover, expose, and counter the Kremlin’s disinformation operation.

Alongside previous asset freezes against media outlets already in place, the UK is systematically shutting out Putin’s propaganda.
