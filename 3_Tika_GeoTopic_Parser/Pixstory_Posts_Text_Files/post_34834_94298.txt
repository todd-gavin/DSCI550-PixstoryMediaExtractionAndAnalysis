The more he scores with Lazio and the more he is criticized for what he has done in the national team There is no peace for Ciro Immobile at the top of the Serie A top scorer with goals but always in the criticisms for Italy&#39;s failure to qualify for the World Cup in Qatar So much so that it is rumored that he is thinking of retiring from the blue shirt despite his age still allowing him to be called up for a few years But he still has to decide what to do Continue I don&#39;t know I still have to decide he has an answer at the end of the match against Turin The many goals are enough to appease the critics No, it&#39;s not enough. As I said in Genoa, criticism is part of football. I accept it. I don&#39;t accept meanness. Probably someone enjoys making it. I want to deserve criticism and praise when there is. Like everyone else, when you play this sport. for the failure to qualify for the World Cup but everyone is responsible
