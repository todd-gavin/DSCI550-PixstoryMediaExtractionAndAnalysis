I have had similar experiences We have been pulled out of our solitude with which we are content and happy offering something more Sometimes we end in disappointment Solitude is something meditative if you aren t carried away in negative thoughts It s a time to reflect and to get immersed in yourself So next time when you pull someone out of their solitude make sure you give them good company
