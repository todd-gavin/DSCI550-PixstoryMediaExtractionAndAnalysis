The Ministry of Home Affairs is holding a high-level meeting to examine and debate the security arrangements in place in Kashmir, among other things. The gathering also included National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Kashmiri officers.

Ajit Doval, the National Security Advisor, is attending a high-level conference at the Ministry of Home Affairs to discuss and examine security arrangements in place in Kashmir, among other topics.

Senior officials from the Ministry of Home Affairs and Jammu & Kashmir were also present at the meeting, in addition to the NSA.

Tensions in New Delhi are high as a result of a series of targeted killings in the Kashmir Valley. The attacks were carried out by hybrid terrorists, according to security forces. These are agents who are not on any terror watch lists but have become radicalised enough to carry out a strike and then return to normalcy.

The situation in Jammu and Kashmir has deteriorated dramatically and violently. Jitendra Singh, the Union Minister, declared last month that Jammu and Kashmir was quickly returning to normal. He claimed that the decades-long terrorism was nearing its end. The police declared Srinagar 'terror-free' in August 2020, but there has been a surge in terror activity in the previous two months, with many targeted killings.

Two terrorists were shot and killed by security personnel in Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir, earlier today. One of the assassinated ultras was engaged in the murder of a bank manager earlier this month in Kulgam.
