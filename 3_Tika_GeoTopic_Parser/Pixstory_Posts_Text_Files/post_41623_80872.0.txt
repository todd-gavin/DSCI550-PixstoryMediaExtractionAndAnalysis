Basque pelota fathered an expansive diaspora of hard-ball sports, including jai alai and hand-pelota. Players carom a tiny, hard-rubber ball off a wall, known as the "frontis," using a racket, stick, gloved hand, basket, or club. On bigger courts, pelota games can be played one-on-one or in teams. Pelota is thought to be derived from the Vulgar Latin term pilotta (ball game). It is a diminutive variant of the term pila, which is connected to the English word pellet and may refer to a hard linen or leather ball stuffed with pilus (fur or hair) or the Latin words for hit or spade.
