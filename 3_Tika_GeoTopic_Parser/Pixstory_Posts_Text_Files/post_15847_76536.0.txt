Introduction
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a multifactorial disease characterized by metabolic abnormalities. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1(PAI-1) is a key factor of the fibrinolysis its expression is elevated in insulin resistance, obesity, and MetS. In addition, an adiponectin produced by adipocytes is also key factor in MetS. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between PAI-1, adiponectin levels in MetS.

Patients and Methods
A total of 379 subjects were analyse in this cross-sectional study. MetS was defined by NCEP ATP-III criteria. Anthropometric, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, PAI-1, and adiponectin were measured.

Results
PAI-1 levels were higher in MetS compared with non-MetS. In addition, adiponectin levels were significantly lower in MetS compared to non-MetS. Furthermore, increased level of PAI-1 corresponds with increase in prevalence of MetS. PAI-1 levels were significantly associated with MetS (OR = 2.51, CI = 1.23 â€“ 5.14; p = 0.039).

Conclusion
PAI-1 increases the risk of MetS. PAI-1 and adiponectin regulation is useful in assesing the presence and severity of MetS. Further pharmacological targeting of PAI-1 studies are necessary for MetS management.
