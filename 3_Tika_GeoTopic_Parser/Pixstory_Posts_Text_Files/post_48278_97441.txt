PCOS and PCOD are essentially the same As such there is no major difference between PCOS and PCOD PCOD Polycystic Ovary Disease is an outdated term used to now define PCOS Polycystic Ovary Syndrome So what is the difference between syndrome and disease A syndrome is a set of specific symptoms whose underlying direct cause is not understood fully However something is called a disease when there is a good understanding of the causative process For example tuberculosis is a disease because there is a fair level of certainty that tuberculosis is caused by a bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis In the case of PCOS the diagnosis of PCOS is done through an understanding of the symptoms of PCOS There is still very limited clarity on what causes these symptoms Poor lifestyle obesity stress and hormonal imbalance are causes of PCOS PCOS is actually very common up to of women of reproductive age have PCOS Having a gap greater than days between periods or experiencing less than periods in a year could be a sign of PCOS or an underlying issue Some others may get regular periods but may be suffering from the symptoms of PCOS while others may not have these symptoms but may have irregular periods Finally stress levels lack of sleep and a poor diet seem to also have a role to play in the onset of PCOS Excess weight and fat deposits can also be another reason behind missed skipped periods or having PCOS There s a higher risk for you to develop PCOS if in case it runs in your family For example if your mother or sister has had it then chances are you might also develop it It is crucial to identify PCOS early on in order to manage the disease so if you think you are having any PCOS symptoms or have been suffering from irregular periods don t hesitate to consult a doctor Pinky Promise also has a robust PCOS symptom checker on its mobile app Sources
