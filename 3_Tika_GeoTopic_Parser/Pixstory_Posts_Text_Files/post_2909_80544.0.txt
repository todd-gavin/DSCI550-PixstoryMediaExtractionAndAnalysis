According to recent figures by the World Health Organization (WHO) the number of infections in Africa could be seven times higher than official data suggests of various countries, and deaths could because of the virus could be two to three times higher. (https://www.trtworld.com/life/who-africa-covid-cases-could-be-7x-higher-than-reported-latest-updates-54595) This is another reason why Africa is among the least-affected continents by COVID going by the official figures.

That all seems to be in the past. The WHO has some good news for the continent. If current trends continue, the continent can control the pandemic in 2022. 

According to the WHO, the reason for this optimism is that countries are doing a good job. “Over the past two years, the African continent has gotten smarter, faster and better at responding to each new surge in cases of COVID-19,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.

It’s a different matter that this is in sharp contrast to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus saying that the pandemic is not over and that it is premature for countries to think that the end might be imminent.

Although Covid-19 vaccine supplies to Africa have risen in recent months, the continent has not been able to reach enough people. According to official figures, only 11% of the population fully vaccinated in the whole continent. (https://www.afro.who.int/news/africa-needs-ramp-covid-19-vaccination-six-fold) The first case of covid-19 was detected in Africa on February 14th, 2020, and in the last two years, more than 11 million people have been tested positive on the continent, and more than 242,000 have died.
