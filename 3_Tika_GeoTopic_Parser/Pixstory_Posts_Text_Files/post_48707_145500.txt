There is no question that LGBTQ representation is important in Disney movies and TV shows Not only should it provide an accurate portrayal of the LGBTQ community but it also helps to normalize these relationships for children This can help remove some of the stigma associated with being LGBTQ and make it easier for them to come out later on in life Some might argue that Disney already features a diverse range of characters within its storylines so why bother adding LBGTQ characters Well there are a few reasons why this is important For one thing many young people don t see themselves represented accurately in popular culture they need positive role models to look up to Secondly many kids who are LGTBQ may feel isolation or loneliness because they don t identify as completely straight or completely gay Having mainstream media representations of those experiences can be very therapeutic especially if those representations happen during childhood adolescence when memories are still fresh So what specific examples do we have from Disney s recent history of inclusive content Not many All across Hollywood studios LGBTQ representation is slowly but surely starting to change for the better thanks to pressure from allies and LGBTQ groups If Disney could take some simple steps toward correcting these issues now instead of waiting until public outrage forces them into action later on Well that would be pretty great
