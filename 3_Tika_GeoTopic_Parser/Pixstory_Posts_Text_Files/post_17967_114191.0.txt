Director Amy Heckerling’s cult 1995 chick flick Clueless has inspired many a fancy dress costume. But, the fact remains that the preppy style of lead characters Cher Horowitz, her best pal Dionne and high school newcomer Tai needn’t be limited to themed occasions. 

Tessa Thompson and Natalie Portman paid tribute to the classic at the press junket for Thor: Love and Thunder. Before appearing on the red carpet, wearing Oscar de la Renta and Dior, respectively, the co-stars channeled Dionne and Cher. 

Portman sported Cher’s signature yellow and black checked separates, comprising a skirt and jacket from Dior. Rather than wearing knee-high white socks and heels as seen in the film, she completed her look with Doc Marten boots. Thompson assumed the role of Dionne, and wore a puffball skirt and a white shirt layered beneath a black top, with black tights and patent slingbacks.
