When high achieving students from rural areas go off to college and graduate they often choose to live in suburban or urban areas instead rural communities like the ones where they grew up decades of research have shown Often they are following the advice of adults or just deciding on their own to search for success in cities where career opportunities are more abundant Teachers coaches and neighbors might reinforce the message to leave behind the small town life and its limited career opportunities But that long standing pattern might be changing Some rural communities are beginning to see their college graduates return I am a researcher who studies higher education and rural communities and my colleagues and I wondered what might be leading adults to return to rural communities a decade or two after they graduate from college elsewhere To find out what might be prompting some college graduates to return to their rural hometowns later in life we conducted a study using national data on the well being of adolescents into adulthood to look at why people who grew up in rural places decided to return Specifically we took a look at whether their middle and high school experiences had any connection to their decision to return home in their late s or early s We considered only those individuals who had gone at least miles away to complete a bachelor s degree We found three factors that contributed to college graduates coming back home Tight knit school communities We found that the more students enjoyed school and felt as if they belonged the more likely these college educated adults from rural areas returned home Fewer people and more land College educated people from smaller towns or open undeveloped land were twice as likely to return home as people who grew up in slightly larger rural towns Read full story at The Conversation Imagery
