If we take strikers from 2001 for Chelsea then we have a list of many finest strikers Chelsea acquired, and during that time a new era started for Chelsea as Russian Billionaire Roman Abramovich bought the club and heralded a new system at the club.
Chelsea were in a financial mess at that time and Abramovich came as a ray of light who lifted the club from all the debts and made them a competing club once again. Many new managers came and gone likewise with players. They shelled out hundred million pound to bring big names to club and we have surely witnessed many.
Below we take a look at those top 10 strikers who joined the club 2001.


10 Alvaro Morata
Chelsea made a record signing in order to sign Morata, and the Spaniard has made an immediate impact at his new club. He was good enough that he was in a debate with the Premier League's top strikers, Morata had many admirable traits, such as pace, strength, and ability to win aerial duels.
That made him a top - notch player for Chelsea, and he scored 20 goals in his first season with the club. He became the first player in their history to score a hattrick in the shortest amount of time, but injuries limited his playing time and he was eventually replaced by Giroud. He left the club with 24 goals and 74 appearances under his belt.


9 Demba Ba
With Drogba and Torres struggling to find their shape in the Premier League, Chelsea signed Ba as a partial substitute, and the deal from Newcastle United was well worth it. Although he was only a temporary striker, Ba scored many memorable goals, one of which was against Liverpool, when Gerrard slipped and Ba took the loose ball and scored, effectively ending Merseyside's title hopes. In 51 games for Chelsea, he scored 14 goals.
