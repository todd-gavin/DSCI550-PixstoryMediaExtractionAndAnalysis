Hello Everyone!
So it happened a few days back that there was some technical issue with a blue line...I think most of you are aware as it was all over the news...so that day my first time experience in DTC Bus was more than what I expected...The conductor was a nice person as he told me where I can get ticket in a bus (I didn't know how to)...you know that pink ticket(free one ðŸ˜œ). And as I was first time travelling there so he also stopped me from getting off bus on wrong stop, if it had happened, I would have got so confused... So I would say it was much better as I got a seat too...
That's it
