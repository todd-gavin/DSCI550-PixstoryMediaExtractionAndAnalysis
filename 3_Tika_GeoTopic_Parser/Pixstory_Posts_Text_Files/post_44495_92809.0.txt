Nothing went quite to plan at the Bridge for Chelsea earlier this week. They were beaten
comprehensively by a Karim Benzema-led Real Madrid team. Then on, things only get
progressively worse for the Blues.

Ahead of their trip to Southampton on Sunday, Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel confirmed
injuries to two crucial players.

"He's injured [Lukaku]. Azpilicueta unfortunately has a positive Covid test," Tuchel told
Premier League Productions.

Romelu Lukaku will likely sit out the next premier league fixture, and the trip to the Bernab√©u
next week as a precaution. He came on as a second half substitute in the first leg, evidently
changing the dynamic of Chelsea's final third play. With a target man now lurking on the
shoulders of the two Madrid centre back's, the home team were comfortable just whipping
balls into his vicinity.

The Belgian forward squandered two headers on the night. Captain Cesar Azpilicueta tested
positive for Covid-19 and will remain out of action until two successive negative tests have
been recorded. The Spaniard too came on as a fourth defender against Real, forcing Thibaut
Courtois into an exceptional diving save.

This is a huge blow for Chelsea, not just for Madrid. Their next premier league fixture is of
vital importance, and bouncing back from defeat to Brentford will help them stay in the hunt
for Top 3. Tuchel also expressed his anger and frustration following the defeat.

"I watched the Real Madrid game again at home and I got angry in the middle of the night,
then the next morning I watched it again, and I got angry again. I needed a lot of chocolate
to compensate."

The German is known to play such mind games with his opponents ahead of crucial ties.
Surely he's got a plan up his sleeve for Tuesday's game. One that doesn't involve Lukaku or
Azpilicueta.
