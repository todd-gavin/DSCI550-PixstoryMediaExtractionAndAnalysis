While I get your point I think it s still pretty pointless Every school has phones for emergencies teachers have phones for that I think allowing phones would be okay as long as there are enough restrictions on them Like for example submitting them before entering the school or the classroom so you can have them when you re out of the protection of the school Otherwise it s just distracting Both for teachers and the students Teaching is a hard job as is handling a handful of children at the same time whilr trying to educate them is not easy and on top of that you have kids trying to play games or watching movies in class It s super distracting and I think there s no real need for that
