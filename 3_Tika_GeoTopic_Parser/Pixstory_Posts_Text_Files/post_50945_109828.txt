Photo Editing Apps Lightroom I love Lightroom for editing my photos but it s also how I get photos from my computer onto my phone Snapseed I sometimes use Snapseed to edit my photos some They have a selection tool which allows you to brighten up etc specific areas of your photo without editing the entire photo VSCO This app is great if you want to add specific filters to your photos and create a cohesive feed It s just like having a preset for your photos PicTapGo I use it to intensify colors but it also has some fun filters as well Facetune Facetune definitely gets a bad rap but it s really great for brightening whitening up your photos Unfold Unfold is similar to Canva in the way that you can easily upload your photos and text into already created collages and you re ready to upload them to your story Lightroom To edit the colours in the photo and applying presets
