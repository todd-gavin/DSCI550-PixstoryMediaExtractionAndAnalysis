I was never a person who shops online especially clothes I tried several online shopping platforms like myntra etc Myntra really disappointed me in many ways But then one fine day I came across an app called URBANIC After that Urbanic has always been my first choice for shopping online The fabric of their product is superb They are absolutely versatile amp have got tons of options for women I recently bought this grey top which is my favourite in the recent times Urbanic is a pocket friendly platform They never really run out of discounts coupons etc You ll get many good clothing items in a really Reasonable price Go and check it out and if you have already tried it out let me know in the notes section how was your first experience For new users you can go and download the app Link is attached below
