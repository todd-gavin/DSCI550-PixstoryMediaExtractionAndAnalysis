Juventus are getting closer to reaching an agreement with Valencia regarding the potential loan deal for Arthur.
The Brazilian international’s future seems to be further away from Turin despite having a contract until 2025. Arthur struggled to get regular playing time last season and things are unlikely to change with Massimiliano Allegri at the helm.
Heading into the World Cup year, the midfielder will be looking for regular playing time to get into the Brazil squad. Despite his struggle so far with Juve, Arthur still has some suitors, notably Valencia.
According to La Gazzetta dello Sport(via Juventusnews24), Los Che are currently the only side seriously in talks with Juve for the ex-Barcelona man.
Both parties are yet to strike a deal but it seems that an agreement is getting closer each passing day. The deal will be a dry loan deal as Valencia can’t afford to pay any transfer fee at the moment.
