Three years ago, in 2019, I along with my friends went to a food festival in Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium by the name of Zomaland. We went there because one of us was playing on one of the stages over there with another artist and we wanted to show our support (also the other artist told us she’d by us drinks if we came to see them).

It was a daylight slot for the two of them. We stood there in the pleasant November sun, literally the only two people in the audience. We sang along to the pop covers. We were the best audience one could ask for. Sadly, the singer our friend was playing with was not the best singer you could ask for. As soon as they finished playing, the two of us bolted from there while they packed their stuff. We couldn’t bare to face them Immediately after the travesty of a vocal performance that we’d witnessed.

We ended up going through the food stalls present at the festival. I’ve always been a huge fan of a good burger. Just the sight of a good looking burger can put me in a good mood. My friend and I separated as he wanted kebabs and I spotted a decent burger joint. I sat alone in the seating area in-front of the stall and waited for my food. Then came, the best burger ever.

I almost had tears after savouring my first bite. That burger was a piece of food heaven that I’d been granted access to. I ordered another. Pure delight. I then went back at dinner time to the same place and had a third burger. Just as good, if not better. Only one small problem. I didn’t note down the name of the place.

Since then, I’ve been on a personal quest to find a burger as good as that. Maybe that place closed down? I don’t know. But yesterday, I stumbled upon a place just as good.

Louis Burger. They make gourmet burgers and have chains all over the country. Try it out. Let me know.
I’ve found love again.
