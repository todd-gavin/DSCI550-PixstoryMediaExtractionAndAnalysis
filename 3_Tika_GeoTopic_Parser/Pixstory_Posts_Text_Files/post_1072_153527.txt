Leo Messi I never set out to be the best player in history I think I m just another player On the pitch we are all the same and when the game starts I always try to improve myself Messi My intention is that when I retire I will be remembered for being a good person not as a good player Messi I m counting days for the World Cup there is a little anxiety and nerves of wanting it to be already I don t think Argentina are top favorites because there are some teams who are above us but we will fight against anyone Messi I never think about what happened or what I achieved I m always looking forward I think about what s coming what can we become in the opportunity we have and what it would be in the future Messi When we won Copa Am rica I couldn t believe it I didn t know how to explain it but it was like saying That s it what I needed was given it was one of the goals I needed to try to close everything Messi If I weren t I would always have the thorn of the lost finals of not having been able to consecrate myself with Argentina and at that moment in that image in which you see me kneeling I thought It is done Messi Becoming a coach I don t really intend to be a coach but Zidane said exactly that and after that he became a coach and won the Champions League times Messi I would like to be the sporting director of a club to build a team to accompany the coaches but I m not sure about that
