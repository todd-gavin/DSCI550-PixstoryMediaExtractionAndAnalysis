As the National Ball Association celebrates its anniversary with the top 76 players of all time, some are lamenting at the list’s shortcomings – best documented by NBA reporter Billy Reinhardt’s tweet: Dwight Howard “should be here, man.”

There’s been a lot of controversy around NBA All-Star and Lakers champion Dwight Howard’s exclusion from the list – with some disagreeing with the judging panel, while others discussing the excluded players' reactions.

“I can’t go back and do anything right now.. But at the time, I was kinda bitter to hear that I wasn’t on that list,” Dwight Howard told the Athletic last year.

Howard also entertained the possibility of miscommunication, while referring to his stats, and citing how he’s the youngest player to reach up to 9,000 rebounds.

“You hear people say, ‘He was only dominant for a couple of years.’ I didn’t know eight years of being an All-Star, being dominant for eight years, was a couple of years.. I didn’t know winning three Defensive Player of the Year awards in a row, and it should’ve been four, is something that is considered not good,” Howard said. 

Some people believe that Howard’s exclusion has to do with his attitude, which may have caused some friction between the voters throughout the player’s career.

“You look at him right now, he’s a sub… He comes in, he adds some energy, plays some defense. But if you go back to in his prime when the world revolved around him and teams have to account for him before they account for anything else because he’s such a presence on the inside. Everyone had to adjust for that. The game has changed so much,” Howard’s former general manager told the New York Times.

What are your thoughts? Do you agree that the list should include a player’s attitude, or should it be based solely on their performance in the court? Is there something else at play here? Dare to dissent by challenging this post!
