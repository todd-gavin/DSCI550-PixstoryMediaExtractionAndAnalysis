Security researchers predict that a kind of darknet structure could emerge there, similar to today’s Internet. The machinations of the cyber gangsters could even take place in protected rooms that can only be reached from a specific physical location and via valid authentication tokens. This would make their underground marketplaces inaccessible to law enforcement agencies. In fact, it could be years before the police can operate effectively in the metaverse. We often hear about some MNC having a data breach. Metaverse will be storing more than your email addresses and passwords. It will store your behaviors too. With a huge data mine, the technology needs to ensure information privacy and personal data security for every user. This will require new security strategies because the darkverse will become the go-to place for conducting illegal/criminal activities because it will be difficult to trace, monitor, and infiltrate by law enforcement. In fact, it may be years before the police catch up.
The researchers warn that the Darkverse could become a platform for cyber threats, including:
Attackers target non-fungible tokens (NFTs), an increasingly popular means of defining property in the metaverse, for phishing, ransomware, fraud, and other attacks.
Criminals use the metaverse to launder money using overpriced virtual real estate and NFTs.
Criminal and state actors create manipulative narratives that reach vulnerable and receptive groups. Social engineering, propaganda, and fake news have profound implications in a cyber-physical world.
Privacy is redefined. Operators of metaverse-like rooms have unprecedented insight into the actions of the users. Privacy as we know it no longer exists there.
