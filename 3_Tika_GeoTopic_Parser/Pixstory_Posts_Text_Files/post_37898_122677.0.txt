Lionel Messi announced his return to club football with a delicious double that included a magnificent bicycle kick. The Argentine was the star of the show as Paris Saint Germain began their Ligue 1 title defence with a 5-0 win over Clermont Foot. 

The away side were without the services of French sensation Kylian Mbappe. However, this did not stop PSG from dominating the stats as they had thrice the number of shots as Clermont. 

Neymar opened the scoring in the 9th minute courtesy of a Lionel Messi assist. The Brazilian then provided key assists to  Hakimi, Marquinhos, and Messi as he recorded a goal and 3 assists in the first game of the season. 

Having already dismantled Clermont's hopes, PSG were not done with a 4-0 scoreline. A searching pass from Leandro Parades found Lionel Messi's run into the box. The PSG #30 first controlled the ball with his chest before unleashing a magical overhead kick to award PSG a crucial 5-0 away win. 

Lionel Messi and Neymar's performances would certainly boost the team's confidence as both the players underperformed in the last season. With Kylian Mbappe set to return from his injury soon, things can only improve for PSG in the 2022/23 season from here on.
