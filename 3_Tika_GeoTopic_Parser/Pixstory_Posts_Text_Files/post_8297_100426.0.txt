Coach Monty Williams was very emotional after his Phoenix Suns lost in the 2021 NBA Finals, and that self-pity continued for about two weeks as he relaxed in his offseason country home in Texas. Then, suddenly, another emotion hit the man of strong Christian faith.

Embarrassment.

“I was so selfish the way that I thought about it. I felt like we deserved to win,” Williams told Andscape last month. “And it had to be the Lord just taking me through this quick process of ‘Look at all the things that have happened. It’s selfish for you to think you have a right to win. You should be thankful for everything that’s happened here in Phoenix. The guys you get to coach, the people you’ve met, the money you make. And for a short period of time, you guys are in the NBA Finals. Are you kidding me?’

“And I didn’t really get to that point until I got back to Texas and everything kind of settled down. Our house is out in the country. I had a lot of time to think and pray. I became way more aware of my hypocrisy. Here I am again, this reputation for all this stuff, and here I am internally feeling like I deserve something. It took me about a week or two to get to that point where I was like, man, I should be way more grateful and thankful than I am right now.”

The reigning Western Conference champion Suns failed to close out the Dallas Mavericks during a 113-86 Game 6 loss in Dallas on Thursday night, and Phoenix’s title aspirations are on the line Sunday as they face superstar Luka Doncic and the visiting Mavs in a deciding Game 7.

“We just did not have the focus and determination that it takes to win a game like this on the road, but we will have it the next time we step on the floor,” Williams said after Game 6.
