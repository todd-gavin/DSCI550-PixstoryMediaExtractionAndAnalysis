Shane Warne, Australia cricket legend, died aged 52 on Friday.

For Australian cricket, this is the second devastating news in 24 hours with fellow great, Rod Marsh, also dying on Friday having suffered a major heart attack last week.

Affectionately known as ‘Warnie’, he made his Test debut at the SCG in 1992 and immediately gained international fame with the ball of century, one to remember for ages for cricket fans around the world.
