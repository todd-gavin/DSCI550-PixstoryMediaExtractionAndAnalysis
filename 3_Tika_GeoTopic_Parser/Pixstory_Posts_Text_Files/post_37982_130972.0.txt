With thr third gameweek now past us, here are the 3 major talking points from the weekend:


1) Man United pull off a major win against Liverpool! 

The Red Devils got their first points of the season as they beat Liverpool 2-1 at Old Trafford. With Ronaldo benched, Rashford and Sancho stepped up to pile misery on Jurgen Klopp's winless start after 3 games. It has to be seen if Ten Hag's team could build a winning streak over the next week. 




2) Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur get 3 points! 

The North London rivals had a successful weekend as Arsenal beat Bournemouth 3-0 and the Spurs win Wolves 1-0 to add to their magnificient starts. Arsenal have won their opening 3 games and are now the only team with a 100% record in the PL.




3) Chelsea, Man City drop crucial points! 

Chelsea lost 3-0 to Leeds and Man City drew 3-3 with Newcastle United as the two clubs lost ground on the pace setters Arsenal. City had a comeback of sorts as they were trailing 3-1 in the 54th minute. Thomas Tuchel's side on the other hand had a dissapointing outing at Elland Road.





4) What's wrong with Leicester City? 

The Foxes have had a miserable start that have seen them pick up just 1 point from 3 games. LCFC have lost points after leading their games against Brentford and Southampton. With multiple players out and none signed yet, Leicester could face a tough time this season if they fail to find their touch in the coming weeks!
