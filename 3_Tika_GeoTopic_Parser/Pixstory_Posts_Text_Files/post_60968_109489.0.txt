Chandelier always intrigues me because it is such intricate work and the work really shines when paired with the lightbulbs. Looking at this masterpiece always makes me wonder how they are made, how much time it takes to make these, and they look so heavy. What if it falls from the ceiling (one of my greatest fears growing up). But above all, this art attracts me like a moth to a flame. It's a beauty.
