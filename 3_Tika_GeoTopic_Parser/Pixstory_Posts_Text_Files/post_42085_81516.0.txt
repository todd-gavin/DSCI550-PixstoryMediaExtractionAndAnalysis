‘Greatness is not in doing great deeds. Greatness is in doing small things with immeasurable love’. History bears witness to the fact that one who gives is the one who gathers. But why restrain our compassion only for each other?
How many of us diligently store water and grains for the parched birds out in the air? Did we do our bit in ensuring the street dogs do not shiver in the chilling winds? If not now, then when? If not us, then who?
Compassion begins with us. The bright side is that it also ends with us.
