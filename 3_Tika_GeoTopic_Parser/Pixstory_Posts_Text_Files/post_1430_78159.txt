Do you think companies owe the public something Or are they merely profit making ventures That s the question at the heart of the latest brouhaha with Spotify Here are the basic facts Spotify has a contract with Joe Rogan beloved by many young American men if you re wondering where you ve heard that name before He is actually the most popular podcaster on Spotify although he is not exactly uncontroversial For instance he has expressed transphobic views about MMA fighter Fallon Fox a trans woman describing her as a man He has invited right wing conspiracy theorists on his show including people who described the Sandy Hook school shooting in America as a hoax But the issue at hand and the cause of the current backlash to Spotify is his stance on COVID He frequently invites anti vaxxers to guest on his shows and has claimed that vaccines cause adverse reactions As a person who shapes taste according to the New York Times there can be no doubt that he has an outsize influence on many people s medical decisions including whether or not they get vaccinated If Spotify continues to platform Joe Rogan with minimal interference or editing of his content he has stated that they never asked him to change anything unlike YouTube which has stricter policies on misinformation then they are DIRECTLY responsible for propagation of harmful information on the pandemic which will lead to loss of life They pay for exclusive rights to his show which means they are seeking it out specifically and do have responsibility for it Conversely you can make the case that they are not in the business of promoting the public good Rogan makes million a year for Spotify not exactly a small amount If they lose Rogan they would have to rethink their investment in podcasting a grievous blow to Spotify because it s betting a lot of money on podcasting in general It s as clear cut a case of profits vs people as you can imagine What do you think
