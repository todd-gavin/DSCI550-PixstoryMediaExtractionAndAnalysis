My hair makes me feel beautiful ! I know how difficult it is to take care of our hair . Our hair is influenced by the weather , our diet , lifestyle , and many other factors ! ✅💇‍♀️
But these are certain mistakes we make during our hair care ! Let's discuss some ; ✅
❌Never washing /cleansing your styling tools : When was the last time you thoroughly cleaned and soaked your brush ? After a while , your brush , flat iron , curling wand , etc . build up an arsenal of germs , dead hair , and excess product . Continuing to use the products while they are dirty can lead to oily hair and aren’t good for the overall health of your hair !
❌Not using microfiber hair towels and silk pillowcases : Don’t dry your hair with a cotton towel after the shower , always use a microfiber hair wrap or other non-damaging hair towels . Also , don’t sleep with a cotton pillowcase ! Sleep with either a silk pillowcase or a silk bonnet . Cotton towels and pillowcases can cause breakage and damage to your hair !
❌Rinsing your hair with hot water in the shower : This can cause so much damage ! Rinse with cold / lukewarm water always ! It is a myth that hot water rinse can help add softness to the hair . Rather , the fact is it can strip your hair of its essential oils and moisture that can leave your hairs all frizzy and dry to put it precisely .
❌ Using the Same Products Year-Round : You should be changing up the products you use depending on the weather and seasons . During the summer you may need products that cleanse more from the increased sweating and oils, but in the winter you probably need products that will moisturize and help tame frizz . If you’re using the same products year round , your hair most likely isn’t getting what it needs to thrive !
