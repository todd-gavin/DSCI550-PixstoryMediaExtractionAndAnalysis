A universal donor is a person who can donate blood to any recipient of any blood group. 

In some emergencies, donors with the same blood group as the patient may not be available. In such cases, a person with group O, specifically O negative, can donate blood to the patient. This blood group barely causes any reactions to the recipient and is called a universal donor blood group.

Ideally, blood transfusions are done with donated blood that's an exact match for type and Rh factor. Even then, small samples of the recipient's and donor's blood are mixed to check compatibility in a process known as crossmatching.

Although people with an O blood type are commonly known as universal blood donors, people with O- (negative) blood type are the true universal donors. It is because their red blood cells do not carry antigens. So, they can donate blood to any other blood group. A person with blood group O+ (positive cells) cannot give blood to an Rh-negative individual.
