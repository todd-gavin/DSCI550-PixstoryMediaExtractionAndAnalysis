Tottenham Hotspur have set their sights on a move for Nottingham Forest loan man Djed Spence Matt Law has revealed on his personal Twitter account th February that Spurs are watching Spence and have been monitoring him for a long time The year old has become a key player for Forest this season and has particularly impressed in the FA Cup He scored in the win over Leicester City and was superb in the win over Arsenal as Forest continue their fine run of form However he isn t Forest s player and he is currently on loan from Middlesbrough which is very interesting because both sides are pushing for promotion However if I were to guess I would say that no matter what happens Spence will be in the Premier League next season He has been a standout player in the Championship since Steve Cooper replaced Chris Hughton at the City Ground and you would think at least one PL team will make a suitable offer The big question is will that be Spurs Well Spence has played times this season as a right wing back which would suit Antonio Conte s favoured system transfermarkt Now he is currently playing Emerson Royal there but Spence could prove to be the perfect competition that Conte wants in his squad He is also young and could develop huge sell on value if Tottenham take the gamble and splash out on him It has been reported that Boro are looking for million which Spurs should be able to easily afford and I would love to see what Conte could do with him ESPN Spence already has the physical and technical attributes to go very far and Conte could turn him into a weapon This might not be the most eye catching transfer but it makes a lot of sense and Spurs should be all over this in the summer
