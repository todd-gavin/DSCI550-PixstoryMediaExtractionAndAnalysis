The Republican party in Texas has taken a series of extreme right positions including claims such as Joe Biden was not legitimately elected and homosexuality is abnormal In its biennial convention in Houston delegates voted to oppose all actions to validate transgender identity including the use of taxpayer funds for any medical gender dysphoria treatments or sex change operations It s a shame that in this st century the anti trans and anti gay declarations are part of the state party s new guiding principles this contradicts their claims to be more inclusive Their plans stand in opposition to giving special legal status to gay men or women while favoring those who oppose homosexuality based on faith religion or a belief in traditional values Military personnel prison inmates and young people striving with body dysmorphia and gender identity issues seem as groups who should not receive care and treatment This stands against Biden s recent executive order made to defend the LGBTQ community from a wave of state laws in Republican states such as Texas that deter access to health care resources and prohibit the discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in schools Overall the new platform gives more indication of Texas Republicans moving remote to the extreme right Republicans who govern the legislature governor s mansion and every statewide office have used their power to push through some regressive laws in recent months including anti abortion anti LGBTQ anti migrant and anti voting rights legislation Source The Guardian
