While topped flatbreads were consumed in ancient Egypt and Rome, Italians are credited as the people who invented pizza first. During the 1700s and 1800s, Naples was a bustling waterfront city especially near the shore, where overcrowding and primarily outdoor living forced locals to find quick, easy ways to feed their families. Pizza became a common dish because of its limited ingredients and handy portability, but it was considered a street food for the poor, unsuitable for the upper class. 
Little did they know how this seemingly simple creation would turn into a global phenomenon.
