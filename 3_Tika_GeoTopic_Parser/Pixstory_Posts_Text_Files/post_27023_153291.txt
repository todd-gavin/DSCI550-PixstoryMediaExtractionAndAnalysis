Anxiety and depressive disorders are moderately heritable approximately and evidence suggests shared genetic risk across the internalizing disorders Among internalizing disorders the highest level of shared genetic risk appears to be between major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder Neuroticism is a personality trait or temperamental characteristic that is associated with the development of both anxiety and depression and the genetic risk for developing neuroticism also appears to be shared with that of the internalizing disorders Common nongenetic risk factors associated with the development of anxiety and depression include earlier life adversity such as trauma or neglect as well as parenting style and current stress exposure At the level of neural circuits alterations in prefrontal limbic pathways that mediate emotion regulatory processes are common to anxiety and depressive disorders These findings are consistent with meta analyses that reveal shared structural and functional brain alterations across various psychiatric illnesses including anxiety and major depression in circuits involving emotion regulation executive function and cognitive control Anxiety disorders and major depression occur during development with anxiety disorders commonly beginning during preadolescence and early adolescence and major depression tending to emerge during adolescence and early to mid adulthood In relation to the evolution of their comorbidity studies demonstrate that anxiety disorders generally precede the presentation of major depressive disorder
