Alfredo Di Stefano – 18 goals

In 1953, Di Stefano left Millonaros for Real Madrid. In his debut El Clasico, he scored twice, the opening and closing goals in a 5-0 victory.

Although Di Stefano never scored a hat-trick against Barcelona, he did score four braces against them in 1953, 1960, 1960, and 1962. With 216 goals, the Argentine is third on the all-time list of Madrid goal scorers.

Di Stefano died in July 2014 of a heart attack at the age of 88.


Karim Benzema – 11 goals

In 2009, Benzema moved to Real Madrid from Lyon. It took him three seasons, however, to score his first El Clasico goal in the Super Copa in August 2011. He assisted Ronaldo's goal, which negated Andres Iniesta's opener, and scored to equalise Lionel Messi's goal.

The French international's only brace against Barcelona came in a nail-biting 4-3 home defeat in March 2014. Benzema's last Clasico goal came in the Super Copa semi-finals in January 2022, which his team won 3-2 after extra time. He also contributed an assist during the game.


Luis Suarez – 11 goals

Suarez eventually scored his first El Clasico goal in a 2-1 home win over Real Madrid in March of 2015. He followed it up the following season with two more goals in a 4-0 away win.

In a 5-1 win over Real Madrid in October 2018, he scored his first and only Clasico hat trick. Suarez last scored against Real Madrid in February 2019, when he scored twice in the second leg of the Copa Del Rey semi-finals.

Suarez is currently a member of Atletico Madrid.
