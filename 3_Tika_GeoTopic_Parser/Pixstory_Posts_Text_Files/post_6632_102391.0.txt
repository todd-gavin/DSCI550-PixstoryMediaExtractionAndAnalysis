A video shot during a procession where people can be seen celebrating the victory of a newly-elected Panchayat Samiti member in Jharkhand’s Hazaribagh is widely circulating on social media. Several BJP members of the state alleged that pro-Pakistan slogans were raised in this rally. This was also reported by multiple mainstream media outlets and an FIR was registered against 62 people, out of which 12 people have been named.

Deepak Prakash, the state president of BJP Jharkhand, shared the video on Twitter and wrote, “When the Chief Minister of Jharkhand has a problem with the slogan “Bharat Mata ki Jai”, there will be slogans of “Pakistan Zindabad” in the state”. He also made a xenophobic remark in his tweet.

Media outlets The Times of India, Republic, The Hindu, Times Now, Business Standard, and Scroll reported on the incident. Pro-BJP propaganda website OpIndia also ran similar stories. It is important to note that Business Standard and The Hindu have attributed their report to PTI.

Many of these media outlets also stated that similar slogans were raised in Giridih last month, after which the police arrested a mukhiya candidate and two of his supporters. Alt News has already debunked this claim. The report can be read here.
