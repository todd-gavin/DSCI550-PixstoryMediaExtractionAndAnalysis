Mysore, a weekend getaway.

Exploring the historical centered city for The Weekend was a very spontaneous decision. 

From its famous Mysuru palace to the Chamundi Devi temple, zoo, Aquarium, karanji lake boating, famous masala dose and mysore pak. We had it all under a day. 

The best and the most surprising thing about Mysuru is that everything is within 10 minutes radius, even if you roamed the entire city, you would still have so much time left. 

It was a very calm and serene city, people were extremely happy-go friendly, and all in all itâ€™s an experience that will leave you pondering of all the wonders in life.
