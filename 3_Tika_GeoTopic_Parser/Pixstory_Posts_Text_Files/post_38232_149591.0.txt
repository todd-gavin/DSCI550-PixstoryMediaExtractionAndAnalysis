Juventus have suffered a slow start to their season under Massimiliano Allegri. But with the January transfer window fast approaching, the Black and White's are looking to add Adama Traore and Christian Pulisic to their attack. 
The Serie A giants are currently eighth in the table. To add to this, Juventus are currently placed third in their UCL group after losing both their opening games to Benfica and PSG. With the club under heavy scrutiny, finishing in the top four would be the bare minimum expected from them at the end of the season. 
As per Sportskeeda, "Adama Traore is being targeted by Juventus due to his physical attributes, while also injecting some much-needed pace into the wings. They are also looking at Chelsea forward Christian Pulisic in an attempt to bolster their frontline." 
Dusan Vlahovic was brought in last season in order to bolster the attack after the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo. However, the Serbian has failed to make a huge impact as Juventus have scored just 9 goals in 7 Serie A games. 
Roma, Atalanta, Napoli, AC Milan, and Inter Milan have had a decent start in the Serie A. With almost 1/5th of the season done, Juventus have some catching up to do in order to attain their goal of at least finishing in the top four.
