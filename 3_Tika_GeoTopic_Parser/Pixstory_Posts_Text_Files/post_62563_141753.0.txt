There are a lot of different types of soap available on the market today, so it can be hard to know which one is best for your skin. However, there are a few key ingredients that you should look for when choosing a soap for back acne:
- Salicylic acid: This is one of the main ingredients in most back acne soaps. It helps to break down the oil and grease on your skin, leaving it feeling clean and free from obstruction.
- Calendula extract: This herb has anti-inflammatory properties that help to reduce the inflammation and redness associated with back acne.
- Chamomile extract: Chamomile has been shown to be effective at reducing inflammation and soothing irritated skin.
To find soap that's best for your needs, you need to look for a soap that has ingredients like glycolic acid (and salicylic acid as mentioned above). These acids are responsible for breaking down the grease and soil on your skin, allowing it to be easily removed. Additionally, ask for soaps that are fragrance-free or low in sulfates â€“ these chemicals can cause irritation and dry out your skin.
