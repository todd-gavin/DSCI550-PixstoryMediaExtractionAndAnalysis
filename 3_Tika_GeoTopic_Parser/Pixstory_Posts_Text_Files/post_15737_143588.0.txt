Located in Jewel Changi Airport, Singapore, The Rain Vortex Waterfall stands 40 m high, making it the tallest indoor waterfall of the world.
The waterfall was designed by Safdie Architects, as the centrepiece of the airport, with the goal of making Changi airport an attraction and to encourage Singapore leisure travel. The sculpture is jewel of the airport and Singapore.
The waterfall is surrounded by greeneries, giving visitors the illusion of being transported to a rainforest.
Come night fall, the Rain Vortex will transform into a spectacular Light and Sound show with special lighting effects.
Visually stunning attraction, right?!
