A new obstacle has arisen when it comes to Ben Simmons return to game action for the Brooklyn Nets In addition to working to overcome the mental health issues that have prevented him from playing in a single game this season Simmons is also dealing with some back soreness in his reconditioning process according to Shams Charania of The Athletic Further strengthening of the area will be required before Simmons makes it out on the floor There is still no timetable set for Simmons to make his debut with the Nets but the good news for Brooklyn is that Simmons back issue doesn t seem to be especially serious as Steve Nash categorized it as soreness and described it as a byproduct of the fact that Simmons hasn t played since last season It s not like an injury It s just as he s returning to play his back s flared up a little bit But it s not a long term thing Nash said He hasn t played a game since July June So I think that s just a part of his process in returning to play As you ramp up you re a little bit susceptible to certain things as you would be with muscle soreness or tightness He s having a little tightness with his back In addition to Simmons the Nets have also been without Kevin Durant due to a sprained MCL but his return appears to be right around the corner Along with Durant and Kyrie Irving Simmons projects to be a major factor in whatever success the Nets are able to achieve for the rest of the season so the sooner he can get out on the court to gain some familiarity with his new teammates the better for Brooklyn
