Deforestation, i.e. the process of cutting down trees and reducing the area under green cover is adding to a variety of problems. The loss of trees leads to loss of biodiversity (deforestation destroys the natural habitats of animal species), disruptions in the monsoon cycle, loss of soil fertility, soil erosion, greater volumes of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and extensive damage to the environment in general. All of these problems add to the process of Climate Change, that threatens the very existence of life on earth.
