The Biden administration plans to sell Ukraine four state-of-the-art Gray Eagle drones which can carry more powerful laser guided Hellfire missiles for use against Russian forces, according to an exclusive report filed by Reuters news agency from Washington.  

Ukraineâ€™s forces have until now been using smaller drones with a shorter range such as AeroVironment, Puma AE and the Turkish Bayraktar-TB2 against Russian forces.

The Gray Eagle represents a quantum leap in technology because it can carry a heavier payload of 8 Hellfire missiles that have the capacity to destroy tanks on the ground as well as helicopters and slow moving fixed-wing aircraft in the air. The drone also has the capacity to fly over 30 hours which gives it a longer range.
