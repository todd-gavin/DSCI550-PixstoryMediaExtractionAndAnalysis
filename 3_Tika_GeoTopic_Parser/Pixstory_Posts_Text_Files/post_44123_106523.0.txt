Real Madrid has announced the signing of highly rated France midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni
from AS Monaco on a six-year deal. After beating off competition from European competitors,
the Champions League winners have agreed to pay a transfer price of roughly â‚¬80 million to
sign Tchouameni, 22.

According to ESPN, Madrid and Monaco reached an agreement on the transfer on Tuesday,
with the midfielder choosing Madrid over Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain. On Tuesday, the
midfielder will have his medical at the club, followed by a press conference.

Tchouameni, along with Federico Valverde (23) and Eduardo Camavinga, is considered by
Madrid as a long-term alternative for Casemiro, 30, and will become part of a new midfield
generation at the Bernabeu (19).

Madrid have been busy planning for the summer transfer window despite being turned down by
top target Kylian Mbappe, who decided to sign a new three-year contract with PSG in a
last-minute change of heart.

In addition to Tchouameni, they have finalised the free transfer of Germany defender Antonio
Rudiger from Chelsea.

In January, ESPN reported that Madrid was considering options to reinvigorate their midfield,
with Tchouameni being the most prominent possibility. Juni Calafat, Madrid's head scout,
travelled to Monaco that month to lay the groundwork for a future transfer.

While Madrid had reached an agreement with the player, their transaction with Monaco was
stalled due to Spain's categorization of Monaco as a tax haven, requiring the Ligue 1 club to pay
a 24 percent tax on the transfer's revenues.

Carlo Ancelotti wants to recruit a new defensive midfielder as soon as possible, and Tchouameni was the frontrunner over Ajax's Ryan Gravenberch.
