On Friday afternoon, a group of Student's Federation of India (SFI) activists vandalised Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's office at Kainatty, close to Kalpetta in the Wayanad district.

The SFI employees were asking that Rahul Gandhi, the local MP of the hilly region of Wayanad, speak out on the recent Supreme Court judgement establishing an eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of one kilometre surrounding all protected areas, wildlife, and national parks.
According to reports, the protesters broke chairs out of the office and assaulted the staff members. For several hours, the situation in the region remained tense, and numerous police officers were stationed there.

Congress workers across Kerala have taken to the streets in protest at the event. Leaders in Congress have harshly denounced the attack.

In the meantime, in response to the reports of the attack, Rahul Gandhi published his letter to the prime minister regarding the ESZ issue on his social media page. Dated June 23, the letter stated.
Rahul claims in the Facebook post that the letter was intended to attract the PM's attention to the situation of the Wayanad local communities, whose way of life will be negatively impacted by the Supreme Court's ruling on the upkeep of ESZ around national parks and animal sanctuaries.
