Italy and Brazil went head to head against each other at the historic Rose Bowl Stadium, Pasadena, California on 18th June 1994 in the final of the 1994 FIFA World Cup which was hosted by the United States of America. It is till date remembered as one of the most thrilling and dramatic finals ever in the history of FIFA World Cup and in this article, we will learn why. 
Roberto Baggio was one of the finest Italian players back in those days and he was also the highest goalscorer of Italy (second highest goalscorer of the tournament) in the 1994 World Cup with 5 goals in 7 matches. Baggio, who was 27 years old at that time and in the prime of his career, was up against another Footballing great Romario of Brazil in the final who was just a year older than him and had the same number of goals in the tournament. It was thus already expected to be a thrilling match. 
Although neither teams were able to score a goal in 90 minutes or in Extra time, it would be wrong to say that it was not an entertaining match as Italy and Brazil had constant to and fro motion between box to box and both sides had their fair share of chances to take the lead. Roberto Baggio himself had a number of beautiful opportunities which he missed by inches.
