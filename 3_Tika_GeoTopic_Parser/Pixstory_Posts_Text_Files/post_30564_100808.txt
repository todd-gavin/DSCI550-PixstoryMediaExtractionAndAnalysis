Curious anecdote told by Raul Bandiera of Real Madrid in an interview with AS The former captain of the Blancos returned with memories of years ago on the occasion of the Champions League final played in Glasgow against Bayer Leverkusen and remembered above all for the incredible goal scored by Zinedine Zidane The other goal Real scored in this match that gave them their ninth European Cup was by Raul himself who recalled The day before the final in Glasgow Iv n Campo kicked me with a kick in training The day of the match I couldn&#39;t even to tie my shoes I told the doctor to do whatever it took to get me on the pitch and play And so an hour before I warmed up the doctor anesthetized my toe and put it to sleep That&#39;s why I kicked so badly I can say I scored a goal in the Champions League Final even with a numb finger
