Rahul Gandhi's son, Congress MLA Arun Vora, has reacted to claims that his father, late Congress politician Motilal Vora, is to blame for the Young Indian-AJL transaction. According to Arun Vora, who spoke to India Today, the allegations are unfounded, and he believes Rahul Gandhi cannot make such accusations against his father.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is questioning Rahul Gandhi in connection with a money-laundering investigation involving the National Herald-Associated Journals Ltd agreement. According to reports, Rahul Gandhi told the ED on Wednesday that Motilal Vora was the authorised signatory for all financial transactions between the AJL and Young Indian Private Ltd, which owns National Herald and is supported by the Congress.

In response, Arun Vora stated, "These are unsubstantiated claims. Voraji, like the Congress leadership, cannot be incorrect."

Arun Vora remarked, "Rahul ji cannot make such claims about my father."

In their testimony to the ED, Congressmen Pawan Bansal and Nitin Gadkari indicated that the arrangement was not made by a single person and that Vora was fundamentally responsible for all financial transactions, according to sources.
