The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has imposed a penalty of Rs 5 lakh on IndiGo for failing to adequately handle the case of a special child at Ranchi airport.

The aviation regulator DGCA on Tuesday warned airlines against offering unserviceable seats to passengers on their domestic and international flights.

Earlier this year, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation had conducted an audit of seats and other cabin fittings in aircraft of airlines, and found that many had broken or unserviceable seats.

In a communique sent to all Indian carriers on Tuesday, the DGCA said that some of the carriers are offering unserviceable seats to passengers on their scheduled international and domestic operations. "This practice is not only causing inconvenience to the travellers but also inviting a serious safety concern as well," the regulator mentioned.
