Sportspersons make the nest ambassadors for sports brand. Meh, common sense. But this was that time when it became a nightmare for the multi-billion company. And well, they were the ones to be blamed.

It was one of those experiences that you had to witness to believe. In the first few minutes of the Duke-UNC game, Zion blew through his Nike Paul George 2.5s with ease. As a result of Zion's knee injury, Nike's stock dropped by more than $1 billion. Nike flew to Durham straight away to create a special shoe for Zion to correct that blunder.

Back in 2019, the incident took place during a game between Duke and North Carolina. When Zion Williamson's 285-pound body and acrobatic agility looked to slash the shoe almost in half, as if severed by a sharp knife. Barack Obama pointed out saying "his shoe broke".

Definitely an embarrassing situation for both Williamson and Nike.
