This is an continuation of the article Remembering the Dance FADS where in will we talk about some more dance fads which has left a huge impact because of their unique style.The tango remains one of the most famous, most recognizable, and most taught dances in the world. Although the tango has roots in pre-America, old-world Europe, it emerged in the 1800s as a solo dance performed only by women. Its modern version came to New York City in the early 1900s, but it first became a bona fide craze in 1921 when Rudolph Valentino made it a hit.In Havana around the same time the Mambo was catching on, a new Afro-Cuban dance would emerge called Cuban rumba, it was completely different from the rumba that was trendy in the ballrooms of the United States. The dance, which was long frowned upon as vulgar by high Cuban society, is characterized by African drums and fast, rhythmic lyrics.The word "Mambo" describes a traditional voodoo priestess in Haitian folklore. A dance by the same name originated in Cuba's Haitian community, but contrary to popular belief, the Mambo is not derived from traditional Haitian dance. The Mambo, first publicly performed by Perez Prado at Havana's La Tropicana night club in 1943, it's actually a fusion of Cuban dance music and American swing/jazz dancing. Tango and these styles are known to be some of the best dancing styles that had a great impact on the people through dancing all over the world
