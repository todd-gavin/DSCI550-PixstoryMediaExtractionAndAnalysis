Malaika Arora has stated that married at the age of 25 and having a child has never interfered with her career. She said, "Somewhere, it was an example of sorts for lot of other women".

In Namrata Zakaria’s podcast called Tell Me How You Did It Malaika told "It never was a hindrance. I'm proof of that. Not in any way has it come in the choices that I've made. Being married, or when I was married, or when I decided to have a child, don't think any of it had any bearing on my professional life. People around me had a lot more to say, but it didn't have any bearing on my professional life”.

"I always have this glamorous approach or being a certain way, it has worked in my favour," she added.
