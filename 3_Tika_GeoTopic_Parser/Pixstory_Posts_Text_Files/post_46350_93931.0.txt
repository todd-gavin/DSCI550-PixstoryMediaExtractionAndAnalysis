I still Remember the days of my 12th standard ! I use to be the topper of my class ! yes , im serious ! But You know what ? Sometimes Things does not happen the way you wanted them to be ! And At that point , You could not decide what to do ! 

The same happened with me too ! The results of my pre-board exams were out ! And i was expecting 95% ! and then Boom ! I could not Fare up to my expectations as i scored 79% ! I was so much sad after it ! I didn't gaved up and Tried again and again as Practice exams ! But it was not working , as i was not scoring up to my expectations ! I became so Angry , Frustration Slowly crept into my life ! I was so depressed after it ! And just one single thought in my mind , " Why me ? " I was so disturbed that i couldn't understand that it's just the part of life ! I was totally lost . I thought that I was not meant to be in the 95% !

After months of hardwork , when i gaved my 3rd pre-board exam ! I did it ! The results were out and I topped with 98% ! It was not at all easy !

I learned the biggest life lesson that , Failure is just a part of life !

We should always take Failure as a New opportunity to Do things more perfectly ! 
I don't understand why people commit Suicide because of there failure ? Come on guys ! Life is so precious ! Failure , Depression , Frustration , Anger these all are part of life !

Yes , Its 15th April , The Sucks Day today ! It is observed in United States to Celebrate people's Failure , anger , Sarcasm , Frustration and much more !

Failure is Everywhere , So why Just In United States , Let's Celebrate our Failure where ever we are ! 

Afterall its Just a Part of Life ! ü§ç‚ú®
