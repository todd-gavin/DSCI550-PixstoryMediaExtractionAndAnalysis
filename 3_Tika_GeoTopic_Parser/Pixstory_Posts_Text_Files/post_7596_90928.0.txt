It's World Bipolar Day today and I just got reminded of Silver Linings Playbook by David O. Russell. Silver Linings Playbook is based on the novel of the same name written by Matther Quick. The protagonist of the movie, Pat played by Bradley Cooper is bipolar. The movie was nominated for 8 Oscars and Bradley Cooper also got a nomination. Though only Jennifer Lawrence won from the movie for her amazing acting as Tiffany.
Pat wants to get his life back on track, he doesn't take the medication thats prescribed to him at first and thinks he'll be able to handle his bipolar condition on his own.
The manic episode that he suffers from are realistic but in the movje mostly his outbursts full of anger are shown. Except from these moments of emotional angst, his biopolar self is depicted by his speech pattern and speaking anything he think. His insomnia is another symptom of his bipolar condition.
The one think that helps him on his road to recovery is his friends and family and they're supportive to him throughout his journey.

A psychologist while analysing the movie has appreciated the team behind the movie for how they've shown a bright person with bipolar disorder. 
How Pat is able to realise that he's having a manic episode which cause his delusional state but can't grasp the idea that his wife also suffers from a mental illness. He can't comprehend the consequences that his actions have resulted it at all.
His inability to judge his overreactions is what gives away his facade of keeping himself together. 

While the movie might add some dramatic flair for the purpose of moving the plot forward but it has some aspects to it which provide insight into the life of the people who are diagnosed as bipolar. By the end of the movie, Pat is on the path to recovery, he finally accepts his condition and learns to live with it.
