A white buffalo calf was recently born to the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians. 

The tribe considers the white buffalo to be the most sacred living creature on the planet, and believes the very uncommon animal is a sign that their prayers are being heard. 

According to KFYR, the tribe held a community healing fire and began a Sun Dance during the birth.

“I didn’t believe it. I said I’ll believe it when I see it because we were gifted a white buffalo last year, and just the odds that a calf would be born this year, or at all, are just astronomical,” said TMBCI Tribal Chairman Jamie Azure.
