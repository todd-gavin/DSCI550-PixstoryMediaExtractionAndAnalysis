Former President Donald Trump, in an attempt to portray himself as tough on Russia, downplayed the amount of US military aid granted to Ukraine under the Obama-Biden administration and claimed that only he had not faced a Russian invasion of another country in recent history. This is not the case. 

Meanwhile, according to YahooNews, Trump's vice president, Mike Pence, made the dubious assertion that all of Ukraine's current armaments come from the Trump administration. 

Examining the weekend claims versus reality: 
When comparing military aid under President Donald Trump to that under President Barack Obama, TRUMP says: “I was the one that sent the Javelins, not Obama. Obama sent blankets.” — rally Saturday in Commerce, Georgia.”

Trump and Pence are exaggerating the amount of aid provided by Obama and Biden, while ignoring their own delays in assisting Ukraine.

While the Obama administration refused to equip Ukraine with lethal weapons to combat Russian-backed separatists in 2014, it did offer a variety of other military and security assistance, not simply "blankets." The administration was concerned that supplying lethal weaponry like as Javelin anti-tank missiles might prompt Russian President Vladimir Putin to escalate the fighting in Ukraine's separatist Donbas region, which is close to Russia's border. 

According to the Defense Department, by March 2015, the Obama administration has supplied more than $120 million in security aid to Ukraine and committed $75 million in equipment, including counter-mortar radars, night vision systems, and medical supplies. 230 Humvee vehicles have also been pledged by the United States.
