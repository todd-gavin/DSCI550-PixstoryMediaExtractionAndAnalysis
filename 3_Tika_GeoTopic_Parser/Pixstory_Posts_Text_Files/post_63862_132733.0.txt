Putting out its latest 10 minute gameplay trailer for the upcoming action RPG ‘Forspoken’, Square Enix has given us a much more detailed and deeper look at the magic enhanced combat and parkour mechanics of the game. Focusing on traversal speed and fluidity, the game features a narrative driven adventure with its protagonist Frey having access to a variety of magical abilities that can be upgraded with experience points earned via combat.
“The gameplay trailer follows Frey on a quest from Athian archivist Johedy, as she ventures into the wilds of two corrupted areas, Praenost and Avoalet,” Square Enix said. “The two realms featured in the trailer give players a glimpse of the different enemies they will encounter and showcases the versatility of Frey’s magical combat skills.
“Players can choose to wreak magical havoc on enemies, fighting in a controlled frenzy and unleashing a barrage of quick-fire spells or they can take a more methodical approach wielding powerful and calculated attacks on their adversaries. In ‘Forspoken’, no two fights are ever the same.”
Magic plays a big part of the gameplay as Frey can summon elemental hoverboards to slide on, swing around with giant tethers like Spider-Man, run faster than any human, and jump incredibly high like the Hulk. These moves can be chained together to “flow” through the world with skilled players being able to zip around and unlock treasure chests full of valuable resources or nab mana used for leveling up. Frey can summon different spells from a wheel and flood the screen with different ranged and melee attacks that can lay traps, do area-of-effect damage, manipulate enemies, and more. Originally scheduled to arrive in May 2022, the ‘Forspoken’ release date has pushed back by three and a half months, from October and will arrive on January 24, 2023.
