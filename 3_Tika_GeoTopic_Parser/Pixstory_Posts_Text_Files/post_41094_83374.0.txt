When "Uncharted," a big-budget adaptation of the popular video game, was given a release date in China, Sony officials breathed a sigh of relief. 

Variety reported that the Chinese government, which has complete control over which films are shown in its theatres (and when they are shown), has recently become extremely picky about which non-Chinese films are allowed to be shown in the country's tens of thousands of locations. As a result, many of Hollywood's biggest pandemic-era blockbusters were denied entrance to Chinese theatres, including "Spider-Man: No Way Home," "Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings," and "Eternals." The lack of those films has cost them tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars in box office receipts.

“Getting any blockbuster into China right now feels like a big deal,” says Jeff Bock, a box office analyst with Exhibitor Relations.

However, just because "Uncharted" is due to premiere in China on March 14 does not guarantee that the picture will be a success there. In an alternate world, an action-adventure film like "Uncharted," starring Tom Holland as treasure hunter Nathan Drake from "Spider-Man," might have made a lot of money in China. Instead, it will serve as a crucial test of whether Chinese audiences are interested in Hollywood productions. Recently, the few films that China's censors have permitted have failed to perform well at the box office.
