Ellen van Neerven is one of Australia s most significant rising writers and I know she d be eager to throw off the cloddish label important that we re attempting to drape over her shoulders here As per the Guardian Ellen is a proud Mununjali woman from the Yugambeh language group in south east Queensland and despite her prodigious and rising talent she is one of the most generous and giving writers Heat and Light her debut novel is a stunning collection of linked stories Water the book s centrepiece piece achieved for me what the best writing can do after reading it the world around me changed never to be the same again As Rebecca Slater writes Ellen s poetry is exciting in a way that poetry often struggles to be her poems were recently collected in Comfort Food find yourself a copy and her non fiction published widely explores myriad subjects always with an unsettling background clarion call that causes you to sit up and take notice because something vital is always happening even if you don t quite know what it is Readers everywhere are fortunate that Ellen exists and writers everywhere are even more so
