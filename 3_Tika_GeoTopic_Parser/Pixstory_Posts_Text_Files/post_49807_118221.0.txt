California is a state with the strictest laws on gun control and hence still finds the need for gun control to strengthen safety. 

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a series of gun safety bills into law, ramping up regulations on gun sales and dealers within the state. 

Among the eight laws signed there is a 10-year ban on gun possession for those convicted of child abuse or elder abuse. Another law will require schools to annually provide information to parents about California's child access prevention laws and laws relating to the safe repository of firearms. 

It will also compel school officials to report to law enforcement any "threat or perceived threat of a homicidal act," with law enforcement or school police expected to conduct an investigation and threat assessment.

The push for rigid gun controls comes in the wake of a string of mass shootings across the United States that has once again brought the national debate on gun ownership to the forefront. 

Newsom said in a statement: “These new measures will help keep children safe at school, keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people and responsibly regulate the sale of firearms in our communities," he said, adding: "California will continue to lead on lifesaving policies that provide a model for action by other states and the nation.”

Another measure blocks licensed firearms dealers from charging more than 5% of the purchase price of a firearm as a "restocking or another return-related fee" if the purchase is canceled by the buyer within 10 days of the application, with an exception for special order firearms.
