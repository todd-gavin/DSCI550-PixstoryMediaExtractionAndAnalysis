In relation to the Marmolada tragedy of recent days, the researchers of the Geophysical Glaciological Working Group for research on the Marmolada who have been studying the glacier for twenty years wanted to make their own contribution to understanding the phenomenon Importance of the Marmolada glacier The Marmolada glacier is the most large glacier of the Dolomites and a fundamental thermometer of climate change due to its rapid response even to small variations in rainfall and temperature. The collapse in July affected a residual strip of the central glacier which occupies a small niche close to the summit ridge below Punta a suspended glacier The collapse under study occurred due to a series of conditions whose relative weight is not easy to determine today the strong inclination of the rocky slope the opening of a large crevasse which separated the glacial body into two units the presence of discontinuities at the bottom and on the sides the anomalous increase in temperatures that have influenced the state of the ice the increase in melting with consequent increase in the circulation of water inside the ice which may have triggered an increase in stress on the surfaces of the discontinuity the progressive melting of the front that caused the suspended mass to lack support Before the collapse, no clear signs of an imminent collapse were observed Unlike landslides in glaciers, except in very rare cases, there are no warning systems that measure movements and deformations in real time The crevasses that played a fundamental role in the detachment they had already been visible for several years and in themselves are part of the normal glacial dynamics The detachment of seracs is a frequent phenomenon in glaciers and is part of the normal glacial dynamics. Marmolada Retreat and warming lead to an increase in the frequency of events Glacier retreat is the most evident manifestation of ongoing climate change What is most worrying is the progressive acceleration of glacial retreat which requires a revision of the more optimistic climate scenarios prepared by scientists
