You can anticipate high-level, generic inquiries during an HR round about you, your prior employment history, and your reasons for looking for a new job. Be prepared to answer questions that only briefly mention the duties pertaining to your role while mentioning your skills and aptitudes.
You can expect to be asked about:

What you expect for your salary
Why you’re looking for a new role
Why you’re leaving your current company
What you’re looking for in a new opportunity
How you could function in a new environment
How you’ve functioned in your former environment
How you’ve handled conflict with coworkers
How you’ve handled high-pressure situations

The HR interview can also cover the company’s benefits, work hours, and organizational structure.
