Most women have no idea what will happen when they deliver.  Some may have witnessed a delivery; most will have heard the scream of a woman in labour, so the mother-to-be is very fearful. In urban areas, more expectant mothers are now using antenatal clinics and hospitals to get information and a modern delivery. Often, however, hospitals facilities are only used in difficult cases or when complications occur. Often fear of the unknown will hold women (and her family) back from taking advantage of these services.
The delivery occurs in the presence of the mother’s female relatives and the midwife only. During strong pains the patient and the midwife will call upon God for help. Other practices may include placing the women’s hand in a bowl of flour when the delivery is near. This or bread is then given as alms, khairat, to the poor. If the baby is delayed, the blood of a chicken may be sprinkled on the patient to appease the evil forces preventing the delivery.

Superstition is attached to the afterbirth. There is a strong belief that the afterbirth still possesses the life force of the baby, so it must be buried quickly and near the baby.
Immediately after birth the child is washed and wrapped in the swaddling cloth. An amulet, Chashem mora, a round piece of blue ceramic tile that is pitted with holes, is often attached to the swaddling cloth. The child's eyes may then be lined with black antimony, sorma, expressing the hope that the child may one day be blessed with the vision of God. The child is placed at the mother’s side alongside a stone or piece of wood, to indicate that the child be as strong as a rock, “ke mesl sang sakht byaya,” and the child sleep like a rock or a piece of wood.
The midwife is paid according to the means of the family, with gifts such as cooking oil, soap, sugar, chadar, or some article of clothing in addition to money. The payment tends to be higher with a first child and with male children. The family may also gift food to the poor.
