Things went from bad to worse for Manchester United at the weekend If only last week s split of points against Leicester City wasn t enough the Red devil s lost away from home to an Everton side that s struggled for form as of late Cristiano Ronaldo missed last week s game through illness but was back for this one That being said his performance was not one he ll be very proud of The Portuguese was clearly out of his usual rhythm and fell way off his standards because he had little to work with After a frustrating minutes and an injury to boot Ronaldo walked off the Goodison Park pitch a frustrated man Footage of him smashing a young fan s smartphone in frustration emerged not long after It isn t normal to see someone of Cristiano s level to let his outrage damage anyone that comes to watch him fan or foe A few hours following full time in Merseyside the time Ballon dor publicly criticised through an Instagram post It s never easy to deal with emotions in difficult moments such as the one we are facing he wrote in an Instagram post Nevertheless we always have to be respectful patient and set the example for all the youngsters who love the beautiful game Ronaldo believes United are going through a very tough phase and has called upon himself and his teammates to set an example I would like to apologize for my outburst and if possible I would like to invite this supporter to watch a game at Old Trafford as a sign of fair play and sportsmanship United next face Liverpool on the other side of Merseyside If anything Ralf Ragnick will hope for a better result and a more convincing performance especially from leaders like Ronaldo Having lost the reverse fixture the game at Anfield comes as a call for revenge
