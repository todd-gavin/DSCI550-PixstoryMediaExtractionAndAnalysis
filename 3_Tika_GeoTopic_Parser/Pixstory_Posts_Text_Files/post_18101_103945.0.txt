Colombian Singer Shakira caught eyeballs with her appearance at the ‘Elvis’ premiere during the Cannes Film Festival.


She arrived on the red carpet wearing a black strapless dress that featured a plunging neckline, and a thigh-high side slit.

For elevating her look, Shakira wore a pair of sheer black gloves and rocked an eye-catching dazzling ring over the top. Her silver necklace also stole the attention.
