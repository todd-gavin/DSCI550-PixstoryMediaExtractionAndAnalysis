The miracle that ultimately failed Sofia Goggia will not take part in the super-G at the Beijing Winter Olympics The decision was made official a few hours after the first ski tests just two weeks after the injury in Cortina in which she suffered a microfracture of her head of the fibula and a partial lesion of the cruciate ligament of the anterior knee I still feel pain, Goggia said yesterday A nuisance that led to the forfeit for the races that will start on Friday morning A real pity his absence in the super-G given that in the season currently Italy has dominated in the discipline Of seven races disputed, the blues have won six three times Federica Brignone two Sofia Goggia and one Elena Curtoni Still nothing is known about the downhill in which it seemed she would have to participate regularly but now this too seems to be at risk We will therefore see if Sofia Goggia will be present on Tuesday and above all in the first rehearsals which will take place from Saturday
