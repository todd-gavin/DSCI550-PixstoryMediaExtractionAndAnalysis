Post stroke period is a period where the patient experiences paralysis. A new study published in the Journal of Neuroscience, new options for controlling  their hands or limbs via their brain. 

The researches headed by Fatemeh Khademi, PhD, a data scientist at the Institute for Neuromodulation and Neurotechnology at the University Hospital and the University of Tuebingen in Germany, studied about the brain robot apparatus for controlling the movements of hands among the stroke patients who are affected with paralysis. 

The scientists measured the brain and muscle activity in healthy participants as well as people who had a stroke using electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyography (EMG). 

Similarly at the same time, participants controlled a brain robot interface for their hands. In order to operate the apparatus, the researchers asked the patients to think about moving their hands. 

The electrical activity between the hand and the muscle parts of the brain increased which indicates the enhanced communication between the two regions. 

“We work with patients who cannot open their hands at all. Our brain-robot interface allows them to control the robot-assisted opening of their hand by imagining the movement. This apparatus is a training tool,” said Dr. Alireza Gharabaghi, lead study author and director of the Institute for Neuromodulation and Neurotechnology at the University Hospital Tuebingen. “Patients are expected after weeks or months of training to develop the ability to open their hand again.”
