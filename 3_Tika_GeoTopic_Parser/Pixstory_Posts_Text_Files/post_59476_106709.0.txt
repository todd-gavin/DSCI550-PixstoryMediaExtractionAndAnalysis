The Indian Air Force (IAF) intends to develop roughly 100 modern fighter jets in India, and has began discussions with international aircraft manufacturers. 

Top government sources told India Today that the Aatmanirbhar project will use Indian money for the first time to pay for about 70% of the project's cost. 

"The goal is to manufacture 96 planes in India, with 36 of them being paid for partially in Indian money and partially in foreign cash. "All payments for the remaining 60 planes would be done in Indian rupee alone," they stated. 

The IAF intends to purchase 114 planes to strengthen its combat capabilities and replace its outgoing fleet of MiG series planes.
