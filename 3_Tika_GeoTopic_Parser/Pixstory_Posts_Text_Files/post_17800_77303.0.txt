Evangeline Lilly who is best known for playing the role of Kate in "Lost and The Wasp in the MCU, recently took to instagram to confirm her attendance at the protest that happened in support of “bodily sovereignty.” The actress in the post explained how he stands against the government-mandated vaccine policies.
Evangeline Lilly's post read the following, 
"I was in DC this weekend to support bodily sovereignty while Canadian truckers were rallying for their cross-country, peaceful convoy in support of the same thing.
I believe nobody should ever be forced to inject their body with anything, against their will, under threat of: -violent attack
-arrest or detention without trial
-loss of employment
-homelessness
-starvation
-loss of education
-alienation from loved ones
-excommunication from society
...under any threat whatsoever.

This is not the way. This is not safe. This is not healthy.This is not love. I understand the world is in fear, but I don't believe that answering fear with force will fix our problems.
I was pro choice before COVID and I am still pro choice today."
