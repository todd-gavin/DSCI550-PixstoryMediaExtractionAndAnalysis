He did not feel welcomed in anyone’s eyes, he felt alone everywhere he went, he felt like a burden on himself and the world. When you read these words, you would think in your mind how could a person feeling this way even function, and you are right, a normal human being might not, but for Vincent Van Gogh it was the pathway to his art, the art which has been cherished for years. 

Being a movie buff, I never found animated movies interesting or appealing but when I was told about a film which was the world’s first ever truly painted movie, it dawned on me that this is something special and feels like worth the watch only for its amazing rotoscoping technique of making.

“Loving Vincent is a result of animating 62,450 oil paintings on canvas, inspired by van Gogh’s style, that attempts to reach an artist through his art.” Yes, you read that right, more than 62,000 paintings were made in order to perform the rotoscoping technique to make this film based over the life of Vincent Van Gogh, the sole effort that took in making such a work of art is enough reason for you to watch it, but beyond those other reasons include the voices of several notable actors like Douglas Booth, Jerome Flynn, Saoirse Ronan and Helen Mc Crory. The film depicts the life of Vincent Van Gogh during his final days and how he grappled with the world. 

I could have written thesis over how beautiful and satisfying this film is but this is a once in a lifetime experience and I don’t want to colour anyone’s opinions by talking about it any further, if you are thinking to broaden your scope of World Cinema, Loving Vincent would be a glorious entry to your list.
