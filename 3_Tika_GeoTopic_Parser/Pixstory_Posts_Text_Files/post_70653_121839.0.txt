The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, was withdrawn by the Center on August 3; a replacement Bill will be introduced.

The Joint Parliamentary committee's members were informed by Minister of Electronics and Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw of her decision to withdraw due to the 81 revisions and 12 recommendations made "toward a comprehensive legal framework."

"A thorough legislative framework is being developed in light of the JCP's report. Therefore, it is suggested that "The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019" be withdrawn in light of the current situation and replaced with a new bill that adheres to the overall legislative framework."

Meity MoS Rajeev Chandrasekhar claimed in a tweet that the JCP report had identified concerns that were important but outside the purview of current privacy laws. "Indian citizens have a fundamental right to privacy, and a trillion dollar digital economy necessitates global standard cyber rules," he said.

An expert committee led by Justice BN Srikrishna originally drafted the Personal Data Protection Bill in 2018. A draught of the Bill was presented by the Center in the Lok Sabha in 2019; in December of that same year, it was referred to the Joint Parliamentary Committee. After six delays, the committee's findings was presented to Parliament in December 2021.

The latest version of the bill included both personal and non-personal data under its ambit, which would be dealt with by a Data Protection Authority.
