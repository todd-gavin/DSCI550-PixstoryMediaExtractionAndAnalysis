A personal show pervaded by affection and nostalgia Brandon Maxwell&#39;s album of memories parades and with the fall winter he chooses to pay homage to his grandmother who is now suffering from Alzheimer&#39;s Prologue to the show Siri&#39;s voice reading Maxwell&#39;s Wikipedia page which reminds us how the stylist spent most of her youth in the old woman&#39;s clothing boutique in Longview, Texas before moving on to a film of family photos and videos, many of which are of Maxwell with her. In this sense, the memory seems to be the engine of the entire collection where blanket yesteryear jewels shawls and satin pochette recur as timeless accents drawn directly from the designer&#39;s youth Even the fabrics evoke a feeling of domesticity from the crushed satin of the double lapel coat at the opening of the show to the oversized chenille stitch to the rich brown fabrics chosen for the tailoring While the flowers on the final dress worn by Karlie Kloss reproduce those of a family painting
