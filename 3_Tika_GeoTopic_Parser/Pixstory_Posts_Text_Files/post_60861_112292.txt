This flower has a lot of names It blooms at night and has been doing so since I was a child My parents are gardening enthusiasts When they were constructing our house they made sure to utilize whatever little space we had left was reserved for growing a garden They planted what they called the night queen at a small corner of the garden When I was young my mom would take me there and I remember I would be so fascinated with the way the white blossoms looked Later when I was old enough I tried to find more information on the plant Its scientific name is Epiphyllum Oxipetalum and it rarely blooms When it does bloom it happens at night and it typically wilts in the morning The plant is also known as Dutchman s pipe cactus and is a species of cactus The flowers grow from its leaves It s safe to say that this plant is my favourite in the garden but unfortunately it rarely blooms throughout the year However the times that it does bloom it d fill the garden area with the sweetest floral scent imaginable I d just know that it has blossomed and go outside to enjoy the view You ll have to know how to take proper care of the plant though It s not easy to take care of these and you have to make sure the temperature is just right for its growth It also can t grow in too much sunlight so a place that receives indirect sunlight is perfect You ll also have to change the amount of water you give any organic fertilizers depending on the season It can be a little high maintenance but it s worth the wait and effort to see them bloom
