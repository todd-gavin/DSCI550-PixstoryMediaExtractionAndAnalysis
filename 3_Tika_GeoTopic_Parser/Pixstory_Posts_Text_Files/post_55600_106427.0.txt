In this absorbing period drama set in a Melbourne newsroom, the 1980s are brought back to life. The Newsreader is a six-hour television show that is filled of nostalgia, romance, and office politics while also dealing with more serious issues such as sexual harassment, homophobia, and racism. 

Helen Norville and 30-year veteran Geoff Walters co-host "News at Six" . Dale Jennings, a stuttering journalistic newcomer who desires to be everything Helen is, enters the picture. 

But not everything is as it seems: Helen is a high-strung, self-doubting disaster off-camera. The raving underminer Lindsay Cunningham, her bully of a supervisor, is to blame for a lot of this (William McInnes in an outstanding performance).

As per collider, the Newsreader revisits real-life events from the 1980s that are fused into Australians’ (and much of the world’s) collective memories, including Lindy Chamberlain’s release from prison, the Challenger space disaster, Melbourne’s Russell Street bombing, and the Chernobyl accident. 

Its brilliant cast, tight writing, and emphasis on understatement make The Newsreader great viewing.
