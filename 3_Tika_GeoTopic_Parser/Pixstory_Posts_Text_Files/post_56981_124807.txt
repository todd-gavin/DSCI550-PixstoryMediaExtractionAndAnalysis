One of the most significant benefits of the mono diet is its simplicity Unlike other fad diets there are no complicated guidelines to follow However mono diets are highly restrictive and cut out most healthy foods Therefore just because a simple diet doesn t mean it s healthy It also doesn t require dieters to track nutrients count calories or measure portion sizes which could appeal to some people It may also be effective for short term weight loss depending on which foods you consume and in what amounts Still know that this has nothing to do with the mono diet The weight loss achieved on a mono diet is simply due to the calorie restriction that comes from cutting out most foods Any extreme diet is likely to lead to short term weight loss However this weight loss is rarely maintained in the long term Although it s unsustainable and may be challenging to follow for long periods some people use it to kick start weight loss before transitioning to other dietary patterns Moreover mono diets are simple to follow and take almost all the planning and thought out of the dieting process A mono diet that limits calories may jump start weight loss in the short term For some people this could increase motivation to continue losing weight with a more rounded eating and exercise plan
