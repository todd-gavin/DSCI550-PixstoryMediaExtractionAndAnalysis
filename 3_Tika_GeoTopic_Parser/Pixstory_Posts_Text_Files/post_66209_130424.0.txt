The World Health Organization just released a report further outlining the increased risks of colorectal cancer from regular red meat and processed meat consumption. This is on top of existing concerns about heart disease, stroke, and other health complications.
A lot of people have diets that are extraordinarily high in processed food that contain added sugar, preservatives, chemicals, and other ingredients that can impede your health, make you feel sluggish on a daily basis, and lead to long-term health problems. A lot of the time, meat is at the center of this diet.
Of course, vegans can have a highly processed, unhealthy diet. But going vegan forces you to actively consider the ingredients of the foods you are consuming. This daily consideration will most likely, over time, lead to a fresher, more nutrient-rich diet.
It’s really amazing how much better you feel when you eat healthy. Try it if you don’t believe me.
