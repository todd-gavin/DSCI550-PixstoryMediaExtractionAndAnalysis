I read below message today morning thought provoking suggestion I like it hence sharing with you all I propose that a scheme similar to Agniveer should be introduced for our dear MPs and MLAs too MPs may be named Karmaveers and MLAs Sevaveers once they have completed years of service to the nation During the year tenure they would receive training for year and would be paid a consolidated salary plus allowances On completion of years only of them would be eligible to seek re election based on their performance and the rest would receive a one time severance package No pension or other privileges benefits will be paid Those who have served as cabinet ministers would receive a citation describing him her as Param Karmaveer or Maha Karmaveer or Param Sevaveer Maha Sevaveer etc I am sure this proposal would receive support
