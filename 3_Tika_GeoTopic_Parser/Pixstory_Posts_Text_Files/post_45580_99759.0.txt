When tragedy hits, the imagination can occasionally conjure up a fantastic escape. In Inda Craig-"Black Galván's Super Hero Magic Mama," a family is torn apart after Tramarion, a Black adolescent, is gunned down by police when his trophy from winning a trivia show is mistaken for a weapon. 

Sabrina Jackson, his mother, goes on a fanciful mental voyage, seeing herself as Maasai Angel, the superhero her son and his friend Flat Joe developed. 

WBUR reported that the Company One Theatre, American Repertory Theater, Boston Comics in Color Festival, and the Boston Public Library (at the BPL through May 21) are presenting the New England premiere, which is the company's first fully staged in-person play since the pandemic.

As Jacquinn Sinclair writes, the plot of the show is intriguing. Sabrina (Ramona Lisa Alexander) plays Maasai Angel, a fierce Afro-wearing warrior with bright ethnic jewellery, a luminous chest plate, and a spear in her hand who must overcome a succession of opponents in order to find her son. Lady Vulture (Helen-Hy-Yuen Swanson, who also plays anchor Connie Wright) and the Human Hyena are among the interesting individuals Diana meets on her journey. 

Generations of Black children had no chance to view themselves as heroes on small and silver screens before the recent releases of Marvel's pivotal "Black Panther" picture, Netflix's "Luke Cage" series, and DC Comics' great "Watchmen," among others. As a result, focusing on a Black woman as more than a victim — as a heroine — is extremely appreciated.
