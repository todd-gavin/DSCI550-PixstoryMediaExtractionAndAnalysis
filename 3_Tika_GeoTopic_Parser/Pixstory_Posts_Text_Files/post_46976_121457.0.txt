India captain Rohit Sharma wants his team to continue playing more attacking cricket during the lead-up to this yearâ€™s T20 World Cup and is happy to wear the occasional loss due to the more aggressive style.

India batters failed meekly when they fell to just their fourth T20I loss of the year on Monday when defeated by an Obed McCoy-inspired West Indies by five wickets in St Kitts.

Rohit was one of McCoy's six victims in the match, with the West Indies pacer running through India's star-studded batting line-up to help bowl out the tourists in the final over for just 138.

But Rohit said there is no need to panic and the odd disappointing result will continue to fall India's way while they continue to attack more with the bat.

"Really, really happy with how the bowlers bowled, but of course, there are certain things in our batting that we really need to look at," Rohit said after the loss.

"But again, I will say that as well: we will continue to bat in that kind of fashion because we want to achieve something. Unless you try and do it, you will not achieve.
