Easter is the celebration our faith of eternal life in Jesus. We give thanks for Jesus' death on the cross for our sins, allowing us to be reborn through sincere faith in Him. Singing our praises in worship and communion with Christ is a great way to express our thanksgiving.

There are numerous songs that I love, but "Great is Your Mercy" is one that I think shows the Lord in all of his glory. It's a straightforward tune with only a few verses. They do, however, say everything. 

—Thank You for Your mercy
Thank You for Your grace
Thank You for Your Blood
That's made a way
To come into Your presence
And glorify Your Name
Lord, I stand amazed at what I see

Great is Your mercy toward me
Your loving kindness toward me
Your tender mercies I see
Day after day
Forever faithful to me
Always providing for me
Great is Your mercy toward me
Great is Your grace

Other than this, Christ Arose, See A Victory and King Of My heart tug at my heart strings!

Another one would be Jesus Paid It All.
—Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow.

Easter Hymns are a wonderful way to connect with Christ. The list really never ends. They always bring tears to my eyes.
