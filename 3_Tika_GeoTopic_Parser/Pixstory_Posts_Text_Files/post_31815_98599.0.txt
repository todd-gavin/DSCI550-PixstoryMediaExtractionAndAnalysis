In the past, indris were partly protected from hunting by local fadys, traditional taboos that forbid eating their meat. Today, however, two factors contribute to the unsustainable increase in indri hunting: diminished belief in taboos amongst the Malagasy people and the influx of immigrants who do not follow local traditions. However, the greatest threat pushing the indri towards extinction is due to the disappearance of its natural habitat onset by deforestation. The degradation of the Maromizaha forest has mainly been caused by the practice of slash and burn agriculture to convert the forest into agricultural land, selective logging, and mining. Unfortunately, the indri is an animal that cannot survive in captivity, which means it must be protected in its natural habitat. World Sustainability Organization/Friend of the Earth started supporting the study and monitoring of indri populations thanks to the  "Maromizaha Conservation Project" alliance. There are currently 12 groups of indris under daily observation. Four local guides are in charge of studying their behavior and movements. Monitoring is carried out by both focal observations and by using special acoustic recorders placed in strategic locations, which are moved every three weeks. The project is also engaged in habitat restoration through the management of several bamboo and other native plants’ nurseries. A participatory approach underpins the project's operations, with support and training provided to local populations that are intended to promote and protect indigenous knowledge and traditional methods. Environmental education is also emphasized to foster greater involvement from the people, including activities in local schools and scholarships for disadvantaged children to provide them with the opportunity of an education.
