Being able to communicate with someone whether it be through deep soulful debate easygoing enjoyable talk monotonous typical silly talk that only the two of you find hilarious or in any other way at any time anywhere is one of the most precious pleasurable and cherished things in the world Once you have it the tragedy of life is bearable you look forward to experiencing life and you want to tell your person everything The easiest way of finding your person is to inculcate the traits and attributes that you desire in yourself first and then you will find your person But I see a lot of individuals looking for and longing for the ideal partner while failing to realise that you could also be the ideal partner for someone else When the other person expresses their joys and worries try to be the one who will listen and not just listen but also put effort into understanding and be judgment free If you make an effort to become that person you will certainly find your best friend someone to whom you can confide your problems pleasures and dreams
