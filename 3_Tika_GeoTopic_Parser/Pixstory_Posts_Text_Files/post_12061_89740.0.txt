Most of us are happy because we see an endemic to this pandemic. But the truth is that its not the end yet. 

Experts have discovered a new covid variant that could be more worse than Omicron variant and it could hit the world in the coming two years. 

Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer said that there are high chances of new covid variants and he sees that there is still a long away for the world to have a post covid period. 

While the experts have tried to assuage the fears surrounding Covid, through statemts saying that it will only mutate now to a mild cold-causing pathogen. 

Whitty shared that the virus could be seen "less dominant'. He also added that its not wise to think that Covid has reached its 'stable state'. 

Whitty said at the Local Government's Association public health conference as reported by Daily Mail "We could well end up with a new variant that produces worse problems than we've got with Omicron and the Omicron problems are by no means trivial".
