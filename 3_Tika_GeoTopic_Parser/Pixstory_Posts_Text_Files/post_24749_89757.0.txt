This is the first time Italy failed to qualify continuously. The 67th ranked team shocked Italy with an extra time goal. 



856 Million Euros were the market value of players lined up for Italy against a 65 Million North Macedonian side, which failed to score and qualify for the biggest stage of football. Italy can't fly to Qatar. 


The goal which crushed Italy's World cup hopes came in the 90+2', Trajkovski collected a second ball from goal kick and moved two steps up, and took a shot which went low to the right side of Donnarumma. Italy tried 32 shots to score but only 5 went on to target. 


Post match Mancini commented North Macedonia were a good team with technical abilities and good in counter. Also, they defend well. 


Italy are current European champions and 4 time World cup winners. They have participated 18 times in the World cup , but failed to do so 4 times. In 1930 they did not enter, 1958, 2018 and 2022 failed to qualify. They were champions in 1932, 1938, 1982 and 2006. In 1970 and 1994 they reached the final and became runners up. 


Azzuris had Ciro Immobile, Insigne, Berardi at attack. Jorginho, Barella, Verratti in the midfield. With the line up and the experience they carry, they should have scored minimum 4 goals in the match against the team who have only one EURO (2020 - group stage) appearance in their history as football legacy. By not qualifying, Italy became first champions to not qualify consecutively in the world cup finals. Previously, North Macedonia defeated Germany once in 2021. Goalkeeper Stole Dimitrievski (Rayo Vallecano) and midfielder Elif Elmas (Napoli) could be the top players for North Macedonia, after the Pandev era.  Goal scorer Vlatko Trajkovski has played just 9 matches for North Macedonia. 


North Macedonia will play against Portugal in their next play off match on 30th march. Portugal coach Fernando Santos says Portugal must respect North Macedonia as much as Italy.
