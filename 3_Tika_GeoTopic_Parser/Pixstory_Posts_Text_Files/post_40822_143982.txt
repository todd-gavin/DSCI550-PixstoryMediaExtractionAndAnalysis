In all people I see myself none more and not one a barley corn less And the good or bad I say of myself I say of them I know I am solid and sound To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow All are written to me and I must get what the writing means I know I am deathless I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter s compass I know I shall not pass like a child s carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night I know I am august I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood I see that the elementary laws never apologize I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by after all I exist as I am that is enough If no other in the world be aware I sit content And if each and all be aware I sit content One world is aware and by far the largest to me and that is myself And whether I come to my own to day or in ten thousand or ten million years I can cheerfully take it now or with equal cheerfulness I can wait My foothold is tenon d and mortis d in granite I laugh at what you call dissolution And I know the amplitude of time Walt Whitman
