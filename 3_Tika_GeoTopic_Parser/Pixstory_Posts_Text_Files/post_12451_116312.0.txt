We have often heard about anxiety where one experiences extreme stress that affects their better functioning. Social anxiety is different and it affects a person's socialising and it is where the person has an extreme fear in social settings. 

Those with this disorder will confront problems like talking to people, meeting new people and being a part of social gatherings. They have a fear of being judged or scrutinized by others. They know that their fears are irrational but they feel powerless to overcome them. 

Social anxiety is a fear that one will have about something embarrassing or flawed about oneself which will become obvious to everyone. 

Social anxiety is a fear of the judgements from others and this makes us self focused.  

Focusing on our own appearance, performance and emotions means we will come from social situations with very little information on how the situation actually went. 

This means we look inside to see how things outside are actually going. 

The problem lies when we start using our discomfort to understand how we're coming off to others. 

We feel stupid, so we think we must be talking nonsense 

We feel embarrassed thinking that everyone is secretly laughing at us. 

Now what do we do about it ?? 

The key is to divert our attention to the outward on what's happening currently around us. 

The trick is to look into what people are saying and to stay focused on what's happening at the moment. 

When you start to prioritise being attentive, observant and responsive to others you will be more able to focus on the task you have at hand, rather than the anxiety. 

Also you will be able to get a balanced view of how the situation went.
