If the Cleveland Browns want Baker Mayfield to assist them in resolving their Deshaun Watson dilemma, they will need to put in some effort!

US News reported that on Tuesday at his football camp outside the campus of the University of Oklahoma, Mayfield hinted that he may step in if necessary. 

Mayfield responded, "No. I think there would have to be some reaching out for that to happen. But I believe that on both sides, we are prepared to move on. 

In March, the Browns completed a significant trade to acquire Watson, who they later signed to a record-breaking $230 million contract.

Now, Watson faces a possible suspension from the league stemming from accusations of sexual misconduct by two dozen massage therapists in Texas.

Former U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson, who was jointly appointed by the NFL and the NFL Players’ Association, will hold a hearing to determine whether Watson violated the NFL’s personal conduct policy and whether to impose discipline.
