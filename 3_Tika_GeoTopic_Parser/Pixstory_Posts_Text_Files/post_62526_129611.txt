A video went viral in July with a little baby sleeping peacefully on a cot while four king cobras one of the deadliest snake species in the world safeguard him King cobra s bite is so bad that only one bite can kill an adult human in mere minutes In the video each snake extends its neck above the ground as it stands watch at the corners of the bed where the infant is sleeping imitating the protective stance it will adopt It is unknown where the video was shot or why the infant was abandoned close to the snakes Some people have hypothesized that the snakes are guarding the infant out of a natural instinct to safeguard infants that is because king cobras are the only snakes in the world to construct nests and protect their eggs However some have also speculated that the cobras had their fangs removed and mouths stitched and it was shot by a snake charmer an ancient profession in South Asia typically India only for likes and views In many folklore King Cobras have played the part of a parent to a human many times What do you think Do they hold any truth Do snakes have empathy for human infants Can they form a friendship with their human owners Can venomous snakes be tamed to this extent video
