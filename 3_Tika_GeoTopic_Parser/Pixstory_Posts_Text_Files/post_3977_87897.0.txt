Holi is here and we would want to run around with colours and burst the water filled balloons and chill with bhangs. 

The colours just give us so much of joy but chemicals in them don't give us much of joy to deal with. 

These bright colours which are chemical based could cling onto our hair for days or even weeks. So here are few tips suitable for all to take care of their skin and hair from the colours, especially for those who have sensitive skin. 

• Massage and apply your entire body with coconut oil. They not only keeps your body hydrated but also reduces the colour absorption by the skin. 

• Best defense is to wear clothes that covers up your entire body and lessen the chance of one's skin getting exposed to colours. 

• Cut your nails short as colours tend to deposit inside them. Further, applying a thick coating of nail paint on fingers as well as toes can also protect them from absorbing colours. 

• A lot of Holi injuries are often caused to the eyes. It is thus a great idea to wear sunglasses that can protect the eyes from coming into direct contact with colour bursts, water jets, etc. 

• Lip balm and Vaseline can be applied on your ears. 

• Putting cotton earbuds is a good idea as it will prevent colour from entering deep inside the ear. 

• Generously oil your hair with coconut or mustard oil, and make sure it seeps into the roots. This will protect your scalp and make it much easier to wash off the colour once the festivities are over. 

• Do not keep your hair loose open as it is a welcoming sign for colour damage to one's hair. Either tie a braid or a bun. A dupatta or a bandana which prevents the colour from entering into the hair. 

• Try to avoid the sun as it makes the sun to absorb the colour faster.
