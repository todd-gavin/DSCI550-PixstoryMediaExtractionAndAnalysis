Paris Saint Germain massively underperformed last season after arguably having the best summer activity in Europe. However went a renewed belief, can Galtier, their new manager, guide the Parisians to their first UCL crown? 
Signings made by PSG: Carlos Soler, Fabian, Renato Sanches, Nordi Mukiele, Vitinha, etc.
Players released by PSG: Angel di Maria, Rafinha, Gueye, Draxler, Paredes, Kurzawa (all three on loan), etc.
The best business the PSG did in terms of signings was arguably extending the contract of Kylian Mbappe. The Frenchman was touted to leave for Real Madrid however the PSG management offered the youngster a package that he could not refuse. 
The Parisians also made a sensible decision by strengthening their midfield. The central midfield was a point of concern last season hence signing Renato Sanches, Carlos Soler, Fabian, and Vitinha would be quite crucial this season. 
PSG also signed Nuno Mendes permanently and added Mukiele to bolster their right wing following the departure of Angel Di Maria. 
Weaknesses: Sergio Ramos missed most of last season due to injuries. Hence PSG should have considered signing another center-back who would have been versatile. 
The squad looks balanced but the management could have considered selling Icardi and adding an update to their attack. 
Rating PSG's 2022 summer transfer window activity: 8/10
