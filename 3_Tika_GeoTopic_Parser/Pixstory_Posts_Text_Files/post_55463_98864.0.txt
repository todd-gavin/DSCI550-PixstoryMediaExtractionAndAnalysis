1. The bottle should be dark. Transparent bottles where the product is exposed to light, changes its quality and reduces the health properties.
2. Look for the words; “cold press”. That ensures it's the pure form and has gone through minimal processing. Also it should NOT be a blend. Many times it's a blend of refined and extra virgin, so read the label carefully.
3. Extra virgin olive oil, over time loses its properties due to oxidation and exposure to light. So look for a production date that is a year or less from the current date. This time period preserves it the best.
Remember to get all these things checked before buying if you want to use olive oil for your regular cooking.
Also note, pure Olive oil will be much more expensive than the refined ones. So if you find an underpriced olive oil; know it’s shady.
