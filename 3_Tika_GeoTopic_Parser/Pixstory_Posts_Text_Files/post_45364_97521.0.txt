Bellerin, a former Barcelona youth product, joined Arsenal in 2011 and spent his entire senior career there before joining Real Betis on a season-long loan last summer.

The 27-year-old, a lifelong Betis supporter, has had an outstanding season in his hometown, assisting the team in winning the Copa de Rey and still in contention for a place in next season's Champions League. Bellerin, according to reports, prefers a permanent move this summer over a return to Arsenal.

Arteta, on the other hand, has hinted that the right-back will be in his plans if he returns to north London.

‘Any player with a contractual obligation with us is our player and considered our player,’ Arteta told a press conference on Friday.

‘So every plan is considering that possibility [that Bellerin stays] and how they can fit into the team.’

At Betis, Bellerin is managed by Manuel Pellegrini, who was previously the manager of Manchester City. While the full-long-term back's future is uncertain, Arsenal icon Robert Pires spoke with him about the move last summer and is pleased to see him flourishing in Spain.

'Hector Bellerin has had a good influence at Real Betis,' stated LaLiga ambassador Pires on behalf of LiveScore. He's a seasoned pro.

Bellerin found it difficult to find a role with Arsenal in the end, thus he elected to join La Liga, specifically Real Betis. Bellerin contacted Pires and inquired about Manuel Pellegrini, who served as my manager at Villarreal.

Pires told Hector that if he gets the chance to play with Pellegrini, he should take it because he will enjoy himself. The most essential thing is to enjoy football. It's not just about playing the game; that's vital, too. But also, being at Real Betis and coming into the club every morning. Hector Bellerin has a wealth of high-level expertise, and Pires is delighted to have him at Real Betis.
