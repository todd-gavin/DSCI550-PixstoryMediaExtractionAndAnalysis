Deplorable comments and abuse have always been part of people who stay in the public eye; although common people are affected too, the numbers are high here.
Social media makes it easier for people to talk about anything or everything against someone anonymously because they care more about hiding and not the comments that could make anyone feel bad about themselves.
It is the thing every day, and people who endure much of the prejudice are people of colour. This actually shows how prevalent racism is, and of course, body shaming is another thing to discuss here.
Besides all the rights and equality chants, nothing much has been improved, and I think social media aggravates it more.
You can just come, write and go then; who cares about your identity or the words?
