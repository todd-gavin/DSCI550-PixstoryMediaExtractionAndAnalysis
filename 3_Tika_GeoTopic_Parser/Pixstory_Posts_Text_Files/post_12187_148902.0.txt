The two most famous ice-cream milkshakes on pune 
The yellow one,
As guessed, the mango milkshake served with vanilla ice cream. It was a mixture of the milk, the rabdi, the noodles, cashews and what not ...
Absolutely brilliant 👏 👌 
The pink one, 
It's not strawberry but the rajbhog flavor, a unique different flavor of gulkand and pasta  .... gets 20/10 from me  ... 
Can't wait to have it again ...
