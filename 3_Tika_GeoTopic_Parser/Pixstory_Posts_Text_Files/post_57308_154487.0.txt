Remember that over time, the intensity of your painful feelings will lessen. This
doesnâ€™t mean you stop feeling grief, but what once seemed unbearable may be easier to manage, and the sadness, anger and despair you once felt may no longer demand your energy. Feelings of security, calmness or everyday happiness that may have receded during the months and, sometimes, years after the death of your loved one may slowly become accessible again. You may even feel guilty for reinvesting in the pleasures of life again. Try to remember that the memory of your loss does not disappear with your decreased feelings of grief.
By going on with your life, you are not taking away or denying the experience of your loss. Finally, know that you cannot grieve without finding your life unchanged. Realize that you have grown from your loss experience and gained an invaluable awareness of how precious life is
