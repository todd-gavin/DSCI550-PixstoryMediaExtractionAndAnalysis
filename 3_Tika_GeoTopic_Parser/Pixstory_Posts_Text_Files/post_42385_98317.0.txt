Karan Johar, who is famously known for movies directed by him and under his production house and getting involved in controversies because of his chat show “Koffee with Karan” just announced that his chat show will not be returning.

The statement by Karan Johar said that,

Koffee with Karan has been a part of my life,
and yours, for 6 seasons now. I'd like to think we've made an impact and even found our place in pop culture history. And so, it is with a heavy heart that I announce that Koffee with Karan will not be returning…

After the suicide of Bollywood actor, Sushant Singh Rajput, Koffee with Karan came under scrutiny because of some controversial statements from many Bollywood actors (which I think is a foolish act from the fans) but this announcement proved that either anyone is right or wrong, power of the fans is unmatchable.
