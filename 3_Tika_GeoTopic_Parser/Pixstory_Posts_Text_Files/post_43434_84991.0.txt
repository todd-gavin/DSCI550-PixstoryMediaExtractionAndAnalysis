Women’s Day has become a custom every year now and celebrated for the women around us. All these women deserve respect, love, care, and happiness.
The empowerment of women is a great responsibility that all these women need. The world becomes a better place when women don’t feel the hardships to exist. For many years, women have faced several difficulties.
Earlier, the role of women was limited to household chores. Everyone, including some women, was brought up to believe that the role of women is limited to the tasks. Due to this belief, women didn’t go out to work or thought about going for work.
However, this thought changed after a few decades because women started trying different things. Women began realizing that they, too, can have careers and a future. More and more women began taking up jobs and worked in many sectors of the economy.

All Women's have equal role in society upliftment.
