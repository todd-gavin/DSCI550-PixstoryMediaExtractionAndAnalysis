The Street Child World Cup Doha 2022 is just days from kicking off! It has been a busy day welcoming the inspiring 28 teams from 24 countries. 13 girls teams and 15 boys teams will come together to participate in an international football tournament, a festival of arts, and a congress, to champion the rights of underserved children worldwide. With one united voice, they will show the world, ‘I AM SOMEBODY’.Throughout the week, each team will campaign for one of our four pillars: birth registration, protection from violence, access to education, and gender equality. The young people will get the chance to campaign for these core demands in front of the media, politicians, and key stakeholders, to implement positive social change. We can’t wait to get started!
