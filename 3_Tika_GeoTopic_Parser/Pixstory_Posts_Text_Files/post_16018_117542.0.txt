Abstract

Purpose

To determine the predictive value of the microcirculation of optic nerve head (ONH) by SS-OCTA for identifying individual with high risk of DR progression and DME development.

Design

Prospective observational cohort study

Method

A total of 946 patients (1,879 eyes) with type 2 DM were recruited who had no DR or mild non-proliferative DR at baseline, and no DME. All subjects underwent 3 mm × 3 mm SS-OCTA centered on the ONH to generate angiograms in four layers: radial peripapillary plexus (RPC), superficial retinal capillary plexus (SCP), deep retinal capillary plexus (DCP), and choriocapillaris (CC). The CC flow deficit percentage (CC FD%), vessel density (VD), and perfusion density (PD) were quantified.

Results

During the 3 consecutive years of follow-up, 312 eyes (16.60%) experienced DR progression and 115 eyes (6.12%) developed DME. The DR progression was related to a lower VD of the SCP (RR per SD decrease, 95% CI):1.30, 1.14–1.48; P < 0.001), a lower PD of the SCP (1.41, 1.24–1.60; P < 0.001), a lower VD of the RPC (1.23, 1.08–1.40; P = 0.002), and an elevated CC FD% (1.62, 1.40–1.88; P < 0.001). The DME occurrence was associated with a lower VD of SCP (1.35, 1.09–1.66; P = 0.005), a lower PD of SCP (1.29, 1.05–1.59; P = 0.016), and a higher CC FD% (1.29, 1.03–1.61; P < 0.001). The CC FD% significantly improved the predictive power, with the increase of the C-statistic for DR progression and DME occurrence by 3.83% (P = 0.002) and 5.24% (P < 0.001), respectively.

Conclusions

This study provides the first longitudinal evidence suggesting that CC FD% can improve the prediction of DR progression and DME development beyond traditional risk factors.
