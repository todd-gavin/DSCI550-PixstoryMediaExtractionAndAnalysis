Steven Soderbergh is a director of contradictions who has grown incredibly prolific in the age of streaming He portrays himself as a traditional professional who can tackle any topic and personalize it with his own style and hobbies Soderbergh is the most physical of all current Hollywood filmmakers the one who comes closest to the painterly ideal of feeling the image It s in his latest film Kimi which will premiere on HBO Max on Thursday This is a delightful surprise because the film s substance isn t visible in the foreground constructed it s as a standard genre piece With agoraphobic protagonist Angela Childs Zoe Kravitz working tech support from home this technological device is essentially a stand in for Alexa or Google devices not used name because crimes are heard and recorded on their behalf while the company itself is involved in highly shady practices Her job include debugging stream data communication issues between the user and the device Angela s agoraphobia is less compelling which contributes to broad stereotypes and a disconcerting sense of dishonesty in the writing Even Zoe Kravitz who is fantastic in the role otherwise is limited to exaggerating tics that overshadow the remainder of an unusually difficult performance All of the elements come across as parts of a character that never come together to form something meaningful Kimi at its core is a story about shoving someone through a different kind of traumatic experience in order to reawaken their life Hearing something along the lines of rape and murder on one of those tech support audio recordings As a result of the insidious erosion of the illusion of privacy brought on by such devices and Angela s decision to take matters into her own hands The suspense element is well crafted there s an attempted kidnapping in broad daylight that is intensely framed and shot and the chimes provide an odd dreamlike soundscape that matches Angela s persona when she eventually ventures out into Seattle to administer justice Kimi is engaging enough that you won t want to turn the movie off with your own voice but there s plenty of unfulfilled opportunity along the way
