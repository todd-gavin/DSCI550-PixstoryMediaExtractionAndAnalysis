We all demand autonomy as soon as we reach that mature stage when things become fathomable, and we understand the discussions of privacy and individuality.

It begins with asking for space from parents and always mentioning that we are grown enough to make the right decisions. However, amidst ongoing discussions of asking for autonomy or learning about the right to privacy, we often ignore or forget how social media and technology cannot understand and respect humans' autonomy.

Privacy matters; without it, there won't be any real individual freedom, but does the growing technology understand the balance between individual autonomy and its role?

Of course not; privacy is in crisis due to constant surveillance of our personal information through social media and technology. With this technological revolution and the internet world, our personal space is constantly hindered by the government or apps. So there's always someone trying to invade our privacy. And this is not FINE.

No one would want to be seen and judged by a constant eye that can capture our interests, information and even what we are up to.
