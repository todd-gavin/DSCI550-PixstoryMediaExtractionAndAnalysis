While the MeT department had predicted light to moderate rain with thundershowers in Jammu and Kashmir over the next 24 hours, heavy rainfall lashed numerous areas of Kashmir on Saturday. 
Roads were submerged by the torrential downpour, which turned them into virtual swimming lakes and inconvenienced commuters.
The minimum temperature this morning was 22.2 degrees Celsius in Srinagar, 16.3 degrees Celsius in Pahalgam, and 13.2 degrees Celsius in Gulmarg.
