This is so cute. ðŸ¥°

Did you know polar bears are actually black? Shocker, right? But it is the truth. Polar Bears have black skin. And I mean, jet black. They have jet black skin under all that thick white coating of fur. In fact, even their fur isn't white. It's actually translucent but because of all the light reflected from the snow around them, their furs appear to be white.

Another amazing fact about them is no matter how adorable they look, they are extremely dangerous with their hypercarnivore instincts. Their nature is predatory, so it's always a smart idea to stay far far away from them.

Oh, one more. Their DNA can be determined just by their foot print. Not only that, even their recent meal's DNA can be determined through their footprint.
