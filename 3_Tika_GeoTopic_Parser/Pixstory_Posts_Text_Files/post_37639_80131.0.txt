The first teaser trailer for the TV series "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power” will debut on Super Bowl Sunday, Amazon Prime Video announced on Monday.
The announcement came after Amazon’s tease-reveal of character posters last week which showed only cast members hands.

The series’ cast includes Cynthia Addai-Robinson, Robert Aramayo, Owain Arthur, Maxim Baldry, Nazanin Boniadi, Morfydd Clark, Ismael Cruz Córdova, Charles Edwards, Trystan Gravelle, Sir Lenny Henry, Ema Horvath, Markella Kavenagh, Joseph Mawle, Tyroe Muhafidin, Sophia Nomvete, Lloyd Owen, Megan Richards, Dylan Smith, Charlie Vickers, Leon Wadham, Benjamin Walker, Daniel Weyman, and Sara Zwangobani.

The series is set in the Second Age of Middle-earth — thousands of years before the events of the Lord of the Rings films and the novels. The series brings to screens for the very first time J.R.R. Tolkien’s fabled Second Age of Middle-earth’s history. Beginning in a time of relative peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth.

The Rings of Power is the rare streaming series to earn a major promotional cycle more than six months before its debut, since Amazon spent roughly $465 million on the first season alone — on top of the $250 million the company spent to secure the rights to the series from author J.R.R. Tolkien’s estate.
