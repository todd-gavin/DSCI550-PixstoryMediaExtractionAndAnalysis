These hot, flaky packages are on the menu of every social party, sporting match and are even acceptable for a hearty breakfast after a big night out. 

Try a classic Meat Pie with tomato sauce from the local bakery or service station. Or sample one of our many, many other popular types of pies like Beef Curry Pie, Butter Chicken Pie, Chicken & Leek Pie – or any other version you can find! Pie is always a good idea in Australia.

Nothing beats fresh fish and chips, with a lemon wedge and some chicken salt, when you’re down by the beach. Try the popular Australian fish barramundi, named from the Aboriginal language meaning ‘large-scaled river fish’ or sample some calamari rings AKA squid rings coated in crispy batter.
