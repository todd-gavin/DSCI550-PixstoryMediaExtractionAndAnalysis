The sporting star, David Beckham shares about his battle with OCD which impacts his life in numerous ways. In a throwback interview he shared about how obsessive he become when it comes about counting cans of fizzy drink that he stores in the fridge. 
Speaking of the obsessions and compulsions, he said that, “I have got this disorder where I have to have everything in a straight line or everything has to be in pairs. 
“I’ll put my Pepsi cans in the fridge and if there’s one too many then I’ll put it in another cupboard somewhere. I’ll go into a hotel room and before I can relax, I have to move all the leaflets and all the books and put them in a drawer.” 
His wife, Victoria Beckham added more about his behaviour and she said, “He’s got that obsessive-compulsive thing where everything has to match. If you open our fridge, it’s all coordinated down either side. 
Due to the condition he also had a habit of getting tattoos, where nearly every inch of his body is covered and its the pain of the needle which keeps him going back to it. 
“I've got that problem,” he added before going on to explain that he has already tried to rid himself of the condition. “I would like to. I've tried and I can't stop." 
Throughout these years, Beckham was able to find his own ways of managing his OCD and any other potential dark moments of mental health. In 2019 he had shared about how his children have a positive impact on him and how one children's toy helps him to calm down during the struggle. 
“When the kids finish school, they might have different activities going on, like football or rugby. 
“But when they get home we'll often play one of their favourite games, like Connect 4. They also love LEGO. So do I. The last big thing I made was Tower Bridge. It was amazing. I think LEGO sometimes helps to calm me down.”
