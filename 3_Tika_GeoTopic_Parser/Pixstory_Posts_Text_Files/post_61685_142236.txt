Among the many things we heard in the aftermath of All Out was that then AEW World champion CM Punk was injured We eventually learned the injury happened during his PPV match with Jon Moxley not his post media scrum brawl with Ace Steel against Kenny Omega amp The Young Bucks And we were told Punk suffered a torn left triceps When that was reported it wasn t known if Punk had undergone surgery to repair the tear which causes pain and immobility in the arm Now Wrestling Observer s Dave Meltzer says Punk already had surgery earlier this week He reiterated that there s usually about an eight month recovery period after the surgery Punk s doctor recommended doing the surgery as soon as possible to prevent muscle atrophy No mention of the surgery s outcome but no reason to think it wasn t successful either We wonder about his future with AEW after his seemingly planned speech deriding company management amp former World champ Hangman Page at the All Out presser led to an already infamous fight backstage That s apparently pending the results of an internal investigation and Punk s negotiations with AEW owner Tony Khan It is rumoured that Punk will be out months due to the recovery
