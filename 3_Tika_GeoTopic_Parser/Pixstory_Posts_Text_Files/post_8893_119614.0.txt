Chief Justice of India continues .....

â€œAfter finishing education, Mr. Justice Mahajan joined the legal profession and started his practice first at Dharamsala and then in the district courts of Gurdaspur. Both these places were too small for the ambitious young lawyer who had supreme confidence in himself. In 1918 he shifted to Lahore. 

Here he got opportunities for the display of his forensic abilities, and success following success took him to the highest rung of the ladder. In 1943 he was made a judge. 

The acceptance of judgeship at a comparatively late stage in life when he was enjoying a large and lucrative practice at the Bar meant considerable financial loss to him. In 1948 he came to the Federal Court and I had the privilege of being associated with him from the very first day that we both took our seats in that Court. What struck me from the very beginning was the quickness of his approach and the power of mastering details within a short time. However complicated the facts of a case might be, he could unravel its intricacies within a short time and put his fingers at once on its vital part. 

His judicial pronouncements bear the impress of his strong personality and some of them indeed can be said to have contained the last words on the subject. It would be premature to attempt to make a comparative estimate of his work as a judge, but this I may say without any hesitation that nobody was more mindful than Mr. Justice Mahajan of the supreme importance of maintaining the rightful place of this Court as the guardian of the liberties of the people and dispenser of equal justice to all. His one anxiety was to see that the banner of this Court continues to be held aloft and not lowered before any power or temptation. 

He never regarded law as a printed finality with an unvarying content, nor administration of justice a mere mechanical process.
