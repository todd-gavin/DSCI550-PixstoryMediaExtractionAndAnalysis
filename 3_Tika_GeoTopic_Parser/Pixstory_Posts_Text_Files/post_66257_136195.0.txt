See you again…
By far the best Fast and Furious film to date, and what a truly emotional send off to the late Paul Walker too!
I never thought I’d get emotional during a Fast and Furious film… 
This film is an exhilarating nitro fuelled thrill ride!!!!!!!
James Wan takes over as director and proves he is more than capable of directing an action film! 
The cast is really entertaining too! 
Vin Diesel is on top Vin Diesel badass mode! 
Paul Walker is very much the heart of the film.
It is quite hard watching some of his scenes to be honest; knowing that this will be the last time we will be seeing him as this character.
Michelle Rodriguez is equally as badass as her male co-stars! 
Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris provide a lot of laughs!!! 
Dwayne Johnson is sadly underused though. 
He only appears in a few scenes at the beginning and then reappears in the finale of the film.
Jason Statham makes his Fast and Furious debut, and he is absolutely awesome!! 
A great addition to the franchise!
A really cool character with a lot of presence! 
Nathalie Emmanuel makes her debut too as a hacker. 
She is also a good addition to the cast and is great to look at as well!!!
Tony Jaa appears as a side villain who has a few fight scenes with Walker! 
He is truly incredible when it comes to the action sequences; he is so fast!! 
Kurt Russell is also in the film and seems like he is having a good time!
The action is big, loud and very entertaining!! 
The cars and girls look amazing!! 
The soundtrack is cool too! 
Overall this is a solid entry in the franchise, and in my opinion; where it should have ended.
