The legendary goalkeeper Petr Cech has been handling the role of Technical and Performance advisor for the last 3 years, and has decided to step down from June 30. 


In an official club article, Petr Cech says, "It has been a huge privilege to perform this role at Chelsea for past 3 years. With the club under new ownership, I feel now is right time for me to step aside. I am pleased that the club is now in an excellent position with the new owners and I am confident of its future success both on and off yhe pitch". 


Todd Boehly, the Chairman and co-controlling owner said,"Petr is an important member of the Chelsea family. We understand his decision to step away and thank him for his contributions as an advisor and his commitment to the club and to our community. We wish him the best". 


Considered to be the best goalkeeper alongside Peter Schmeichel, Cech played 11 years at Chelsea. Post his retirement in 2019, he joined as an advisor, connecting the senior team and the academy. He has been with the U-23 team, as a non contract player, also playing one match in the Premier league 2. He had a good connection and voice in the previous management, who intervened in Chelsea's withdrawal from the proposed European Super league, when Chelsea supporters were protesting. Clearly, fans and youth players won't be happy about Cech leaving the position. It is yet to know if there was any topic/subject, that new management wasn't ready to accept/agree.
