Amazon's "The Rings of Power" and HBO's "Game of Thrones" prequel are poised to square off, with billions of dollars possibly on the line. Here is a breakdown of who will win and why the idea of a competition in general might possibly be a delusion.

The makers of HBO's House of the Dragon and Amazon's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power don't want their fantasy epics to be compared to each other. "We're not even on the same night," co-creator George R.R. Martin said. Dragon co-creator George R.R. Martin recently told The Hollywood Reporter. 

The media and fans are going to make plenty of sport comparing the two tentpole dramas over the coming months. Amazon announced its Sept. 2 premiere date a year ago, but HBO revealed its Aug. 21 premiere date in March. Both shows are rolling out episodes on a weekly basis, providing several weeks of overlap. Some data suggests Dragon has double the audience interest of Rings of Power.

So let’s play the game, if only because everybody else will too: Which show — and which platform — will “win”? Or, at least, win the most?
