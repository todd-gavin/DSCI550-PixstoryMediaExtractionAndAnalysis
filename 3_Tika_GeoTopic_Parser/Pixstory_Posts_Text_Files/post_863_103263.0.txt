Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer Keerthi Jalli has become an internet sensation after her pictures visiting flood-hit areas in Assam's Cachar district went viral on social media. In the number of pictures and videos, Jalli can be seen walking barefoot through the muddled waters in the flood-affected area and interacting with locals devastated by the natural calamity.

There is no denying the fact that the officer on the news deserves praises. But why in India people go overboard when they see some officials being honest and dutiful? 

Is it because most officers don't do their duties so that those among very few do their duties get all the hype?
