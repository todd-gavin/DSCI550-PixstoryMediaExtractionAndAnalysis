A year full of important challenges and memorable moments, 2021 was also the year that stars Leonardo Bonucci and Barbara Bonansea shone bright, as recognised at the Best FIFA Football Awards 2021. Leo has been included in the FIFA FIFPRO Men’s World 11, Barbara in the FIFA FIFPRO Women’s World 11.

In season 2020/21, Bonucci added three more winner’s medals to his personal collection: the Italian Cup and Italian Super Cup with Juventus, and EURO2020 with Italy. 

In the black and white stripes, his presence was fundamental both on and off the pitch. A point of reference also for the national side, he was fundamental in Italy’s conquest of Europe. Not satisfied with scoring the equalising goal that took the final to penalties, he also stepped up to convert his spot kick in the nail-biting finale at Wembley.

Being chosen in the world’s Best XI is a natural consequence of his winning mindset.

Barbara Bonansea can also look back on 2021 with huge satisfaction. Selection in the FIFA FIFPro Women’s World 11 for the second consecutive season is just reward for another stellar season, full of goals, victories, records and trophies. 

In a year of change, she rose to the challenge, adding more silverware with a fourth Serie A title and a second Italian Super Cup. Following more success with Italy she topped the year starring in Juventus Women’s historic qualification to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Womens Champions League.
