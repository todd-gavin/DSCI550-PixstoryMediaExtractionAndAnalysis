What is mansplaining all about?

The term "mansplaining" simply comes from the words "man" and "explaining". Doesn't appear to be too horrible, does it? What's wrong with a man teaching things to a woman? So, here's the situation. Mansplaining entails not only explaining, but explaining in a condescending and, more often than not, patronizing manner. It stems from the assumption that women are knowledgeable in areas such as make-up, cooking, and fashion. When a woman speaks about politics, science, or technology, for example, she is not speaking from a position of expertise and comprehension. In fact, it's gotten to the point where men believe they have the right to tell a woman whether or not she suffers pain during her period, how she must feel after a sexual assault, and so on.

So how does this harm women?

For example in their careers, women are under so much pressure in most industries that they believe they must be perfect, and when someone "mansplains" something to them, it only adds to their sense of not being good enough. Mansplaining is unavoidable in these industries, where men outnumber women. To be viewed seriously in their employment, women often feel compelled to minimise any feminine style they may have.

In personal lives, they are discouraged from speaking because there's always a man out there deciding if their experience is valid or not. Even when they decide to voice it out, it's not only ignored but disregarded, because "what do women know about their own experiences?"

Men frequently feel compelled to explain something to a woman, even if she hasn't asked for it, and it's usually about something that is squarely in the woman's field of expertise and not at all in the man's. Or when the subject is a woman's personal experience, and the man wishes to communicate it to her. The question is where does this entitlement come from?
