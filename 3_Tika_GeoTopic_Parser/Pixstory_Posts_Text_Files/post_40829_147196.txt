Endless unfolding of words of ages And mine a word of the modern the word En Masse A word of the faith that never balks Here or henceforward it is all the same to me I accept Time absolutely It alone is without flaw it alone rounds and completes all That mystic baffling wonder alone completes all I accept Reality and dare not question it Materialism first and last imbuing Hurrah for positive science long live exact demonstration Fetch stonecrop mixt with cedar and branches of lilac This is the lexicographer this the chemist this made a grammar of the old cartouches These mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown seas This is the geologist this works with the scalpel and this is a mathematician Gentlemen to you the first honors always Your facts are useful and yet they are not my dwelling I but enter by them to an area of my dwelling Less the reminders of properties told my words And more the reminders they of life untold and of freedom and extrication And make short account of neuters and geldings and favor men and women fully equipt And beat the gong of revolt and stop with fugitives and them that plot and conspire Walt Whitman
