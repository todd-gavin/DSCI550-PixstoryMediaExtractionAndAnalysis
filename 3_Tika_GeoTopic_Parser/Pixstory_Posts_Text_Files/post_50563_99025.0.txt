I am a bit of an introvert and shy and often hesitate to speak for myself. But mother isn't like that. She is one of the most courageous women I have ever seen and this is something I truly want to inherit from my mother. I grew up seeing how she stood up for her right and that built an inspiration in me. She used to teach me that you have to speak up for yourself or else, people will use you for their will.

Not only that, I grew up seeing my mother juggling with her health as well. I was almost 1-2 years old , when she went for her surgery in legs. Her life hasn't been easy for her ever. There used to be a time when she used to be severely sick struggling with her pain, acidity , arthritis, fatigue and whatnot and sometimes  so severe that she lands up in the hospital. But she was so courageous, she still survives. She has seen a lot in her life and seeing her motivates me to move ahead without any fear.üñ§‚ù§Ô∏è
