Hong kong skipper Nizakat Khan lavished praise on Suryakumar on his unbeatable knock of 68 off just 26 balls, saying that it was nice to watch and rued the slip - ups made by his bowlers in the death overs.
Surya's incredible innings lifted India to massive total of 192 with just loss of 2 wickets. Former skipper Virat Kohli accompanied him to finish the innings off in style.
The bowlers also done a fine job by restricting opposition to 152 with the fall of 5 wickets. India stands first on the point table and most probably will succeed to playoff to achieve hat- trick on Asia cup title.
