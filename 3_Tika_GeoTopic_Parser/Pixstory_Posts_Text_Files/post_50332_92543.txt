As we reached Dhansa from Rohtas we could meet some tractors going both uphill and downhill who were looking at us with surprise since they had not seen the police indulging in such risks frequently As planned we reached Dhansa around am and after counting the heads advanced ahead I along with the DFO and ASP Sasaram were seated in a civilian Tavera vehicle often used as a tactical mislead for the Maoists in such areas while SDPO Dehri moving in the front was seated in a regular police jeep The forest road we were moving upon was seen like a patch of red between lush green forests with routes into villages quite clearly marked by the absence of patches of vegetation and tire marks The school of Soli was about a km from the main Rohtas Adhaura forest road As we approached Soli Mithileshji SDPO Dehri having visited the village much earlier got confused and turned into the wrong road My driver Indradeo Yadav hailing from a village near Adhaura noticed the mistake and being very familiar with the terrain took the lead bringing my civilian vehicle into the front A Bullet Proof Gypsy with young constables of Bihar Military Police st Battalion were just behind my vehicle followed by the SDPO Dehri and his escort vehicle The STF was behind along with the SAP contingent which was seated in an Anti Landmine vehicle The STF was moving in about vehicles which included an Anti Landmine vehicle With the contingent of these vehicles and about men we were moving at good speed on the forest roads as we took a turn for Soli
