The Istituto Nazionale Tumori Regina Elena IRE is marching fast in the continuous implementation of models of personalized and precision medicine in oncology. very high number of genomic alterations a job unthinkable until a few years ago Each of these alterations and there are hundreds of them can be the target of targeted therapies that are more effective and better tolerated by patients The goal is to promptly associate a specific drug with the unique molecular profile of the tumor each patient Only in were tests carried out on tumor tissue to identify target therapies and approximately NGS tests on white blood cells in order to define predisposition to neoplastic diseases on a family heir The use of various NGS solutions the expertise to design solutions also for rare tumors and designed on a single patient had a special recognition from the European Consortium ICPerMed as the best research in precision medicine in Europe for the year In five years of activity highlights Gennaro Ciliberto IRE Scientific Director the number of NGS analyzes for diagnostic and clinical purposes has increased exponentially until to the more tests of the last year The tumors profiled are mainly lung colorectal breast and melanoma because they are those where the therapeutic opportunities are maximum In the case of the most frequent form of lung carcinoma, for example, the percentage of patients has increased in which it is possible to find mutations sensitive to action of specific drugs and today constitutes more than the cases The Institute has a variety of so-called tumor agnostic NGS solutions, i.e. gene panels that offer the opportunity to associate the right drug for each tumor with each genomic alteration and the expertise to design global solutions dedicated to single pathologies and single patients with particular attention to rare tumors orphan pathologies young subjects and abnormal pathological conditions
