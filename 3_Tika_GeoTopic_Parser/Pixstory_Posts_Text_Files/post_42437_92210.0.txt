Just finished watching episode number two of the Marvel Studios’ web series “Moonknight.” After watching the episode I must say that Marvel is on the right track to change its image by making web series like this.

I had some problems in the first episode where I thought that the studio made action scenes half-heartedly and they should show more flight to make the series darker.

But after watching episode number two, I understood the whole idea of the director how will he make this series intense and dark for the audience.

Episode two began from the point where episode one ended and we got to know that Steven had a nightmare where he saw Marc vandalize his gift shop. Steven is still trying to figure that how these things are happening and how he and Marc exist in the same universe.

After this incident, he discovers many things about himself, Marc, Layla, scarab, Arthur, and Honshu, and plot by plot he allowed Marc to control his body and fight against the big hound dog.

I like this episode because the director takes his time to show the audience little details about the character which helps us to understand the character's psyche and why they are taking these types of actions.

As a fan of marvel studios, I can’t wait for the next episode and I am waiting that what will happen next.

You all should watch this series even if you are not a fan of Marvel’s movies and web series because I think this web series has the potential to bring a new audience.
