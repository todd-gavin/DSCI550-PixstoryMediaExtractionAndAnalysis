Prime Minister Scott Morrison has arrived at the Governor-General's house and is expected to confirm the date of the federal election later today. 

Morrison's the first Prime Minister in nearly 15 years to make this journey twice

Scott Morrison is the only Prime Minister in 14.5 years to have made the journey to see the Governor-General twice.

Greg Jennett just mentioned this on ABC News Channel as the PM was travelling along Dunrossil Dr.

"It was John Howard in October of 2007 who had called for himself for elections, didn't win that one obviously, but no Prime Minister since, not Rudd, not Gillard, not Abbott, nor Turnbull."
