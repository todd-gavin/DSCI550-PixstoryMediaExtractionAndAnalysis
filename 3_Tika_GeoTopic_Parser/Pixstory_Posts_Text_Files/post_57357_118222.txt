You would remember getting scolded for not sitting correctly and for lousy posture But it didn t make us realise what harm it can inflict on our health and body as it seemed comfortable and most of us were not bothered to pay attention to it But unfortunately bad posture has some severe effects and we should know it Back Pain One of the most commonly known side effects of poor posture is an unwanted strain on your upper and lower back Slouching forward puts pressure between your shoulder blades and causes you to flatten your back muscles If you notice pain below the neck and around your tailbone after a long day at work you are likely not sitting up straight Neck Pain Headaches Poor posture puts pressure on your posterior muscles which hurts your neck Whether your shoulders are hunched forward or your head is aimed downward the strain put on your neck by the tightness of these muscles can lead to tension headaches Poor Sleep Deficient posture can put your entire system of muscles in a compromising position For example if you cannot fully relax your body at night you may find yourself tossing and turning to find a comfortable place for your neck and back leading to hours of lost sleep Disrupted Digestion Sitting with bad posture can lead to digestive issues if you have an office job that requires you to stay at a desk most of the day Neglecting to pay attention to your posture can compress your organs slowing the digestive process and causing stomach issues Lack of Motivation When you do not sit up straight or stand with your shoulders back it can negatively impact your work ethic This is because your focus will be on feeling uncomfortable rather than the task Bad posture is also correlated to low self esteem per Health Psychology
