The NFL is asking a judge that a case filed against it by three Black coaches alleging racial hiring practises should be dismissed for a variety of reasons. 

US News reported that the league said in a statement posted Thursday ahead of a first hearing before a federal court in Manhattan that it will either request that coach Brian Flores and two other coaches' claims be forced into arbitration or be dismissed without a trial because they lack legal substance. 

Lawyers for the coaches and the NFL collaborated on the letter to inform the judge of each side's arguments ahead of the May 2 hearing.

Flores, who was fired as the head coach of the Miami Dolphins in January, claimed in his lawsuit that the NFL's racist hiring processes, particularly for coaches and general managers, left the organisation "rife with prejudice" despite its apparent condemnation of racism. 

Steve Wilks and Ray Horton, the other two coaches, joined Flores in the complaint earlier this month. 

Flores allegedly had a "sham interview" with the Denver Broncos in which team executives arrived an hour late and was cast as the "angry Black man" by the Dolphins after refusing to break recruiting rules and tank for a better draught pick, according to the NFL's lawyers.

“Defendants have not discriminated against Plaintiffs (or the Black coaches and general managers they purport to represent) on the basis of their race, nor have Defendants retaliated against Mr. Flores for filing this lawsuit,” the lawyers said.

Let’s see what happens next.
