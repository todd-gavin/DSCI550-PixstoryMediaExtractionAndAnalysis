Adding weight is absolutely a great way to make progress in the gym However it s far from the only way There are so many ways that you can make progress in the gym like adding some tempo to your reps Or maybe you use the same weight you have been using but you lock in your form to make it even better Or maybe you shorten the rest between your sets making it so that you have to perform the same amount of work in a shorter period of time Or maybe you try to add a rep or two to an exercise Whether it is something on this list or something else there are so many ways to create progressive overload and thats what matters when it comes to making improvements in the gym And remember its not always just adding more weight though there is nothing wrong with that Bottomline we all know that progress no matter how big or how small is the name of the game And there are a ton of ways that you can make progress Increase the amount of weight used Use a slower tempo like pause reps eccentric and isometrics Use the same weights but improve your form Decrease your rest between sets Add reps Add sets
