Luka Modric was grateful and at times emotional at the gala where he was awarded the MARCA Leyenda which places him on par with the greatest icons in the history of world sports The Croatian midfielder has been involved in some huge moments with Real Madrid in recent years notably the various comebacks in the Champions League knockout stages this season The most difficult one was the one against Manchester City because there was almost no time left but the team and the fans believed until the end because it s part of the DNA of this club Modric said In the end we did it The most fun was the PSG game it was or minutes of madness because it s very difficult to explain what happens on Champions League nights at the Bernabeu It was the start of many magical nights that have taken us to Paris and hopefully we can win another Champions League Real Madrid loves Modric Modric is a very loved figure in Madrid having won so much with Los Blancos I am aware of how much the fans love me they show it to me they show me every day I always try to give my best when I put on the Madrid shirt to repay that affection Madrid is everything it s my home I feel very happy at this club from the very first moment it s been something amazing I feel part of Madrid I am one more Madridista and that s for life Team Focus After receiving the award Modric admitted that he is happy to receive the individual accolade despite always focusing on the team I want to thank MARCA for this award It is an honour to receive such an award from such an important media outlet not only in Spain but all over the world Modric said
