The affection of the fans especially in the last league match in which Atalanta played against Empoli convinced Gasperini to stay in Bergamo Otherwise he most likely would have changed his mind after so many seasons so many great things done together but also after a difficult last season If they are still I&#39;m here because of the strong link with the city During the last match against Empoli I felt the strong demand from the people Stay in Bergamo This thing conditioned the choices because I was really ready to leave if the club wanted said Gasp to La Gazzetta dello Sport I stayed because I am convinced that in Bergamo there are the conditions for working well together and for building something that further strengthens the pride of belonging the Atalanta coach said again But the union must be founded on values not on results And then a topic on which Gasperini and the owners, both before and now, have often found themselves having to debate in recent years. Having the ambition to repeat ourselves is obvious, I&#39;m not talking about a goal, salvation but we cannot have the conviction that we are a big name We are not a big name Otherwise we will be unhappy with a draw and everything will become difficult the moment we understand what we are capable of doing to question ourselves starting from a lower level than the big ones because that&#39;s what the rankings said
