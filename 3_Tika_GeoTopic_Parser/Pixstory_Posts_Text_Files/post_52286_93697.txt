Social media is a space where one can interact with anyone You can find peope and spaces with similar interests The one thing i like about social media is its visual appearance and friendly user interface I really like those social media apps that have a very simple interface so that users are comfortable with using it The real time notifications is also something i admire on social media The one thing i dislike about social media is how fast a fake news can spread Also sometimes children are subjected to adult material on social media which is concerning One thing i would like to change about social media is giving more privacy to users
