Excercises For A Stronger Back At Home💪🏻!1. SupermanLie on your stomach and slowly, lift both your arms and legs simultaneously, as much as possible. Hold this position for as long as you comfortably can and keep looking straight ahead. 2. AquamanFor this variation of Superman, first lift your right arm and the left leg as much as you can. And when you bring the two down, lift your left arm and your right leg. Do both these movements as fast as possible. 3. SquatsFor those who didn’t know, since squats isometrically use both the lower and upper back, they’re a great workout to strengthen your spine too. Moving the hips back, bend the knees and hips to lower the torso and after pausing for a couple of seconds, return to the upright position.4. Cat StretchCome down on all fours and take a deep breath. As you exhale, push your belly towards your spine, curving your back to the ceiling. Hold this position for a few seconds and then, slowly bring your back down to normal.5. Dolphin KicksPlace your torso on a table or bench as you lie on your stomach and slowly, lift both your legs together in the air as high as you can. If lifting both the legs together is particularly tough, do it one leg at a time. Tell me more in notess..😍Thankyou💪🏻❤️.
