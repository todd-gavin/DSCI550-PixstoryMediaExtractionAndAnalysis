Since the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard case has gotten considerable media attention, there have been allegations of physical abuse from both sides. 
This brings into the light the idea of mutual abuse and why is it not essential to normalise it that both the partners are the victims. This misconception is meant to be eradicated so no one misuses it to protect them in a relationship.

Mutual abuse is deemed an oxymoron by many as it is hard to believe that both the partners in a relationship can be abusive.
Abuse victims can and do respond to their abuser's actions. However, it is not always the injuries that justify any abuse; instead, it is how a person uses his power to have control over their partner and exploit them.
The gendered power dynamic is quite common as most stories involve men abusing women, which is not always accurate as women can also be abusive in a relationship. Abuse also occurs in a same-sex relationships. 

The United Nations’ definition of domestic abuse notes that abuse is a “pattern of behaviour in any relationship used to gain or maintain power and control over an intimate partner.”
So, abuse occurs when either one of the partners tries to exploit or manipulate the other; according to this statement by the UN, if the power balance feels “mutual,” then a relationship may be unhealthy, unpleasant, painful or traumatising. But it’s not abuse. 

It is not always crucial that abuse victims don't react or respond to violence; they tend to punch their partner back if they are treated wrong. Fighting for their autonomy, they tend to do things that maybe be unacceptable, but self-defence or responding to the abuser cannot be called abuse. Everyone should deny the idea of mutual abuse as it foments a battle for someone vulnerable.
