5 Signs you're in a TOXIC Relationship.
1. Avoiding difficult conversations and trying to pretend that things are fine when they are not.
2. Instead of talking about the problems with the person you are dating, telling your friends about your relationship issues.
3. Ignoring the fact that you and your partner are deeply incompatible and continuing to be with them because you don't want to be alone.
4. Posting a quote on your story to describe how you're feeling but not communicating your true feelings to the person you're with.
5. Keeping track of everything that upsets you in order to bring it up in a future fight rather than sharing your feelings in the moment.
Stay away from these behaviours if you want to be in a happy, healthy relationship.
