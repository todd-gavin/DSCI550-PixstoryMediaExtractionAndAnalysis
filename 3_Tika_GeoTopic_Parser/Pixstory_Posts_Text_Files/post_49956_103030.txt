When police departments budgets are cut violence and civilian injuries increase and departments turn to taxation by citation to raise money Low wages force many officers to take extra jobs leaving them tired and incapable to deal with a high stress police situation During the recession many police departments were urged to cut officers as federal funding lessened If properly financed they could focus on crimes rather than fundraising What s up with different laws for police in different states The police department is very unorganised in America like many laws as a country we have to make sure safety measures and military options like the locally patrolled police come under one single umbrella and have rules payment given regularly by the government for the job they do Police should not depend on public donations for their survival The level of police misconduct is overstated more not fewer police are being called for in crime ridden areas and reforms are both possible and benefited by a majority of Americans If police departments were reformed to focus on policing black neighbourhoods the same way they police wealthy white neighbourhoods police violence would lessen Black neighbourhoods suffer from under policing as police officers focus on traffic and drug stops they should care about the protection of all Americans Police departments should not be dissolved but held to systematic national regulations which should comply with international human rights laws The Equal Justice Initiative EJI suggests many federal reforms comprising ending the transfer of military equipment to police departments a provision that police departments concede their racial inequalities and grievances mandatory racial biases training and eradicating qualified immunity which protects officers from being sued for wrongful death Police in other countries use of force policies is stricter than in the United States Officers in Europe train for an average of three years compared to about months for Americans This will lead to a more efficient police department
