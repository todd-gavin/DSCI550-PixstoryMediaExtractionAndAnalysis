Now that I ve had experience as a coach I ve come to realise how basic knowledge I was imparted with when I was playing football We were never taught a particular playing style or what the formation of the team was We were just taught passing and drills When I was doing my coaching licenses I found that the football that was much more tactical The first three licences were relatively easy they were the main basics of the game combination play ball control and other things The real challenge was the A Licence as it was about new types of playing styles we were made to learn how the defence line would operate and how the midfield is supposed to operate in a team I wasn t able to score as much as my instructor expected I was good in skills demonstrations and even theory but I just left I was lacking something After this setback my instructor advised me that I should either work work for an I League team as that would help me get better I started working with the Women s team of Pune FC having not cleared the A Licence I started reading a lot of books related to football and also began to watch games more frequently In I finally got my A Licence I got my C Licence in B Licence in and finally the A Licence I m glad that I took so much time in between as it helped me garner much experience and knowledge regarding the beautiful game Along with these licences I got one licence for coaching goalkeepers as in the Women s team there usually isn t a proper goalkeeping coach The GK has become an important part in modern football as the attack starts from the goalkeeper in possession based football I also got a licence to become an instructor to coaches so that I could impart my own learnings to the new coaches Finally I have one to be a grass root instructor as well I ve come to the conclusion that when it comes to Football a person never stops learning
