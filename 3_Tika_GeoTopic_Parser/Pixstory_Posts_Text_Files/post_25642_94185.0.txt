Last year, there is a very strange thing that I noticed about my own town. 
In some nights of sheer darkness, when not even the moon is the lightðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµ, you can see zillions of stars stuck in the widespread sheet of darkness that covers the entire Dharchula, my hometown. It is a well known fact that the mobile phone cameras ,let alone the DSLRs, fail to pull off the task of capturing the reality of night, moon, and stars as we see them through our naked eyes, and I would like to assert that it is not really about the number of pixels that the cameras have, it is rather about the fact that emotions, feelings, and everything that surrounds us ; whispers, noises, dust, wind, time and so on are fleeting and sadly cannot be captured in a mechanical device called camera. But I think its still not so bad or maybe even for good of the mankind that we can't capture everything in camera because that will simply take away the exclusivity and the value of the moment when we live it. Life is supposed to be lived, not captured.  
But anyways, so, what was the strange thing that I was meaning to tell you ? When in those extra dark nights, filled with stars, you look at the sky and may think how beautiful all these stars are, how far away they are from us, and how some of them are not even there anymore, just their light reaching our innocent eyes that believe for a second that its all there, existing, you might be romanticising over something that is not even the light of star let alone the star itself. Yes, some of the lights that you see in that sky are not coming from stars but from widely scattered houses situated in the mountains that surround us.
People over there do farming for their livelihood and will turn on the lights outside their houses in night. I figured this out quite lately in my life since I would mostly be out in night when there was a full moon or a powercut. Good night!ðŸŒƒ
