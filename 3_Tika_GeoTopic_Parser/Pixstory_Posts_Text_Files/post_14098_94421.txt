Veerapandiya Kattabomman The very name brings out feelings of valour patriotism and pride in our martial heritage This monument in Kayathar is where the warrior was hanged Needless to say this monument is the beginning of our eternal homage to this valiant son of the soil Associated with the Tamil Matinee star Chevalier Shivaji Ganesan who is said to have acquired the land and sponsored the construction of the monument this historical landmark is easily accessible as it is situated on the national highway Clean and decently maintained this monument has great potential to further propagate his history The government of Tamil Nadu could bring this under ASI or state archaeology department Souvenirs and books about Kattabomman could be sold The potential is great Right now the Mandapam utilises only one floor to exhibit a few paintings in addition to a larger than life statue of the warrior Definitely a must visit site for history buffs and patriots
