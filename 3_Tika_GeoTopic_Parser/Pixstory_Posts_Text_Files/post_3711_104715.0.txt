Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR), is the way of crafting audio-visual communication that tingles the sensory feeling of the viewers by whispering the dialogues, making the viewers feel calm and thereby nailing the brand in their minds. Many viewers might feel goosebumps several times while watching/listening to the video or audio. These are called ‘oddly satisfying’ or ‘wholesome’ videos in layman's language.

ASMR started gaining popularity in the year 2016, however, the first video that BestMediaInfo.com found during research is from the year 2014 when a YouTuber discussed the sensation for the first time, then in collaboration with The Washington Post.

So, what is so unique about this sensation that people went crazy about it and would watch such videos on loop? Rajni Daswani, Director - Digital Marketing, SoCheers, said, “Imagine you have come to our office for a meeting, and while you wait, you hear the steely voice of the lift doors opening and closing, and the dim sounds of chatter behind glass doors. Someone offers you a can of coke and you hear the fizz when it's opened, and then the bubbling sound of liquid pouring into a glass. These sounds activate some sort of a tingling sensation around the scalp and move down the back of the neck and upper spine; and are popularly known as ASMR.”

“When sensation can be evoked with sounds and videos, it gives brands a chance to experience their brand, instead of simply seeing posters or creatives. With this trend getting hugely popular on video apps like YouTube and TikTok, brands saw it as a good opportunity to indulge in and build a more experiential connection with their audience,” she added.
