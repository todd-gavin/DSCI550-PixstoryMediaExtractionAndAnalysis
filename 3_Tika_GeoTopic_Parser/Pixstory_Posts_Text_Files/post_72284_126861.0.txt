An individual who was formerly wanted by Arsenal but turned down a transfer to the club in 2020 is now being pursued by Nottingham Forest.

Houssem Aouar, a midfielder for Lyon, is close to finalizing a transfer to the City Ground after his earlier attempt to join Real Betis fell through. The 24-year-old Frenchman's contract with the French club has just one year left, and he reportedly wants to play in the Premier League.

This summer, Forest have already added 14 players to their roster, with the signings of Emmanuel Dennis and Cheikhou Kouyate being officially announced on Saturday night.

After receiving serious interest from Arsenal two summers ago, Aouar had previously been linked to a transfer to the Premier League. However, Aouar's rejection of a move and Mikel Arteta's team's failure to meet Lyon's rumored Â£55.5 million value prevented the Gunners from signing him.

Later on , he provided an explanation for his choice to remain in France, addressing Telefoot, "I thought that I could still contribute to this squad in some way." I wished to carry on the journey with the group that had raised me. We need to do better, so we must lift our heads.

Aouar, who graduated from the Lyon academy, signed with the team in 2009 when he was just 11 years old. Since then, he has played 215 professional matches for the club, scoring 40 goals and providing 35 assists. He has one France cap and started last weekend's home Ligue 1 debut for Lyon against Ajaccio, but was removed after only 30 minutes.

In addition, if Aouar's transfer from Lyon is successful in the coming days, he won't be the final player to sign with Forest. Remo Freuler of Atalanta and Neal Maupay of Brighton have both been linked to Steve Cooper's team.
