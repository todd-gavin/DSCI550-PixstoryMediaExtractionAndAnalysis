The Ukraine international got emotional after securing the English crown with his side on Sunday. Oleksandr Zinchenko dedicated Manchester City’s Premier League title win to the people of Ukraine.

The City star was reduced to tears as the Premier League trophy was draped with the Ukrainian flag in tribute to the victims of Russia’s invasion of the country.

Zinchenko, who has been open about the emotional toil the conflict in his country has had on him, spoke of his national pride as his side celebrated their success.

What has Zinchenko said about Man City’s title ?

Speaking after City beat Aston Villa 3-2 to retain the league crown on the final day of the season, Zinchenko told Sky Sports, “Unforgettable emotions for me - for all Ukrainians who are at the moment starving and surviving in my country because of Russian aggression.”

“I am so proud to be Ukrainian and bring this title to Ukraine, for all the people because 
they deserve it.”

“It means everything to me. I would rather die for these people and their support. What people gave me and what they have done for me during this period, the most difficult period of my life, I am so appreciative and I will never forget this in my life.”

“At some point, at the beginning of the war, I did not think about football because it is 
impossible to live and know what is happening in my country. But with all the support I have had, we did it.”

“I hope we will always keep going because this amazing club deserves all of it.”
