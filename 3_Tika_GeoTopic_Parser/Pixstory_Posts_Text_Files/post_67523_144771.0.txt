On June 5, 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the advancing of the target year for 20% ethanol-blending by five years to 2025, a high-priority national goal. The blending programme aims to lessen India’s dependence on costly oil imports.
Broken or partly damaged rice are remnants from paddy dehusked by mills. It is a key source of poultry feed as well as a raw material from which ethanol is made.
The country will need 11 billion litres of ethanol to meet the target 20% blending target, according to official projections. Since that target cannot be met by molasses alone, which is a by-product of sugar, the country permitted the use of grains for manufacturing ethanol, which is blended with petrol, in 2018-19.
In 2020-21, the government allowed the Food Corporation of India (FCI), the Centre’s main food stockpiler, to sell specific quantities to grain-based ethanol distilleries.
In the so-called ethanol supply year 2021-22, FCI allotted 1.3 million tonne of rice for the purpose. Of this, distilleries lifted 505,935 tonne up till August 28 2022, up from 49,000 tonne in the previous year, the food ministry’s data shows.
As a global food crisis took hold, and wheat became scarce due to the Ukraine war, the export of broken rice soared, pushing up prices. “Countries desperate for food began importing broken rice from India,” said Anshul Singh, the proprietor of Santoshi Impex, a food trading firm.
During April-August 2022, the export of broken rice stood at 2.1 million tonne, up from 1.5 million tonne in the corresponding period of the previous year. When compared to a base period of April-August 2019, this represents a 4178% jump, the data showed.
Importers of broken rice included Djibouti, a country in the Horn of Africa, Indonesia, Senegal and even China, the food ministry’s data show.
FCI rice cost distilleries about ₹20 per kg, while broken rice, although unfit for human consumption, was selling at ₹21-22. It costs the FCI about ₹41 per kg to procure, transport, and store rice.
Higher broken rice prices also pressured poultry breeders, who shifted to other grains such as maize.
