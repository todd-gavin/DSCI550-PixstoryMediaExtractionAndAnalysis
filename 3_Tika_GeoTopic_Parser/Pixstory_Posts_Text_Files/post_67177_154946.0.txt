The Sky Mile Tower is a mini-city project under Japan's "Next Tokyo" plan, and is expected to be finished by the year 2045.

It will be five times taller than the Paris' Eiffel Tower and double the height of the Bhuj Khalifa.

It will not be just a building but, a tiny city, intended to fight climate change. It will have 421 floors in total,  which will be able to house 55,000 people. 

To achieve the best wind resistance, the structure would be hexagonal in shape.

Water will be immediately filtered from the atmosphere and kept outside of the structure. 

The tower will be a hub for everything, Including commercial, residential and agricultural activities. 

Elevator without cables would be used to move both vertically and horizontally throughout the tower.
