Butter boards the latest viral sensation The latest TikTok trend which I have to read about unfortunately because I can t access TikTok in India is something known as a butter board It s exactly as simple as it sounds it s a good sized smear of butter on a wooden board You can dress it up or down popular toppings include things like honey bacon sun dried tomatoes anchovies flaky sea salt herbs chilli flakes and so on It s something you can serve to guests along with a crusty baguette perhaps or freshly toasted bread The chef who inspired the TikTok video Joshua McFadden wanted it to serve as an alternative to the much vaunted charcuterie board and had this to say of it Bread and butter all by itself is one of the perfect things in life Good butter grass fed real butter the yellow almost cheeselike butter is popping up at farmers markets in small batches and is even showing up on supermarket shelves Butter has gotten a bad rap but finally the nutrition world is realizing that it s actually quite good for us So what do you think Will you be trying one
