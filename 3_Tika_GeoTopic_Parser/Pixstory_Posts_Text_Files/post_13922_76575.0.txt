The NBA Rookies have always been a topic discussion as they represent the next generation of talent and hence their progress is always measured and analyzed. We have passed the halfway point of the season this year and the Rookies from the 2021 Draft have shown tremendous upside, but some have also been a little disappointing.

Cade Cunningham

Cade struggled in the first month of the season but now he seems to have settled in Detroit and is showing everybody why he was picked No. 1 in the Draft. In his last 22 games, Cade is averaging 17.5 points, 4.6 REB, 5.5 AST on 44.4%-38.9%-83.7% shooting splits

Jalen Green

Jalen was labeled as one of the best scoring talents in the Draft and his experience in the G League would make him more NBA-ready than other rookies. However, he has been inconsistent this season shooting 38.1% FG% and 29.8% 3P%. Although he has shown promising flashes which should excite Rockets fans.

Evan Mobley

My pick for Rookie of the Year, Mobley has been the best rookie so far this season as his 2-way dominance has made the Cavs into one of the best defenses in the league. He is versatile enough to be a rim protector as well as a switchable defender on the outside. Offensively, he is averaging 15 PTS, 8.2 REB, 2.7 AST on 51%-30.4%-67.4% shooting splits. He also displaying a promising jumpshot which should develop in the future

Scottie Barnes

A surprising 4th pick in the 2021 Draft, Barnes has shut down all his doubter by being one of the most well-balanced contributors in the Draft Class. He uses his strong and long frame to maneuver his way to the basket, he has great court vision for a forward and he is also a solid defender.

Franz Wagner

Unexpectedly, Wagner is now in the Rookie of the Year race due to his ability to create offense for himself averaging 15.4 PTS, 4.8 REB, 2.9 AST on 45.3%-33.5%-84.7% shooting splits.
