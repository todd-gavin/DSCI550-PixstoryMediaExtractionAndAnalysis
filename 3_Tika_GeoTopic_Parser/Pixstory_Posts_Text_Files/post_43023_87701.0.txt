European leaders who made a long, hazardous journey by rail from Poland to Kyiv in a show of support as the city came under further Russian attack.

The prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday evening as a curfew began in Kyiv.

Afterwards, the Czech leader told Ukrainians that they were "not alone".

They are the first Western leaders to visit Ukraine since Russia invaded.

"We admire your brave fight," Petr FialaÂ wrote in a tweet. "We know that you're also fighting for our lives. You're not alone, our countries stand by your side."
