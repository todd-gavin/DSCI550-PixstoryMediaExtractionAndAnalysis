With the exhibition TRINITY SITE by Lucas Memmola Bari curated by Fabio Avella and Lara Gaeta from April to June, the Milan branch of the aA Project Room gallery proposes a reflection on the physical and psychological condition of the human being located in an underground context which on the one hand protects and shelters from the other inevitably isolates and confuses TRINITY SITE not only the title of the exhibition but a toponym that is identified with the space itself of the gallery which for the occasion changes its appearance presenting itself as an underground refuge literally a tripartite site where each space corresponds to an extract poetic of the experience of a human being suspended between life, survival and transformation. When one crosses the threshold, the visitor therefore has the sensation of being in an epochal moment of transition that brings together the past and the future at the same time. In TRINITY SITE one experiences a sensation lack of loneliness and adaptation is a place where the ways of life and habits of human beings are questioned With this site specific work the artist creates a vertical parallelism in which the physical environment represents the possible catastrophic future of civilization which is closely connected to an existential condition of the human soul The artist identifies in the spiritual transformation the starting point for implementing a change on the physical level by going through an inevitable moment of transition TRINITY SITE a concrete metanarrative that gravitates around the traces of a man who slowly evolves like a chrysalis highlighting the will of the human species to always tend towards life The artist&#39;s works were created thanks to the technical support of Fabrizio Romano Genovese
