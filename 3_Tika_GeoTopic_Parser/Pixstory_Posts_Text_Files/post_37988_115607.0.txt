Chelsea FC have secured a massive defensive signing! The Blues have completed the move for Napoli star Kalidou Koulibaly to bolster their depleted backline as per Fabrizio Romano. 

The London-based club lost out on Christensen and Rudiger in the summer transfer window on free transfers. Hence Thomas Tuchel had made it clear that he wanted to add defenders in order to improve Chelsea's chances to secure a title next season. 

Kalidou Koulibaly has been a long-term target for the Blues. The London-based club attempted to sign the defender last season however Napoli were hesitant to let their player leave. 

However, things have changed this time around and Chelsea have reportedly agreed on personal terms with the defender. A transfer fee of £35-40 million is yet to be agreed upon by the clubs. 

Chelsea are reportedly offering Koulibaly €10m per year in terms of signing. The defender will sign for the Blues in a 5-year deal that would keep him at the club until 2027.

Following this, the Blues are expected to sign another defender with City's Nathan Ake and Juventus' Matthijs De Ligt high on their wishlist. It has to be seen if Chelsea can add on to their squad in the coming days.
