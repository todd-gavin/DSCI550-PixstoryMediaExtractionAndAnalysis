The Millennium Challenge Corporation Nepal Compact, an American grant worth $500 million, has led to tensions on the streets of Nepal with the student wings of Communist parties of Nepal organising protests leading to violence. Last week, a general strike led to the closing of schools and some violence, including the police firing teargas shells and beating up protesters.

The Compact agreement was signed in September 2017 with the US allocating $500 million grant for various development projects. 

But why are the protests taking place now? 

Critics in Nepal, who include the coalition partners of the ruling government, consider the MCC project affects national sovereignty. The Parliament ratifying it would mean that it would override some of the country’s laws. Some also see it as part of US’s Indo-Pacific Strategy with containing China as the primary objective.

Government officials argue that it is a “gift” that Nepal doesn’t have to repay the loan and that there are no conditions to avail the loan expect that that the Parliament should ratify it. It is done so that the funds are used for the projects they are meant for, even if the government of the day changes.

Since Nepal’s communist parties are considered close to the Chinese, these protests are seen as China's handiwork.

While the Communists are holding the protests, ironically, the now-dissolved Nepal Communist Party (NCP) led by KP Sharma Oli had mooted the MCC's ratification in June 2019. (https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/govt-tables-mcc-pact-amid-obstructions-in-parliament)

In the meantime, the government has gone ahead and tabled the MCC in the Parliament with Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba expressing confidence that it will be ratified despite opposition from the coalition partners.
