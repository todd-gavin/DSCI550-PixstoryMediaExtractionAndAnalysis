Even with fall just around the corner,🍂 Kendall Jenner isn't hanging up her minidresses just yet. 👗❤
The model was spotted in New York City 🗽wearing the perfect summer-to-fall transitional outfit, the centerpiece of which was a speckled light gray minidress💃 with black spaghetti straps and a black hem. She upped the ante with a pair of under-the-knee pointed stiletto boots in dark chocolate brown🤎👢. Finally, she finished the look with rectangular sunglasses,🕶 a matching shoulder bag👜, and delicate hoop earrings.🌙❤
