A peak in the pandemic is being noticed and the rise is going high in China. The surge in China was followed by an unexpected wave in Hong Kong from early February. 

In India the third wave is coming to an end and the life is almost nearing to certain restrictions being removed that existed for two years. Furthermore restrictions will soon move away if the numbers of the cases maintain the same or gets more lower. 

No new variant 

Thankfully in the current wave the resurgence is not due to the emergence of any fast spreading variant. As of now none of the variants have been found yet, which gives us some relief. Currently the rise in Hong Kong and China is the Omicron variant itself which started showing up late. 

Relaxations in restrictions 

In United States and Europe things are going back to normal and prepandemic scenario are coming up. But in India things are different but let's hope it soon turns to pre pandemic period.
