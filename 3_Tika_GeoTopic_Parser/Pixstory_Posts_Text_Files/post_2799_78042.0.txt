Of late, North Korea’s missile scientists have been on overdrive. It has done seven tests in one month. It saved the best for the last, launching the most potent missile since 2017. 

The North Korean dictator Kim Jung Un claims that the latest missile could reach to the continental U.S. According to Japan and South Korea observers, the latest missile travelled 1,242 miles into the air and landed in the sea.  

In September, North Korea launched ballistic missiles from a train, flexing its muscle and showing its capability to launch mobile missiles. Days before that, it launched a new type of long-range cruise missiles.

Experts say that North Korea wants to put pressure on the United States so that it can get some relief from the crippling economic sanctions that the country has been facing for several years now. The dictator has so far rejected the Biden administration’s efforts to engage the country. Experts have been suggesting that North Korea could take “incremental steps” in the testing sphere depending on the response of the U.S. (https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-north-korea-likely-to-escalate-tensions-to-gain-leverage/6232351.html)

Pyongyang’s aggressive moves is a well-honed strategy of breaking international norms and launching missiles to gain leverage in the now stalled negotiations with the U.S. The moves also suggest that North Korea could take more incremental steps and move even fully activate its nuclear program. If Kim’s only aim is to attract the attention of the U.S., his steps to launch missiles are seen as good signs. (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-60150121)

The talks between the U.S. and North Korea last took place in 2019 when a summit between Donald Trump and Kim failed after Trump shot down Pyongyang’s demands in exchange for stopping the nuclear program.
