When I won the Gold Medal in 2016 in Junior Nationals, next year I was again selected for the Nationals and this time around I wanted to give an even better performance. For that I had to train even harder and train at better facilities, I was helped by Nakachari Sports Association and the Jorhat Power-lifting association to avail a  better training facility. I used to travel from Jorhat to Shikshagarh every morning around 6 A.M. even in the winters of December to train in the gym there. After training till 8:30 A.M. I used to travel back to Jorhat to go to my college.
This was my routine till I completed my graduation in 2016 and after that I rented a room in Shikshagarh. It was not  easy to handle all this due to not having proper financial means. This was the time when I started working in a shop to sustain my training but this didn't leave me with much time for training so I had to quit this job. After this I started working at a Swimming Pool facility that gave me the time to focus on weightlifting. By sacrificing many things and working really hard that how I've won the medals that I have.
