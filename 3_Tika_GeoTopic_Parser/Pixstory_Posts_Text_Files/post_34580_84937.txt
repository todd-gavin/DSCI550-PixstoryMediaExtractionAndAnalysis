The World Swimming Championships in Budapest are approaching, scheduled from June to July. The FINA International Swimming Federation has announced something new and that lane swimming will take place in the first part instead of the second as per tradition. Translated, it means that the the day after the inaugural ceremony, lane swimming will begin in the Duna Arena and continue until June Only after that will there be room for diving until July and for cross-country skiing scheduled from to June This novelty pleases Gregorio Paltrinieri who at the one-year Europeans he conquers three golds before being struck by mononucleosis S much better the program is always a bit crowded but everything is very close so that&#39;s okay
