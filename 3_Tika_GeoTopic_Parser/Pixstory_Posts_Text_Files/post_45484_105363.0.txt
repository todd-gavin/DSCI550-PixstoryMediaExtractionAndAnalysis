Germany and England both made disappointing starts to the UEFA Nations League and will be looking to amend things as they face off in Group 3 League A in Munich on Tuesday night.

Germany were held by Italy to a 1 - 1 draw while England lost out 1 - 0 to Hungary.

Germany will be disappointed to not take all 3 points away in their match against Italy, where they wasted a lot of chances. Germany find themselves unbeaten in 10 matches across all competitions. 

England put on a very lethargic performance against Hungary, with players visibly fatigued and unable to create an impression on the match. Southgate must rotate to inspire a better performance. 

Germany vs England: Probable Playing XI

Germany: Manuel Neuer (GK); Thilo Kehrer, Antonio Rudiger, Niklas Sule, David Raum; Joshua Kimmich, Ilkay Gundogan; Serge Gnabry, Thomas Muller, Leroy Sane; Kai Havertz

England: Jordan Pickford (GK); Harry Maguire, John Stones, Reece James; Kalvin Phillips, Declan Rice, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Bukayo Saka; Jack Grealish, Raheem Sterling, Harry Kane

Germany vs England: Predictions

Germany will need to put on their shooting boots if they want to win this match. However, they create enough chances which should see them through. Rivals England will need to shake up tactics if they want to play inspiring football, something they seem unable to do under manager Gareth Southgate. 

Prediction: Germany 2 - 0 England
