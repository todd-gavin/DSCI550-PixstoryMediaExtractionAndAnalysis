I think it's always the high end requirements and amenities that make the gym quite a tougher option.
You need proper gym and equipment and it cannot be performed without accessories.
This makes it even tougher for people to do exercises.
Besides that if you need a proper body building teaching then you deinitely need a trainer for targeted fitness.
A trainer would teach you and instead guide you for better workout.
This is the reason why gym is  quite expensive as it needs gym facility and a trainer.  Even at home version needs some equipment.
