In the trio's first appearance since the team's Champions League meltdown against Real Madrid, Neymar and Lionel Messi were both booed by PSG fans, while Kylian Mbappe was cheered.
All three men played the entire 90 minutes of PSG's 3-1 loss to Real Madrid, which sent them out of the Champions League 3-2 on aggregate.
Mbappe scored in both legs of the tie, avoiding the wrath of the Parc des Princes faithful, but Neymar and Messi were both jeered whenever they touched the ball during the early stages of their most recent Ligue 1 outing against Bordeaux.
The boos began when the names of Neymar and Messi were announced as both sets of players lined up before kickoff, and they continued for the first 30 minutes.

PSG look to have been mocked by the Mayor of Marseille, who posted a single star emoji at the end of PSG's Champions League loss.
PSG appeared to be easing their way into the Champions League quarter-finals this season when Kylian Mbappe scored the opening goal at Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday, putting them two goals ahead on aggregate.
Karim Benzema, a France international, had the final say, scoring a magnificent hat-trick in the second half to ensure the Blancos' spot in the last eight.
As the final whistle blew in the Spanish capital, wild celebrations erupted among home players and fans, Marseille's major, Benoit Payan, posted a single star emoji on Twitter, which is thought to be a homage to a lone French success in Europe.
