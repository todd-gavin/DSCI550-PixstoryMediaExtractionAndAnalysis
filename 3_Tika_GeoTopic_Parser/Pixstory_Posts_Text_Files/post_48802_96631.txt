You say queer representation in children s cartoons is propaganda in the new age shows which is pretty funny because in most of old cartoons racism pedophilia sexism and even sexual assault were romanticized to the point children though they were okay Now THAT S something I d like to call propaganda When you think about it the stories of Snow White and Sleeping Beauty which talk of a princess being roused up by a prince s kiss are actually about sexual assault on an unconscious person You may believe I m breaking the illusion but these stories promote sexual assault and I want everyone to be aware of that Prince Florian was a year old man Snow White was only a year old child Do you understand just how problematic that is A grown man sees a sleeping child and kisses her Oh and do I have to talk about his necrophiliac tendencies too But nope that was innocent romance made for kids amirite The Disney film Lady and the Tramp depicts two Siamese cats as racist caricatures of Asian people It couldn t be more clear with their slanted eyes clich d East Asian accents and entrance song featuring a gong sound But that s okay For kids it is Johnny Bravo s toxic masculinity or the hypersexualization of Sara Bellum in Powerpuff Girls Everything was okay But inclusivity of queer characters is what gets too political
