The England midfielder might well be in possession of the city's keys at Leeds. There's little to
no doubt that Phillips would be happy to spend the remainder of his career at Elland Road since
he has been a lifelong supporter of the Whites and his entire family is also 100% loyal to Leeds.

The 26-year-old can expect to play in the Champions League, win trophies, and take a
significant step up in his career with Manchester City, who have reached an agreement with
Leeds to sign him.

The midfielder might easily become a champion of the top division within a
year, following in the footsteps of Jack Grealish, who left his home in Aston Villa last season.

In Pep Guardiola's 4-3-3 formation, Phillips would fight with Rodri for the starting defensive
midfield position. Rodri was one of City's key players last season.

Rodri, who concluded the
season with the most effective passes in the opposing half and the joint-most possessions won
in the Premier League, set the pace for City's play last year, underscoring his domination all
over the field.

The difference in City's victory percentage with and without the Spanish midfielder emphasises
how important he is to the team. When Rodri is absent from the field, Guardiola's team's win
percentage drastically decreases, and they also score much less goals.

According to statistics, City do not win when Rodri is at his most sloppy in possession.

Guardiola's team has only won one of the six Premier League games in which Rodri has misplaced the ball 15 or more times. That victory came against Everton in March of last year, a
game in which the Spaniard may have been too careless with the ball and should have given up
a penalty.
