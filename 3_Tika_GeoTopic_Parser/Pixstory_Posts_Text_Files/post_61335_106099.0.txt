The suspense around Frenkie de Jong’s future at Barcelona is growing day by day. After announcing many times that he is not willing to move to any club this summer, it seems de Jong is ready to make a move to Premier League. 

English club Manchester United, who are desperate to get the Dutch midfielder on-board under new manager Erik ten Hag, have opened the bidding for the Barca player.  

As per MARCA, United have made first bid of around €80 million (€60 million + €20 million) for De Jong. Although Xavi has claimed that he sees the midfielder as Barca’s future, Club’s financial weakness and desperation to reduce its wage bill might tempt the club to sell him.

According to Marca, De Jong “is becoming increasingly clear that his future is far from the Camp Nou” despite his recent comments saying Barca are his “dream club.”

Meanwhile, former Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has given his views on the whole transfer saga. The head coach of the Netherlands football team believes that De Jong is worth upwards of €112 million. 

“I already knew how important Frenkie is. I don’t need to see that anymore. Frenkie brings extra quality, that’s why he is worth €112 million,” Van Gaal told NOS.
