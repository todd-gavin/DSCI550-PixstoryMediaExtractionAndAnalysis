Mikel Arteta faced the media shortly after landing in Norway ahead of our Europa League group stage clash with Bodo\Glimt on Thursday night.The boss was asked about the challenge of playing on an artificial pitch, rotating his squad and the importance of us finishing top in the group.𝐎𝐧 𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐩𝐢𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐥𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐦 𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧…What we think about is how we are going to win the game. That’s it. How we win every three days, in different conditions, in different contexts, in different weather, in different competitions, and that’s the only way we are approaching it.𝐎𝐧 𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐢𝐬 𝐚 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐢𝐧𝐣𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬…We don’t know, a player can get injured on an artificial pitch, he can get injured in a training session. Obviously we do what we have to do to protect the players as much as we can, but at the end of the day, tomorrow for sure we are going to have 11 players on the pitch𝐎𝐧 𝐰𝐡𝐲 𝐆𝐚𝐛𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐥 𝐉𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐬 𝐡𝐚𝐬 𝐛𝐞𝐞𝐧 𝐥𝐞𝐟𝐭 𝐛𝐞𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐝…We felt that with everything he’s been through in the last few weeks that it would be better for him to stay at home.𝐎𝐧 𝐑𝐨𝐦𝐚’𝐬 𝟔-𝟏 𝐝𝐞𝐟𝐞𝐚𝐭 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞…I think I mentioned it before the home game, that what this team and this coaching staff has done in the last few years is remarkable. Especially in Europe, because it’s got more headlines to the rest of Europe, but without a question of doubt, the scores that they’ve had here explain themselves.𝐎𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐁𝐨𝐝𝐨 𝐬𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬…They were really loud, really passionate and I spoke to Martin about it. He mentioned to expect a great atmosphere here and it’s great. That’s why you travel into Europe as well.𝐎𝐧 𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐀𝐫𝐬𝐞𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐚 𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭 𝐧𝐨𝐰 𝐰𝐞 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐨𝐩…I don’t know how other coaches play their games against us, obviously Gaby (Jesus) is a player who gets involved in a lot of physical contact. That’s in his nature and its down to the referees to protect the players.
