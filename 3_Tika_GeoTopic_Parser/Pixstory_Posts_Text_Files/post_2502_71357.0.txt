The great Abdul Karim Khan of Kirana gharana for some years had in his company one Tipu Miyan. Tipu Miyan was his best friend until his passing away. They shared the same food and drink, even the same room. Wherever Khan Saheb went, Tipu Miyan accompanied him. Khan Saheb even gave him lessons on music and Tipu Miyan took as much as he could absorb.
Once at a music programme in the town of Satara where Khan Saheb was invited, Tipu Miyan was also billed to sing with him. The curtain went up and Khan Saheb stepped in with his two disciples who were to be on the tanpuras. Khan Saheb then gave a brief description of Tipu Miyan's forefathers and the training he had undergone. The crowd listened patiently. Khan Sahib called Tipu Miyan on to the stage. He immediately responded and took his seat next to him. Tipu Miyan had a string of pearls round his neck to draw the attention of the listeners.
“Thik se gaana Tipu Miyan ; yeh izzat ka sawal hai ” (Please sing well. It is a matter of prestige).
Tipu Miyan nodded confidently, little realising that he was to match “sur” with one of the all-time greats of classical music! Khan Sahib began -- “sa” and it was matched by Tipu Miyan's note very much in tune. Then Tipu Miyan followed Khan Saheb with “re”, “ga”, and so on to the “sa” on the higher octave, staying there without a quaver. The crowd cheered and Khan Sahib acknowledged it with folded hands!
Tipu Miyan was Khan Saheb's pet dog. There is no record of whether it was Khan Saheb's revenge on the audience or his effort at training man's best friend.
