Antony


This transfer should be taken with a grain of salt. Many top clubs are after this Brazilian. He plays as both right-winger and left-winger. In ETH’s Ajax, he usually played as an inverted right-winger. This season he has 8 goals and 4 assists to his name. The Dutch boss would do everything in his power to get him and Timber to the Old Trafford. But they would need to battle for his signature because it is rumoured Liverpool and other European clubs are after this pacey left-footed winger.

How will Ten Hag Use Cristiano Ronaldo?

Ten Hag needs to sit with Ronaldo and ask him if he can play high up the pitch at 37. He will demand that to give him at least 60 min on the pitch. Having scored 23 goals this season, Ten Hag would want him in his team. 

Ten Hag’s Style Of Play


Eth will set up a 4-2 -3-1 system with players, but it'll be a highly fluid and mobile system, with players interchanging their positions. Taking his Ajax side when they have the ball, we see their 2 wingers high up and wide stretching the pitch, a No 10(Bruno Fernandes) in the attacking midline, while another midfielder is joined by left-back and right-back, creating back 3 in the centre back, this shape resembles 3-2-5 formation., but as a proprietor of positional play, it resembles 3-2-2-3 formation.

A big part of positional play is to maintain horizontal and vertical lines with a maximum of 2 or 3 players in each line at a time. Rigidity in the team is what makes the positional rotation so frequent to retain the structure while using off the ball movement to manipulate the opponent, the attacking structure also provides a start point for ETH’s counter-press which sees his players swarm the opposition to regain the form. The formation will switch to 4-2-1-3 or 4-3-3 or 4-2-4 depending on the scenario. Expect ETH to implement his formation in the United team.
