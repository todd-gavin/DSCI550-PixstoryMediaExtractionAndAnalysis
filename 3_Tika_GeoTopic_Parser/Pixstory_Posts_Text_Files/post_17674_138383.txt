Since its introduction in the relationship between football and VAR has been toxic The Video Assistant Referee was introduced to aid the on field officials with decisions that needed proper examination Like the infamous Hand Of God But its initiation into football has always been a topic of discussion in the footballing world Many football fans believe that VAR is killing the thrill of the game The recent events that preceded the Premier League have further dampened the VAR s reputation The disallowed goal for West Ham against Chelsea was controversial and would have stood had the VAR not intervened It was a ball and the contact on Mendy was soft In the Post interview Moyes stated it s a ridiculously bad decision The VAR came into question again in Newcastle s clash against Palace Similar to West Ham the Geordies disallowed goal was controversial as well With both Eddie Howe and Amanda blasting the decision The replays showed Mitchell pushing Willock who crashed with the Palace keeper which resulted in the foul The shove by the Palace left back was clear but the VAR thought otherwise The most recent decision that received heavy criticism was ruling out Martinelli s opener at Old Trafford Leading up to the goal Eriksen was caught off guard by Odegaard whose tackle was deemed foul Similarly the event leading from Richarlison s goal to its being disallowed was something to behold Today no footballer can celebrate his goal passionately because of the fear of VAR Many events in the past have also paved the way for the outright pour of anger towards VAR The rage towards VAR was on the brim and now it has spilled out For me personally VAR has killed the emotions surrounding the game No moment of footballing magic or genius is safe because of the uncanny VAR interruptions Even though it has aided the sport it should also be held accounatble for killing the thrill and the raw emotion associated with the sport
