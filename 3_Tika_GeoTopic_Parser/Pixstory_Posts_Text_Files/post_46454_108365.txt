 To Every Father Who Acts like they care about nothing but still pays attention to everything about his children To every Father who walks for miles just to save Rupees for his child s daily pocket money To every Father who pays rupees to auto when comes out with his children and walk for miles when he came alone or with his wife To Every Father who raises his voice everytime when his children do something wrong and Praises his own children in their absence when they do something good To every Father who lacks sleep for many nights to see his children sleep peacefully Happy Father s Day To each and Every Father You all are best and You all are Appreciated
