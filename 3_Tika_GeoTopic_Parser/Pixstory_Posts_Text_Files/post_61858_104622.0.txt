One of the most popular musical acts returned to South Korea after an eventful visit in USA, which saw the world reknowned group meet up with the President Biden and discuss Hate crimes against the Asian communities in USA. 

It is interesting to note that Kim Taehyung aka V of BTS returned to his home town in South Korea earlier than the other band members. 

V returned to South Korea on June 2nd morning, which means he started from the US on the 1st in the noon hours. 

V hurried back to South Korea early to support his friend Kang Dong Won. The South Korean 
Actor and BTS member V are best friends ever since they started their careers in the entertainment industry. 

BTS’ V and Kang Dong Won reportedly got close because of their common connection to the 
Geochang county in South Korea. V was born in Daegu and later grew up in Geochang, while Kang is also from Geochang. 

Kang Dong Won’s latest movie, Broker, will be hosting its VIP premiere on June 2, 2022, in Seoul. V especially returned from America early to attend the VIP premiere in support of his friend. 

Kang Dong Won invited him to both the Cannes and Seoul premieres. But V could only make it to the one in Seoul.

This shows how much V values friendship, and how much he loves his friends.
