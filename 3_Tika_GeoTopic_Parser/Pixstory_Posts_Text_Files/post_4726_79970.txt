The view from the foothills of the Sierra Nevada in Southern California can be beautiful pine forests and chaparral spill across an often rugged landscape But as more people build homes in this area where development gets into wild land they re facing some of the highest risks for wildfires in the country The type of trees plants and grasses at any location will influence how likely the area is to burn However our new research shows that some areas of the wildland urban interface the land where development ends and wilderness begins are at much higher risk of burning than others A key reason is how vulnerable the local vegetation is to drying out in a warming climate In a study published Feb our team of climate scientists fire scientists and eco hydrologists mapped out where vegetation is creating the highest fire risks across the western U S We then compared that map to where in the region people have been moving into the wildland urban interface We were surprised to discover that the fastest rate of population growth by far has been in the areas with the highest fire risk This includes several areas in California Oregon Washington and Texas Plant sensitivity has a large effect on fires When a fire does break out the amount of area that burns increases significantly if a region s vegetation is drought sensitive meaning it dries up easily after periods of little rainfall and hot temperatures Read full story at The Conversation Image Courtesy Marius von Essen
