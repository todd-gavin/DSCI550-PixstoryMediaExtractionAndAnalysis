My father still treats me as a child... he can't believe that I reached a certain maturity age, I'm not sure I got mature or not. Just saying..

Well, no matter how much time I used to say to him that now I am a grown up child, he still behaves as just I am 6 years oldðŸ˜….

He was as caring and protective as he was when I was 6 years old. When I first stepped up into secondary school, he used to be very protective, telling me 100 times that this is bus No.5, don't sit on the other bus as you may get lost. No matter whether he used to be sick or not, he was always there for me to drop me at the bus stop. He is still the same.

Well I guess Dads are just like that and that's what is just so awesome about that
