As Fiona made landfall as a large, destructive post-tropical storm on Saturday, homes were thrown into the sea, roofs were blown off, and 80 percent of two Atlantic Canadian provinces lost power.
Late on Friday, Fiona changed from a hurricane to a post-tropical storm, although it continued to produce hurricane-force gusts, torrential rain, and enormous waves. The town of Port Aux Basques on the southern coast of Newfoundland was pummelling by the storm, and entire buildings werehed into the water. On Saturday, Mayor Brian Button posted on social media that individuals were being moved to higher ground as a result of downed power lines.
The 4,000-person hamlet, according to the Royal Canadian Police, is under emergency conditions as firefighters battle numerous electrical fires and floods in homes.
On Saturday morning, disruptions impacted more than 415,000 Nova Scotia Power customers, or almost 80% of the over 1 million residents of the province. While NB Power in New Brunswick reported 44,329 without energy, almost 82,000 subscribers in the province of Prince Edward Island were also without power. Although Bermuda officials reported no significant damage, the swiftly moving Fiona made landfall in Nova Scotia before dawn on Saturday. Its power was down from the Category 4 strength it had early Friday when it passed by Bermuda.
