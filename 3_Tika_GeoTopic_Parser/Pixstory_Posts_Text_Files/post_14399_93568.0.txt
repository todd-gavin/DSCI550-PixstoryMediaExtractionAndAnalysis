Sergey Milinkovic-Savic wants to play for Juventus, claim several reports today. While Lazio want to sell him to Manchester United or Paris Saint-Germain, the Serbian wants to play for the Old Lady. And keeping that in mind, there is no doubt that Juve should sign the Serbian.

This is arguably the best midfielder in Serie A and this is someone who has contributed to 18 goals in the league this season. Apart from that, he has been doing the job consistently for about 4-5 years now, playing in a pragmatic system in the past and he’s now firing in a more attacking approach under Maurizio Sarri. He has consistently shown that he’s a very complete midfielder and the only one who can come close to his skillset is Paul Pogba.

Juve could lose Adrien Rabiot, Aaron Ramsey and Arthur next summer, with doubts still remaining about Weston McKennie. That will leave them with only two reliable midfielders - Denis Zakaria and Manuel Locatelli. Jorginho is being eyed and he won’t cost too much. But there will still be a lack of depth in midfield.

Milinkovic-Savic’s multi-functional approach makes him a perfect fit for Max Allegri’s side and if the finances are right and if Lazio can accept some players in the deal, this is a deal which can benefit both parties.
