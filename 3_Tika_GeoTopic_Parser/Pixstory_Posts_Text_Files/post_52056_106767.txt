Some swear it tastes just like Coca Cola others gag in disgust A simple homemade concoction of sparkling water with a splash of balsamic vinegar has become a viral experiment on social media The healthy Coke recipe was originally shared by TikTok user Amanda Jones who said she learned it from a pilates instructor In three days the video has been viewed more than m times It has since become a trend on TikTok and beyond as people film their reactions while sipping their fizz and vinegar I am not joking you it tastes just like a Coke said Jones who used guava flavoured sparkling water to make the drink And it s healthy and it s good for you That s too much vinegar said Hoda Kotb a USA Today show host who mixed it with a black cherry flavoured soda then gagged in disgust after her first sip Dietician Dr Rosemary Stanton says It may be better for your waistline but it may not be any better for your teeth But if you re using a flavoured soda water and there s sugar in it then it s bad for your teeth and your waistline Then the only thing you d be avoiding is the caffeine and that s probably the least of the three problems with Coke Dr Mikaela Chinotti an oral health specialist says even if there is no sugar in the sparkling water the drink is still a problem The acidity in both balsamic vinegar and carbonated water wears down tooth enamel I don t know where they re getting the healthy part from she says Nowhere does anybody recommend to drink either of these things for your health let alone mixing them together We made the Guardian Australia office a round of healthy Coke with plain carbonated water to put it to the test The verdict it s an acquired taste The strangest part is that I can actually understand why people think it tastes like Coke all the bad parts of Coke said one staff member Out of eight corralled tasters he was the only one to see the resemblance There is that weirdly artificial sweet aftertaste
