Arsenal welcome Ajax to Meadow Park for the UWCL. The first of a 2 legged affair, which will see the winners go to the CL group stages.

Few chances, but the game started quickly, with Ajax’s high press. Rafaelle’s tidy footwork was key to evading the press on a few occasions, however it was evidently something The Gunners weren’t comfortable with.

The only chance of note however, bobbled to Pelova, but the forwards effort was saved by Zinsberg, in the North London sides goal.

After a cagey 12 minutes, Ajax took the lead, again looking dangerous on the left, with a ball finding Leuchter, who squeezed the ball home.

It wasn’t until the 25th minute when the Gunners equalised - a corner found Rafaello, who hit the bar, before the ball was turned in by Blackstenius.

A few ricochets created half chances for Arsenal, while a good save from Zinsberg happened just before HT, but nothing concrete.

An entertaining half, high intensity - especially from the visitors. All to play for!

Arsenal wasted no time. Catley’s effort slammed the post just after the break, and goal scorer Blackstein had a long ranged effort in quick succession.

It was a penalty however, which provided Arsenal Womens with the lead. A ball played into Beth Mead, who was pushed from behind.

Little made no mistake from the spot, sending the keeper diving, with 30 to play.

A vastly improved 2nd half from the Gunners, who created many openings, with Mead especially influential in buildup, & Rafa a constant threat.

It was to be Romee Leuchter however, who left the tie in the balance.

After all of Arsenal’s dominance, a poorly dealt with cutback ends with Leuchter tapping home for Ajax.

McCabe looked to have won it for the hosts, but the offside flag came to Arsenal’s demise, despite appearing to be onside.

A bitter one for the Gunners, a great result for Ajax, and an enthralling 90 minutes awaits, to decide the CL fate.
