8 Ricardo Kak√°
Kaka, a midfielder with every skill and a magician, was one of the greatest players to ever grace the game, the only player in football history who has never been hated and won every trophy inhis career. He joined Real Madrid in 2009 for a whopping 68.5 million euros and quickly established himself as the club's best player.
He was regarded by FIFA as having the "ability to glide almost effortlessly past opponents,provide defence-splitting passes, and score consistently from distance." Kaka would carry the ball forward without hesitation and score goals when in possession. He was a great playmaker and goal scorer who won the Ballon d'Or in 2007. In his 12 games, he scored 29 goals for Real Madrid.
