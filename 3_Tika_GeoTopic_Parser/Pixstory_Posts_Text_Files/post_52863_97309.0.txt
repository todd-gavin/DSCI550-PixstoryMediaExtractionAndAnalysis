But what's special about this post and the date? It's just a boom, right? 
However the memories associated with the date is something that makes the book remarkable for me. 
My friend gifted me this novel because my birth date is November 9. I couldn't have asked for a better present. I'm absolutely in love with her titles. This is going to be a delightful read for sure. Every time I hold it, i makes me smile. It takes me back to plethora of memories that I've created with her. Thank you, bestie. You're the best.
