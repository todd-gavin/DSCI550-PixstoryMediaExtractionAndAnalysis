When the Lakers benched Russell Westbrook last week, he was transparent about how disappointed he was, but he also responded to being held accountable in pretty much the exact way the team probably hoped he would.

In the two games since that loss to the Pacers, Westbrook has averaged 21 points, 10 rebounds and 8 assists on 53.1% shooting. That is admittedly an extremely small sample size, but is also better than his season averages in every single category.

No one is probably happier about this development than the Lakers themselves, and not just because Westbrook playing well is obviously good for the team. They’re also probably pretty encouraged because, as Ramona Shelburne of ESPN detailed in the huge story she dropped on Tuesday morning about the team’s Lakers’ year from hell, Westbrook has not always been so receptive to criticism this season.

It’s obviously not ideal that Westbrook apparently has been less than receptive to criticism of some of the warts in his game, but from a player who has always prided himself on doing things his way, it’s also not particularly surprising. But the Lakers under Vogel have always been a team that gets most of their work and improvement done through honest and unfiltered feedback in the film room. It was a huge part of their adjustments game-to-game on their title run. As the saying goes, that’s what the film room does. The Lakers have always let it tell the truth during those sessions.

Still, it’s important to note that this is just some anonymous people’s read on how Westbrook has responded to such critiques. He’s a competitor. Even if he doesn’t like the feedback in the moment, it’s possible that eventually it will start to click.

But what has that feedback been over? Well, we don’t know for certain, but we can hazard a guess based on both watching the games and some other recent reporting from The Four Letter.
