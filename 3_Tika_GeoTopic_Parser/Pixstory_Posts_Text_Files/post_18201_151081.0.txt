The 2023 Met Gala will honor Karl Lagerfeld.
On Friday, Vogue announced the theme of the 2023 Met Gala, which will take place on May 1, 2023, the first Monday in May.
The theme is "Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty," and it will pay tribute to the designer's body of work.
Lagerfeld died in 2019 at 85 years old. The late designer was best known for his work as Chanel's creative director, but he also worked with Fendi, Balmain, and for his self-named brand, as Vogue reported.
Andrew Bolton, head curator of the Anna Wintour Costume Center at the Metropolitan Museum, told Vogue that Lagerfeld wasn't interested in having his work in a museum when he was alive.
"Karl never tired of telling me that fashion did not belong in a museum," he said. "When we worked on the Chanel show together he was incredibly generous in what he lent, but he was completely disinterested in the exhibition itself! He would say 'fashion is not art â€” fashion belongs on the street, on women's bodies, on men's bodies.'"
Bolton also told Vogue that instead of doing a "traditional retrospective" on Lagerfeld's most famous works, the exhibit will be based on his sketches.
 Although the Met Gala sometimes has a broader theme, like "In America: An Anthology of Fashion," it's not unusual for the star-studded event to honor a specific designer, such as the 2011 gala that paid tribute to Alexander McQueen.
