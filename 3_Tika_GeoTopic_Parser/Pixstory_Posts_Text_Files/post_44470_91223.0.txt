Manchester United announced on Thursday that they will play Liverpool FC in Thailand on July 12 as part of their 2022 pre-season plans.

The Red Devils have confirmed the first of their pre-season trips for 2022/2023, which will take them to Bangkok, Thailand, and then Melbourne, Australia.

United will play traditional rivals Liverpool in the 'The Match' Centenary Cup on July 12 at the Rajamangala Stadium in Bangkok, marking the club's first visit to the Thai city since 2013.

The team will then go to Melbourne, Australia, for the first time since 1999.
On July 15, the Reds will play local A-League outfit Melbourne Victory, and on July 19, they will play Premier League rivals Crystal Palace at the legendary Melbourne Cricket Ground.

Manchester United's football director, John Murtough, in a statement said: "Pre-season tours are such an important part of the squad's preparation for the season ahead, so it's crucial to have excellent training facilities and high-quality opposition. We’re delighted that we’ll have both these things during our visits to Bangkok and Melbourne this summer, and we’re looking forward to playing in front of our fans in both cities for the first time in a number of years.”

Chief Operating Officer, Collette Roche, said: “It has been two years since the club has been able to travel on an international pre-season tour, so we can’t wait to get going this summer and reconnect with our fans in south-east Asia and Australasia.

“Our matches in Bangkok and Melbourne will be a wonderful opportunity for international fans to see their favourite players up-close in an exciting schedule of games.”
