Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) are bacterial infections that affect the urinary tract (urethra, ureters, bladder and kidneys). Typical symptoms of a UTI include painful urination, burning sensation while peeing, frequent urge to urinate, a feeling as if the bladder hasn’t been emptied despite urinating, abdominal pain, cloudy urine and blood in the urine. Sometimes, these symptoms on their own are enough for a doctor to confidently diagnose you as having a UTI. However, often, doctors will also prescribe urinary tract infection tests so they can confirm the presence of an infection and also identify how to treat it! 

The two most common tests are a urine routine test and a urine culture test. The urine routine test confirms if you have an infection by checking for white blood cells, blood, pus, the acidity of urine and so on. Without an infection, you typically won’t find these in your urine in high quantities. The culture test works to test if the infection is resistant to any antibiotics. Should the urine routine test turn out to confirm the presence of an infection, the results of the culture test will help the doctor to prescribe an antibiotic which will actually respond to the bacteria causing the infection. One should not start consuming antibiotics before giving a urine sample for these two tests as doing so would make the tests ineffective. 

Technically it takes 24-48 hours for UTI antibiotics to show results. However, there is a chance that sometimes, the bacteria responsible for the UTI may not respond to the antibiotics or treatments that may be prescribed to you. This could be a sign of complicated UTI or an underlying disease. Your doctor may take a CT scan to see if there are any obstructions in the urinary tract.
