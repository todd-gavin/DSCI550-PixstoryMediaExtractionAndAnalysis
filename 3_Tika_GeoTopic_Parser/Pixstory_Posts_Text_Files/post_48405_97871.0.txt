Homeschooling is a concept frowned upon by many.  The pandemic made us realise homeschooling is a good option. Homeschooling is no less than public or private school, in fact, more flexible. Parents have a direct role in a child's daily learning this would reduce the stress of the child and learning wouldn't be considered something to get tense. Homeschooling helps parents to have a deeper and stronger bond with children. Schools often have tuition fees and additional so many charges feeling a burden to parents but homeschooling makes it all enabled at home. Children can have equal hours to play and learn whatever they want. All extracurricular activities of the child can be nurtured as homeschooling doesn't have any selection process. There are always some things beyond the syllabus that children learn that is not taught in most schools. Children will have less ridicule and social pressures that reduce self-esteem and discourage learning. Real-life skill-building is stronger in home-based learning as practical knowledge is more important. Children will get to spend more time on topics they desire rather than studying things that will not help them in future. Less distraction from students who do not value learning allows for greater achievement.  Most schools work in a universal framework. Everyone has to learn things even if they don't want to. Homeschooling gives freedom to learn whatever the children want to learn. Homeschooled children will not be exposed to any kind of emotional torture, abuse or bullying by other students. The home will be a safe environment for them. 

Always remember homeschooling is about freedom hence don't forget to ask your child what they prefer homeschooling or public or private schooling. Don't force homeschooling upon them.
