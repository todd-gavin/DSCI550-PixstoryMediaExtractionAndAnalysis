Coldplay s Midnight is a song about optimism It exhorts you to remain hopeful even in the darkest of times You would one day move on the world wouldn t end everything tragic and horrible that had occurred to you would have passed and you would be stronger than before When you are away from home away from family and friends when you are caught up in a crisis you should leave a light on suggesting you should have hope The idea for Midnight appeared back in when I was working late at the studio with Chris and Rik one night I played Chris this unfinished idea for an ambient track I d written called The Fourth State Part II and Chris was really into it he grabbed a mic Rik set up a vocoder patch and the basic vocal idea was jammed pretty much straight away Jon Hopkins
