What does it feel like to be from a #tier 1 college?Many assume that they’re served and get everything without any hard work. If I get this college, then life is all about chill. Well said, it’s tougher to survive in DU than to get into DU.It's absolutely frank to say though, And be prepared to hear this sobering fact.Speaking about my college, I’ve seen how my friends and other students work dedicatedly hard not only in academics but also in extra-curricular activities.  Why are they doing this? They can simply get things right?But that is not the case here,The red-white buildings did not create the brand name of any college. It is the consistent, persistent, and daily hard work of the students. Every day I strive for perfection in my areas of interest and passion to find the unmapped paths for me. I don't rely on outside forces to make things happen for me.Therefore, I want to form the correct conclusion that if you're really passionate and driven to achieve something then nobody can stop you, regardless of what college you're from!
