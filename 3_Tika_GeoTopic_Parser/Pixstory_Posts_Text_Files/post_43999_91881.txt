A club in trouble like no other club looking at their recent past with disarray and the future difficult to predict as has always been the case Manchester United will need a new head coach in the summer and the list of potential candidates was quite impressive too I say was so as to highlight the fact that It s now been cut down to just two options both very capable and proven of course PSG head coach Mauricio Pochettino is widely believed to be one of the two targets with his project at the Parisian club seeming to be headed up a dead end Those close to the club suggest the ex spurs manager will be released in the summer window along with a few of the club s hierarchy resigning too Erik ten Hag was obviously the other candidate His astute nature as a tactician a straightforward strategist and his status a revolutionary at Ajax all in mind he has come to the forefront as the favourable choice To add to that the club will have to pay a mere million to relieve the Dutchman off his duties Even so a number of players in the United dressing room seem to have their own interesting opinions about Ten Hag As should be the case really Ten Hag is a visionary and his arrival will mean the first team cuts down on many of its previously considered assets For players like Donny Van de Beek however a return from loan could well be on the horizon Regardless of the rifts in the United locker room Ten Hag is a well proven manager who s lead Ajax to two Eredivisie titles as well as reaching the semi finals of the UEFA Champions League in In the long run him with Ralf Ragnick as director are likely to carry out a project built from the very roots With United s position in the league table as it stands though Champions League football next season is a distant dream
