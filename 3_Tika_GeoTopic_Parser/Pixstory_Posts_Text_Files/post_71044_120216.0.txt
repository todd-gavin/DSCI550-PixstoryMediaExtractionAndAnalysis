Hima Das, an athlete from India, became an overnight sensation at the age of just 18 after winning a medal at the U-20 World Championship in 2018.

Hima won up to three medals at the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta, including golds in the women's and mixed 4x400-meter relays as well as an individual silver in the 400-meter race.
But over the past few years, Hima has had to fight on numerous fronts due to ailments, which also prevented her from travelling to Tokyo for the most recent Olympics.

But now the 22-year-old 'Dhing Express', after a few training camps, including one in Turkey, is raring to go and eyeing Commonwealth Games glory on the tracks of Birmingham and India has never previously won a medal in a track event, but Hema Das made history by winning a gold medal.
