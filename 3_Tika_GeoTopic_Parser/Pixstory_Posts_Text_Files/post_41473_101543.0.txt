According to Basketball Reference data from 2021-2022, the average male NBA player earns $5.3 million per year. Stars like Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant, who earn $45.7 million and $42 million per year, respectively, earn far more.

CBS reported that WNBA players, on the other hand, make an average of $130,000 each year. Diana Taurasi, Jewell Loyd, and Breanna Stewart, the league's highest-paid players, each earn almost $230,000 per year. 

According to Kim Crowder, a diversity, equality, and inclusion expert who focuses on pay discrepancies among women, the basketball pay gap is so wide that women are forced to "travel overseas and play sports so they can make more money than they do here."

The main reason for the huge difference in pay for men and women players in pro basketball is because the WNBA generates far less revenue, corporate sponsorship and media viewership than the NBA, said Nicole LaVoi, director of the Tucker Center for Research on Girls & Women in Sport at the University of Minnesota

“The pay is so wildly discrepant," she said. "Honestly, the men are overpaid. Nobody should be making that type of money to be an athlete."

With US soccer erasing the gender pay gap, it’s time that other sports follow suit!
