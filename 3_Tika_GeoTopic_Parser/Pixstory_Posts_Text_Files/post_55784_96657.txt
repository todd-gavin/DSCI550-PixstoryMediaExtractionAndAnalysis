When you think of traditional Australian cuisine you might picture dishes of crocodile or kangaroo However Australia has absorbed a range of culinary preferences from throughout the world as a result of immigration influences primarily Mediterranean and Asian It s not all bush tucker and grilled shrimp As Chefspencil tells us firstly try the delightfully fresh battered fish topped with plenty of sizzling hot chips since Australia has some of the best seafood in the world Remember to season with chicken salt A chicken parma comes is another good idea This popular Australian chicken dish may be found on the menus of most pubs around the country Parmigiana was originally made with eggplant but it evolved into the popular breaded chicken meal we know and love today Chicken schnitzel is covered with a thick tomato sauce ham and melted cheese in this Italian favourite What s not to like about this dish which is usually served with chips and salad Alternatively on a Sunday there s no better way to unite the family around the table than with a roast leg of lamb Roast lamb is a family favourite traditionally roasted in rosemary and garlic and served with plenty of gravy and enough potatoes to feed an army
