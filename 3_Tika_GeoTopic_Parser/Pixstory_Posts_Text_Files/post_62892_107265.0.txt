Italy is one of the top five most visited countries in the world, and it is the birthplace of modern tourism. What exactly do I mean? Tourists did not exist until the 1600s; affluent traders, rich bankers, royal spokesmen, ambassadors, and nobility were the only ones who travelled to the colonies for work-related reasons. Italy was responsible for the birth of tourism in the year 1700, thanks to Pompeii. When Pompeii was discovered in 1700, many wealthy Europeans began to come to Italy not for business but to see Pompeii.

Italy has the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites of any country in the world. Monuments and works of art can be found all around the country.

Because of its incredible natural and cultural diversity (everything from the high mountains of Sud Tirol to the parched south of Sicily), attractiveness, wonderful food, and generally nice people, as well as its history.

Food!

Oh, did I mention...FOOD?
