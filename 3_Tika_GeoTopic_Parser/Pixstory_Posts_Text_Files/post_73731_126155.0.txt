Akshay Kumar’s Raksha Bandhan has recorded a low opening weekend of Rs 21 crore, as the film didn’t show much of a growth on Saturday. According to early estimates, the Aanand L Rai directorial has collected in the range of Rs 6.30 to 7.00 crore on Saturday, showing nominal jumps on the third day. The film opened at Rs 8.00 crore on Thursday and then dropped by around 20 percent to collect Rs 6.25 crore on Friday.❌❌

The national multiplex chains have seen a spike of about 5 to 7 percent and it’s the mass belts that will decide where the third day biz of Raksha Bandhan finally lands. These are low numbers and the next two days – Sunday and Independence Day – should enable the film to hit the half century mark by the end of opening week. The trend isn’t encouraging, but being a mass film, there is a possibility of getting some jump on Sunday and Monday.✅✅
