Matteo Berrettini ready to return to the field after surgery on his right hand Before Wimbledon the Italian tennis player will play the ATP tournament in Stuttgart, an event he won last year before playing an incredible Wimbledon in which he reached the final Arrival in a different condition compared to the one from three years ago when I won the tournament but I&#39;m fine and I really want to go back to playing he said on the eve of the tournament I know it won&#39;t be easy because I was stopped a lot and suffered an injury that is complicated to resolve and on my dominant hand it will be easy but somewhere you have to start over A year ago Berrettini&#39;s conditions were different both from a physical and mental point of view If I think about it the last time I played on grass I was on the pitch for the Wimbledon final and in any case on this surface I always feel at ease I have excellent sensations From the point of view of my head I&#39;m also fine I know that the situation is not easy especially thinking of Wimbledon and the points that expire with consequences on the ranking I am aware that it is one of the most complex moments to manage from my career but another challenge to face head on Points down From sixth in the world the injury will inevitably drop him beyond the top which is strange for him given his recent successful years I have always been among the top in recent years Now inevitably i will go back because i was injured but i know my level and my potential if i was number six in the world not because i bought it but because i earned it so i can go back
