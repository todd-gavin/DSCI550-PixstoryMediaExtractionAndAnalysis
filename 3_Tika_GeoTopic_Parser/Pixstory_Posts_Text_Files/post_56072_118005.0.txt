Still to be neat, still to be dressed‚Äù
BY BEN JONSON

Still to be neat, still to be dressed,
As you were going to a feast;
Still to be powdered, still perfumed; 
Lady, it is to be presumed,
Though art's hid causes are not found,
All is not sweet, all is not sound.

Give me a look, give me a face,
That makes simplicity a grace;
Robes loosely flowing, hair as free;
Such sweet neglect more taketh me
                       Then all th'adulteries of art. 
They strike my eyes, but not my heart.

The speaker begins by addressing the lady, "Still to be neat, still to be dressed / As you were going to a feast," indicating that she need not always appear to be on her way to a celebration.

 He would obviously prefer her in less formal attire, without her makeup. (That's her choice by the way) The repetition that recurs in line 3, "Still to be powdered, still perfumed," is typical of lyrics and strengthens the continuing state of adornment of the lady's person.

 The message to her after the first of two stanzas is that while what is beneath the art has yet to be discovered, those gazing at the lady presume "All is not sweet, all is not sound." The fact that she requires so much makeup signals she conceals something unpleasant.
