Serena Williams is not ready to say goodbye just yet Nor clearly are her fans In her first match at what is expected to be the last US Open and last tournament of her remarkable playing career Williams overcame a shaky start to overwhelm Danka Kovini on Monday night in a packed Arthur Ashe Stadium with an atmosphere more akin to a festival than a farewell Williams still didn t definitively say she was retiring during a ceremony after her first round victory over Kovini But the time Grand Slam singles champion made it clear she is ready for different things saying there s other chapters in life She promised that whatever she does after tennis she will still be intense like she was as a player saying her next chapter will be like Serena The ceremony which included her husband and daughter coming onto the court as well as Billie Jean King included a tribute narrated by Oprah Winfrey titled Dear Serena It ended by saying Just know whatever you do next we ll be watching With love all of us Early Williams was not at her best Maybe it was the significance of the moment There were double faults other missed strokes missed opportunities She went up but then quickly trailed Then suddenly Williams less than a month from turning looked a lot more like someone with six championships at Flushing Meadows and Grand Slam titles in all numbers never exceeded by anyone in the professional era of tennis which began in She rolled through the end of that opening set capping it with a service winner she reacted to with clenched fists and her trademark cry of come on The more than in the stands thousands of others watched on a video screen outside Ashe rose for a raucous standing ovation and did so again when the hour minute contest was over celebrating as if another trophy had been earned
