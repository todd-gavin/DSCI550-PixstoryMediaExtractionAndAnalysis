Art show curated by Shubhlakshmi in Mumbai  “Anything which is readable could be viewed as " text". Cities, publicsquares, markets, libraries, hospitals, asylums, prisons, architecturalbuildings, schools, colleges describe a cultural specificity(detailing on human mind) as readable. In linguistics readability ofthese spaces explains these as text in a language.A photographic image describing it's location, people, mood as wellas the unspoken in it, is also a text.A curation of photographic prints, this show also focuses upon thevolume of unspoken in human lives. Especially women when theyare strategically isolated and silenced due to unusual patriarchalaccounts. The unspoken is a taboo and the voicing of the unspokenis a taboo as well. Specific material choice and the chosen wordsallow the paradox to surface and reflect upon its contents from the very beginning “- Shubhlakshmi Shukla
