A Room of One's Own is an extended essay by Virginia Woolf, first published in September 1929.The central point of A Room of One's Own is that every woman needs a room of her ownâ€”something men are able to enjoy without question. A room of her own would provide a woman with the time and the space to engage in uninterrupted writing time.
