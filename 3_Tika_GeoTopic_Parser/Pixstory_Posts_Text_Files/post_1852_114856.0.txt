Sanjeev Kumar was popularly known in the film industry as Hari Bhai, from 1965-66. His real name was Harihar Jethalal Jariwala. His father had a Zari-work shop. Hence "Jariwala". 

Hari Bhai started very young, as a 20-year old, as a stage actor in IPTA plays. IPTA (Indian People's Theater Association) promoted young talent & Hari Bhai found his calling doing a variety of roles. 

Hari Bhai made his film debut with a small role in Hum Hindustani in 1960., but his big break was a small role in 1968, opposite Dilip Kumar, in Sangharsh. 

Hari Bhai's breakthrough hit was Khilona (1970), a completely over-the-top melodrama was Hari Bhai was noticed for his histrionic abilities. 

Gulzar, who was also associated with IPTA, was acquainted with Hari Bhai. Parichay (1972) was their first film together & so started one of the most rewarding relationships in popular Hindi cinema. Hari Bhai would find his mark in Gulzar's films. He played an old man, a businessman, a truck driver, twin brothers & a deaf & mute person. 

The Gulzar-Hari Bhai partnership lit up 1970s. 

By 1977-78, Hari Bhai had started losing the battle with himself gradually. Exceedingly fond of food & liquor, Hari Bhai developed serious health problems by the end of 1970s. 

After his first heart attack, he underwent a bypass in the US. However, on 6th November 1985, at the age of 47, Hari Bhai suffered a massive heart attack, which resulted in his death. A man who often played an old man in films never got old himself. A luminous talent was cut short.
