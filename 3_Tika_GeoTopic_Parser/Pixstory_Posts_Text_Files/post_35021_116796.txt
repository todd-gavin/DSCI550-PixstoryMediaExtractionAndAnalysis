There were a couple of hours left before the semifinal of the men&#39;s meters when the news that everyone hoped they didn&#39;t have to read arrived Marcell Jacobs gave up the most important appointment what he was waiting for from the last Tokyo Olympics where he ran faster than everyone He would have liked to repeat at the World Championships in Eugene but physical problems forced him to forfeit after a first round in which it was already seen that he was not in top form The eighth time recorded and the consequent post-race pains did not help A painful choice wrote Jacobs on his Instagram profile I&#39;m forced to interrupt the race despite wanting to be here in Eugene and confront my opponents There&#39;s nothing I love more than running and competing I&#39;m a fighter and with this spirit I decided not to miss the appointment with the World Cup But now in order not to risk a more serious injury I have to postpone the confrontation to the next important matches after a full recovery I make this promise to the Italians and my fans I will do my best to keep making you dream The blue stop has arrived for a contracture in the right thigh accused in the heats before the semifinal. A note published on the Federation website specifies it. During yesterday&#39;s m heat, the athlete Marcell Jacobs accused a contracture affecting the large adductor of the right thigh which in any case allowed him to concluding the performance In the clinical tests conducted this morning, the muscle contraction remained present, albeit to a lesser extent. As this is a clinical picture that can put muscle integrity at risk and lead to injury, it was decided not to allow participation in the competition. Jacobs tried to arrive at the best at the world championships but there was nothing to do The meters final, the one in which he would have liked to arrive again in front of everyone, saw a completely American podium
