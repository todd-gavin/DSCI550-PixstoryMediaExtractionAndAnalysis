Prejudice and discrimination are prevalent in almost every field and sexism and biases in video gaming are examples For a long time gaming world was male dominated and women being a part of it was either deemed an anomaly or not wholly accepted The picturisation of women characters where they are shown wearing attractive clothes with exaggerated figures is very common In addition bodily stereotypes are commonly portrayed by making women characters look voluptuous with storylines made in a way that Although video games are not inherently sexist the creators and the culture give birth to the concepts and ideas that critically target women Most video games have this online chatting system where characters can communicate online These characters tend to possess an identity but it is anonymous their real identity is hidden which sometimes gives rise to harassment messages and even insulting women According to Stephen Toulouse moderator of the online gaming service Xbox Live between and women were the most frequent target of harassment In a study by the Ohio University showed that the same person playing Halo online with a male and a female profile using recorded voice messages received three times more negative comments with the female profile despite similar game scores Even welcoming everybody at the beginning of a game could lead to sexist insults against the female profile Examples suggest how existing discrimination in video gaming is targeting women and harassing them
