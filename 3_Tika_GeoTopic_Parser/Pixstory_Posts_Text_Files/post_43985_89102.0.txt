FIFA has announced a collaboration with Crypto.com ahead of the event this year.

Crypto.com has secured a sponsorship contract with FIFA for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

The cryptocurrency trading platform, which also includes an NFT marketplace, is attempting to "generate greater awareness" of its brand, in a move that will be familiar to those who have followed the company's recent hard-driving marketing campaign.

As teams, players, and governing organisations try to cash in on worldwide interest in new financial markets, digital currencies and tokens have been tied to football.

“Crypto.com has already demonstrated a commitment to supporting top-tier teams and leagues, major events and iconic venues across the world, and there is no platform bigger, or with a greater reach and cultural impact, than FIFA’s global platform of football,” said Kay Madati, FIFA’s Chief Commercial Officer, in a statement.

“We are delighted to have a global brand like Crypto.com join us as a sponsor of the exciting and ground-breaking FIFA World Cup in Qatar, ultimately helping to grow our beautiful game on a global scale.”

Crypto.com co-founder Kris Marszalek said in a statement: “We could not be more excited to sponsor the FIFA World Cup, one of the most prestigious tournaments in the world, and to drive further awareness of Crypto.com globally.

"Through our partnership with FIFA, we will continue to use our platform in innovative ways so that Crypto.com can power the future of world-class sports and fan experiences around the world.”
