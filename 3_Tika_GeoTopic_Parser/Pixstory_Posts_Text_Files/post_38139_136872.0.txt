The Premier League champions suffered European heartbreak once again last season. But City have gone in hard in the summer transfer window once again. Will the signings of Erling Haaland and company finally be the final piece for Pep Guardiola's jigsaw puzzle? 
Manchester City's major summer signings: Erling Haaland, Kalvin Phillips, Manuel Akanji
Manchester City's major summer exits: Raheem Sterling, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Gabriel Jesus, Fernandinho
The Sky Blues dominated the headlines by capturing Erling Haaland early on. The Norwegian has already grabbed headlines by scoring 10 Premier League goals in just 6 games. 
With Fernandinho leaving, Kalvin Phillips was another big name that City secured in the summer. The central midfielder certainly adds to the team's midfield depth. 
Julian Alvarez and Manuel Akanji also joined the squad this summer, making Pep Guardiola's team seem to be the most complete side in the Premier League. With a bit of luck, Manchester City should certainly be one of the favourites for the PL and the UCL titles once again. 
Potential Weakness: Manchester City don't have any particular loopholes in their squad. The Sky Blues boast one of the richest squads in football history. Unless they are injury-plagued, Guardiola's side should always have options for the manager to play any formation. 
Rating Manchester City's summer transfer activity: 8/10
