A bowl of these oats is probably one of the best ways to start your day. They're so warm and comforting. I would be lying if I said I wasn't in LOVE.

RECIPE:

For the oats:

- 1/2 cup (50g) oats
- 2/3 cup (160ml) water
-Pinch of salt
- 1tbsp honey or maple syrup
- 1/2 an apple

Combine the mixture and microwave for 1min30
OPTIONAL, but highly recommended to get that caramel

Flavour:

add 1/2 scoop of an CARAMEL protein powder
after leaving the oats to cool for 2 mins

Toppings:

- 1/2 an apple (chopped up small). Add cinnamon & honey and microwave for 1 min

I hope you enjoy!
