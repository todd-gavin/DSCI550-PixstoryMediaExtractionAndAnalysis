 As per Forbes, Aston Villa have convinced Barcelona to sell them, Philippe Coutinho, in the summer. The Steven Gerrard-led club has been enjoying the services of the Brazilian and hence they want to sign him full time. 

The initial loan deal stated that Aston Villa would have to pay £35 million to sign the midfielder in the summer. However, the Premier League club have convinced Barcelona to bring the number down to £15-20 million. 

Since signing with Aston Villa, Philippe Coutinho has made 15 Premier League appearances. In this, the Brazilian has scored 4 goals and provided 3 assists for the Villains. However, after a bright start, the midfield magician has been a bit out of form in the past few games. 

Aston Villa however are placed 11th in the Premier League under Steven Gerrard. The Villains will surely beat the drop and have hence confirmed their place for the 2022/23 Premier League season. 

Steven Gerrard himself stated that he wanted to keep the Brazilian at the club. The Aston Villa manager said, "We want Philippe Coutinho here for sure." regarding the midfielder's status for next season.





Coutinho's legacy with the Blaugrana!

Over the years, Phillippe Coutinho has made 106 appearances for the Blaugrana. In this, the Brazilian midfielder has scored 26 goals in all competitions for the Spanish giants. 

The 29-year-old will depart Barcelona with two LaLiga titles, two Copa Del Rey titles, and a Supercopa De España. Hence, even though Coutinho could not reach his full potential, the Brazilian did have a decorated career with the Spanish giants. It has to be seen how the next few years hold for the midfield magician.
