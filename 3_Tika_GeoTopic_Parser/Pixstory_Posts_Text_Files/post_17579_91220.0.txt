Unfortunately for Frank Vogel, he has to make the most of his current roster before the longest season ever finally ends. The Lakers head coach has spent this year and last, dealing with his two superstars battling injuries and a cast around them who pales in comparison to the 2019-20 team.

Vogel said he is also dealing with the pressure of James’ legacy as he spends a crucial season on a Lakers team that is struggling to make the playoffs. This, along with other factors, has led to Vogel’s most difficult season yet.

“We’ve had too many really difficult nights and I think there’s an element of being a part of managing LeBron’s legacy for these final years of his career. I want to just give him the best opportunity to have team success throughout that,” Vogel said.
