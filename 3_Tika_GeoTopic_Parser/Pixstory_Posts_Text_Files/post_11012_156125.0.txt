On 25 August 2022, a police constable showed up at 34-year-old driver Kalu Khan’s one-room apartment in the south western Madhya Pradesh town of Khargone and handed him four notices. 
“I was told my neighbours had filed claim petitions against me and my son,” said Khan, a tall, stout man.
Khan’s Hindu neighbours have claimed Rs 480,000 as damages from him and Rs 290,000 from his 12-year-son, alleging that both robbed and vandalised their home in the town’s Anand Nagar mohalla during communal violence on 10 April 2022. 
The violence followed a Ram Navami procession that rolled through a Muslim-dominated part of the town, leaving 20 injured and one dead.
Khargone, 150-km south of Indore, is 61% Hindu and 37% Muslim.
“The policeman told me that we will have to face a tribunal and fight the case,” Khan told The Reporters’ Collective. Khan’s son, 12-year-old Arif (name changed because he is a minor), is being tried along with 270 adults, 65% of them Muslim.
The trial, underway since August 2022, is unfolding at the state’s first ‘claims tribunal’, set up under the Madhya Pradesh Prevention and Recovery of Damages to Public and Private Property Act (Madhya Pradesh Lok evam Niji Sampati ko Nuksaan ka Nivaran evam Nuksaani ki Vasuli Adhiniyam, 2021) that came into force in January 2022. 
Madhya Pradesh is the third state, after Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, to enact such a law. All states are ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
The tribunal is a quasi-judicial body with powers of a civil court. It is empowered to recover damages from those held guilty of causing destruction to public and private property during riots and other violence.
“We were both at home on the night of the violence,” said Khan, who has been served three notices by his neighbours. 
Under Indian law, a 12-year-old cannot be tried as an adult in any criminal proceeding in any Indian court. He can only be tried by a juvenile justice board, according to the law.
