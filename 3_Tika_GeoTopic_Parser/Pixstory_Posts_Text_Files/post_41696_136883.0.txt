In the third one-day cricket international, Zimbabwe defeated Australia by three wickets and won consolation with the assistance of leg-spinner Ryan Burl's career-high five wickets for 10 runs. 

IE reported that after winning the toss and putting Zimbabwe in to bat, Australia won the first two matches by margins of five and eight wickets, respectively. 

Regis Chakabva, the captain of Zimbabwe, won the toss on Saturday, but the outcome was very different as the visitors knocked Australia out for 141 runs after taking three wickets in the first 10 overs. Zimbabwe's response saw them through to win with 66 balls remaining.

Tadiwanashe Marumani contributed 35 runs, and Chakabva contributed 37 runs for a winning total of 142-7. It was a first ODI victory over Australia in Australia.
Josh Hazlewood led the Australian bowlers with three wickets.
