On Saturday, the WTA’s world No. 1 hosted Iga Swiatek & Friends for Ukraine at Krakow's Tauron Arena to a resounding success.

Swiatek ensured a strong Ukrainian presence was on hand, as Elina Svitolina, Sergiy Stakhovsky and football legend Andriy Shevchenko all attended in various roles.


Former world No. 2 Agnieszka Radwanska defeated Swiatek, 6-4, in an entertaining set, after the two kicked off the exhibition on opposite sides of a mixed doubles set that also featured Stakhovsky and Polish junior Martyn Pawelski. Svitolina served as the chair umpire.

"It's been absolutely unforgettable day. I still need to wrap my mind around it and for now I just want to thank you all," Swiatek wrote on social media

Most significantly, Swiatek’s leadership resulted in approximately £422,000 being raised for a trio of organizations providing war in Ukraine relief to impacted children. The funds will be distributed to UNICEF Polska, United 24 and the Elina Svitolina Foundation.
