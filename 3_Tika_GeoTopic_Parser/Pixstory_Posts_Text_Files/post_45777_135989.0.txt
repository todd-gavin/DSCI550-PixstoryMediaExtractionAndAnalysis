On Saturday, September 3, NASA will attempt to launch the Artemis 1 a second time, according to Reuters. A failing RS-25 engine on the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket had forced a delay in the Moon mission. 

IE reported that When team engineers discovered that one of the engines had a problem with the liquid hydrogen, Artemis 1 ran into problems. One of the RS-25 engines was having problems, and the launch director approved a plan to fix it. But the troubleshooting strategy was unsuccessful. 

At T-40 minutes, the countdown stopped as the hydrogen crew and launch director debated possibilities. 

The unmanned Artemis I mission is the first in a line of more difficult Moon missions that will eventually return people to the sole satellite of Earth. NASA will demonstrate the Space Launch System (SLS), its most potent launch vehicle to date, as well as the Orion crew capsule's performance and capabilities during the trip. SLS and Orion will travel approximately 65,000 kilometres to the Moon and back throughout the mission's six-week duration.

Letâ€™s hope everything goes right this time!
