The two leagues will meet again in the middle of the summer. In this summer's All-Star Game in
Minnesota, MLS and Liga MX will collide once more.

The MLS All-Stars will face their Liga MX counterparts on August 10 at Allianz Field, home of
Minnesota United, according to the leagues. For the first time in 2021, the two leagues met in an
All-Star Game, with the MLS team winning a penalty shootout thanks to a goal from Ricardo
Pepi.

“Last year’s match between the MLS All-Stars and the Liga MX All-Stars was the most
competitive MLS All-Star Game ever, and we’re pleased to renew the rivalry between the two
leagues this summer,” said MLS Commissioner Don Garber.

“Our partnership with Liga MX has brought out the best in both leagues on and off the field, and
I have no doubt the intensity will be even higher for the rematch in Minnesota. Beyond the
game, All-Star Week will celebrate our sport with a series of cultural and community initiatives
for the passionate soccer fans of the region.

From the first day through the MLS All-Star Game presented by Target, it will be an
unforgettable week in Minnesota.”

The MLS All-Star Game evolved from an East vs. West format to an annual summer friendly against prominent European teams, with teams like Chelsea, Juventus, and Real Madrid among
the opponents.

However, ahead of the 2020 match, MLS and Liga MX revealed plans to play in a new format,
which was postponed until 2021 due to the coronavirus outbreak. As part of what has evolved
into an event, that format will be maintained.

The reintroduction of the MLS All-Star Skills Challenge, which will involve five competitions:

a
shooting challenge, a touch challenge, a cross and volley challenge, a passing challenge, and a
crossbar challenge, will highlight All-Star week.

In addition, the league has a series of community events scheduled to support the communities
of Saint Paul and Minneapolis.
