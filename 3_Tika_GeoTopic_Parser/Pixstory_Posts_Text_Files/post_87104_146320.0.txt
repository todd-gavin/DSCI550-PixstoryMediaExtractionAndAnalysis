West Ham has emerged into a solid top-six side under David Moyes in the last couple of seasons. Moyes has built a good team and they are one of the sides that are extremely difficult to break down and defeat. They have a balanced squad and have good consistent players all over the pitch and Moyes must be given great credit for this as not many were convinced by his appointment as this is his second spell at the club. They have been underwhelming so far this season as they currently sit at 18thin the table and have only accumulated four points. We will look at their squad in-depth in this article.
Strengths
West Ham’s biggest strength is that their style of football suits their players to a tee and they can execute their roles perfectly. Moyes has implemented his philosophy onto the side and the style of football is quite traditional. They depend on the physicality of their players and being able to dominate and win second balls. The likes of Declan Rice in the midfield suit this style perfectly as his role is extremely simple but effective. He possesses good physical qualities and a strong range of passing which means they can be effective in transitions where the likes of Michael Antonio and Jarrod Bowen can create opportunities for the side. This all comes down to their system suiting their player’s qualities.
Weaknesses
One weakness of West Ham’s squad is that they are too reliant on their system and struggle to adapt to difficult situations. When they take the lead they have the quality to see out the opposition by defending rigorously and creating opportunities on the counter. However, when this is not the case and they have to chase games they are not productive and find it difficult to create multiple opportunities. Another weakness is their lack of squad depth if Michael Antonio or Declan Rice suffers an injury, this can prove to be detrimental to the team's performance.
