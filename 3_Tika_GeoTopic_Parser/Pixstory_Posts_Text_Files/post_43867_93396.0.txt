Barcelona are reportedly interested in signing Stuttgart winger Borna Sosa this summer for just €25 million (£20.9 million). Sosa has impressed for the German side over the past two seasons after a modest start following his arrival from Dinamo Zagreb. He had ten assists in the 2020/21 season, as newly promoted Stuttgart ended barely outside the European places.

Even though his team has been drawn into a relegation battle, he has been in fantastic form this season, assisting on seven goals for his teammates.

 According to Kicker, Sosa received a lot of attention during the January transfer window, but he decided to stay to assist Stuttgart avoid relegation.

However, the Bundesliga club is claimed to have agreed to allow the midfielder leave if interested clubs match their €25 million asking price.

Barcelona is one among the teams rumored to be looking for Sosa. Since Xavi took over as manager in November, La Blaugrana have gone from strength to strength, losing only once in 18 La Liga matches and climbing to second place in the rankings. Sosa isn't the only player they're paying attention to. 

Barça are also said to be close to completing a double swoop for Chelsea's Andreas Christensen and Cesar Azpilicueta, as well as Franck Kessie.

According to GOAL and Spox, Robert Lewandowski has not reached an agreement with Barcelona, despite the fact that he could leave Bayern this summer. 

According to a rumor from Poland, the striker was dissatisfied by Bayern Munich's refusal to initiate contract discussions, and instead agreed to a three-year agreement with the Catalan giants. That isn't thought to be the case, yet the Poland international might still depart the Bundesliga winners this summer.
