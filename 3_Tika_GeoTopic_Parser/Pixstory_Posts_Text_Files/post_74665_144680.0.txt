After an excellent opening weekend at the box office, Brahmastra held on well during the weekdays to register an overall good week Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt's Brahmastra has closed its opening week with collections at Rs. 170 crores. The Ayan Mukerji directorial collected Rs. 9.25 crores on the seventh day taking total collections a little above Rs. 170 crores. The trend on weekdays was slightly lower than expected, yet the film should enter the Rs. 200 crore club by the end of the second weekend 🔥🔥🔥🔥Of Rs. 170 crores, around Rs. 150 crores have come from the Hindi version, and the remaining Rs. 20 crores have come from South Dubbed. In the next 2 days, Brahmastra will topple Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 to emerge as the second highest-grossing film of the year after The Kashmir Files. The budget of Brahmastra is however much higher and hence, it isn't a clean hit despite the high numbers. 👍👍👍🥲As a matter of fact the first week is amongst the record opening that some of the biggest Bollywood blockbusters have taken over the last 10-15 years, and that makes the success of this Ayan Mukerji directed magnum opus all the more special. ✔️✅🔥🙏🙏The next milestone which Brahmastra now has is to enter the 200 Crore Club 🔥and for that it would be eyeing the timeline as end of second weekend. That should be possible as well since the film needs only 30 crores more over next three days to reach there. Considering the fact that the first weekend stood at 122 crores, it should be possible as well. In fact the aim should be to earn 40 crores over the weekend since there is no competition whatsoever either that the film is facing. 👍On Friday, Brahmastra producer and Bollywood filmmaker Karan Johar shared the official figures of Brahmastra in one week. Sharing the box office figures Karan wrote, “Love and light ruling the global box office at #1! Entering the second week with a heart full of gratitude and excitement,”🙏🙏🙏🙏
