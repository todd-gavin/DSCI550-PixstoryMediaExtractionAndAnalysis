The killing of George Floyd, a 44 year old black man by the US police is something that wouldn't fade away from our memory. 

The video showing the hand cuffed Floyed who is unable to breath was all over the Internet. Many came in support of Floyd and many bollywood stars to politician started tweeting against the brutalities from the police in the US. 

Even though these support are heartening, the support doesn't speak through the actions from Indians especially to students and others of African origin in India. They face racism on daily basis in their lives. 

A Sudanese-Indian worker who is an employee at a multinational firm in New Delhi, Mariyam Nuh shares her experience with racism. 

She recounts innumerable incidents of harassment that she faced on the streets and when she was called as "negro". “Every time I step out of the house, the police look at me like I’m a drug dealer or a prostitute looking to expand business,” she said. 

Racism is not systemic in India but it comes from cultural stereotypes and ignorance. Still it seems to be very real, she said. 

“I get very scared at police check posts. I have noticed my cab is always stopped once they take a good look at me,” Nuh said. She makes sure that she has her government identification card everytime be it even on her way to the office. 

In the recent years, New Delhi have made efforts on attracting many foreigners to the country’s universities and affordable medical facilities. But deep down racism results in serious violence on several occasions which has become a serious dent on these efforts.
