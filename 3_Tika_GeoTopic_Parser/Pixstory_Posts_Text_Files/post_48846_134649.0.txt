Pakistan contributes less than 1% to global carbon emission yet is facing one of the worst calamities in a really long time.
The exploitation and overusage of resources by the rich countries in Europe and North America have caused irreversible impacts on the climate. Scientists and economists recently confirmed overconsumption in rich countries like the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Japan, and South Korea is driving mass species extinction around the world.
Rich countries are responsible for climate change. The main culprits here are the rich countries' reliance on fossil fuels, which release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat inside the Earth, causing global temperatures to rise. This in turn causes more rain to fall, exacerbating the problem even further.
As a result of this cycle, many poor countries are now facing environmental disasters that they never thought possible. They're also seeing their crops and water resources dwindle, as well as their populations becoming increasingly vulnerable to various diseases.
Pakistan is just one of the many victims of the absolute hunger of America and Europe's obsession with luxury and imperialistic mindset. The third world neither have enough resources to slow down climate change in their countries, nor the means to protect themselves when calamities hit.
We need to realize this, and we need to realize this fast.
