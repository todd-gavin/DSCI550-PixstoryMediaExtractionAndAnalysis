Losing Rudiger to Real Madrid will break Chelsea s heart but his mind was made up months ago by Lampard s treatment of him Lampard completely ejected him from the team and I believe this had an impact on Rudiger That s when he decided not to sign a new contract You used to go if Real Madrid or Barcelona came calling That is no longer the case Chelsea are as good as Real Madrid as evidenced by their performance in the Champions League quarter finals The Blues had a poor first minutes but otherwise they were far superior to Real Madrid Chelsea is now letting a m m defender leave on a free transfer and bringing in someone for m who will be nowhere near as good as Rudiger As Rudiger and Andreas Christensen depart they will need to strengthen their defence Trevoh Chalobah is a good player but they play three at the back so they ll need to add another defender Even though Kai Havertz along with Mason Mount is Chelsea s best player and someone they can build a team around they still require a forward I m not saying it won t work with Romelu Lukaku but he needs to get it together and make his mind up that he s staying In my opinion his agent would never say something like what he said this week about discussing his future this summer if he hasn t been told something by Lukaku If I had an agent and he started saying something that I never said to him I d be getting rid of him tomorrow morning For me it s an easy way for Lukaku to get something out there without him saying it himself Lukaku wants to be at a great club and I don t see why he can t go on and score a load of goals But he can t have a season like he did this season for m
