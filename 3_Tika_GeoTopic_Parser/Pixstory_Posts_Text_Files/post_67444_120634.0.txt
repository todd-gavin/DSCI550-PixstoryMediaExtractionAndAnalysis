Cauliflower is a vegetable I'm sure all of us have eaten at least once in our lives. But I bet you've never seen cauliflower like this! 

Purple and orange cauliflower are 100% natural. The antioxidant anthocyanin, which is also present in red cabbage and red wine, gives purple cauliflower its lovely colour, which ranges from pale to jewel-toned.

The first orange cauliflower was found in Canada in 1970, but it required several generations of crossbreeding to make it publicly accessible. A genetic mutation that enables the plant to store extra beta carotene is what gives the colour to the plant. Additionally, it has around 25% more vitamin A than white cauliflower does.

Colored cauliflower has a little different flavour from its white version but has the same firmness, crumbling florets, and texture. Despite tasting nothing like cheese, orange cauliflower is sometimes called "cheddar" cauliflower. It has a delicate, slightly sweet, and creamy flavour. Similar in flavour to mild and somewhat sweet with nutty undertones is purple cauliflower.

You can cook it the same way you would a white cauliflower, but I suggest blanching it to preserve those gorgeous colours!
