Caffeine affects different people in different ways. The effects that caffeine has on the body of someone who is allergic to it are not the same as for someone who is caffeine intolerant.
When a person consumes caffeine, it is absorbed into their bloodstream from their gut. It can then affect how different organs work.
In the brain, caffeine blocks the effects of chemical messengers that normally make a person sleepy. It may also increase levels of adrenaline in the blood, which makes the brain and body more alert.
For people who have a non-allergic caffeine intolerance, the rush of adrenaline from caffeine may cause them to experience symptoms.
In contrast, a person with a caffeine allergy has symptoms that are caused by an allergic reaction.The body of a person who is allergic to caffeine treats it as if it were an invader. When they consume caffeine, their body produces an antibody called immunoglobin E.
As one 2014 studyTrusted Source suggests, people’s different response to caffeine is thought to relate to genetics. However, exactly what makes some people’s bodies treat caffeine as an allergen is not fully understood.
