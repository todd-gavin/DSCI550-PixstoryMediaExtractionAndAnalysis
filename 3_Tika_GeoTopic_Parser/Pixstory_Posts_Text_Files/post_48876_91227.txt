Recently the spine chilling case of the murder of Ana Abulaban by her husband Ali Abulaban tiktok JinnKid resurfaced on twitter and it compelled me to think just how anti women our system really is Reportedly Ana went to the police nine times to seek help NINE TIMES but they never took action and that is very telling of how our police work for only the oppressor and never for the oppressed Be it BIPoC queer people or women they are all repeatedly let down However it also made me think how come women get stuck in relationships like this I mean it shouldn t be rocket science to know to run for the hills at the first red flag isn t it Apparently not And that has a lot to do with how we are brought up Both men and women Most people especially men think patriarchy or gender wars are a thing of the internet They act like it doesn t exist in real life However it is far from the truth And the stats are the biggest proof of them One in three American women has suffered some sort of mild violence from her partner and one in seven women has been injured by her intimate partner And this is just physical In countries across Asia and the Pacific surveys indicate that between and percent of women have experienced physical and or sexual violence at the hands of an intimate partner These rates are alarmingly high How do women fall for such men The romanticization of toxic and borderline abusive behaviour in the media causes women especially young girls to fancy it Once again how they re brought up adds to it too Why do men get violent to their partners There is no uniform reason for marital violence There is no one size fits all solution Domestic violence against women is caused by a complex combination of sociological behavioral historical religious and cultural causes The difference between the upbringing of men and women is significant While men are taught to be dominant controlling and alpha women are taught to be polite nice and tolerant We have to make more safe spaces for women
