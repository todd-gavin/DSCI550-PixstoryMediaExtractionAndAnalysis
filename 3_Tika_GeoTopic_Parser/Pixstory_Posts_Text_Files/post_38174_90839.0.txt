Former Manchester United manager Louis Van Gaal has reportedly warned Erik Ten Hag. As per the Manchester Evening News, Van Gaal has asked the Ajax manager not to join Manchester United. 

Louis Van Gaal was signed by Manchester United in July 2014. The Dutchman was signed after David Moyes was sacked just months after joining the club. Hence Van Gaal arrived at the club in a pressure situation. 

In his two years in charge, Louis Van Gaal helped the Red Devils win an FA Cup title in 2016. He also brought Manchester United back into the Champions League after helping the club finish fourth in the 2014/15 season. 

The 70-year-old is currently managing the Netherlands national team. He is expected to lead his country in the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. In an interview with the Dutch team, Van Gaal has asked Erik Ten Hag to not join Manchester United! 

Louis Van Gaal said, "Erik ten Hag is a great coach, and that is always good for Manchester United. But Manchester United are a commercial club, so it’s a difficult choice for a coach. He’d better go to a football club."

The Dutch manager then added that though he would not call Erik Ten Hag about this, he expects a call from the Ajax manager himself. Hence it has to be seen what Ten Hag decides to do after talking to Van Gaal!



Will Erik Ten Hag join Manchester United? 


As stated earlier, Erik Ten Hag is one of the favourites to land the Manchester United job. The Dutchman has reportedly impressed the United board in the initial interview for the position. 

Erik Ten Hag is currently under contract at Eredivisie club Ajax. Though the club has not commented on it yet, it is widely expected that the 52-year-old would leave at the end of the season. Hence United could realistically be Ten Hag's next destination.
