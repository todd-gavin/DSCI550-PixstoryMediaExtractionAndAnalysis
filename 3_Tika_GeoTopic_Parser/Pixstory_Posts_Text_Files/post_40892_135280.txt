The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections They scorn the best I can do to relate them I am enamour d of growing out doors Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods Of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and mauls and the drivers of horses I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out What is commonest cheapest nearest easiest is Me Me going in for my chances spending for vast returns Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me Not asking the sky to come down to my good will Scattering it freely forever Walt Whitman
