We often find ourselves caught up in  stressful situations in our daily lives and forget to take care of ourselves. It’s vital to adopt a positive mindset so to overcome adversities and stay happy and relaxed. I’m going to share some tips with you for the same:

1. Start the day with a positive affirmation: Tell yourself how you’ll have a good day today and how amazing you are. You can even put a positive quote as your phone wallpaper or as a painting in your room.

2. Find humor in bad situations: Remind yourself that the situation you are in will make an amusing story later and try to crack a joke about it. 

3. Turn failures into lessons: Instead of focusing on how you failed, focus on where you went wrong, learn from the mistake and swear to not to repeat it again future.

4. Transform negative self-talk into positive self-talk: Negative self talk can demotivate a person and can become a cause of depression. When you catch yourself doing this, stop and replace those negative messages with positive ones. For example, I’m so bad at this becomes once I get more practice, I’ll be better at this. I shouldn’t have tried becomes that didn’t work out as planned—maybe next time.

5. Focus on the present: We often overthink about things and cannot let go of the past as a result. Most sources of negativity stem from a memory of a recent event or the exaggerated imagination of a potential future event. Therefore, it’s important to live in the present and forget about the past.
