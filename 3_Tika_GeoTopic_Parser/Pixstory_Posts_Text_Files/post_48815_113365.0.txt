Happy fourth of July, y'all!

But how happy it truly is for the Americans that are not cisgendered heterosexual white Christian men? Here's the tea ☕:

1) There has been millions of mass shootings happen in America since we got our 'independence'. In the seven months of 2022, 309 mass shootings have occured.

2) 1 out of every 6 American women has been the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime (14.8% completed, 2.8% attempted).

3) Compared to non-LGBTQ+ people, LGBTQ+ people (16 and over) are almost 4 times more likely to be the victim of violent victimisation – according to a study in 2017. And it has only gotten worse since.

4) Asian American adults experienced hate crimes at a rate of 16 percent in 2021, up from 12.5 percent in 2020; 31 percent express constant concern about being harmed due to their race, with South Asians often getting cornered in these conversations.

5) At least 19 transgender people in America have already been victims of fatal gunshots that killed them. These figures excluding a bigger number of anti-trans violence going unreported.

6) According to the International Labor Organization, at least 12.3 million people are subject to forced labor at any given time, of whom 2.4 million do so as a result of human trafficking. According to the US Department of State, between 14,500 and 17,500 individuals are reportedly trafficked into the US every year.

7) On average, nearly 20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the United States, much of which often goes unreported. Many times, it's not even looked into.

8) The Washington Post's research indicates that at least 1,055 people were shot and killed by police in 2021, predominantly black people but also other people of color.

9) Roe v. Wade overturning took away millions of people's reproductive rights.


All of this is not even the tip of the iceberg of what all is wrong with the greatest nation of the world. We need to wake up, we need to smell the damn coffee. We are not free, there's no independence in America.
