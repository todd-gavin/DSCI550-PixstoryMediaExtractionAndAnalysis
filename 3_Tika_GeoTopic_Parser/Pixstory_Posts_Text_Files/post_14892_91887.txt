Plastics and microplastics are recognized as an emerging pollutant with harmful effects on the health of the environment of humans and aquatic animals A study by the Water Research Institute of the National Research Council of Verbania Cnr Irsa has shown how different microplastics can cause a different impact on bacterial communities in water The research was published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials In a system that replicates an Italian river or lake we compared the bacterial communities that grow on PET polyethylene terephthalate obtained from a very abundant bottle of soft drink in water with those that develop on almost unknown used tire particles due to the fact that they tend not to float and sink very slowly explains Gianluca Corno of the Cnr Irsa We have therefore demonstrated that the former offers refuge to human pathogenic bacteria that can cause immediate risk to human health without promote immediate growth Thanks to the constant release of organic matter and nutrients, the tire particles favor the abnormal growth of so-called opportunistic bacteria which, while not causing a direct risk to humans, cause a loss of environmental quality of microbial biodiversity and a consequent impoverishment of ecosystem services offered Generally, the bacterial communities that grow on microplastics as biofilms are studied without analyzing the differences related to the type of plastic on which they proliferate, but as a single compartment, the so-called plastisphere. This result puts us for the first time in front of the need to reconsider the methods for analyzing microplastic pollution and taking into account tire particles which can have a decisive impact on the quality of aquatic ecosystems in countries such as Italy where rivers are particularly exposed to this type of pollution concludes Corno The research was funded in scope of the AENEAS project by AXA Research Fund
