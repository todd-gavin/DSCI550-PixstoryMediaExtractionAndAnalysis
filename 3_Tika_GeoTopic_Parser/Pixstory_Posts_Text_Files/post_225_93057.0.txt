After what seems like decades worth of back and forth about needing to â€˜crack open a cold oneâ€™ my brother-in-law and I finally got around to doing it yesterday. 

One sip in and I started on a long ramble about writing, journalism, media and misinformation, while my sister fell asleep and Tom patiently listened.

Tom has always led the way to great listening, and I definitely have a long way to go in catchup up with him, as I hardly gave him the space to put in a word.

I hope to work on making listening a way of life: listening is learning, and more importantly, I canâ€™t turn into my sister Avni Gupta ðŸ˜‰
