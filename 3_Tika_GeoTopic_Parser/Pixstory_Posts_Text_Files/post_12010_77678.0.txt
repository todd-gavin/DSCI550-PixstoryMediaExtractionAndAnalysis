Some people with long Covid may have hidden damage to their lungs, a small pilot study in the UK suggests.

Scientists used a novel xenon gas scan method to pick up lung abnormalities not identified by routine scans.

They focused on 11 people who had not required hospital care when they first caught Covid but experienced long-lasting breathlessness after their initial infection.

A larger, more detailed study is under way to confirm the results.

The work builds on an earlier study that looked at people who had been admitted to hospital with Covid.

Researchers say the findings shed some light on why breathlessness is so common in long Covid - though the reasons for feeling short of breath are often many and complex.

Long Covid refers to a host of symptoms that continue for many weeks after a coronavirus infection and cannot be explained by another cause.
