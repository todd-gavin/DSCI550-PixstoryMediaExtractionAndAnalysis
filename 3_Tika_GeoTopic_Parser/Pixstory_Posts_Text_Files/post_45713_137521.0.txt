The launch of Nasa's massive, next-generation rocket ship was halted on Saturday for the second time in a week due to a persistent fuel leak, which the space agency warned might push back the launch of its moon-to-Mars Artemis programme by at least a few weeks. 

TOI reported that about three hours before the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket's planned 2:17 p.m. EDT (1817 GMT) liftoff time from Cape Canaveral, Florida, preflight operations were suspended for the day. 

A half-century after the last lunar mission of Apollo, the predecessor of the Artemis programme, the unmanned test flight was to have been the first trip of both the SLS and Orion. It was intended to launch the capsule out to the moon and back.

Due to the delay, Jim Free, an assistant NASA administrator, informed reporters during a late-afternoon briefing that the earliest opportunity to try flying the rocket again would come during the next launch period, which spans from Sept. 19 to 30, or during a subsequent October window. 

According to space centre "range" restrictions governing how long a rocket may remain at the tower before liftoff, he added that the postponement would also require wheeling the spaceship off the launch pad and back into its assembly facility at some time.

Let’s see what happens next!
