There's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as everyone has their own reasons for wanting to travel. However, I truly believe everyone should have a bucket list. Big or small, but they should. Why it's important to have a travel bucket list in my opinion would be because:
1. Seeing the world is one of the greatest adventures life can offer. There's nothing like exploring new and exciting places, and by having a bucket list you're guaranteeing that you'll get to do so at some point in your lifetime.
2. Traveling opens your mind and senses to new cultures and ways of life, which can be really beneficial in improving your understanding of life as a whole. It can also lead to improved relationships with other people because you learn how to deal with different situations and emotions.
3. Travelling allows you to see yourself in a different light – from a perspective that's often unseen by regular people. You might even gain some new insights about yourself that you never knew before. 
4. It can be incredibly fun and fulfilling experience that will make you feel very alive and connected with the world around you. Plus, it gives you plenty of amazing stories and memories to share with friends and family when you get home!
5. Travelling can provide an escape from everyday struggles — something that is desperately needs nowadays given the stresses of modern life. When things are tough at home, travelling usually makes them seem afar. Less stressful.
