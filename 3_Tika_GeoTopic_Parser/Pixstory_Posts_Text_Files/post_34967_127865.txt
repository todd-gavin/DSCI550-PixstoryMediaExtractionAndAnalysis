The instrumental tests that Angel Di Maria underwent this morning at J Medical showed a low-grade lesion of the long adductor muscle of the left thigh. This is certainly not good news for Massimiliano Allegri who said he wasn&#39;t worried last night after the match. Let&#39;s see the results of the exams tomorrow, these are things that the captain had said to Dazn&#39;s microphones. He also had that little problem with his adductor a week ago but I&#39;m not worried now, let&#39;s see the results of the exams tomorrow. He doesn&#39;t know how long it will take Di Maria to get back on the pitch. none The Juventus medical staff communicated that the injury will be re-evaluated in about ten days to understand more about the actual recovery times So the Argentinian will certainly miss the next league games
