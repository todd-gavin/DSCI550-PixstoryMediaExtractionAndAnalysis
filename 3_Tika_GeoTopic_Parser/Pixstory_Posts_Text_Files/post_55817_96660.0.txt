According to the Australia Council for the Arts, more than half of Australia's population reads at least one work of fiction each year, with those who read novels doing so at least once a week. 

Nonetheless, with a population less than a tenth of that of the United States, Australian writers yearn for—and deserve—a larger international audience. They write engrossing original novels, short tales, and memoirs that deserve our attention. 

Even Patrick White, the most admired character in contemporary Australian literature and the first and only Australian to win the Nobel Prize, is little unknown in the world.

As Lithub tells us, after White’s death in 1990, an unfinished manuscript called The Hanging Garden was discovered in his desk drawer. The story starts on the eve of the Second World War. Her mother transports a young Greek expatriate to a run-down house in a Sydney suburb. A youngster has been billeted in the same house as his mother, who was killed in the London Blitz. The sensuous and halting awkwardness of these two ruined lives coalesces. White's sensitivity to the vicissitudes of dislocation is palpable throughout the novel, and his depictions of adolescence are as dreamy and rich as the garden in which his story unfolds. In its unedited rawness, the novel emerges as astonishingly honed, incomplete but nevertheless satisfying.
