The substitutes decided the game, but the opening 60 minutes were uninspiring. England woke up with the changes in Saka and Mount, and I’m not sure if we’ve learned anything new about this side ahead of the World Cup.The England lineup was formed of a 3-4-3 system Gareth Southgate regularly deploys, with Dier partnering Maguire and Stones - the latter going off injured. Luke Shaw started on the left of the four-man midfield / wing-back, and he was arguably a shining light in the opening 60 minutes with a goal to his name.Bellingham injected dominance and bravery, as he walked off to a standing ovation from the fans in Wembley. He looks like he’ll be starting in midfield against Iran barring any injury.Bukayo Saka reminded the neutrals what he can do from the right hand side, adding threat in his aggressive forward thinking and wise decision-making. Rice played his usual game, Foden looked busy without being effective. Has Foden done enough to start regularly?Luke Shaw looked inspired and determined despite not playing for his club at this current time, and it will be interesting to monitor him in the upcoming months. Is Nick Pope the goalkeeper to start for us? His error resulted in the equaliser, so there’s no guarantee he will be first name on the team sheet. Maguire was disappointing on the ball. Not looking confident.Still some questions unanswered.
