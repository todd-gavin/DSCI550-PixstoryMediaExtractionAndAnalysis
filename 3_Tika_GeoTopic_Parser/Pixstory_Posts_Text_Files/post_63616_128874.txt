 It is no secret that among the bands that nab the top spot in earning hate by the rest of the rock n roll and metal community Creed and Nickelback take the top two spots As to who is number one or two it is up to you to decide But do these bands really deserve such intense hate Honest answer No Creed and Nickelback are two of the most consistent unoriginal and uncreative rock bands out there true There is nothing special about them but sometimes some generic corporate rock with ridiculous lyrics is fine because it has that certain factor of dumb fun that a lot of great bands like Gojira Iron Maiden Dream Theater and Katatonia don t have These two bands have been the highest selling rock bands of the s and for many it is rather cool to hate on what is popular In the case of Creed they are hated for three things obscene levels of radio play of their biggest hits such as With Arms Wide Open My Sacrifice and One Last Breath This made people sick to their core essentially making Creed victims of their own success While the band has maintained that they are not religious their sort of Christian lyrics added a stigma to the band while Scott Stapp is not a particularly impressive vocalist sounding basically like a cheap version of Eddie Vedder from Pearl Jam For Nickelback the hate is not as much generated from their mediocre musicianship or lyrics as it is by their incredible marketing skills Signing off to Roadrunner Records a major heavy metal label Nickleback marketed their music in the most innovative way one could think of A barely classifiable hard rock band getting the backing of a major metal label made them prime targets of hate and gave them all the publicity they needed It s become one of the biggest memes to trash talk Nickelback and yet their biggest haters will bump their heads to one of their songs Nickelback songs are made with a strict corporate approach in mind that is if not anything else guaranteed to sell records
