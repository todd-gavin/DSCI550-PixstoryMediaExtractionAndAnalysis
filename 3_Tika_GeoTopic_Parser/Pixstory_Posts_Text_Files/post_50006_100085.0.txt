A burlesque is a literary, dramatic or musical work aimed to cause laughter by caricaturing the mood or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects.The word derives from the Italian burlesco, which, in turn, is derived from the Italian burla – a joke, ridicule or mockery.

Burlesque overlaps in meaning with caricature, parody and travesty, and, in its theatrical sense, with extravaganza, as presented during the Victorian era.
