FC Barcelona took on FC Viktoria Plzeň in their first match of the UEFA Champions League 2022-23 season tonight at Camp Nou and embarked on a very promising campaign ahead. They got the perfect start to their UCL season with a sensational 5-1 victory over the Czech first division team and this will definitely be a confidence booster for them. 
FC Barcelona’s new signing Robert Lewandowski was undoubtedly the star of this match. The Polish striker scored his first hat trick in Blaugrana colours tonight and has now become the only player to score a hat trick in the UEFA Champions League for three different clubs. 
However, another top performer for FC Barcelona tonight was Ousmane Dembele, who has been on a whole new level since signing his contract renewal for the Spanish giants. He provided two assists tonight but it would be wrong to judge how good he was based on numbers only. 
The result of the game could be totally different had it not been for a VAR intervention tough. Right after FC Barcelona opened their scoring via Franck Kessie, the referee showed Andreas Christensen a red card for a foul inside his own box and awarded Viktoria a penalty. However, VAR later overturned those decisions. 
As you might expect, FC Barcelona completely dominated FC Viktoria Plzeň in every aspect of the game. They maintained a 77% possession, attempted 20 shots (11 on target) compared to Viktoria’s 8 shots (1 on target) and also played almost triple the number of their passes. 
This was the biggest victory for FC Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League in a long time and thus it will act as a huge confidence booster for all the players. It also showed us that FC Barcelona has totally transformed themselves in a short span and they are now a force to be reckoned with. 
They will take on FC Bayern Munich on 14th September next in the UEFA Champions League and that will be their first big match of the season.
