A video montage of a mosque is being widely shared on social media with a claim in Hindi that says Muslims have taken over an ancient Hindu temple in Kerala and converted it into a mosque. It also alleges that despite opposition from the Hindu community, the “left-communist” government of Kerala has decided not to take any action.

The claim suggests that the alleged temple was recently taken over by Muslims.

The video is also viral on Facebook with the same claim.

False communal spin
We took a close look at the video and noticed that the video montage has documentary style edits. This was the first red flag. Then we noticed that within a few seconds a watermark appears on the video. It reads “TSOI” which later transitions into “Thousand Shades of India”. The name suggested that the video was most likely taken from a documentary.

Taking this clue, we checked the Instagram page of Thousand Shades of India (TSOI) and found the same video on their feed, uploaded on December 20, 2021. The caption on the post reads that the video is of the Zeenat Baksh Mosque in Mangalore’s Bunder, which houses one of India’s oldest Muslim communities.

As per the bio of Thousand Shades of India on YouTube, the page celebrates the diverse heritage of the nation. It reads, “We celebrate India’s diversity in life and livelihood, cultures and traditions, heritage and history, art and craft through our stories and documentaries!” It appears that the intention behind the video was to celebrate the beauty of the structure.
