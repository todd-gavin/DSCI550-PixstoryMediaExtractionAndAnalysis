Can I be your light Even though you don t love me I ll be your good night Am I a bad tide Damaging your sea and fly away like a kite If you only know me once maybe you could give me a chance Maybe later you would say me hey thanks We could plan some pranks No more lacks I promise to keep you safe and sound Even if your not in my town I will always try hard to keep you safe in my heart Just remember you and I will never be apart I could guide you straight If you re stuck I would open every gate Can I be a flower That makes your garden shine I ll make you fine Today I m the one you hate one day I ll be your inspiration gate Today you want me to go away one day you wish me to stay
