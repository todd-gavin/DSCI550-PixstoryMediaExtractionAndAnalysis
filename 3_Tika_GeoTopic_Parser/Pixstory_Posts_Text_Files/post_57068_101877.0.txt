Much chaos has been created around the Amber Heard and Johnny Depp case.
The troll games on social media against Amber Heard have gotten extreme, with a large bunch of people supporting Depp.

It is still unclear about what actually has happened in the Depp-Heard case but what remains the point of concern is that the message it is giving for a woman is vicious.
The Depp fandom is apparently more extraordinary than that of Heard. She has been constantly abused and targeted by these fans who think women are often the abusers in a relationship.

The whole narrative created on social media has some cruel misogynist points.
The ideas and trolling on social media don't limit themselves to what Heard should be blamed for, but rather it is setting a delusional notion for women who are the victims of emotional and physical abuse.

The reality is that abuse is a very gendered issue; women tend to be the victims of violence more than men. Although it doesn't mean that men always have to be perpetrators in every case, what is more likely observed is that women lie on the side where they endure the violence of masculinity.

The case pictures seem very clear; a person with more popularity would always dominate the less popular one. Still, it should not set such misogynist narratives on social media where not just Heard but rather any woman is attacked and abused online, fomenting sexism.
