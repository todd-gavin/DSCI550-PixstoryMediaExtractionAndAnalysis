“The Last Queen” is written by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni. Previously, I read ‘The Palace of Illusions’ and ‘The Forest Of Enchantments’ written by above-mentioned author and books were based on Mahabharata and Ramayana respectively but Chitra Banerjee wrote this book from the point of view of Draupadi and Sita, which was the key point of both the books 

I will recommend you both the books as a must-read.

“The Last Queen” is a book based on the story of Rani Jindan, Mother of The Khalsa. 

Today, I will start reading this book and whenever I’ll finish the reading, I’ll discuss it with you all.
