The announcement of Eid al-Fitr this year in various cities of Afghanistan last night was accompanied by widespread joyful shootings. The blessed ceremony of Eid al-Fitr prayers was held yesterday morning in the mosques and public places of this country and the people of Afghanistan participated in the Eid prayers amid strict security measures.
Although bloody terrorist attacks have targeted Afghan mosques in recent days, Eid prayers were held in a peaceful atmosphere without any terrorist incidents amid tight Taliban security measures.

The Taliban Interior Ministry has also assured the Afghan people of the security of Eid al-Fitr in Afghanistan. One of the differences between Eid al-Fitr this year and previous years in Afghanistan is the departure of the occupiers from Afghanistan.

The people of Afghanistan say that although the military war with the occupiers is over, the cultural and economic war with the Western colonization continues. Afghanistan was one of the few countries that declared Sunday Eid al-Fitr yesterday.
Eid al-Fitr is celebrated in Afghanistan for three days and is the biggest Eid of the people of this country.
