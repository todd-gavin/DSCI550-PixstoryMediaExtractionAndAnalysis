Even before the director starts the shooting of the movie the director and music director had to sit together to decide what type of music and songs will be used for that particular movie Songs are the soul of the movie and song plays a very crucial part to attract an audience to buy tickets for the movie especially for me And If we are talking about the songs and we all know that The Oscars ceremony is around the corner so why not today we should talk about the nominations for the Best Original Song of this year s Oscars This year five songs got the nominations in The Oscars which are as follows No Time to Die Billie Eilish Somehow You Do Diane Warren Be Alive Beyonc Down to Joy Van Morrison Dos Oruguitas Lin Manuel Miranda Out of five songs my favorite song in the above list is No Time to Die No time to Die is a title song of The James Bond movie named No time to Die and the song was sung by none other than Billie Eilish Song was released way back in but the movie No Time to Die was released in and because of that the song is eligible to get the Oscar nomination The most important thing I liked about the song is its title selection and how important the song is for the movie Other things that I liked about the song which made it so special were the voice of Billie Eilish and the lyrics of the song My favorite part of the song is as follows I let it burn You re no longer my concern Faces from my past return Another lesson yet to learn That I d fallen for a lie You were never on my side For once listen to this song and I promise you that you will listen to this song on loop I hope that No time to Die will win the Oscars and make all the James Bond and Billie Eilish fans happy
