Recent chaos is about the unavailability of baby formula in the United States.
It is a nationwide crisis and stress for many mothers who don't breastfeed.
The shortage was first seen during the Pandemic when scarcity was created due to a lack of labour, raw materials, and production.
"The formula shortage was triggered by supply chain issues, including the scarce availability of some formula ingredients and staff shortages that have made it difficult to get products out of warehouses and onto store shelves." NY Times reports.

Then in February, the problem worsened as at least four babies were hospitalised, and two died after consuming the products made by Abbott Nutrition, a baby food manufacturer. 
Many parents are trying to find the limited stocks of the baby formula, while others are trying to deal with the problem by making a homemade formula for infants.(which can be dangerous)

On Thursday, President Biden released a plan to return infant formula to store shelves, involving the Federal Trade Commission, individual states and the private sector.
