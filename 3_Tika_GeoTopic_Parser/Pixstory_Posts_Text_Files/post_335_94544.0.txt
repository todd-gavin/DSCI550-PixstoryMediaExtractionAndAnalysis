The sex binary is an unscientific myth that erases transgender and intersex people, while simultaneously attempting to limit cisgender people from the possibility of becoming. 

The arguments upholding differences based on “biological sex” fall apart the more you dig into the details of how genes, gonads, and hormones keep sex subject to change. 

“The truth is, your biological sex isn’t carved in stone, but a living system with the potential for change,” Neurobiologist Dr. Simón(e) D Sun writes in the Scientific American.

The continued practice of a sex binary restricts every person through toxic masculinity and patriarchal femininity. 

There is nothing unscientific about men becoming pregnant. 

Those who refuse to believe that men can be pregnant, are also refusing a path to become their full selves through a gender essentialist erasure that reduces all of us to our anatomy.
