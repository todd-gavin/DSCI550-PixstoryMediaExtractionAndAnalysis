Milk is an essential part of human diet. I can understand why you wouldn't want to have meat. It is violent even though I don't see why you would not include a proper balance in your diet, but even milk?

Milk is something that we need in our diet for our calcium requirement. You don't want kids growing up with weak bones now, do you? Milk has many essential nutrients that we need. This veganism thing is going a bit too extreme, don't you think? Veganism is not healthy.
