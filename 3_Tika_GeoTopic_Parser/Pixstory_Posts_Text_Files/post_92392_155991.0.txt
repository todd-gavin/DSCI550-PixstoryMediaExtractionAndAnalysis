Days after it was announced that Travis Barker would be hitting the road with blink-182, Kourtney Kardashian showed her support by rockin' the band's logo hoodie on Instagram.
Ready to be the ultimate girl at the rock show.🖤👨‍🎤
After blink-182 announced they were reuniting for a world tour, Kourtney Kardashian proved she is eager to hit the road with husband Travis Barker and his bandmates.😉
In a series of Instagram pics, the Kardashians star, 43, got into the goth-glam spirit, rockin' a black blink-182 hoodie teamed with a sexy black netted skirt with a thong underneath and chunky lug-sole, knee-high boots. Completing the vibe, Kourtney's dark hair was styled in a sleek bob and wore little-to-no makeup.💗
"Rockstar world tour wife," she captioned the Oct. 14 post. "Getting ready to mosh in a city near you."
