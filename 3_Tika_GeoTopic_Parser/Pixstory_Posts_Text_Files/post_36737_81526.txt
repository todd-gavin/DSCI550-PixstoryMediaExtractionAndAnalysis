A tiny camera that fits inside a pill sized capsule has revolutionised cancer screening in Scotland Over two thousand patients have now used the PillCam rather than the more traditional invasive method of having a colonoscopy A camera sits inside a vitamin size capsule you swallow As the capsule travels through your digestive tract the camera takes thousands of pictures that are transmitted to a recorder you wear on a belt around your waist This capsule helps doctors see inside your small intestine an area that isn t easily reached with more traditional colonoscopy procedures Waiting lists for colonoscopy procedures are long But this new technology allows patients to take charge of their screening from home These miniscule cameras could help to reduce wait times and catch cancers early when they are easier to treat
