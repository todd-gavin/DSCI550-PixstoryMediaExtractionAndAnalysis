Finally after years of imploring, The Star Wars fans have gotten their wish, Ewan McGregor has returned as Obi-Wan Kenobi, he portrayed one of the fan favourite Jedi in the prequel trilogy and got tremendous love showered on him for the role.
It was expected that 10 years after the Fall of the Republic and the death of his comrades, lover and the betrayal by his best friend and student, Obi-Wan would he shattered. That is exactly how it was, once a quick and cunning Jedi, Obi-Wan in the first three episodes is just slow and rusty, he can't think on his feet and can't even properly control the force.

He's in pain and anguish seeing Anakin as Darth Vader, its terrifying when Vader finally comes to confront Obi-Wan, the duel will get a rematch again for sure. Its really sad to see Obi-Wan in such a frail stae but it's only for some time as he'll get back to his usual self and be on with the Force.

The creators have done a wonderful job at showing different aspects of the Star Wars Universe after the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Empire. It'll be very interesting to see where they take this series, as only 3 episodes have come out yet.

Ewan McGregor has done a wonderful job at portraying the broken Obi-Wan Kenobi. As a Star Wars fan it's really exciting to see this franchise back on track again and listening to the fans.
