Western Bulldogs star Bailey Smith has been offered a two-game AFL suspension for headbutting Geelong defender Zach Tuohy.

The dynamic midfielder was cited for a scuffle with Tuohy at three-quarter-time of the Bulldogs' 13-point defeat on Friday night.

Smith was reported immediately by the umpires and, on Saturday, was formally cited by the AFL's match review officer Michael Christian.

Christian deemed Smith's headbutt as intentional, with medium impact and high contact.

"The incident was classified as a two-match sanction as a first offence," an AFL statement said.

"[Smith] can accept a two-match sanction with an early [guilty] plea."

Tuohy has also been cited for "other misconduct" on Smith.

The Geelong utility has been offered a $1,000 fine with an early guilty plea.

After the pair grabbed each other's jumpers, Tuohy walked away from the wrestle with a minor cut on his forehead.

Tuohy spoke to Smith post-game, saying there was "all love at the end".

"Emotions were getting the better of both of us," Tuohy told Fox Footy.

"I think I was pulling and dragging at him as much as he was me, so there's not much in it."

Smith, who has never been reported before, has become one of the Bulldogs' most important players since being drafted in 2018.
