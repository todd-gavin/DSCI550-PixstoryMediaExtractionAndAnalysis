As we draw ever closer to the vital Premier League fixture against Liverpool Mikel Arteta took a moment to commend the renewed sense of belonging all across the club In a short press conference ahead of the Liverpool match the boss was asked by the media what was key to maintaining our momentum and connection We have to keep giving our fans more reasons to be even more present and more supportive of the team But at the moment we cannot ask anything of them The atmosphere they create every time we play for them is fantastic We want to continue to have those moments together Arteta s appreciation of our current club wide unity is heightened by his recognition of what needed to be done to renew that sense of togetherness I think one of the things in terms of how you measure success as well as lifting trophies is needing to understand where we were How we looked at the time and how it looks right now it s a credit to everybody that has been involved in the last few seasons to achieve that he added It s far from the final destination however and just as performances can continually improve there s still plenty of room to grow together as a football club I m really happy I m proud obviously of the change the dynamics the atmosphere and the belief around the club But as we re looking ahead to where we want to be and we are not there yet With eight league games played we remain top of the Premier League and inevitable questions abound whether we can add to our trophy cabinet this season but silverware isn t Arteta s mark of true success If you win but you don t have that connection is that really the meaning and the purpose of how you do things For me the answer is no If you re able to win we set an atmosphere and such a feeling of belonging and participation I think it s much better
