While world leaders, including President Biden, have imposed sanctions on Russia as a result of its multifront war in Ukraine, significant Hollywood figures have reacted quickly to denounce President Vladimir Putin's conduct. 

Musicians, festival organisers, and industry leaders have announced their plans to postpone events in Russia during the last week, drastically reducing the country's entertainment options.

In light of recent events, we're sad to announce our Russia and Ukraine shows are canceled until further notice. Our thoughts are with Ukraine and all others suffering from this needless war," a statement on the band's social media accounts reads. 

Imagine Dragons was set to perform in Russia and Ukraine in June, but the band announced their cancellation over the weekend. 

Green Day made a similar message earlier this week on its Instagram Story. 

"With heavy hearts, we feel it is necessary to cancel our scheduled gig in Moscow at Spartak Stadium due to current events," Green Day stated. 

"We understand that this isn't about rock concerts in stadiums; it's about something much broader. But we also understand that rock and roll is eternal, and we are convinced that there will be a time and a place for us to return "The band went on. "At the time of purchase, refunds are available. Keep yourself safe."
