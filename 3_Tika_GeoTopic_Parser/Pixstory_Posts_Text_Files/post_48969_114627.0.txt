Veganism is an ethical lifestyle founded on the notion that people should not abuse or exploit animals. Vegans avoid eating animal products – but not because they are on a diet

If we call veganism a diet, it takes the opportunity away from many people, like chronically ill individuals. They can continue their medicines that might have animal derived ingredients in it while reducing harm from other parts of their lives. Calling veganism a diet is an inaccurate and outdated way of seeing this philosophical lifestyle.

Veganism is so much more than a diet, it’s a lifestyle. The Vegan Society’s definition of veganism is “way of living which seeks to exclude – as far as is 'possible and practicable' – all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of humans, animals and the environment. In dietary terms, it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals."

Vegans do not consume or support animal-exploitative events or industries such as rodeos, circuses, or zoos; vegans avoid items tested on animals; vegans do not attend or support animal-exploitation events or industries such as rodeos, circuses, or zoos. Dieting has nothing to do with any of this.

Vegans do not consider animal-based foods to be food, hence refraining from consuming them is not a diet restriction. It is possible, however, to be vegan while restricting some vegan meals, which is a type of dieting.

There are more than one ways to be vegan. Intersectional veganism is all about that. A lot of people, for example, cannot afford to go fully plant based for multiple reasons. It could be financial instability, or perhaps physical condition. But they can opt to cut out what they can.
