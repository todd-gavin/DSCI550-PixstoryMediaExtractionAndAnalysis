Real Madrid is the most successful club in Europe, with an incredible record of Champions League trophies. They are acknowledged as European royalty, thanks to their players who have been stable over the years, with new players coming and going but the team mentality remaining perpetual.
The club is most well-known for producing great talents who have led the club to
unfathomable heights; this demonstrates how the club has remained consistent in its pursuit of trophies. And in this article, we rank the top ten Real Madrid defenders of all time.
10 Dani Carvajal
Carvajal was one of the best right-backs in Real Madrid history, appearing in every
Champions League final and being an irreplaceable player who is still Real Madrid's first-choice full-back. His precise crossing makes him a dominant full-back on the team, and he is also an excellent passer. Carvajal has appeared in 338 games for Real Madrid and has five Champions League titles to his name.
9 Lucas Vasquez
Vasquez made his way to Real Madrid's first team after being promoted from the Real Madrid academy from the Espanyol B team. He has since been a key starter in many matches. He returned to the club in 2015 and was a key player at right-back. His speed and small stature enable him to make behind-the-back runs and beat offside traps; he can also combine well with wingers and provide many game-winning assists. Vasquez has appeared in 285 games for Real Madrid and has four Champions League titles to his name.
8 Raul Albiol
Albiol was brought in to replace Pepe after the Portuguese suffered serious injury problems and was forced to miss a season. Albiol was impressive and was valued at around â‚¬ 15 million. Along with Ramos, he quickly established himself as the undisputed leader. However, injuries limited his match timing, and he spent the majority of the time on the bench. Before joining Napoli, he appeared in 119 games for the club.
