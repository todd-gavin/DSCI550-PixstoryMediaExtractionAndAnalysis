Healthy soil is essential to feeding our planet but human activity is making healthy soils disappear When soil health declines farmers can no longer rely on it to produce the amount of crops they need to feed their communities According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature if soil degradation continues at its current rate we could experience a food production shortfall of by Animal agriculture contributes to soil degradation in two ways First the widespread deforestation for cattle grazing and feed production erodes nutrient rich top soil making the soil unsuitable for plants to grow Second farmers who grow corn and soy for animal feed often over cultivate soil in an effort to produce as much product as cheaply as possible They don t give the soil enough time to recover and restore its nutrients which may maximize their harvest in the short term but destroys the soil in the long term Reducing demand for meat and making the switch to plant based foods gives soil the opportunity to heal By freeing up land that was once used for meat production we make space for the process of rewilding letting environments get back to their natural rhythms and recover from degradation
