Oil marketing companies (OMC) have slashed the price of 19 kg commercial LPG cylinder by around ₹135 with immediate effect from today.
Meanwhile, a 14.2-kg LPG cylinder costs ₹1,003 in the national capital. Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana beneficiaries will get ₹200 subsidy directly in their bank account and the effective price for them would be ₹803 per 14.2-kg cylinder.
There was no subsidy paid on cooking gas since June 2020, and all users including Ujjwala beneficiaries bought cylinders at market rate, which currently is ₹1,003 in Delhi.
Non-subsidised LPG now costs ₹1,003 per 14.2-kg cylinder in the national capital, up from ₹999.50 previously, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers. Since April 2021, prices have risen by ₹193.5 per cylinder.
An oil ministry official earlier stated that the Saudi LPG prices have gone up by 33 per cent while domestic rates have increased by only 11 per cent.
After the assembly elections held in five states, the prices of petrol, diesel, and LPG are being increased continuously.
