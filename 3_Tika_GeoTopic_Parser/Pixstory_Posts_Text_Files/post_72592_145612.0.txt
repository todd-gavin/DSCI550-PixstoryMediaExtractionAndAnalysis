Loneliness is not caused by the absence of loved ones....
It's when my conscious says me that nobody cares about you....
It's feeling for Poetry
A solace for meditation
And process of emancipation...!!!
It's not absurd that one should goes through a tough time, the time of solitude where he or she is free from the concern of others... Doing what they wanted to do without any prejudices or judgement of being procecuted!!!
Love is essential for humanity but it should be unconditional...
I know it's very difficult to love somebody without any condition...
But once you love, it's rhythm of happiness will bound you until your death...
Just love faithfully even if you are alone...
Love will covers you with its majestic wings of fraternity ❤❤❤❤🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
