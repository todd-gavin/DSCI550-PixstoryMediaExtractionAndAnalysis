Should I avoid breastfeeding my baby if I have a cold?

“If you have a common cold, it’s mostly fine to breastfeed your baby. "

“If you are taking medicines, they may get transferred into your breast milk, which is why you should discuss your illness with your pediatrician."

Can I breastfeed my baby even if I haven't eaten anything in a while?
“Yes, you will be able to breastfeed your baby without affecting the quality of the breastmilk as your body has been preparing for this throughout pregnancy."
