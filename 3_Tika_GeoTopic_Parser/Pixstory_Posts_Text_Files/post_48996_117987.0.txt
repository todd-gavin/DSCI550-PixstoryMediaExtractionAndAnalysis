I just realized I haven't posted any vegan recipes on my blog and thought it would be a good day to start because it's always a good day to help people cook vegan! For a delicious and quick vegan pasta, here we go!

Ingredients : 

 200 g pasta

 4 tbsp capers, finely diced

 Fresh basil, very finely chopped

 Chilli flakes and Oregano 

 2 garlic cloves, finely diced

 2 tbsp nutritional yeast

 2-3 tbsp olive oil

Method : 

 Cook the pasta until it is just shy of becoming al dente in lots of water. Just before draining the pasta, save a little cup of the pasta water while you're at it.

 Warm up some olive oil in a nonstick pan. Add the garlic, stir often, and let it cook on low heat. 

 Add nutritional yeast, roughly 2 tablespoons of the pasta cooking water previously saved, and 1 tablespoon of caper brine once the garlic is fragrant and tender. To create a thin emulsion to coat your pasta, combine everything in a bowl and stir well. Give it a few seconds to simmer softly.

 Add the pasta, capers and parsley to a pan and toss. Sprinkle with oregano mix and chilli flakes. 

  Most importantly – Enjoy!
