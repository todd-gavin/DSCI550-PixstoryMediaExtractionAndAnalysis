A surprising amount of the She-Hulk: Attorney at Law pilot dealt with whether or not Steve Rogers was a virgin. Jennifer Walters brings it up a few times throughout the episode before the big reveal takes place in the episode's post-credits scene. According to Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), "Steve Rogers is not a virgin."
The character has long-thought to have passed away some point after Avengers: Endgame, considering he went back in time to live his life with Peggy Carter. Given that Banner uses the present tense when compared to Walters' line where she claimed she thought he was dead, it's looking increasingly likely Evans' beloved hero is canonically alive within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The idea of whether or not Rogers has ever had sex has long been a fan-favorite theory. Evans himself even spoke to the situation in 2014.
"I think there's just so much to explore," Evans shared. "Not just with the evolution of myself and  Mackie's character, but the reconnection with Bucky and ultimately a relationship with a woman. It'd be nice to see him—it's funny when you think about it. He's probably a virgin. He's probably a virgin! I don't know when it would've happened."
While he tries his best to not share details but eventually caves when Jennifer pretends to be drunk and weeps over Steve remaining a virgin for a century. Annoyed by her pity for him, Bruce announces, “Steve Rogers is not a virgin. He lost his virginity to a girl in 1943 on the USO tour." The details seem to have caught Chris Evans by surprise. The actor took to Twitter and shared a reaction to what appears to be the scandalous revelation. The Captain America actor tweeted, “😂😂", adding the hashtag She-Hulk.
