There are a lot of spectacular rail rides in Australia. The Indian Pacific Railway runs between Sydney and Perth, passing past the magnificent Blue Mountains and into the outback before reaching the steep Flinders Ranges. 

TN agrees that stopping in Adelaide is a must-do if you want to savour gourmet food, art museums, and the city's wide-open spaces. Returning to the road, you'll go across the Nullabor Plain, where you'll find the straight portion, before sweeping through the rich Avon Valley and into Perth. 

Riding the Indian Pacific is a fantastic way to view Australia's diverse landscapes while taking advantage of the train's luxurious amenities.
