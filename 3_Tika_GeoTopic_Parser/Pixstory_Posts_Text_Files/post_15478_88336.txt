I have already told you some details of my visit to the Pope&#39;s summer residence in Castel Gandolfo not far from Rome but perhaps I had focused more on the gardens because they are truly enchanting I must say however that the courtyard immediately at the entrance also deserves a little attention of the Residence where some of the mobile Popes used over the decades by the popes are parked Here I leave you a small taste because to see all these wonders you absolutely must organize a visit
