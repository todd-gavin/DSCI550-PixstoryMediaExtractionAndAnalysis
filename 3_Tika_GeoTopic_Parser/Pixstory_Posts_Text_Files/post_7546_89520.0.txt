Panic grips me,
Intangled, can't move,
Our fates were entwined,
Thoughts prelude my reality,
My existence comes in the way,
Of your memories of happiness.
I embrace this obsession,
Of your endless thoughts,
That plunge me into chaos,
I believe every word you say,
Curse me rather than standing behind,
While I just think of ringing to you,
My voice has been ceased,
By your ranging emotions,
As teary eyed I might get,
By this exile you've forced,
Upon my life and words,
I don't seek freedom, 
As I'm only bound,
By these chains of roses,
I'd give them all to you,
You'd just burn them,
The way my soul does.
Every time I look into your eyes,
They make my heart bleed,
Carmine from my eyes,
As you evade them.
I want to talk to someone,
About how this separation 
Has left me lonely,
There's no one to listen,
My elusive conceits of my feelings. 
The thorns of these roses,
Choke my throat,
I cannot speak a word,
Either way you never would've listened,
To this Skylark that admired you.
My breath is held captive,
On your demands.
So, tell me should I let go, 
Of love that was never mine,
To embrace the madness,
Your absence will cause.
I know all your next moves,
Change directions when you see me,
Pretend to not hear,
As I call out your name,
To get a moment to talk.
You said if I turned cold towards you,
It wouldn't please you,
Your actions warrant that though.
In this game of roses,
I'll always lose,
As my heart is pulled down by the chains,
Of your unjust roses.
