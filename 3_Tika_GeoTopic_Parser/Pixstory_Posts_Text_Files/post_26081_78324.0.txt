One of the two new Indian Premier League franchises, Luck Super Giants have unveiled their logo less than two weeks ahead of the mega IPL 2022 auction. The franchise which will be led by KL Rahul has said that the logo has been inspired by ancient Indian mythology.

The franchise took to Twitter to unveil the logo and wrote," Soaring towards greatness. Lucknow Super Giants is all set to stretch its wings. Prepare for greatness!".

The franchise explained that the wings are of the mythical bird Garuda for inspiring the team, while the tri-color represents the pan-India appeal of the Lucknow-based franchise. They further explained that the body of the bird has a blue colour bat to signify the game of cricket while the red ball with an orange seam is an auspicious ‘Jay Tilak.’
