Periods are biological we have no control over them and no choice in the issue Why do we have to spend so much for something we didn t ask for menstrual hygiene products are pricey Women should not be penalised for something they have no control over nor should they be penalised for going through a natural life process Profiting from women s lack of access to essential health care is unethical According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics consumer prices increased by percent in Prices continue to rise while salaries remain stagnant This means that menstrual products are becoming increasingly pricey for women who don t make enough money and those who can t buy them will have to rely on unsanitary methods to take care of themselves Obtaining menstrual items becomes a luxury when they are not evenly available Another kick in the gut not only do you have to pay for it but you also have to pay a tax for it Consequences of that are obviously avoidable Women may miss work or even school because they are unable to obtain the things they require due to financial constraints Not to mention the government keeps trying to many times successfully control women s reproductive rights so they might as well pay for it Condoms are free almost everywhere in US and sex is something that you can control but period products are so expensive even though it s not in our hands Period poverty is a reality and given that the United States is one of the richest countries on the planet it s absurd to consider how tough it may be for women to obtain menstrual hygiene products
