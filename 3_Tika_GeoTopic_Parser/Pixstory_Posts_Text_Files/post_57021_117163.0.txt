The problem is not that these ads inform or educate someone; instead, it is about what they do by misinforming patients and people.

By promoting a drug as the solution to a health problem, these advertisements may lead viewers to believe that adopting healthy behaviours, such as a good diet and exercise, is ineffective or unnecessary. In addition, because it rarely focuses on public health messages about diet, exercise, addictions, social issues, and other treatments, it can also cause people to falsely believe that they are well informed, reducing their motivation to search for more reliable information.

Studies have found that when a claim presents a drug as being very efficacious, consumers do not make much effort to process the rest of the information within the message. Information about risks is also typically presented in often-ignored smaller print or as part of a large, undifferentiated block of text or audio. Additionally, ads often show mismatches between visual imagery and verbal messages when presented with risk information.

Besides whatever is being said or done by FDA, the planned way of trying to deceive people has never ended. 
Also, Suppose a patient’s request for an advertised drug is clinically inappropriate, and the health care provider is unable or unwilling to correct the patient’s perception that it is a good choice. In that case, this situation may lead to unnecessary or harmful prescribing. 

No matter how long we justify the existence of these ads, it is all refuted by the negative impacts of these ads.
They should be banned!
