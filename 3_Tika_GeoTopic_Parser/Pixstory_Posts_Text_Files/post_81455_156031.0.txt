In a game delayed 40 minutes due to a power cut, Bukayo Saka provided the spark by hitting his fourth goal in a week to beat Leeds United - but that only told half the story of a dramatic encounter at Elland Road.The attacker rifled in the only goal of the game on 35 minutes to ensure we won nine of our first 10 top-flight games for the first time ever, but this was far from a routine victory as the hosts pushed us all the way.We received a let-off in the second half when Patrick Bamford pulled a penalty wide of the mark, and also survived a VAR penalty check deep into stoppage time to remain top of the Premier League table.
