Many of us struggle with make-up. Here are some of my personal favorite hacks to help you with your face for a perfect day out!
Use a primer. I can never stress enough how much difference a primer makes. It will help to minimise pores and improve the appearance of your foundation.
Prior to applying eyeshadow, set the primer or concealer; this will enable an incredibly smoother blending of the eyeshadow. You don't have to overdo it obviously when you're going with a natural look.
The contour of your brows matters! Find the shape that best suits you. If something makes you look nice, it doesn't need to be "in trend." Don't worry about what celebrities are doing to their face, find out your best fit.
Learn how your face is structured and where things go and line up. It will help you accentuate it better. How you contour your nose, where you apply the blush.
After you're done applying the base, take a soft tissue and dab your face. It gives it a smoother finish and take away the 'cakeyness' from your makeup.
My personal favorite of all the hacks is applying some highlighter on yout face before the base. Try it, you'll see the difference! Another thing can be using a red lipstick as blush on your cheeks and nose before applying foundation. It looks natural!
