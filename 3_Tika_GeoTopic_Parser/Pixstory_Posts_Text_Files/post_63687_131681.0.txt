During the Gamescom 2022 Opening Night Live, a new trailer was shown at the upcoming WB open world action RPG, Gotham Knights which showed us some of the game’s rogue’s gallery. The rogues gallery include some of the Dark Knight’s most formidable foes including Clayface, Harley Quinn, Mr. Freeze, Penguin and the Court of Owls.
In Gotham Knights, Batman is dead and the players will instead take control of one of the Dark Knight’s proteges, playing either Nightwing, Batgirl, Robin, or Red Hood in order to protect Gotham City from the wave of crime that the city is facing, including the threats posed by some of the villains from Batman’s rogue’s gallery.
The new trailer also gives a better look at the heroes of Gotham Knights and also showcases some of the improved graphics of the upcoming title. Furthermore, the release date for the game has been pushed by four days, due on October 25th the game will instead be released on  PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC by 21st October.
Although it was previously speculated that Gotham Knights was a part of Rocksteady's Arkhamverse, it was later confirmed by WB Games Montreal not to be the case. Nonetheless, Gotham Knights in overall concept and design with its open world exploration and combat is very similar to the Arkham games.
