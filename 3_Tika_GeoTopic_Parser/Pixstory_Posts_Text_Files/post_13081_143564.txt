I have always believed that history is a progression but in the past year I have seen my country rapidly regress to the Middle Ages Before women and girls were still taking small steps towards a better future Now just going to school has become an unattainable dream for hundreds of thousands of them Before the Taliban came back to power our life was great Young students risked their lives every day to go to schools and educational centers but the moment girls entered school they flourished despite the bloody attacks outside and the dire economic and security situation we could hope for I see fruitful jobs as a doctor engineer and lawyer A year ago the Taliban pledged to close girls schools No wonder they don t give up this dignity obligation now women can t work or leave the house without a burqa can t laugh wear make up or high heels can t date a man who is their mahram father brother husband or son are not They cannot go to school or university As a student I dreamed of myself and all the girls in my country becoming Afghanistan s future engineers lawyers scientists artists and technical experts and inspired countless others to do the same The school was forced to close after the Taliban regained control over our country Many teachers have fled our country in fear of their lives I remember Some of my friends said Isn t this our right Is education a crime For God s sake billions people are going to school around the world and we are not even allowed to attend school The West has played a terrible game with our country for decades I think it is the greatest crime against humanity to never allow a country to develop Our motherland has been entrusted to a group of criminals and terrorists and these women and girls are now paying the price
