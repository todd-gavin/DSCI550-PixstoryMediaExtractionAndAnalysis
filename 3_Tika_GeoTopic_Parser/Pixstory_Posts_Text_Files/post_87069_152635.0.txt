In Tamil Nadu, the first three days of the festival are dedicated to Goddess Lakshmi, the next three days to Durga, and the last three days to Saraswati. Figurines or traditional dolls called Kolu or Golu are arranged at homes, shops and temples. Kolu consists of a makeshift staircase on which the dolls, which have been passed on from many generations, kept. They depict particular themes like environment, space, mythology etc.
Music and dance festivals are organised in temples as well by sabhas or music clubs. In several villages of South Tamil Nadu, Pulikali (tiger dance) is performed. Performers paint themselves as tigers — donning bright yellow and black — and dance to the beats of instruments. Kai Silambu Attam (a dance form) is performed in temples where the dancers wear ankle-bells and hold anklets or silambu in their hands.
