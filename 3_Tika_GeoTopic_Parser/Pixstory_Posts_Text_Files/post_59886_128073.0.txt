On Wednesday, former chief ministers BS Yediyurappa and Sarbananda Sonowal were added to the list, while Nitin Gadkari and Shivraj Singh Chouhan were removed from the BJP's highest decision-making body.

Additionally named by the BJP Parliamentary Board are JP Nadda, Narendra Modi, Rajnath Singh, Amit Shah, K Laxman, Iqbal Singh Lalpura, Sudha Yadav, Satyanarayan Jatiya, and BL Santosh. Devendra Fadnavis, the deputy chief minister of Maharashtra, was included on the party's list of the BJP Central Election Committee (CEC) members.

The inclusion of K Laxman and Fadnavis is essential since it suggests that the leaders will be promoted. While Laxman, the national leader of the BJP OBC Morcha, has been attempting to gather support in Telangana, Fadnavis was crucial in helping to bring down the Uddhav Thackeray administration by forming an alliance with the Eknath Shinde group.

"I would boost PM Modi's voice in my state," Laxman added, referring to how people in South India looked to him for development work.
