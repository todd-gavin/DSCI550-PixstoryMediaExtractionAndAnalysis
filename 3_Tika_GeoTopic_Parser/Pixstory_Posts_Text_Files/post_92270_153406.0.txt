Whatsapp privacy updatedüòç :- 
‚ö°This is an important privacy feature that is already available in the Signal app. There are still a few other privacy features that WhatsApp lacks, such as screenshot blocking, and an incognito keyboard. But it is gradually adding it to its messaging app to offer users more convenience and better control over their privacy.
‚ö°Now, if you don't want your WhatsApp contacts to see when you are online or using the app, then you can simply hide it by visiting the settings section. However, if you turn off the Online Status feature for your friends, then you also won't be able to check out their online presence. This is similar to how Last Seen feature works and you will find the latest update in the same section.
