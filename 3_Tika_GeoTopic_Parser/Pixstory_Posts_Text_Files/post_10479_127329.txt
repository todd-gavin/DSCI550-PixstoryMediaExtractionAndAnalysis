Kite flying on the occasion of Independence Day has been a culture for decades in Old Delhi A kid to an adult everyone indulges in the super fun act of Kite Flying on th of August every year You can see rooftops filled with families and friends from morning till night with loud music playing kites flying and fireworks at night People start their day by getting on their roofs around or in morning and they won t get off till its dark Even the hot and humid weather won t stop our old delhites from brimming the sky with colorful kites The most beautiful site is of the Tiranga colored kites People compete with their neighbours in a full fledged Kite competition The winner will cut the loosers kite in air And at night we get to see beautiful fireworks which isn t prevalent as much nowadays as their is a ban on fireworks in Delhi Even Kite flying has seen a downfall there are still many in the sky but in my childhood the numbers were hundred times more In those days it was impossible to look at anything else up except kites The madness was something else then Olddelhidiaries by Hamza Khaleel
