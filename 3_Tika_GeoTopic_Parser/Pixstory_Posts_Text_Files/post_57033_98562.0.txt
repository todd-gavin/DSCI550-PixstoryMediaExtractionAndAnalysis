Lizz Huerta is a widely - admired Mexi-Rican short story writer and essayist. She has published many short stories of her.
It was all born amidst construction sites and applying the cold galvanising spray to rusted iron.
Huerto shares that when all her cohort were engrossed in discussing craft, theory, or who was dating whom, she spent her days surrounding workers, electricians, plumbers, and painters. What elated her the most was audiobooks: "I spent over 15 years devouring audiobooks across the subject and genre".  
Her predilection for audiobooks evoked the thought of writing stories and building the characters of her dreams. The voice in the audiobooks gave her confidence to concoct and buildup the most beautiful.
The flow of rhythm and cadence in the sound of audiobooks created " The Lost Dreamer".
In summers, she used to take out her time attending writing workshops. She was always elated with the thought of meeting writers and people who enchanted her and her ideas of becoming a successful writer.
"My brain was never fried after work. Instead, it was fresh with ideas and hungry to create. My creative time wasnâ€™t in competition with the work that fed me. My painting never followed me home. Instead, I began to see my work as a gift. Who else was able to listen to books all day in solitude? My work could be physically tiring, but there was a deep satisfaction. A rusted, faded iron door was reborn by my hand by late afternoon. There is beauty in completion." she writes, describing the ambience of solitude she entered while listening to audiobooks.
She was brimming up with all joy and tears when she listened to her audiobook for the first time. Overwhelmed with the cadence of the voice and the spark her story created, she said,
"I put on my headphones and sat on my balcony, watching the birds play in the bamboo, grateful to my core, listening and awe at what had emerged through me."
