Wildfires are threatening in the UK due to extreme heat, fire that spread from nearby grassland has affected the small village of Wennington, which lies in the east of London, near Essex. Fire crews were fighting hard to calm down the fired and the fire appeared to destroy several homes. 

Meanwhile, Scotland has recorded its hottest day with a temperature of 34.8C. The Met Office confirmed the high was recorded at Charterhall in the Scottish Borders. It already overtook the previous Scottish record of 32.9C recorded in Greycrook in the Borders on 9 August 2003.

The hot, dry, and windy conditions and unusual extreme heat prevails in the UK. Prof Nigel Arnell, Professor of Climate Change Science at the University of Reading said 
"Wildfire is a rather unrecognized hazard in the UK. Whilst we might not see sorts of the forest fires currently sweeping through Spain, Portugal, and France, we are increasingly prone to fires in grassland and moorland," he says,
These fires have the potential to affect homes too.

"So far we’ve been lucky, but that may not hold for long. Climate change is increasing fire danger across the UK, and we need to be prepared for it,” he adds.

Students from various Universities living at private and university accommodations have admitted it is a difficult time without most accommodations lacking fans or air conditioning. (this is a new phenomenon in a rather cold country like the UK).

Even the Luton Airport, one of the busiest in the UK had been closed on Sunday after extreme heat melted a part of the runway.
