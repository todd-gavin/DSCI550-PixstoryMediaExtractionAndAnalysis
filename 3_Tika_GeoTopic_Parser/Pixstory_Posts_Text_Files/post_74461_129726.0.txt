But I’ve both in equal measure,"Arjun told in the latest interview amidst release Ek Villain Returns…✅✅
He further added that the biggest problem with industry is that no one in industry talks about craft of acting.“I haven’t heard a person having a real conversation about craft when it comes to media or social media about an actor,” he said.
“I think the people who’re discussing the craft don’t know it themselves. The craft they’ve learned is the clickbait, and it’s an easy craft,that means talking negatively about everything.
