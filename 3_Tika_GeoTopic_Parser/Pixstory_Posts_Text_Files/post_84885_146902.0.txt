Arsenal striker Gabriel Jesus has finally broken his silence on omission from Brazil’s squad for the friendly fixtures against Ghana and Tunisia on September 23 and 27 respectively.
Jesus, who has been in incredible form this year, wasn’t selected by Tite, indicating the forward’s status in the national team. The likes of Richarlison, Roberto Firmino, and Pedro, who also play in the same role, are all included in the squad.
Speaking of the snub, Jesus expressed his respect for the coach's decision and said that he’ll always root for his national side.
"I respect the coach's decision a lot, I respect Tite, the entire staff, the entire commission. I said, I'm Brazilian, and I'll always root for the team. And I also respect the other players, who have a lot of quality.” he told ESPN Brazil.
The forward went on to say that he will work hard to win opportunities and keep trying his best to put on top performances.
“I'll keep doing my best to have the opportunity again. What is in my control is my performance. I will always try to give my best and finish the plays. Today I had some chances that I could also improve a little more, I know. I’ve been training, trying to do my best,” he added.
The incredible form of Gabriel Jesus
Gabriel Jesus, who moved to Arsenal from Manchester City this summer, has been
impressive for the Gunners so far. He already has four goals and three assists under his hatin seven league games.
Though his place for the Qatar World Cup is in jeopardy after the snub, he still has time in hand to win the faith of coach Tite again.
Without international distraction, Jesus should be blazing all guns when Arsenal returns on October 1 against Tottenham at the Emirates Stadium.
