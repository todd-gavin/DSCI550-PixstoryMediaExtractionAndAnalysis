The US based symphonic metal quintet Graveshadow s third album The Uncertain Hour over the course of minutes launches the listener through a blazing field of galloping heavy riffs sexy leads and triumphant epic melodies With quite a lot to bring to the table Graveshadow go out strong here with new vocalist Rachl Raxx Quinn giving a powerhouse vocal performance that brings down the house The opener Soldier starts out strong going full out symphonic death metal and is overall a great track The second track Gwynbleiddd is a Witcher inspired track talking about Geralt of Rivia it manages to capture the whole Witcher feel and is awesome The Swordsman is a great track that picks up pace featuring a great riff and melodies This one also features a guest harsh vocal assist by Chelesea Murphy from Dawn of Ouroboros While the rest that follow are all fine additions and solid tracks though none are really exceptional The best parts are probably the last two tracks The Two Lived and Damsel s Distress The former causes a bit of a change in the whole tempo the album a nice change of pace while the latter is a bombastic and powerful finale There are really no bad songs here overall though the album does tend to fall victim to cliches though that is barely an issue what really perhaps sticks out is the production While it is not bad the guitars are too thin not fully bringing out the heaviness the drums are heavily submerged by a wall of sound and the bass is almost drowned out While you can still hear the bass it is just not properly mixed in Nor for that fact are any of the instruments A mix of symphonic gothic power and hints of progressive and melodic death metal Graveshadow is reminiscent of Unleash The Archers with The Uncertain Hour having enough great hooks and tasty fills capture the listener s ear while also at the end having enough variety to prevent it from becoming stale This overall has the makings of a fantastic album which would capture the attention of even non metalheads Score
