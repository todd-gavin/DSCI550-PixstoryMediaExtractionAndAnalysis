On the right is a cookie and cream monster milkshake and the other one is a dark chocolate oreo milkshake. These two crazy-looking milkshakes were more like a dessert instead of a drink to us. The light and fluffy whip cream on top with chocolate chips decorated on the rim of the glass and the ice-cream cookie sandwich and brownies topped on the shakes were a dessert I could never forget. It tastes as good as it looks. Trust me.
