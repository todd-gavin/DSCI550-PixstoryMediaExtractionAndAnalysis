The Reuters photojournalist was one of the photographers who captured the moment Sunday and his photo — which captured Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the moment of contact — would soon be everywhere, immediately going viral.

So what was it like documenting the so-called "slap heard around the world"?
Immediately afterwards my reaction was 'did that just happen?'," Snyder told CNN Business on Monday. "Initially, the other photographers and I were unsure if it was a planned part of the show or something else. Once Will Smith was back at his seat and yelling back to the stage, we figured it was not part of the script. And then I started looking through my camera for reactions."
CNN reported that Snyder was among a pool of photographers from various news outlets who were covering the show from the projection booth in the back of the Dolby Theatre. He said that he had two long lenses (200-400mm and a 600mm) and his responsibility for Reuters was to cover the show — onstage and the audience.

"It's a case of reacting — you see something happening and react," he said. "Frame and focus, and then take the photo. Photographing in the theater, the exposure for the stage and the audience were very different, so there are a lot of technical settings to juggle."
