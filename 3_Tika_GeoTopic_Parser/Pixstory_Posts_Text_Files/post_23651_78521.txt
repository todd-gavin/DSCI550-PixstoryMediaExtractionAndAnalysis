Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning AI has generated a lot of hype over the last few decades but it remains one of the hottest new technological trends because of its significant impacts on how we live and work AI and machine learning are assisting in the automation of models that can evaluate larger more complicated data and produce more accurate and timely answers AI is expected to have a long term impact on almost every business Artificial intelligence may be found in smart devices autos healthcare systems and beloved apps and it will continue to pervade many additional industries shortly Blockchain Blockchain is data that you can only add to not subtract from or change because you re creating a data chain which is how the term chain was coined The most amazing fact is that prior blocks cannot be changed which is what makes them so secure Robot Process Automation RPA Robot Process Automation or RPA is a technology that like AI and machine learning automates jobs Robotic Process Automation RPA is the use of software to automate business operations such as application interpretation transaction processing data management and even email response RPA automates everyday tasks or duties that formerly required human intervention Cloud computing The cloud is essentially a decentralized location where data may be shared via satellite networks Every cloud application needs a host and the hosting business is in charge of maintaining the huge data centres that offer the security storage capacity and processing power required to keep all of the data users transferred to the cloud safely and securely G The fifth generation of mobile networks is known as G It aims to provide multi gigabit per second peak data speeds ultra low latency greater dependability huge network capacity increased availability and a more consistent user experience Higher performance and efficiency enable new user experiences and industry connections G will take the mobile ecosystem to new heights in the coming year with its high speeds high dependability and low latency
