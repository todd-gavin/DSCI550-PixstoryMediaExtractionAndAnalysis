Many people were perplexed by Oscar Isaac's casting when it was first revealed. Everybody should be persuaded after only one episode. He'll be switching between not one, but three different personalities in the blink of an eye. The show's creators make him appear as puzzled as the audience, and it's from his viewpoint that you're viewing it. I can't wait to see what more he has to offer.

It's as if Ethan Hawke is a God Man who's built a whole religion around purity. Bringing Demon-Goddess Ammit back to life is his only goal. The performer creates an aura of mystery and terror about him. It's exciting to see Marc Spector and Steven Grant go on him and see how he's beaten back.

Synopsis : Steven Grant (Oscar) is a London museum employee who feels he has a mental condition. Mercenary Khonshu, who is backed by the Egyptian Moon God Khonshu, is at the heart of this enigma. Instead of hallucinating, Marc Spector, nicknamed Moon Knight, is taking control of his body to rescue the world when he believes he is. Power, demon, and his moto are all revealed in this first episode.

This is one of the most unique and different Marvel product in the longest time. There is a lot to learn and explore. Get on board as soon as you can.
