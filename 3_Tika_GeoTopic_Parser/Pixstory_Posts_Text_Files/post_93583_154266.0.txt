OTD in 2014, I took my love for football and admiration for Messi to start a fan club on Twitter account with ‘ChampionMessi10’ as its username.
now called ‘WeAreMessi’ - little did I know that 8 years later we will be one of the biggest Leo Messi fan club in the world with over 750K followers on Twitter and a combined following of 1.4 Million fans across various social media channels. 
To me, this account has done more than just celebrate football.
It’s personally taught me the power of sportman spirit and resilience in more ways than one. It’s also opened so many job and collaboration opportunities that I’m thankful for but the most important —
The connections and friends I’ve made over the last few years, have been the biggest source of learning.
Cheers to Anoud and Marwan who joined me on this mission to build the WeAreMessi community! You guys are the best! ❤️
It took us 4 years to reach 100K followers on Twitter, another 4 years to add 665K followers! And it’s only day 1 🥹
To all Messi fans, FIFA World Cup is just around the corner and we have some big things lined up with new and existing partners! 👀
Maybe an opportunity to win signed Leo Messi merchandise too! Stay tuned!
