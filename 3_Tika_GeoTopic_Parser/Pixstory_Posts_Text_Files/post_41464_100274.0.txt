The New York Rangers were on the verge of being eliminated by the Penguins following two dismal road losses when they returned from Pittsburgh earlier this week. 

US News reported that they return home for a crucial Game 7 at Madison Square Garden on Sunday night (7 p.m. EDT, TBS) with some momentum on their side after two thrilling comeback victories. 

“Game 7 is huge for us and now we've got to make sure we finish it off tomorrow and play the right way,” Rangers coach Gerard Gallant said Saturday. “We worked hard to get back. I think everybody’s really excited. ... It’s a big game, for sure. It’s a lot of fun and I look forward to it.”

After falling behind 3-1 in the series, the Rangers have come back with two 5-3 victories, one at home and the other on the road, to tie the series. They trailed 2-0 in each of their last two victories before rallying with three straight goals in the second period and tying the game again. In the third, New York began to pull away.
