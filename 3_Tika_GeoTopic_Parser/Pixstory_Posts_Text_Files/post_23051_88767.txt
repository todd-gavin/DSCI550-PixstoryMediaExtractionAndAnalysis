As the winter blankets are put away the clouds of grey are bid farewell and in comes the sky of blue Fair to say spring is here March st of every year is what we call Spring equinox But life as we know it isn t all about science This day every year means something A new life a new beginning and more importantly a new sense of optimism in the air And of course tis the season for poetry and writing about blooming flowers and its association with love Today March was more than just the beginning of spring It was the day of halting and postponing everything I planned to do and just admire the rays of sun I am normally not a believer in Monday Motivation and all the other stuff associated with it but this day it was different This day was everything Especially with what I have been through personally and professionally I felt happy for once and more importantly grateful that I am alive and that I have survived what is hopefully the end of the darkest and longest tunnel I ventured out today soaking the sun and humming the words of The Beatles Here comes the Sun as I sat inside the metro I met my friend today and it felt good Over mojitos and burgers we had our notorious conversations and then kept babbling about how the world is so f d up We walked around Connaught Place and enjoyed each other s company as we saw the sun go down But we ended our meet with a lot of hope Hope that things get better and hope that the storm of darkness is over Hope that we can now heal as masks not just physical come off I for one have not read today s headlines as all they want to talk about is the fourth wave It may happen here but that doesn t mean we miss out on this day Despite anxiety inducing headlines there s hope that things are finally moving towards the better I am not being delusional but for the first time I feel that we ll be better
