Ruby the Gem of the Sun—The
King of Planets
continues...

In the gemstone trade, the word Gem is of importance, rare and is like a title given to only the choicest and finest of gemstones.

A Gemstone is called a gem only when it excels on all 4C's-the cut, color, clarity and carat weight and the crystal has exceptional lustre with a color so fine and closest to its true spectral color that it looks outstanding.

Above is an example of one such “Gem”. Featured above is a fine Burmese 
Ruby of true imperial pigeon Blood color.
What exactly is Imperial Pigeon Blood color?
In the book, Tavernier’s Travels in India (1640-1676), we read “Asking to see 
the pigeon’s blood is like asking to see the face of God.” Anonymous Burmese Trader

This color Ruby is supposed to be the choicest 
in rubies. Imperial Pigeon Blood is pure medium dark red with around a 10-15% shade of Blue that combines with red to give an aristocratic and regal deep red purplish shade.

When such a Ruby is set in bright rich yellow gold of a high caratage the blue gets muted to give you a stunning and unique scarlet red. 

An unheated and untreated Burma ruby that is Imperial Pigeon Blood red is so rare and unique in nature that it is the fate of a privileged few to view it and own it. Owning a Burma Ruby as the one featured above is like owing a piece of 
history.

Jean-Baptiste Tavernier (1605–1689) was a French traveller and pioneer of trade with India, and who documented his travels through Persia (Iran), most known for works in two quarto volumes, Les Six Voyages de Jean-Baptiste Tavernier (Six Voyages) and diamond merchant for some important diamonds of the century.
