A second Champions League hat-trick in as many games from Karim Benzema gave Real Madrid what they needed to take a big advantage back to the Spanish capital on Tuesday night. 

Albeit with a foot and a half already planted in the semi-finals, coach Carlo Ancelotti believes the two-legged tie is still very much open for the European champions. 

"We have an advantage, it's obvious, but it's open. Without the value of the double away goal, Chelsea have that advantage. We respect Chelsea, they're a great team. There's another game and anything can happen."

Ancelotti was also asked about his number 9's form, and had only good thoughts about the Frenchman. 

Benzema scored two first half headers in quick succession before completing a triple via a second half pounce on Mendy's error.

"Every day is better, like wine. Every day he has more leadership, he feels more important in this team and this is what makes the difference.

 He has much more personality. He knows he is a very important player. He has exemplary behavior for everyone".

"He's a complete player. He scores a lot of goals, that's why he's very important, but he helps the team a lot with possession, with his movements... He's very dangerous inside the box and we're very happy to have him".

Ancelotti will look to his master marksman once again in a week's time, as Real look to defend their advantage, maybe even capitalise on it if the chances fall their way.

"Karim was tired and I replaced him because of that, but he has no problems. Militao had a blow to the hip in the first half and then a sprained knee, but nothing serious. Valverde was tired".

Ancelotti concluded by saying he needs to rest the hardest working players on his team.
