Frenkie is able to play under pressure. He excels at it. When the opponents are constantly pressuring him to make errors, he is able to pass under pressure to his teammates to shift the pressure off him. He has made a total of 255 passes when under extreme pressure from opponents. He ranks 88 perecntile, 10.82 per 90 in passing under pressure.

Frenkie is a beast physically. He is able to marshall the defenders quite easily. He is resistant, he has the best aerial ability and he is a workhorse. He is able to cover every inch of the pitch. 

Touches


De Jong has made a total of 1617 passes, and he has taken maximum touches in the middle third with 1005 touches and 476 touches in the attacking third. Even though he has made his touches all over the pitch, these two areas are the most prominent where he has made the touches.

From the below touchmap and heatmap we can see that he has made maximum touches in the middle third and in the attacking third. This guy is looking for the ball all the time and he is looking to orchestrate the play through his passes or running with the ball or defending to snatch the ball from the opponent’s feet
