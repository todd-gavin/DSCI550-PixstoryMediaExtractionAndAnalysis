Today is Menstrual Hygiene Day Celebrated annually on May to highlight the importance of good menstrual hygiene management at global level It was initiated by the German based NGO WASH United in But Guys Do you know why this day is observed on May Lemme tell you why Because menstrual cycles average days in length and people menstruate an average of five days each month May is the fifth month of the year It is meant to advance menstruation as a biological process so that people can menstruate without being cast out or missing out without feeling fear or shame and without being treated like less or exposed to more vulnerabilities It also raises awareness of the inability to afford the menstrual supplies needed to manage health and hygiene with dignity When she bleeds the smells I know change colour There is iron in her soul on those days She smells like a gun Women complain about premenstrual syndrome but I think of it as the only time of the month that I can be myself Menstruation is just a way of your body letting go of something that is no longer needed Happy Menstrual Hygiene Day
