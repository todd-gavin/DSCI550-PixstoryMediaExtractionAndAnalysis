Real Madrid are trailing PSG 1-0 in the UEFA Champions League Round of 16, and the suspensions of Casemiro and Ferland Mendy for the 2nd leg only make things a bit more complex for Los Blancos.

This time, though, out of necessity, Carlo will have to make at least two changes from the team that started the 1st leg.

Here is the starting XI, in my opinion, that Carlo Ancelotti SHOULD pick for the 2nd leg:

Goalkeeper: Thibaut Courtois, DUH!

Not Karim Benzema, not Toni Kroos, not Vinícius Júnior, Thibaut Courtois has been the best Real Madrid player this season. Hands down. It might be up for debate among fans as to who has been the best player for Los Blancos this season, but in my opinion, Thibaut Courtois has been the most consistent performer this season.

With Ferland Mendy and Casemiro getting suspended for the 2nd leg, Thibaut Courtois will be expected to deal with the all-star Paris Saint-Germain attack.

With Ferland Mendy out for the game, Carlo Ancelotti will have to make do with his makeshift defence.

Dani Carvajal has to start the game. He is the best option at right-back and the experience of winning four Champions Leagues can come in handy big-time if Real Madrid are to keep Kylian Mbappé quiet.

In central defence, the in-form Éder Militão must be partnered by Mr. Reliable Nacho, with David Alaba slotting in at left-back. I am sure Nacho will replace Ferland Mendy in the XI, but if Carlo Ancelotti is smart enough, he will play Nacho as his preferred centre-back position and push Alaba out wide on the left, a position he has played at for most of his life. Alaba can help in attack too, and Real Madrid will need all the help they need to overturn the 1st leg deficit.
