I have always maintained that we are surrounded by more right wing extremists than we anticipate We often hear about how these elements form the minority but I disagree Even during the Jan insurgency I held on to this opinion Moreover rather than later the truth unearths itself The same happened in the case of Ginni Thomas Ginni used her influence to try to alter the election results according to text texts sent to Meadows in the weeks after the election Ginni reportedly pushed Meadows to devise a strategy to prevent Joe Biden from becoming president in one of the communications obtained by the Washington Post What happened happened but now let s talk about the repercussions Firstly as New York Times reported she can be a threat to the Supreme Court The assertion that the Justices decisions are politically apolitical is becoming increasingly difficult to believe particularly from Thomas whose wife Virginia Ginni Thomas is a vocal right wing activist She has declared that the deep state and the fascist left which includes transsexual fascists are putting America s existence in jeopardy Thomas a lawyer who manages Liberty Consulting a small political lobbying firm has become a prominent member of a number of hard line groups For years her political activism has sparked debate Will this create problems for her husband and by extension cast a shadow of doubt on the Supreme Court Well that is already done Intelligencer has talked about how Clarence Thomas should have recused himself when the Supreme Court overturned Trump s attempt in January to stop the release of records from the National Archives to the House Select Committee investigating the Capitol siege The justices are not bound by any judicial code of conduct and they are free to decide whether or not to recuse themselves from cases They are also not required to explain their reasoning But nonetheless the seed of doubt is planted
