Humans have eaten meat for the longest time. It's not a new concept and while I agree that no slaughter is humane slaughter, isn't it just easy to not make them feel guilty about it?

We need meat to survive and there's no point in hating to eat it. We shouldn't have to be guilty for having something that's our requirement. On the contrary, making someone feel guilty for that is just not a good thing. If something's going to happen regardless wouldn't it be better if we, at least, feel good about it?

There are ways to make an animal's death as much painless as we can. The government has done countless things for animal welfare. And we're constantly doing better.
