A UC San Francisco study has stated that when elderly people tend to stay active their brains have more of a class of proteins that intensifies the connections between neurons to balance healthy cognition This protective impact was found even in people whose brains at autopsy were riddled with toxic proteins associated with Alzheimer s and other neurodegenerative diseases Our work is the first that uses human data to show that synaptic protein regulation is related to physical activity and may drive the beneficial cognitive outcomes we see said Kaitlin Casaletto PhD an assistant professor of neurology and lead author on the study which appears in the January issue of Alzheimer s Dementia The Journal of the Alzheimer s Association The beneficial effects of physical activity on cognition have been shown in mice but have been much harder to demonstrate in people Casaletto a neuropsychologist and member of the Weill Institute for Neurosciences worked with William Honer MD a professor of psychiatry at the University of British Columbia and senior author of the study to leverage data from the Memory and Aging Project at Rush University in Chicago That project tracked the late life physical activity of elderly participants who also agreed to donate their brains when they died Maintaining the integrity of these connections between neurons may be vital to fending off dementia since the synapse is really the site where cognition happens Casaletto said Physical activity a readily available tool may help boost this synaptic functioning Read more
