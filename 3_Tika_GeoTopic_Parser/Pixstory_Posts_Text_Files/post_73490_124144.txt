A true friend doesn t care if your rich or poor if your being an ass what you weigh what you look like if your house is a mess what car you drive if you have a family of crazy people Your conversations will pick up where they left off even if months have passed by They will be there for you when you need them most and despite your faults will love you with all their heart and cherish the times spent with you
