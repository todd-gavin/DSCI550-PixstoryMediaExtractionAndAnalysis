Abstract

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a genuine international health issue, with Saudi Arabia ranking among the top nations with the largest diabetes prevalence. Following the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), 3.8 million Saudi Arabian people had diabetes in 2014. The occurrence of diabetes in Saudi Arabia is likely to elevate due to the current trend in the general rise of socio-economic status, which positively correlates with diabetes prevalence. The incidence of Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is highest within the age group â‰¥ 45 years, especially in Riyadh and Jeddah, the metro cities of Saudi Arabia. Previous studies have shown that the incidence of T2D is larger in urban regions (25.5%) than in rural regions (19.5%). Both Riyadh and Jeddah are urban areas with different food habits and locations in Saudi Arabia. Recent studies have indicated the correlation between altered alimentary tract microbiota with type 2 diabetes. Gut microbiota plays a critical role in degrading undigested dietary compounds and releasing a vast array of metabolites that directly and indirectly affects host health. In the current review, we shed light on the state of information on the realization of the types and functions of the alimentary tract microbiome and how it plays a causative agent in the up growth of T2D.
