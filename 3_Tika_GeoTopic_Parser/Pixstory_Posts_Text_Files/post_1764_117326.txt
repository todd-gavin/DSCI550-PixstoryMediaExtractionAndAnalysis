Bhupinder Singh had once said There was so much music in my house that I never wanted to join music My father Natha Singh was a music professor in Amritsar My elder brother used to play instruments from a young age I used to feel that if I joined music I would never get respect That s why I did not want to make a career in music There came a time I gave up singing After that I started learning Hawaiian guitar and started playing very difficult songs in it In this I also started playing classical music While playing the guitar my interest in music revived once again and I started singing again Guitar brought me back to singing The first song Bhupinder sang was Hoke Majboor Mujhe with Rafi Talat Manna Dey Madan Mohan gave the music Bhupinder features in the song as well from the film Haqeeqat Bhupinder made his debut as a guitarist with the song Dum Maro Dum from the film Hare Ram Hare Krishna This song was composed by RD Burman After this he played guitar in almost all the songs of RD Burman These include Chura Liya Hai Tumne Chingari Koi Bhadke and the song Mehbooba Mehbooba from Sholay He also played guitar in the title track of Chalte Chalte And in the iconic title track of Sholay On several occasions RD Burman described Bhupinder as one of his Navratnas Ironically for a person who could infuse life with his guitar in songs like Dum Maro Dum Bhupinder s own voice was suited to slow melancholic songs Everyone would have their favourite Bhupinder songs Mine are the slow solo version of Dil Dhoondhta Hai from the film Mausam Music by Madan Mohan and Ek Akela Is Shahar Mein from the film Gharonda Music by Jaidev
