The outflow of refugees from Ukraine has reached two million, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi.

Speaking to French radio station France Inter on Tuesday, Grandi called the milestone a "terrifying" number.

"There are hundreds of thousands of people on the move, trying to flee the combat zone and seek refuge firstly inside Ukraine in the safe zones. But the safe space is reducing and people are inevitably trying to cross borders," he said
