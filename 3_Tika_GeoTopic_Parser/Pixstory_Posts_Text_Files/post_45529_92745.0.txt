Arsenal are planning a surprise summer transfer for Real Madrid's Eden Hazard, who has had a
difficult time since leaving Chelsea. With reoccurring ailments limiting his progress, the Belgian
winger has failed to live up to the â‚¬100 million transfer cost Los Blancos paid for him in 2019.

Hazard hasn't scored in 17 La Liga matches this season and is currently down Carlo Ancelotti's
pecking order.

Furthermore, the former Blues star's future does not appear bright, and his chances may be
further harmed by the rumoured arrival of Paris Saint-Germain phenom Kylian Mbappe.

 Arsenal
have showed interest in Los Blancos' record signing, with the Premier League giants ready to
sell.

According to Foot Mercato, the Gunners have spoken with Hazard's representative to explore a
possible loan deal with a buyout option in the summer. After letting go of Pierre-Emerick
Aubameyang in January, the North Londoners are looking to bolster their attack, and Eddie
Nketiah's contract expires this summer.

Mikel Arteta has had success with a group of youthful attackers such as Gabriel Martinelli,
Bukayo Saka, and Martin Odegaard, but if Arsenal wants to qualify for the Champions League,
the Spaniard will need an experienced player.

Hazard fits the bill, and while he has been more injury prone in recent years, his legendary
position at Stamford Bridge remains intact. After the deals for Dani Ceballos and Anders
Odegaard, the Gunners have developed a strong relationship with Madrid, and they are seeking
to capitalise on it once more. Blues, their bitter rivals, have also been linked with Hazard's
return, but the club's transfer constraints could be a stumbling barrier.
