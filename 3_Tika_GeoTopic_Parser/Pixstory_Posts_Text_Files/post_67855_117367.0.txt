When I just turned to 18 years , I made my voter id card thought of voting to a party who is capable enough to rule the state or area in a right way. 

When I was 18 years old MCD elections in Delhi took place, I was very much excited to know who will be my candidates. What were their qualifications, what are things they will do for us. 

When the names of candidate announced I was looking for the one who is well educated. But i didn't found anyone. 

All the parties gave the tickets in the name of caste, religion. But they didn't thought to choose the candidate who is most educated and eligible. 

Me and my friends decided not to vote any of them as they won't match our line and length, so we decided to none of the above (NOTA). 

I don't know that i wasted my first vote or not but we all should think before give vote that the candidates are elegible for us Or not after knowing and understanding our candidate then we should vote. 

We should not vote in name of greed, party, caste, religion but we should vote in name of leading my country
