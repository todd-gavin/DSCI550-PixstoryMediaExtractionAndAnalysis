Zombies has always been one of the most attractive features in Call Of Duty games with many COD games having it as a separate mode. Activision in a treat for Call Of Duty: Warzone players is bringing back the undead horde as part of the Rebirth of the Dead.

Developed by Beenox, Rebirth of the Dead is a limited-time mode and only 40 gamers can enter at once in a match. The mode is available only as squads. Zombies have a long-running history in Warzone. They’ve been featured in several different game modes across the two-plus years Warzone has been around. Rebirth of the Dead is extremely similar to another game mode called Zombie Royale. Though there are some subtle differences, Zombie Royale players will quickly recognize Rebirth of the Dead.

“As soon as we were asked to bring the memorable Zombie Royale to Rebirth Island, the whole team came on board with incredible enthusiasm and a great many ideas,” said Marc-André Gagné, Senior Expert System Designer at Beenox. “Our number one priority was to keep what made the original mode great while adding a few key quality of life improvements and looking for ways to make it a uniquely Rebirth Island experience.”

Arriving on July 27 with the mid-season update, Rebirth of the Dead is described as a re-imagining of Warzone's past Zombie Royale mode. The mode's matches will feature 10 quads on Rebirth Island, and just like in Zombie Royale, eliminated players will return as zombies.
