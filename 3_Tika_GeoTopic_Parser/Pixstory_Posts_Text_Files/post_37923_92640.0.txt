Wolverhampton Wanderers have set a price tag of £100 million on Ruben Neves as per Express UK. The Wolves have reportedly placed this price tag to ward off interest from other Premier League clubs. 

Ruben Neves has been in exceptional form in the 2021/22 Premier League season. The Portuguese international has scored 4 goals and provided 2 assists in 28 league games. 

To add to this, Neves has been quite brilliant in his defensive duties as well. The Portuguese midfielder has played a considerable part as the Wolves have conceded just 27 goals in 31 Premier League games. This tally is the fourth lowest in the league.

Owing to this, other clubs including Arsenal and Manchester United have taken notice of Ruben Neves' quality. But the Wolves manager Bruno Lage does not want to lose out on his prized midfielder. 

Both Manchester United and Arsenal had already shown interest in Ruben Neves in January. But Bruno Lage had made it clear that he had no intention of selling the midfielder. Neves had also claimed that he was happy at Wolverhampton Wanderers.

But with the summer transfer window approaching, The Wolves know that Neves would draw bids again. Owing to this, they have placed a £100m price tag on the player. Hence any club that signs the Portuguese midfielder now would have to break the British transfer record to do so! 





Why do the Premier League giants want Neves? 


Manchester United could lose out on Paul Pogba, Donny Van de Beek, and Nemanja Matic in the summer. Hence the Red Devils want to add a couple of quality midfielders to strengthen their squad. 

Arsenal on the other hand are already lacking in personnel in central midfield. Granit Xhaka is also rumoured to be leaving. Hence Mikel Arteta feels that Ruben Neves could be a good long-term option in the Gunners' midfield.
