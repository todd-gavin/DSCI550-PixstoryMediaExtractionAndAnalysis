Juventus and adidas present the 2022/23 Away Jersey, to be worn on the pitch for the first time on July 22nd during the Juventus Summer Tour. In the design of a new shirt, there is always a concept that deserves to be known. Once again, that concept focuses on the night.

Capturing the magic of night matches - this is the goal of the elegant black jersey, with subtle design cues that reference the club's DNA. The shirt design moves away from the striped pattern of last season's away kit.

A symbol of magic that represents the history of the Club, the star has been woven into all Juventus jerseys this season.

In this jersey, the star is reimagined in a bold yet subtle way as a carbon-colored starburst graphic is engineered into the fabric, shimmering in contrast to the black base colour. The white accents on the collar, sleeves, shoulder three stripes and the logos stand out against the dark shirt, offering an elegant finish that expresses the Juventus identity.

The new Away shirt, unveiled by exceptional Bianconero Khaby Lame, is made with 100% recycled materials and features the latest adidas’ material innovation, HEAT.RDY - KEEP COOL technology, which is designed to make players feel cool and dry during play optimising sweat distribution and maximising air flow of air to ensure exceptional comfort. The replica jersey offers similar benefits thanks to the inclusion of AEROREADY - KEEP DRY technology that keeps fans comfortable and ready as it manages the body’s sweat for a dry feeling.

The Away shirt is available from today on the Juventus Online Store and in physical Juventus stores.
