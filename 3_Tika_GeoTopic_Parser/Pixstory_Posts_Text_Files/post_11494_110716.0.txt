Cereals include a wide array of food items like broken wheat, quinoa, brown rice, ragi and oatmeal. Cereals are loaded with fibre content. Fibre is essential for the optimum functioning of the body.

2.Pulses: 
Kidney beans, moong dal, chickpeas, masoor dal and soybean are important pulses. Pulses provide protein and are high in fibre, thus helping in keeping the digestive tract clear.

3.Fresh fruits: 
Fruits like apples, avocados, bananas and pears are high in fibre content. High fibre fruits lower the chances of flare-ups, pain and inflammation that come with anal fistula.

4.Brown rice:
It is full of dietary fibre and has a positive effect on lowering the chances of constipation. It targets the anal fistula by making bowel movements smoother and is highly beneficial for patients suffering from anal fistula.

5.Coconuts: 
Coconuts are high in fibre content, which helps bulk up your stool and supports bowel regularity.

6.Some Milk products: 
Skimmed milk and yoghurt are beneficial for people suffering from anal fistula. Consuming yoghurt may be helpful if you have irritable bowel, as yoghurt contains ‘probiotics’ or good bacteria, that help put healthy bacteria back into your gut system.
