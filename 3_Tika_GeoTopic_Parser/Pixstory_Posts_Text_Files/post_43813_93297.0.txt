After the Bosnian's comeback, Ceyhun Kazanci, the Turkish club's sports director, said that "he will not play with us next year," indicating that the Barça loanee will return to the Camp Nou in the summer, with two more years on his contract and a stellar track record.

Miralem Pjanic returned to action this weekend with Besiktas, who defeated Alanyaspor 4-1 in the Turkish league after a two-month absence due to injury. The Bosnian midfielder, 32, entered the game in the 75th minute. 

The excitement of his homecoming, however, was short-lived, as he learned after the game from an authorized source that the Turkish club where he is on loan from Barça this season does not want to keep him for the following season. With a contract with FC Barcelona that runs until June 30, 2024 and a very good track record for which Besiktas has only paid 2.75 million (a third), the club's accountants are in for a headache.

Pjanic, who joined Barça from Juventus in 2020, recently said that he would want to remain at Besiktas, where he has played 24 official matches and 1,750 minutes. In three Champions League appearances, he has not scored, although he has provided two assists. My family and I are content in this location. I have an excellent relationship with the Besiktas supporters, and if I had my choice, I would stay here. "

He never got along with Barça's Ronald Koeman, who paid Juventus 60 million plus five variables for him, and Xavi Hernández had forgotten about him.Last season, he appeared in 30 games (19 in the Premier League and eight in the Champions League), but just 13 of those were as a starter (six in the Championship and six in Europe).

With the emergence of young midfielders like Gavi and Nico González, as well as the rumoured summer arrival of AC Milan's Franck Kessié on a free transfer, it will be amazing to see how Pjanic envisages Xavi's plans for next season
