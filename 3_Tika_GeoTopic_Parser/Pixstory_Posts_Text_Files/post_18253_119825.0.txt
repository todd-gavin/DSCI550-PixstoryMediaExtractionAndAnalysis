Your spidey instincts will start to perk up when you see the picture of Dakota Johnson. The 32-year-old Cha Cha Real Smooth actor was recently seen filming Madame Web for Sony Pictures in Boston. Dakota may be seen wearing a fitting black t-shirt, light wash blue trousers, and a pair of black Doc Martens in pictures taken on set.

With the addition of a red leather jacket and a black belt, the actress completed her superhero ensemble, drawing internet interest from Spider-Man fans. Her bright outerwear looks to be an homage to Julia Carpenter, a Spider-Man character who has worn the eye-catching costume in comic books.

After psychic Cassandra Webb, Julia was the second figure to adopt the moniker "Madame Web." She has also served as the second Spider-Woman and second Arachne throughout the comics.

Julia has previously shared plot lines with Kraven the Hunter, a different character whose own origin movie will star Aaron Taylor-Johnson, according to Sony Pictures.
The earliest reports of Dakota's involvement in the film surfaced in February, when E! News first heard that she was being considered for the heroic role.

The cast of Madame Web also features Sydney Sweeney, Emma Roberts, Adam Scott, and Mike Epps from Euphoria.

The movie was written by Kerem Sanga, Matt Sazama, and Burk Sharpless, who also wrote the screenplay for S.J. Clarkson's Morbius, starring Jared Leto.It will continue Sony's Spider-Verse franchise, which already has Kraven the Hunter, Morbius, and the Venom movies starring Tom Hardy.
