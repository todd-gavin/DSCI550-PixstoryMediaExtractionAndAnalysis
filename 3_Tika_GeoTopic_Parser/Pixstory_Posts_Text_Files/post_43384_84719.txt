The projection that the society put upon the generations regarding SEX is such a ridiculous thing Our societal culture considers not talking about sex or anything related to it Here the topic of Virginity arises and it is a really sensitive topic to be spoken in our country Specially girls who aren t virgin before marriage are considered as uncultured or shameless Also the topic of practising safe sex is considered a taboo too Some people simply think about their sexuality as a reminder of their animal nature which they refer it as morality Indian society should actually remind themselves about Kamasutra that elaborately speaks SEX which was evolved from our ancestors themselves Basically it can be seen that there s no guilt in indulging or talking about sex Therefore it is very important for our coming generations to know about sex and it shouldn t be considered a taboo in coming days Talking about it more and educating your child about it will help the generations to come thus helping in removing this stigma in our society
