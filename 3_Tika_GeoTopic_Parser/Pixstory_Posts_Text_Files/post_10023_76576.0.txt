will conduct a large-scale survey to understand the impact of the Covid pandemic on the psychological and emotional behaviour of school children. The last two years have been really tough and very stressful for school children. Due to school closure students have been confined to their homes, which is leading to a situation of fear and stress among them, he said.

"It is important to understand their mental state, to bring them back to a normal situation. In view of this, we have decided to conduct the study on a large scale to understand the changes in the mental and emotional state of school children in the past two years and what steps can be taken for their well-being," he added.

He said along with children, the study will also focus on analysing the "changes in parenting style, psychological and emotional state of parents, as children have spent most of their time during lockdown with them, in the past two years".

Teachers have also seen many changes in their routine and teaching styles, the minister noted.
