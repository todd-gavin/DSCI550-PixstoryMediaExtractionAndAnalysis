Dusan Vlahovic hasn't enjoyed life in front of goal since he joined us. But he had to adapt to a change in system and he still scored at a decent rate.

Change is football styles can be tough and he is still very young and he was bound to take time. So if Juve sign a good back up, they will motivate him to fire and it allow him to rest at the right time. With that, they will bring the best out of the Serbian.
