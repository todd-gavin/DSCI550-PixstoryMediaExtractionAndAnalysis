Are you skipping cookies , cake or other sweet treats to reduce sugar intake ? Give yourself an A for effort , but you’re probably still eating more sugar than you realize ! What if i tell you that - drinks , sauces , snacks and many other food items secretly contain very high amount of sugar with the sweet stuff ! ❌
Here are some of the  healthy food items that you think don't have sugar but can be laden with hidden sugar ; ✅
1 Bread - Bread is a staple in Indian breakfast ; it may not taste sweet but is filled with sugar . 100 gms of bread contains around five grams of sugar ! Also , processed brown bread , which is claimed to be healthier , can sometimes contain the same amount of sugar like white bread .
2 Granola - They sound like health food , but many add sweeteners like corn syrup , brown sugar , honey and fructose ! Some have a yogurt or chocolate coating , or chocolate chips , which can ramp up the sugars fast -- anywhere from 8 to 12 grams per serving . 
3 Salad Dressings - Sweet types , such as raspberry vinaigrette , French , and Catalina have the most sugar -- about 5 to 7 grams in just 2 tablespoons of dressing ! So watch how much you pour on .  A lower-sugar option is a light homemade vinegar and oil dressing . 
4 Peanut Butter - While many people think of peanut butters as being healthy , but peanut butter contain a lot of sugar ! A serving of peanut butter usually contains upto 15g of sugar per 100g . You need to be careful which brand you buy as some have a lot more sugar than others .
5 Almost Milk - Almond milk is something else to think about as well . Make sure you buy unsweetened because they contain less sugar . Many brands have added sugar upto 28g per 250ml .
Therefore , it's important you cut out these sugar-laden foods from your diet !✅❤️
