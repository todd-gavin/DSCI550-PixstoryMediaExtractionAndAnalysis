There is a reason that church and state are separated. Religious beliefs do not and should not dictate how people live their lives. 

While you are free to believe that marriage is a holy union with a primary aim of procreation, you have no right to enforce that belief on others. 

Marriage is also a legal institution wherein two people, regardless of their sexual orientation can solemnise their bond. People who view any relationship between two people of same sex as a “sin” for religious reasons are free to do so but to advocate that religion becomes the basis of legislature is downright outrageous. 

Leaders from the Christian, Jewish, and Islamic faiths may have all spoken out against gay marriage, but fortunately religious leaders don’t make laws. Laws are made in parliament by the representatives elected by the people. 

To compare polygamous or incestuous marriages with marriage in LGBTQ+ community is just another sign of prejudice and discrimination. Incest has biological consequences wherein people from the LGBTQ+ are denied equal marriage rights solely on the basis of debatable interpretation of religious texts. 

Moreover, what about people who are atheist? People who don’t believe in religion or God? Is it fair to ask them to live their lives according to an institution in which they don’t even believe. To ask them to live by an ideology that has no rational backing is against their human rights. 

Mr. Campbell says that, “It is not to say gay people do not deserve rights, but to change everything in favour of a new trend would be going a little too far.”: Rights of the LGBTQ+ community are not a “trend”. It is not upto the likes of Mr. Campbell to decide wether they need marriage or not. 

Equal rights are not subjected to terms and conditions, specifically terms and conditions enforced by religion.
