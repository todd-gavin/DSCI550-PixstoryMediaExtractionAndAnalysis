Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel refers to the humble and hard working French midfielder of Chelsea N'Golo Kante as the key player team has been missing this season. Kante has missed many matches in the season, where Chelsea seem to finish 3rd below Liverpool and Manchester City. 

31-year-old has been struggling with injuries, because of which, he played only 25 league matches. When fit, he never stops, goes box to box, helps in attack, retrieves the ball, makes important tackles and scores goals. He has played 182 matches for Chelsea and 37 matches for Leicester City (2015-16) and has won the Premier league title with both teams. 

Tuchel said, "I think he is our key, key player but key players need to be on the pitch. He plays 40 percent of the games and it may be a miracle we arrive in third place because he is our Mo Salah, De Bruyne or Van Dijk. He is the guy who makes the difference so if you only have him 40 percent it's a huge problem". 

While Kante is linked with a Manchester United move, he added,"I saw Liverpool last season without Van Dijk and they struggled heavily. Last game he started was weeks ago and he needed to get his rhythm. Last year in the last five games of the Champions league, they handed him man of the match trophy even before the match was over. It was so clear when he played." 

Kante is the first player since Eric Cantona(1992,1993) to win consecutive league titles with different clubs. Kante was a key player in France winning the 2018 FIFA World cup. He has also won the PFA Players' Player of the Year, the FWA Footballer of the Year and the UEFA Men's Midfielder of the year, an FA Cup, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup, and the FIFA Club World Cup. 

Chelsea, after missing many chances, finished their match against Leicester with a 1-1 draw, winning just 1 game in the last five(D3, L1).
