Was life easy? It wasn't for many of us. We had our share of life's spices. We had days where we wished we didn't wake up to days when we were grateful we were alive. The most important thing to remember is that we survived. We fought, we cried, we struggled but we survived. We survived and we came through we might not be happy today or satisfied but we will be. We have control over our life. It's okay to let go out of control so that we can learn to fix damages. 

Never think about giving up in life as it's not something we want. Giving up isn't an option. You have survived up to this day and it's the only confidence you need to move on further, to more challenges, calm over chaos, and lots of love and laughter. 

Happy Day
