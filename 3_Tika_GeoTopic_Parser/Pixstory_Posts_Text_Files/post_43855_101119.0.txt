The Lionel Messi vs Cristiano Ronaldo debate is a never-ending mystery for many a fan. While most footballistas have in recent years settled to simply enjoying the two all-time greats at once, everyone has their own personal preferences â€” even professional footballers. In a recent interview-esque mini survey conducted by ESPN FC, a number of athletes from within the Top 5 European leagues were quizzed with the same question.

The video starts with Tottenham Hotspur winger Dejan Kulusevski, who replies "can't answer that" as he heads into the training facility ahead of Spurs' next Premier League fixture. We quickly move to Riyad Mahrez, who settles for a similarly toned "both". A number of other footballers opted for such non-partisan answers, including Manchester City midfielder Rodri and Jamaican forward Leon Baily. Danny Ings too, said "no comment"

Ukrainian International Oleksandr Zinchenko funnily replied with "De Bruyne!" while Chiquinho commented "no-one" among a number of other hilarious replies. By the end of it, Messi edged the debate 7-5, with Ollie Watkins voting for Cristiano. Buendia, Morgan Sanson and Ki-Hoever all sided for Lionel Messi. The Argentine is widely considered as the Greatest footballer to ever grace the pitch and edges most such surveys. 

French Football legend Thierry Henry too sided with the Argentine earlier this year, saying "Cristiano Ronaldo would need two lifetimes to do what Lionel Messi has done. If not three". It is of course not uncommon for former teammates of the two to pick the player they've played with, but some that have had the pleasure of playing with both are often stuck in the mix.
