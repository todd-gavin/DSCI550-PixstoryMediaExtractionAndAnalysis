I believe that in order to embrace one's sexuality and gender a particular day is not needed but I would rather prefer to celebrate my identity every day, at each and every moment. 

Definitely we all were taught "how to not laugh loudly, how to not react back, to be polite and modest" but why do we need to stick to these when we enjoy laughing our lungs out, fight for what we truly deserve and react and voice out to the inequalities we face. 

Well woman's day shouldn't be just confined to the words that we speak but should be equivalently reflected in the society we live in and so let's start to accept loud laughters, wear what we truly love, be loud enough while talking and be opinionated. 

And let's not get started with the cliche role quotes or posts she is associated with but rather identify her as an individual alone by not associating her to any of her "roles". 

She have her own identity and she would like to be known through her own individuality. Its high time we stop addressing women according to their roles and judging her on her dressing and opinions.
