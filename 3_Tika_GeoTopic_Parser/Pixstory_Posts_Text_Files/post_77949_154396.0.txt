Back to Kochi after One looong month.... And look this what I got as a "welcome back gift". It's a beautiful full painting right... The sky looks so magical âœ¨. I'm not even able to explain it's beauty in words, it's beyond words. Thank you nature for such a beautiful painting, for a such a peaceful and warm evening, sunsetðŸŒ….
