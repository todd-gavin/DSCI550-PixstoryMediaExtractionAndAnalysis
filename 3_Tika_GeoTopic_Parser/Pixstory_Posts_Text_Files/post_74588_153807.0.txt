One thing that Koffee With Karan 7 missed dearly was the appearance of Shah Rukh Khan, 😱And now the filmmaker has an update if the badshah would be returning for the next season.👍When asked if SRK would be making a return in the next season of the show, Karan Johar told Bollywood Hungama, “I’m hoping that we can do something solid with Shah Rukh Khan in the next season because he’s been such a huge part of the show. 🔥Every time he’s appeared, he’s been magical. So I’m hoping that but there are so many more people that I still would love to get on the show.” Amongst those other guests, Karan wants Ranbir Kapoor to be one as well who, he revealed, “teases him” saying he “won’t come on Koffee With Karan ever”. “I’ll try and convince him for the next season,” he said hopefully.💯✅Although Shah Rukh Khan didn’t appear physically on Koffee With Karan 7, he sure did make a vocal appearance in one of the episodes when his wife Gauri Khan came on the show and made a call to him in the ‘Hey Karan, it’s me’ segment. SRK was the first ever guest on the show when it started in 2004, along with Kajol, and ever since, the superstar has made it to almost all the seasons. However, he gave it a miss this time around.👍👍👍👍
