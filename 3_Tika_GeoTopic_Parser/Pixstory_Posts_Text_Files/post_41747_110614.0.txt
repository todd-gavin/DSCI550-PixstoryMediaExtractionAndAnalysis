When Pat Cummins and his team square up against Sri Lanka in a two-test series starting on Wednesday in Galle, Australia can anticipate a trial by spin. 

IE reported that Muttiah Muralitharan and Rangana Herath, two mainstays of the Sri Lankan spinners, regularly misled the visiting batters in the scenic stadium, which is bordered by the Indian Ocean on two sides and is close to a fort built by the Dutch in the 16th century. 

When Australia last visited, Sri Lanka's spinners, led by man-of-the-series Herath, took 54 of the 58 wickets en route to a 3-0 thrashing of Steve Smith's squad.

Australia’s triumph in Pakistan earlier this year suggests they know what it takes to succeed in Asia, but their vulnerability against left-arm spin means the world’s top-ranked test team cannot take anything for granted.

Their batters average 21.36 against left-arm orthodox spin since 2016, the lowest of any test teams except for minnows Ireland and Afghanistan.
