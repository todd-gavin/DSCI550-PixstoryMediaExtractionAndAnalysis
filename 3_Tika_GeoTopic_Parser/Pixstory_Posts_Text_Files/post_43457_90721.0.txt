It's Dr Taylor Swift ya'll!

The 11-time Grammy-winning singer-songwriter megastar is  receiving an honorary doctor of fine arts degree from New York University. 

According to NYU's press release, "Taylor Swift will receive a Doctor of Fine Arts, honoris causa, at the morning ceremony and address the graduates and guests on behalf of all the degree recipients for the Class of 2022."

Keep in mind, Taylor is a genius, but she wasn't able to do the traditional high school–college route because of her career. 

And now our queen is gonna be a DOCTOR OF FINE ARTS!!!
