The collection from the anti-racism rallies that took place across Wales in the summer of 2020 has been shown in the "Wales Is" section at St Fagans National Museum of History. 

The exhibit also includes photographs and personal testimonies from activists who took part in the protests. 

The protests were prompted by the death of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in May 2020 in the United States. 

Marches were held around Wales, notably in Cardiff, Swansea, and Aberystwyth, while people protested around the world. 

The collection highlights "the different experiences of people living in Wales today and in the past," according to Sioned Hughes, head of public history and archaeology at Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum Wales.

“It is important that we display these placards in the Wales Is gallery to tell the story of the Black Lives Matter movement in Wales and its impact on communities,” she said.

L&M Weekly News reported that Amgueddfa Cymru is a family of seven museums and a collections centre, which are all free to visit due to Welsh Government support. They are home to the nation’s art, history and science collections.
