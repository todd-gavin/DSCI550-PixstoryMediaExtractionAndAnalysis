I state that it seems difficult but not so. In preparation it only takes a little more time than for the piece of roast that you find already ready and tied Have the butcher cut a slice of well-beaten beef, this will be the one we will roll up Finely chop the aromatic herbs those that will later be placed inside the slice Even if they won&#39;t be needed immediately, peel the carrots, cut them into rounds, peel the onion, cut it in half, wash the celery sticks and cut them into pieces. Once the initial work is finished, spread the slice of beef on the work surface. and sprinkle it with the chopped herbs placing the slices of cooked ham on top Now you can roll up the meat well, giving it the typical shape To give a more intense flavor to the rolata, take the slices of lard and wrap them all around the rolata trying to cover it all Now a passage a little more complicated but once you have done it once it will be very simple Pass the white thread or kitchen string around the meat tying it well and insert a sprig of rosemary in the middle of the thread Third phase cooking Take a large saucepan and put some oil on the bottom placing the beef inside The meat must brown well on all sides When ready, put the wine in the pot and let it evaporate over high heat In the meantime, add salt again lightly and add the vegetables you peeled and cut earlier and a large glass of water or if you prefer a glass of broth Lower the heat and cover with a lid checking from time to time and adding more water or broth if necessary The rolata must always cook over low heat for about an hour and a half When cooked, let it cool and then untie the roast and cut it into not too thin slices At this point you can serve it with its sauce and vegetables Advice to understand if the wine has evaporated just smell the smell coming from the pot If there is still wine inside you will smell it immediately
