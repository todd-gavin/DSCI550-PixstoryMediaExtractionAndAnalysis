5. Zodiac
Based on true events- this is another one by David Fincher's finest works. It is based on the unsolved mystery of the zodiac killer, from the point of view of a cartoonist ( jake Gyllenhaal) who tries to solve the killer's puzzles. Zodiac is a movie that will get in your head just by the middle of the runtime, as it is a movie that fully understands how Truth, real life mysteries are always stranger than fiction!
