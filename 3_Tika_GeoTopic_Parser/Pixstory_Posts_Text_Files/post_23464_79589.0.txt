Alappuzha is considered to be the oldest planned city in this region and the lighthouse built on the coast is the first of its kind along the Laccadive Sea coast. We went to the lighthouse and it looked beautiful.

However, the highlight was the backwaters, yes something I had waited for 14 years. 

Like the Dal lake in Kashmir, the backwaters are a treat for eyes. We hired a houseboat, you can book one for full ride and payment is to be done according to time you want to spend in the waters. 

Actually the comfortable ride gives you a peak into the interiors of the city. Like they say life on a river.

We stopped for lunch and had the most amazing meal with pariyar rice, some sour kundru gravy with  the most fresh fish you can dream off. You choose it and they fry it for you. 

My son didn’t like the meal though because he hates fish and had to settle for some lentils instead. A picture taken with a hawk/eagle was an added attraction to compensate on the island restaurant. 

While the annual boat race is a major attraction, we could only see the boats parked neatly near the jetties.
