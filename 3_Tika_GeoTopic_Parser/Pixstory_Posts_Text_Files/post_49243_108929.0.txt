BLACKPINK has their own reality television show. BLACKPINK House.  In it, you follow them as they go about their daily lives, from cleaning and laundry to visiting Korean-style saunas and paragliding in Thailand, throughout the course of 12 episodes. It was first broadcast on Korean television.

Their fans also have a their own group name. Blinks! How cute is that? Its similar to how BTS fans call themselves ARMYs, and Twice fans call themselves Once. But cute nonetheless!

Another thing about them is that while all of BLACKPINK's members are fluent in Korean and Japanese, their foreign backgrounds also allow them to converse freely with fans all over the world. Jennie was born in New Zealand but raised in Australia, while Ros√© was born in New Zealand but reared in Australia, and Lisa was born and raised in Thailand. Only Jisoo, who was born and reared in Seoul, has yet to fully learn English, though she does speak Chinese.
