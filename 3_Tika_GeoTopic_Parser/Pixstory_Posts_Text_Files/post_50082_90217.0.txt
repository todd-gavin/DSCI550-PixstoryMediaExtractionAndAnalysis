‌Does all feminists hate men; no but we don't have any affinity towards chauvinists; less affinity towards 'half-feminist'(Is that even a word). Everything is/was about women. It wasn't even 20 per cent about women and their rights even now; there is a belief that women have got 'enough freedom' and here are they showing off. We don't want anyone to give us freedom as we are independent but don't try to curb it in any way. 
‌
‌Justice is subjective and at times has many impediments. And what are these 'favours' women get from the judiciary? Is the judiciary being partial to women Or after a lifetime there are being heard? The subjugation women faced and face on top of everything they endure in life is something men aren't familiar with. Just because your life is easy it doesn't mean everyone's is. You are may or may not be born with privileges, but women aren't. We fight for it every single day. 
‌
‌We see men feeling disturbed upon a single 'threat' they face calling on how feminist's ruined the world. Just for one think about the situation your privileges put us in, think about the abuse faced by men and women due to gender roles you created in your prejudice and finally think about the world you make and are making for the generations to come! We are trying to amend it. Let's talk about not blaming men when the world reaches an egalitarian state. Until then we have to fight not to be a victim but to survive.
‌
‌It might not be all men but definitely, every woman fights for their rights in workspaces, home, media etc. We even fight for men! To release you from the responsibility of all the gender roles. We fight for everyone all the people in the world and their equal representation.
