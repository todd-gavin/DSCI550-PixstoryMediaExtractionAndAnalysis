Today I will discuss the upcoming releases that you can watch near your cinema halls or OTT platforms. Following are some recommendations:-

1. Radhe Shyam - Radhe Shyam is directed by Radha Krishna Kumar. Going by trailer, this movie is about two individuals who will fall in love and Vikram (Prabhas) who can tell the future by palm reading will see something strange and the couple has to fight for their love. You can see this movie exclusively in cinemas from 11th March. 

2. The Kashmir Files - The Kashmir Files is a star-studded movie directed by the National Award Winner Vivek Ranjan Agnihotri. The Kashmir files are based on the incidents where Kashmiri pandits were brutally killed by the insurgents when Kashmiri pandits raised their voices to remove Article 370. I wish this movie convey the message in the right manner and does not end as another propaganda movie. You can watch this movie near your cinema halls from 11th March.

3. The Adam Project - This movie excites me the most when I watched the trailer of it. The Adam Project is directed by Shawn Levy whose last project was Free Guy. The genre of the movie is Sci-fi but after watching the trailer one thing I can surely say is, this movie will be a roller coaster ride that will include sub-genre like action, drama, comedy, and some interesting sci-fi facts. And if Ryan Reynolds is the lead of the movie then you can expect a lot of entertainment. You can watch this movie on Netflix and will start streaming from 11th March.

4. Formula 1 : Drive to Survive Season 04 - Netflix is bringing season 04 of Formula 1 Drive to Survive. This is a documentary of the previous season (2021-2022) of Formula One. You can expect nothing but the thrill and amazing stories that will be told by F1 driver and their managers. If you are a sports lover then this series is especially for you. Season 04 will start streaming from 11th March.
