Liverpool are up and running, when it comes to completing some early business in the summer transfer window. After completing the mega signing of striker, Darwin Nunez just a week before, the Reds have also successfully signed Scottish footballer, Calvin Ramsay. Now, the Premier League runners-up have been linked to Real Madrid star, Marco Asensio, with a couple of potential suitors interested as well.

Marco Asensio’s contract at Los Blancos expires next summer, hence Real Madrid will look to offload the midfielder this summer. As reported by the Sport Bible, Liverpool are among the three clubs interested in signing the Spaniard. However, the Reds are the only club that has expressed their intention in the same.

Serie A winners, AC Milan are also reportedly interested in bringing the talented midfielder to Italy. The reigning Italian champions might just have the edge here, given their strong relations with Real Madrid. However, AC Milan may not be able to match up to Madrid’s asking price of 40 million euros. 

Liverpool’s domestic rivals, Arsenal are also reported to be preparing a bid for Marco Asensio. It remains to be seen as to where the Spaniard might eventually go, given that the current transfer situation is in the nascent stages. Sadio Mane’s imminent departure from Liverpool after a six-year tenure leaves a huge dent in the forward line, as the Reds are stilll lining up options for a busy summer ahead.
