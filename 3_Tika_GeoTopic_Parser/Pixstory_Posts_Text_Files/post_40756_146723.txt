I am he attesting sympathy Shall I make my list of things in the house and skip the house that supports them I am not the poet of goodness only I do not decline to be the poet of wickedness also What blurt is this about virtue and about vice Evil propels me and reform of evil propels me I stand indifferent My gait is no fault finder s or rejecter s gait I moisten the roots of all that has grown Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy Did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work d over and rectified I find one side a balance and the antipodal side a balance Soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine Thoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start This minute that comes to me over the past decillions There is no better than it and now What behaved well in the past or behaves well to day is not such a wonder The wonder is always and always how there can be a mean man or an infidel Walt Whitman
