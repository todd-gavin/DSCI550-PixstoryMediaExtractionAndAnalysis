Domestic rabbits have a lifespan of roughly ten years however rabbits on the Rabbit Island have a lifespan of only a few years or fewer due to starvation disease injury and neglect All of the visitors who feed the wild rabbits have resulted in an unsustainable population growth which has wreaked havoc on the island s ecosystem Similarly the rabbits diet and when they are fed are causing major problems to their health resulting in a lifespan of only two years They are frequently fed cabbage which is not the ideal choice for bunnies because it causes bloating and is low in fibre something that the animals require in order to be healthy Because rabbits require a consistent amount of food and there is very little vegetation left on the island for them to eat when tourists aren t around the same old pattern of being fed a lot of food on sunny days during holidays and nothing at all on rainy days when no one comes to visit is exacerbating the problem So maybe when the rabbits come to jump on you it s not because they are showing affection but because they re probably hungry out of their wits and expecting food from you
