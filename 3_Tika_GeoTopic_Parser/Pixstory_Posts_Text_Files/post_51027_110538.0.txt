Your 20s are, at least according to one psychologist, the "defining decade," because they play a huge role in who you'll become personally and professionally.
So make some of the changes listed below to be in a good shape of mind :

1. Start writing down your goals
2. Start letting go of your ego
3. Start reading a lot
4. Stop trying to live someone else's life
5. Stop feeling bad about the past
6. Start showing loved ones you care
7. Start taking care of your health
8. Start asking questions 
9. Start practicing mind-fullness
10. Start getting involved in meaningful causes
11.Start following current events
12.Start travelling and living in the moment 
13. Start taking alone time
14. Start conducting weekly reviews 
15. Start appreciating failure 

These are somethings you can try to make your 20s better and productive.

Do tell me in the notes what you all do to make yourself a better version .
