The Netherlands are back in action this week, taking on Wales in a crucial UEFA Nations League match on Tuesday. Both sides have a thing to prove in this match and may carry a punch on their day.

Wales is at the bottom of their group and has failed to adjust to the demands of Europe's top flight. Last week, the Welsh team held Belgium to a 1-1 tie, and they will seek to repeat the feat in this match.

The Netherlands, on the other side, are in first place in their group and have had a strong showing thus far. After being held to a 2-2 draw by Poland in their previous match, the Oranje will be looking to rebound.

Netherlands vs Wales: Probable Playing XI

Netherlands : Jasper Cillessen; Stefan de Vrij, Matthijs de Ligt, Jurrien Timber; Daley Blind, Denzel Dumfries, Teun Koopmeiners, Frenkie de Jong, Steven Berghuis; Memphis Depay, Wout Weghorst


Wales: Wayne Hennessey; Ben Davies, Joe Rodon, Ethan Ampadu; Rhys Norrington-Davies, Joe Morrell, Joe Allen, Jonathan Williams; Daniel James, Aaron Ramsey, Gareth Bale

Netherlands vs Wales: Prediction

Wales has the ability to cause difficulties for the Netherlands, and we anticipate a close encounter on Tuesday night. Holland, on the other hand, will be desperate to rebound from their terrible performance against Poland, and we anticipate Van Gaal's team will win 2-1 against Wales once more.


Prediction: Netherlands 1-0 Wales
