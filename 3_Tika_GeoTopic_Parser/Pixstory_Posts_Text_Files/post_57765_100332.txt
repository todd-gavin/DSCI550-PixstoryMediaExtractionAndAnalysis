Letting go is the most difficult thing to do no matter what The thing is we are creatures of habit Many a times irrespective of our emotions and well being when we continue to do something for some time we get used to it Once we get used to it it becomes a part of us despite the fact that we know how bad it makes us feel Letting go of such things starts to feel like we re letting go of something good even when we know it s defiantly not Letting go doesn t mean you re quitting and even if it does so what We forget about the fact that we ve been given this life to make the most of it When we feel we re not making the most of a situation we know to buckle down and do better The same goes for the fact that if the situation itself is not ideal not according to what you think what you know can get the best out of you can help you make the most of it you have that right that choice to let it go and go grab the opportunity that will help you Knowing how and when to let go is a skill we need to know how to utilise because we all have it within us to let go but sometimes a screen drops in front of our eyes our mind our conscience that makes us not let go and that s not good Letting go of wasteful activities of toxic and abusive relationships and people of non gratifying depressing ties of so much we tend to subject ourselves to just because we think we have to as if there s no other way The thing is even in the most dire situations you can realise or create another way another path to trod on instead but the clarity needed for it can get distorted by these things we don t let go of
