Objective For patients receiving cone beam computed tomography CBCT scans as part of implant treatment planning incidental findings such as carotid artery calcifications CAC may provide opportunities to suspect the presence of undetected systemic diseases such as diabetes and refer the patients to physicians for further evaluation The aim of this study was to investigate the association of CAC with a positive diabetic status Study Design Two patient groups were identified from the patient population at Stony Brook University School of Dental Medicine positive CAC based on CBCT and positive diabetic status One researcher AM collected data In addition to demographics data including diabetic status and presence type absence of CAC was obtained Results To satisfy the a priori power analysis records between and were used For the positive CAC group data was obtained from patients males females The mean age was Of this total patients had a positive diabetic status at the time of the CBCT p Chi squared analyses revealed that there were significantly more males than females p The most common location for CAC was the carotid artery bifurcation or followed by multiple sites or intracranial or and bifurcation intracranial or For the positive diabetic group data was obtained from patients males females The mean age was Of these patients had an identifiable CAC analyses revealed there were significantly more males p than females The most common CAC location was the bifurcation or followed by intracranial or multiple or and bifurcation intracranial or with patients exhibiting lesions in other locations Conclusion CAC was found in of positive diabetics while of positive CAC patients had a positive diabetic status there were significantly more males than females in both groups Thus individuals with CAC may be at risk for having undiagnosed diabetes and require heightened awareness on the potential impact s during implant treatment planning Sources
