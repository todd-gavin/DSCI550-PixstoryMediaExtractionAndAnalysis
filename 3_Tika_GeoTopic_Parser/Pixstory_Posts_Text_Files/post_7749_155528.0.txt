A brave first half display by the Indian team where they managed to keep Morocco at bay goes down the drain with the second half one. It was a very good defensive display in that half. The flood gates opened when India conceded a penalty and El Madani Doha scored it, thus giving her team the lead at 50'. At 60' Zouhir scored a goal by finishing a great cross given by Samya. She again managed to assist Cherif by a great cross at 90+1'. 
Morocco dominated the whole match, they managed to get 10 shots on target out of their 20, while India only got 1 shot on target out of their 3. The Indian Team had no shot till the 50th minute of the match. India now sit at the bottom of their group having lost two consecutive games.
