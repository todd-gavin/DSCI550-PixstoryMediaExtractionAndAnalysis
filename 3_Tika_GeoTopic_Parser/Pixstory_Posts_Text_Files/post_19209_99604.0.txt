Our Hon CM Shri. mlkhattar ji has shown what a leader with a vision and love for sports can achieve. Leading a state which contributes to only 2.9% of India's population, he has immensely supported athletes through highest cash rewards & given the maximum medals to India.

Indeed an inspiration to other states, kudos to Haryana for hosting the kheloindia  Youth Games and launching its mascot Dhakad!
