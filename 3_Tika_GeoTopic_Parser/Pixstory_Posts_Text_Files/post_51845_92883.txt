I was asked this question yesterday It is something I talk about very often My son is autistic so inclusion as a concept is very close to my heart But how do I make someone who doesn t know disability or neurodiversity understand what inclusion is The truth is that you don t have to have a disability or be the caretaker or parent of someone with a disability to know what inclusion or exclusion feel likes If you have ever felt like you do not belong somewhere because of a lack of money or lack of education or simply lack of belief in yourself then you know exclusion You know what it feels like to be considered less that others You know the hurt that comes from being sidelined and ignored That is exclusion Now imagine the opposite Acceptance for who you are and the celebration of what you can do That is inclusion I couldn t say all this with a mic pointed at me I wanted to You cannot compress a lifetime worth of learning into one sentence so I told them this story A devotee once approached Ramana Maharshi one of the foremost spiritual teachers this world has ever known He asked Maharshi How do I treat others It was a valid question We are often told how important it is to meditate to find our true selves How then do we interact with others Maharshi turns around with his beautiful smile and says There is no other And that s it That is real inclusion The understanding that if we see everyone as extensions of ourselves we do not need a word like inclusion or exclusion We will just be one How beautiful would such a world be And how I wish my son could look forward to a world like that A mother s prayer will always be with him I hope that is enough
