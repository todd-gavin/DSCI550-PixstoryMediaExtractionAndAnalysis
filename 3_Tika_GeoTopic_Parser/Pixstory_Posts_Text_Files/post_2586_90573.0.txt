I came across a very interesting article in EcoPol Weekly of, presumably, late 1990s.
Though I have a rather poor opinion of EcoPol Academic credibility, nevertheless, they have cited official statistics. 
2 things stike. One, the British hijacking 1400 tonnes of gold from India in decade 1930-1940.
This is net of imports. Compare to imports in 2 year 1931-1933 when 3700 tonnes were officially imported. Juxtapose with sudden drop in imports from 1940 to 1950 when only 311 tonnes is net accrual- the net figure probably arrived at after British had creamed off even more in later years.
Also, remember that Government of India had to part with nearly 1/3rd of reserves to Pakistan.
Of course Pakistan has continued to crib about being short Changed.
Second Is the officially acknowledged imports of 10000 tonnes from 1831 to 1997.
Customs data from 1997-2021 shows gold imports at an average of 500-600 tonnes per year, totalling to nearly 12000 tonnes  at lower end and 14000 at higher end.
Thus my original estimate of Official and unofficial gold reserves at 28000 tonnes goes for a six.
It was an acknowledged fact that 35% of all gold mined in the world from time immemorial came to India. 171000 tonnes is the figure accepted by Gold council is total gold mined in the world.
Right from Chengiz Khan to British, Gold was looted from India.
On basis of official statistics reflected in the article, close to 25000 tonnes is the official imports since 1831.
Imagine the unknown and snuggled gold; mind boggles.
Now to the intresting bit.
The admitted amount of 1400 tonnes exported to Britain is now valued at close to 150 billion dollars.
Forget Kohinoor, Govt of India must file a claim in International Court of Justice for return of this amount in cash or kind.
Customs Houses will Record by way of Shipping bills to show port of disembarkation which would suffice to nail the British rape of Gold reserves.
