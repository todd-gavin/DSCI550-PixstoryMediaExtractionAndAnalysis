Basketball can be the most scintillating sport in all it s glory and this NBA Finals are the perfect example of that Both the teams have done whatever they could to push each other to the limits and both of the teams are evenly matched No team seems to be getting any fair lead over the oppositions Yesterday Warriors took the ball and played like their life depended on it and they did pretty well for themselves They dominated the court and made sure that they improved their game from the previous tournaments Warriors took the game away from Celtics and equalised the NBA Finals championship with that win It is not a stretch to think that Curry and the boys will try to extend the lead acquired and shut the series down before the last match Warriors fans are expecting a trophy while Celtics are looking for the fairytale ending
