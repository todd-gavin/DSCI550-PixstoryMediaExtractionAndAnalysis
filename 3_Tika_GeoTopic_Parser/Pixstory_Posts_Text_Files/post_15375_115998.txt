Despite the increasing attention paid to the impact of some extreme events linked to climate change, including storms, sea level rise, floods, fires on real estate, there is still little attention dedicated to the effect of high temperatures. Urban surface thermal anomalies enhanced by the heat island phenomenon can be associated with a significant increase in costs for cooling the internal environments of water consumption and a general discomfort that affects the quality of life This aspect is particularly relevant in Europe, one of the most attractive regions in the world for real estate investments and even more so in Italy where over the of the home owner population In a study published in the journal Sustainability coordinated by researchers from the Bioeconomy Institute of the National Research Council Cnr Ibe with the contribution of Ispra, the variation in the real estate value of residential buildings in Florence was investigated as a function of surface temperature anomalies in summer We used NASA satellite data to estimate the surface temperature, those on the value of the buildings from the Real Estate Market Observatory of the Revenue Agency and those on urban characteristics land consumption tree and herbaceous cover and bodies of water supplied by Ispra explains Marco Morabito Cnr Ibe To evaluate the different real estate value, the urban characteristics surrounding the buildings were also taken into account The analyzes were conducted in various areas of the central, semi-central and peripheral city and on buildings with different thermal patterns hot spot cool spot and neutral areas The analyzes revealed that the surface temperature is increasingly decisive for the assessment of the value of a residential property as one moves away from the historic centre. The effects are in fact evident in the semi-central and above all peripheral area where the increase in the market value of the property is linearly associated with a decrease continues Morabito The surface temperature, on the other hand, is not decisive for the real estate value in the central band where other elements such as proximity to historical and architectural places have a decisive influence Even if the central residential buildings fall into thermal hot spots almost 1 of these belongs to class with the highest market value
