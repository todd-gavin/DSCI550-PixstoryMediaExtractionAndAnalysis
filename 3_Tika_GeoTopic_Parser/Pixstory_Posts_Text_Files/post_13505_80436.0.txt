I cried involuntarily along the way. During the long traffic jams, the attendants (more than a thousand, more than 50 percent of whom were children and adolescents) went from work to dignified homes. Heavy traffic at the intersection of Uttam Nagar, which took us about 30 minutes.
I remembered my country, children, teenagers, women and Afghanistan

 My tears were flowing uncontrollably, I was in deep pain, I had to distract myself so that I would not go crazy. Along the way, when the lights of the cars were turned on and off, it was a good opportunity for no one to notice.
In Afghanistan  there... the passion and joy of children to flee their homeland burned in the heart.
In India here ........ the voice of children illuminates our heart.
I like both (Afghanistan, India)

Part of me is deeply saddened, I was very naive, I was very hopeful to see the happiness of my compatriots in their own country. I still have this false hope that the blacks will go and the sun will shine, that I will see the children of the homeland in their own land, free from fear and terror, proud and rising. We are a wound, a wound that must finally wake us up. The philosophy of these wounds is to scare and wake up, if we do not wake up, we will not give up ignorance, it will strike the next blow stronger. What has been done so far.
