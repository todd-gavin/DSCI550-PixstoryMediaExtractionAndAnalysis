We travel in trains a lot Most of us carry a backpack handbag in which all our valuables such as cash wallet laptop phones etc are kept and we keep that bag on our berths where we sleep unlike keeping it under the seats Berths are not so wide that they can accommodate you and the bag comfortably One option is keeping the bag next to your face securely which leaves very less space for you to sleep as we are broader from the shoulder side Other option is to keep bag near the foot area which gives ample amount of space for you to sleep but the drawback is that it is unsafe as anyone can easily take the bag away when you are fast asleep
