The thing I love about sandwiches is that they are so easy to eat You can eat a sandwich almost anywhere You can eat them warm or cold u don t need a plate spoon or anything else in the world to eat it U just need a sandwich to eat a sandwich Just pack sandwiches and go on road trip eat them in your car park your bike on roadside eat it there you are getting late for anything feeling hungry you ll be eating a sandwich Feeling hungry but lazy too no need to worry just get some bread and something to fill it with and your hunger is gone And you can experiment with them alot from putting nutella or butter to chicken or veggie you will never to bored with sandwiches You can just keep on switching from one sandwich to another I used to eat salami sandwiches now I eat smoked chicken I got bored with nutella now I eat fruit Jam This morning I was feeling hungry but also didn t wanna eat so I went for a jam butter sandwich Whenever I feel hungry late at night my favorite snack smoked chicken cheese sandwich
