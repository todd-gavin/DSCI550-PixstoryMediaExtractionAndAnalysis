India currently lead the 3 match series 2-0.
India has won the series already but might go for whitewash with opener Shikhar Dhawan's possible return.
The second ODI saw Rishab Pant opening the batting lineup with Rohit Sharma but with Rohit's old partner Shikhar Dhawan returning the batting line-up might change a bit. Rohit and Dhawan have been a successful opening partnership for the Indian team for years. Dhawan might add some extra firepower to the batting line-up.
Dhawan was among the four players, including a reserve bowler, who had tested positive for COVID-19 just four days ahead of the start of the ODI leg.

After India's 44-run win in the second game on Wednesday, India captain Rohit Sharma made it clear that Dhawan will be back for the last match of the ODI series. “We will get Shikhar back for next game, and he needs some game time. It is not always the results. We wanted to try it one game,” Rohit had said. This means that vice-captain KL Rahul would continue to bat in the middle-order along with former skipper Virat Kohli, whose search for his 71st international hundred continues. The hosts, who were restricted to 237 for nine in the second game, would be keen to post a big score if they again bat first.

Pant will go back to the middle-order alongside Suryakumar Yadav, who is likely to retain his place after emerging as the team’s highest scorer in the second match following a top-order collapse. All the middle-order batters  Pant, Suryakumar, Kohli or KL would be keen to get some more runs under their belt and end the ODI leg on a high. This might see the debutant Deepak Hooda make way for Dhawan.

With the series already sealed the Indian team can afford to make a few changes and try out new strategies. Kuldeep Yadav or Ravi Bishnoi could get some game time with the former returning from an injury spell.
