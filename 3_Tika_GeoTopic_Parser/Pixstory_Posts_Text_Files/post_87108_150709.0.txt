The number nine shirt is generally considered to be one of the most valuable in the squad. The club's main striker traditionally wears the number nine jersey. Numerous legendary players, like the Brazilian Ronaldo, John Cruyff, Bobby Charlton, and Alfredo Di Stefano, have worn the number nine for their clubs and nations.
The No. 9 jersey, meanwhile, has proven to be a burden for strikers at Stamford Bridge. The famous number has created challenges for players at Stamford Bridge throughout the Premier League era, and even the former manager Thomas Tuchel concurred that "it's cursed." The next player to don the jersey will be Aubameyang, and Chelsea supporters will be praying that the curse breaks quickly so that the team's newest acquisition will perform.
Which previous ten players actually wore the jerseys, lets just find out?
Hernan Crespo (2005-2006)
After Kezman left, the experienced Argentine took over at No. 9, and despite recent criticism that Crespo is an unimpressive Chelsea player, he was crucial to the club's second consecutive league title. Crespo netted 13 goals in all competitions, but he and his family never made England their home, thus Blues supporters never got to see him at his best. The next year, he moved on loan to Inter, where he finished out his Chelsea contract.
Khalid Boulahrouz (2006-2007)
The Dutch defender signed with Chelsea in 2006 and played there for a whole season before being loaned out to Sevilla for the entire season. But after six months, he went back to Chelsea in January 2008. He eventually relocated to VFB Stuttgart in 2008.
Steve Sidwell (2007-2008)
The English midfielder, who wore the number 9, only spent one season playing for Chelsea. He relocated to Aston Villa after leaving the Blues and eventually played for teams like Fulham and Stoke City. After playing for Brighton & Hove Albion for two seasons, he retired in 2018.
