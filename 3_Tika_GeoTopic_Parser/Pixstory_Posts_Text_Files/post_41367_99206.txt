A decades old failed effort by United States politicians to break the chokehold of a select few countries on the oil market has found new life as the war in Ukraine raised prices to an almost year high CNN reported that a US Senate committee on Thursday passed a bill that could expose the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC and its partners most prominently Russia to lawsuits for collusion on boosting oil prices The vote took place just hours after the cartel and its allies rebuffed the West once again and stuck to plans for a moderate modest ramp up in production To become law the bill has to go through the full Senate and House then be signed by the President White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the administration has concerns about the potential implications and unintended consequences of the legislation She said the White House is still studying the bill The No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act of or NOPEC is a bipartisan initiative that would strip OPEC and its member countries of sovereign immunity that has shielded them from litigation for decades This means that if the bill becomes law oil states will no longer be free from US court jurisdiction if they violate its requirements After Russia s invasion of Ukraine disrupted energy markets and drove up inflation at home the Biden administration has fought to keep oil prices under control
