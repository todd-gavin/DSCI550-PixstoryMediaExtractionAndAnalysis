Michael Jordan’s house hasn’t sold in 10 years, so he put a superstitious price tag of $14,855,000, which adds up to an iconic jersey number!

According to Sports Rush, his house in Chicago, which is an absurdly well-designed and well-kept house has been on the market for more than 10 years. Yes, a house owned by MJ has not been moved for a decade!

A a lot of circumstances have hindered its sale.

Firstly, the mansion is immaculate. It has nine bedrooms, nineteen bathrooms, a cigar room, a movie theatre, a tennis court, an infinity pool, putting green, and a pond.

Well, it looks as though no amount of superstition can help sell the place, as it is located in an area where buyers don’t feel justified by the price tag.
