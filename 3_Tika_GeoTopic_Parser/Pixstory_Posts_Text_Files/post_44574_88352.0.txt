The emergence of communist China continues....

Resurgent Chinese nationalism has been a continuous process, not only from 1949 to the present, but right from about 1920 onwards, and is a significant factor governing the attitudes of Chinese leaders in their dealings with foreign governments, and even with their major ethnic minorities, the Tibetans, the Muslim Uighurs and Kazakhs of Xinjiang, and the Mongols of Inner Mongolia. Today, the attitude of the average Chinese citizen is not only patriotic, but as its economy, military power, stature in the world, and self-confidence increasingly grows, is increasingly chauvinistic, and tending to become jingoistic as well. The recent Internet blog quoted below is more or less what all Chinese feel about a country such as India: “CHINA does NOT compare itself to a weak little country like India. That Hindu country is poor and the people ugly. They wear diapers on their heads and put ridiculous dots on their foreheads. CHINA doesn’t worry about India because there is NO need.” It is at heart more or less what the Chinese Government feels about India too, but the PRC is now a smooth operator on the world stage and it has polished diplomats. Nevertheless, it is important to understand at the outset that the Chinese in the last few centuries have been by and large contemptuous of India, and have considered peoples even within their own boundaries, such as the Tibetans and the Uighurs, to be the ‘barbarians’ who live on the peripheries.

Now, having proved to the world that they have ‘arrived’, the chauvinism of the Chinese state and the Han Chinese people is at a high, and some of the paranoia vis-à-vis the Western world is now mellowed down, but the attitudes of the old imperial China are beginning to reappear. They now want respect from the West, and are beginning to arrogantly expect it from their smaller neighbours.
