I hate huge books , 400 pages is my limit generally . I feel too many words can exhaust you and how long can you keep ur attention intact. 
Sometimes certain stories do deserve a certain play with words and language . You will find there is not much happening in the book, it’s not racing but it can lead you on to many dimensions. 
Took me time to get the grip infact started many weeks ago. It’s now , this week actually that I am
Able to read it and it’s quite interesting much say. 
Proper review once I finish .
