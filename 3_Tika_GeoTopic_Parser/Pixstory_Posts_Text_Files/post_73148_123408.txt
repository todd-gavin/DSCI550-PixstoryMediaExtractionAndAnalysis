There once was a little boy who wanted to meet God He knew it was a long trip to where God lived so he packed his suitcase with Twinkies and a six pack of root beer and started his journey When he had gone about three blocks he met an old woman She was sitting in the park just staring at some pigeons victory comes to you Her smile was so pretty that the boy wanted to see it again so he offered her a root beer Once again she smiled at him The boy was delighted They sat there all afternoon eating and smiling but they never said a word
