MY DERBY DAY DELIGHT…I’ve been going to north London Derby’s since the age of 8 I remember my dad taking me my first one at Highbury and seeing Dennis bergkamp score quite possibly one of the best goals I’ve ever seen. Fast forward 22 years and I still hate the derby everytime it comes around - I’m always full of nerves and anxiety and wish we could just shake hands and say 1-1.However when you do get a day like Saturday that joy and euphoria really does have a unmatched feeling. Nerves around the ground were clear for all to see but as the game drew closer the atmosphere really did hit fever pitch and even though it was a early kick off everyone was up for it.The team news come out and to my surprise Tottenham insisted on there 2 in midfield once I saw that I knew we could dominate this game - and it was exactly as I thought arsenal dominated I’d say 75 minutes of that game. Only when Tottenham scored there penalty was there a 10 minute spell where they looked dangerous.Arsenal looked like a team who were top of the league and spurs looked like a side who just wanted to play for a draw. Tottenham fans will say the red card changed the game (what a stupid challenge by royal) but arsenal were already 2-1 up and looked like they could score with any attack. 3 big points at home to a top 4 challenger and maybe the sign of things to come with liverpool next week at home. My man of the match. GRANIT XHAKA COYG
