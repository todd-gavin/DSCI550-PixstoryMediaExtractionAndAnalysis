The incident of burning alive a thief in Chukur village had shocked the entire Kashmir valley. That my forefathers were involved in it is a fact. And I am not ashamed of it because it's a part of who I am. 

There a huge public outcry in this idyllic village where our house was next to a little canal that connected with river Jhelum near Bijbehara and this was also a water route with houseboats being the major mode of transportation. My grandmother came from Bijbehara. 

My grandparents had to leave the village in the middle of a night in a houseboat and my grandmother's parents offered immediate refuge to them. The idea was to stay there till the outrage subsided and then go back.

However, the incident kept Chukur on the boil for a long time and it refused to die down. That forced my grandfather to take a decision of migrating to Srinagar. That's how we came to Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir. 

My grandfather's sister was married to one of the famous people in Kashmir. His name was Dr Shivji Dhar from Nawab Bazar. He owned huge estates that were given to him by the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir as Dr Dhar was his personal physician. So, they lived in Nawab Bazar for some time. Dr Dhar's family became our first point of contact in Srinagar. 

My grandparents started looking for a rental accommodation because the people those days took a lot of time in taking a decision when it came to buying a property. They found one huge haveli a few houses down Dr Dhar's house. It was one of the tallest buildings in that area. I don't know what has happened to it right now. 

This haveli belonged to Pandit Ram Chandra Kak, who was the Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir from 1945 to 1947 and one of the respectable Kashmiri Pandits. I have in my own way idolised him for being who he was. 

My grandparents had a huge family and all kinds of animals were there and this house was perfect for them.
