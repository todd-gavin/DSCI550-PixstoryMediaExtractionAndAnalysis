Bhavya Pahwa is a 3rd year medical student at UCMS and GTB Hospital New Delhi. She is an aspiring Neurosurgeon and Trans Rights Advocate, especially in medical curriculum. She has set various milestones as a medical student in the field of neurosurgery with tags such as "YOUNGEST", "ONLY FEMALE" and "ONLY ASIAN" in premiere international conferences and award sessions. 

Bhavya is the Founder of IRIDESCENCE, India's first ever LGBT and SOGIESC Rights promoting club in any medical institution which inspired more student led clubs like queerentia and Aquses. She is also the youngest founder for WALTER E DANDY NEUROSURGERY MEDICAL STUDENT’S CLUB in the world. 

Bhavya has an endearing love for painting and uses it as a medium to talk to the world. She is a performer and her ramp walks are a way to own herself as who she is, a strong and independent young woman.

Bhavya will be participating in the panel on ‘Medical spaces and trans inclusion’ while speaking on ‘Experiences as a student’ in the upcoming TransCare Med Ed National conference on May 5th.

About the Conference:

In recent years, there’s been a growing push to make medical education trans-affirmative in the backdrop of Madras and Kerala High Court judgements. But transforming India’s healthcare system comes with the need for a roadmap towards achieving this goal.

Through a systematic, participatory, and inclusive effort, TransCare MedEd has developed a set of draft trans-affirmative competencies on trans-affirmative healthcare in India. 

The upcoming TransCare Med Ed National conference on May 5th and 6th is aimed at disseminating and discussing the draft competencies, highlighting best practices and building consensus on the way forward.

Watch this space for narratives by transgender people navigating healthcare settings, and for thoughts and pathways on the way towards creating access to trans-affirmative healthcare.
