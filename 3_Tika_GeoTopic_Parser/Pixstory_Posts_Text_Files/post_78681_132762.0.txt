Fun watch
Hey
Do you need something funny , short and interesting to watch rn?
Here's my recommendation: Friends
The tv show friends is basically a story of 6 friends. This show has alot of seasons and episodes but the best part is every episode has a different storyline so you can randomly watch any episode anytime. 
It  is a great stress buster as if you are stressed during a productive activity you can take a teeny 20 break i.e, 20 min break and just watch one episode and you'll feel mentally light and less stressed with all the jokes in the show. You can get back to work be more productive.
Have a great watch!
