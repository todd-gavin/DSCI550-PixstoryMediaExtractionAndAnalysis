For me , riding a bicycle without training wheels is the first challenging physical activity i ever learn how to master . We all remember , don’t we ? A running start . The protective hand secured to the bicycle seat is released . And then — ZOOM ! — the child is off and peddling , and a lifetime of adventure and freedom awaits aboard a succession of beloved two-wheeled conveyances . ✅

let’s take a closer look at World Bicycle Day , June 3 , shall we ? 🚴

Training wheels or tandem , cycle your worries away on World Bicycle Day on June 3 ! World Bicycle Day Is Celebrated on June 3 Every Year ! 🚴✅

The day is aimed at making people more active through simple activities , including cycling ! In April 2018 , the United Nations General Assembly declared June 3 as International World Bicycle Day . The resolution for World Bicycle Day recognizes " the uniqueness , longevity and versatility of the bicycle , which has been in use for two centuries , and that it is a simple , affordable , reliablec, clean and environmentally fit sustainable means of transport . " 

World Bicycle Day becomes all the more significant with the growing concerns around the lack of physical activities among people and its health hazards . A cycle is a clean , affordable , and environment-friendly mode of transportation and promoting its use contributes to the conservation of nature and achieving cleaner air and environment . 🚴✅

Let’s not go back to old habits . Let’s use a bicycle to reduce traffic , stress , improve health , air quality and renew our cities . Build a better city for the future generation . ✅

Happy World Bicycle Day to all ❤️🚴
