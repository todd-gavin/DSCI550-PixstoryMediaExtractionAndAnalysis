Saif Ali Khan, who over the years has established himself as one of the most versatile actors in the Hindi film industry, is seen sharing screen space with Hrithik Roshan in filmmaker duo Pushkarâ€“Gayathri's recent movie Vikram Vedha. While the 2017 Tamil version starring R. Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi was a huge hit, the Hindi remake, made with a massive budget of Rs 175 crore, has failed to recreate the magic in the domestic circuit.From Parampara (his debut movie) to Bunty Aur Babli 2, Saif has come a long way in his career and won several awards for his performances. The 52-year-old actor was also one of the first A-listers to appear in an OTT show (like Sacred Games) and proved his mettle as an actor. But Saif Ali Khan's journey hasn't been smooth sailing as he faced a few roadblocks in the form of failed projects and also turned down films that went on to become huge hits.1.
