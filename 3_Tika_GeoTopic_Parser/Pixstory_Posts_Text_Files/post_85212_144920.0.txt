England midfielder Kalvin Phillips is out of the National League games against Italy and Germany due to a shoulder injury. On top of that, he is also doubtful for the World Cup which is scheduled to get underway in November at Qatar.
Phillips, who landed at Manchester City from Leeds United this summer, is yet to start a competitive game for his new home. He suffered a shoulder blow during a friendly match against Barcelona at Camp Nou but made a comeback later. He suffered the injury again in training on Thursday.
The midfielder has had a similar issue at Leeds as well, where he was out of action for five weeks. The 26-year-old has played less than 20 minutes in the three games he featured for the Sky Blues this season.
While he has pulled out of England’s National League games next month, it is almost certain that he will require surgery, which puts his availability for the marquee event in jeopardy.
Gerald Southgate is expected to name England’s provisional squad for the Qatar World Cup on October 21. Manchester City have five fixtures till then, thus, it will be hard for the English midfielder to make a comeback and showcase his fitness for the big stage.
What does it mean to the England national team?
Gerald Southgate will be desperate to have the services of Kavlin Phillips, who played a vital role in the 2020 Euros. Though the length of the recovery is still unknown, the midfielder will have to recover very quickly in order to participate in the World Cup, which is just two months away.
The English side are star-studded with great depth in the squad, Thus, it won’t be too tough for them to find a replacement for Phillips, who is unlikely to get match fit for the mega event.
