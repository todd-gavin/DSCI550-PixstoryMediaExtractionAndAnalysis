I was mindlessly scrolling through my LinkedIn feed when I came across this advertisement post that said use our meme service to promote your brand product and behold it becoming the new sensation At first I was pretty skeptical and I wondered if that was even a genuine ad but when I clicked on it I was quite surprised to discover that not only it was totally genuine but a staggering bunch of individuals and organizations had used their service as marketing campaigns for their respective brands This piqued my curiosity big time so I was compelled to check out what it was all about Only to inadvertently learn that meme marketing is an actual term in the business landscape Motla of the story Memes are simple relatable and proved to be an effective coping mechanism Believe it or not memes are the coming age sensation
