Police Abolition has always been an up and high topic of debate in America I have many times seen people arguing over the same with a lot of people keeping across their points on why or why not should the police department be defunded however there was always one common instance in all those debates The pro police side putting forth an argument Who will protect you if you re attacked someday if police was to be defunded And now I have the same question Who is supposed to protect us Who was supposed to protect those innocent children who were mercilessly being shot at While the gunman identified Raimondo Ramos rampaged through the Texas school police officers refused to enter the building for freaking minutes Parents were shouting Go in there Go in there Onlookers were so enraged that they considered intervening themselves Who do these cowards protect and serve exactly Two teachers gave their lives to protect those children without thinking about their own the others didn t leave the school building until the last kid was out The police sat outside for an hour This is the state of our country where untrained unarmed civilians care more about protecting victims in a massacre while the trained armed and supposedly brave army of police doesn t give a crap despite being paid for it Not to mention the police already had engaged with the shooter before the shooting was carried out This is per Sgt Erick Estrada of the Texas Department of Public Safety in an interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN They watched as he ran in the school armed and did not do anything Didn t shoot because he could have had a bullet proof west on him It s been established in court that it is not the police s responsibility to protect the public from harm It leads us to the question if they can t protect us they engage in killing us then why do we need them They shoot at people for stealing bread but won t shoot at someone going in to massacre little children
