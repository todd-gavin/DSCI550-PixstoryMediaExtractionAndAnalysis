The two Formula E world titles will be awarded tomorrow at the very last round of the season. In fact, the number one race in the history of the electric championship did not close the championship games despite the great advantage of the standings leader Stoffel Vandoorne who arrived at the double round in Seoul with good points ahead Winning was instead his main and at this point only rival in the standings Mitch Evans good at taking the lead of the race at the start and then leading the dance to the finish while the Belgian from Mercedes understandably kept a prudent and measured conduct of the race which led him to finish in fifth place aware of having to collect a few points to bring home the first Formula E title of his career. The podium is completed by poleman Oliver Rowland and Lucas Di Grassi.
