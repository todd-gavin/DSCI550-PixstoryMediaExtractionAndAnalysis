Has covid gone Is everything in your life back to normal now Is there no longer a necessity to preserve social distance All of these thoughts came to mind today while riding the Delhi metro Millions of people use the Delhi metro every day to get to work school or to get from one place to another for any reason because it is one of the most convenient modes of public transportation that is both cost effective and quick in comparison to other modes of public transportation However the level of crowding is so high that it is impossible to maintain the level of social distancing required by Covid security standards There is no restriction to the number of individuals who can board a metro you can enter if there is enough room for you to stand and travel It is impossible to maintain the level of separation essential to prevent illness from spreading from one person to another in such a setting I ve seen folks travelling with half masks and without masks coughing or sneezing During the second wave of Covid we all witnessed the worst case of irresponsibility Although maintaining the current level of crowding in the Delhi metro is nearly impossible the government should take some rigorous measures to avoid the situation from worsening Do express your opinion in terms of how it could be improved
