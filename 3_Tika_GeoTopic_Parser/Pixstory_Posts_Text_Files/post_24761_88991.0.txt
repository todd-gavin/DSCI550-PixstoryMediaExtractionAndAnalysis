Mourinho’s team are now unbeaten in 13 matches from all competitions, reaching 6th in the league. Tammy Abraham scores double to move to third spot in top scorers list with 15 goals. 


Rampant Roma thrashed Lazio with the help of goals from Tammy Abraham (1’, 22’) and an excellent free kick from captain Pellegrini (40’). They are now at 6th with 51 points from 30 matches, winning 15, losing 9 and drawing 6. The Englishman's goal was fastest in the derby which came in just 56 seconds after kickoff. 


First goal came from Pellegrini's corner, which curled to the crossbar and landed on to the legs of Abraham. He easily put the ball into the net. Roma kept on attacking and got the result soon. They made a good move through mid and Karsdorp got the ball with space on the right. His cross was emphatically turned into the goal by Abraham. Pellegrini's goal was magical. A 25 yard long free kick was sent to the right corner of goal accurately, beyond the stretching hands of goalkeeper Strakosha. There weren't many moments to cherish for Lazio in the match other than keeping the ball for more time. Patricio wasn't tested much in the entire game. 


Mourinho's men are looking more stable and organised now. Lazio is 7th below Roma now. AC Milan is leading with 66 points and Napoli trailing just 3 points behind them. Inter, who lost the lead half way through the season, are third with 60 points. 


In the post match interview Mourinho said "I've won each derby in every country I have coached in. It was an important win for Roma and in the history of the club. Lazio were the top team with 1 point. We played decisive and with more control over the opponent. Top teams like Atalanta, Fiorentina are also competing, so this win was important. It was a great performance. Congratulations to the players." 


Roma will be playing against Sampdoria on April 3rd. They have 2 tough matches in April - Apr 18 vs Napoli and Apr 24 vs Inter Milan.
