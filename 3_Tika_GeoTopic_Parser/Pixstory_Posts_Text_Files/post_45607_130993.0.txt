Food is not just about sustenance but also it is one of the biggest joys in life! Ask any foodie and they will agree with me. 

Instead of teaching people about moderation, people these days are all about completely cutting cakes out of diet! 

If it is something that makes you happy, then why should you quit it?

Have you ever taken a slice of your favourite dessert and noticed a sudden change in how you were feeling? Yes, the sensation is real; it is not a placebo effect. According to studies, eating foods with a lot of carbohydrates helps your body produce more of the hormones that make you feel happy (serotonin). 

As GB says, a slice of your favourite cake quickly enhances both your mind and body. 

Utilize the evidence supporting this and indulge in a delicious cake piece guilt-free.
