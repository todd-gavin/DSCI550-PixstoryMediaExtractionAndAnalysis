It&#39;s a real shame but now official Nadal withdraws from Wimbledon due to the abdominal tear that has been tormenting him for a few days and which worsened in the quarter-final match The Majorcan tennis player who at first was thought could play despite the injury announced his decision yesterday evening in a press conference As you can imagine I&#39;m here to retire he immediately communicated to journalists Then he explained the situation I have an abdominal injury I think it makes no sense to go on the pitch even if I have often tried in my career but if I keep playing the injury will get worse and worse I made this decision because I don&#39;t think I can win two games I can&#39;t serve and I can&#39;t make the necessary movements The tear in his abs by millimeters which didn&#39;t stop him from winning the quarterfinals but he wouldn&#39;t be able to to play as he would like the semifinal and especially the final where he could have met Djokovic Nadal tried to stay in the game I&#39;ve had abs problems for about a week but things were more or less under control But yesterday was the worst day Honestly during I did some tests during the week to see how things were developing And after yesterday&#39;s match this tiny lesion I had there for a few days got much bigger The chance for him to win the Grand Slam vanishes
