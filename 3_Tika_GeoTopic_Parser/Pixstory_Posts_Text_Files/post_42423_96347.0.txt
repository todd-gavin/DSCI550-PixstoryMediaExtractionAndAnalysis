A couple of days back, Rohit Shetty announced that he started filming his first web series (named Indian Police Force) with Sidharth Malhotra and the web series will premiere on Amazon Prime Video.

Today, he again announced that in the same web series, Shilpa Shetty will be making her OTT debut.

Out of all the heroines Rohit Shetty worked previously in his cop universe movies, I think the role of Shilpa Shetty will the best out of all and I canâ€™t wait for it.
