Women feel great satisfaction when they buy something new The act of shopping gives us a feeling of power that can rarely be found in other aspects of life It doesn t matter if she buys a dress or something nice for the house the emotion is the same You must have seen girls making an upheaval of their wardrobe with a scream Oh god I have nothing to wear Let s go out and shop Yes this is a common characteristic of every woman on this earth I used to wonder that despite having a cupboard full of end number of different robes why the hell the fair sex crave for shopping Being a girl I personally did not really have any clue behind this psych You know that moment when a girl smiles at a guy and his heart melts like butter and slides down a hot toast Similarly that is what we girls feel when we see a store
