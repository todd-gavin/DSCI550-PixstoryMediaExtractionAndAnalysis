Abortion and negativity towards it is not an issue that persists in America but worldwide who can decide what a woman wants None but herself We see random people expressing opinions on women s bodies this is being happening for years First they suppress us because we are women They destroyed our mental health deeming us secondary Then they started shaming our body parts Objectifying them abusing them and whatnot Then they saw menstruation as impure Not focusing on our reproductive rights Patriarchy needs something or the other to oppress women This is what happens when a bunch of patriarchs who have zero knowledge of what women s rights makes law We cannot definitely return to the times not so old wherein women have to struggle through pain and in unhygienic conditions to abort as it is her decision and not of the government Let the circumstance be anything no reason is needed when a woman decides not to have a child It is about life the life of the women A child is a great responsibility that alters life This should not be an accident but a properly informed decision to make Rejecting abortion rights will be abandoning the reproductive health and the basic right of women over their bodies This is an upheaval of women s rights There must be no discussion on this issue as it s not the government that decides what a woman needs
