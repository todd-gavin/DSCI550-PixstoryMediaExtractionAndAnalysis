In eight trophy-filled years at Anfield, Liverpool cult star Divock Origi won the Premier League, 
Champions League, FA Cup, League Cup, UEFA Super Cup, and FIFA Club World; A four-year deal is signed by a Belgian player with the Serie A champions Milan. After leaving Liverpool, AC 
Milan has completed the free-agent acquisition of forward Divock Origi.

Origi signed a four-year deal with the Serie A winners that runs until the summer of 2026, 
ending an eight-year stay on Merseyside. During his tenure at Anfield, the 27-year-old Belgian 
international won everything that could be won and became a cult legend for scoring crucial 
goals during the most momentous of times.

Origi scored the game-winning second against Tottenham in the final to help Liverpool win their sixth European championship in Madrid in 2019. Origi had already scored twice in Liverpool's memorable 4-0 Champions League semi-final victory against Barcelona in 2019.

Origi saved his best for Liverpool's archrival Everton, scoring the game-winning goal in the 95th minute of the 2018 Merseyside derby at Anfield, which was famously marked by Jurgen Klopp sprinting onto the field in celebration.

His sixth derby goal, which also happened to be his final one scored while wearing a Liverpool jersey, also sealed a 2-0 victory over the Toffees in April 2022.

Origi scored half as many goals against Everton as he did against any other team in his Liverpool career, and he has the most goals scored by a Liverpool player as a substitute with 11 in the Premier League.

He departed the team after making 175 appearances and scored 41 goals, and he now plays for Milan, who last season won their 19th Scudetto and first in 11 years under coach Stefano Pioli.
