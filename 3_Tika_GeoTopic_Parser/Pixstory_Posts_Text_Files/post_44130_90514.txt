Dele Alli is apparently facing the sack at Everton only months after Frank Lampard saved him from a life of misery at Tottenham Alli had been left out in the cold at Spurs when Lampard took a chance and brought him to Merseyside in a last minute move in January making it one of his first acts at the club Given the England international s spectacular drop off in form over the last few of years the move was seen as a risk Both Alli and Lampard were certain that a fresh start at Goodison Park would help the midfielder rekindle his career but that early optimism appears to be disturbingly optimistic year old has struggled to make an impact at Everton with rumours saying that the club is considering releasing him in the summer Alli who is still only has yet to start for the Toffees and has only played minutes in six substitute appearances Everton did not pay a fee up front for him but did agree to pay Tottenham a figure that may increase to million if various performance related incentives are reached something that already appears improbable Alli has continued to struggle under Lampard rather than rejuvenating his career Lampard attempted to defend Alli s stuttering start to life at Everton earlier this month but with the club mired in relegation the onus is on the new man to establish form quickly if he is to have a future on Merseyside It s difficult to see where he ll be plying his trade next season unless something spectacular happens in the final month of the Premier League season Former Republic of Ireland and Sheffield United goalkeeper Brian McDermott is the latest former Premier League player to question Alli s struggles And in the aftermath of his sluggish start at Everton Kenny believes his attitude must be questioned Kenny You would think a change in scenery would do him the world of good but clearly he hasn t been training well enough You have to question his attitude at this point I can t think what else would be keeping him from playing
