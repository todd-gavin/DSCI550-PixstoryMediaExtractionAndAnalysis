In Switzerland the volume of glaciers halved between and the conclusion of a study by the Federal Institute of Technology Zurich ETH and the Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL published today in the scientific journal The Cryosphere The results of the analysis report a release show that glaciers melted faster and faster they lost half their volume between and and then a further between and or in just six years Not all glaciers were equally affected According to the study reports the Swiss news agency Keystone Ats the extent of a glacier&#39;s melt depends on the altitude at which it is found on how flat the glacier tongue is and how much it is covered with debris But in general even if not all glaciers have melted every year and that over the years and the mass even increased in isolated cases the climate of the 20th century was decidedly unfavorable for glaciers The study was carried out with the help of photographs taken between and and the researchers determined the surface of the glaciers at two different times They therefore calculated the difference in volume and reconstructed the topography of all the Swiss glaciers for the year The comparison was then carried out with the data for the years The retreat of the glaciers is accelerating Observing this phenomenon closely and quantifying its historical dimensions is important because it allows us to reaction of glaciers to climate change This information is needed to develop reliable scenarios for future changes observed Daniel Farinotti professor of glaciology at ETH Zurich and WSL and co-author of the study.
