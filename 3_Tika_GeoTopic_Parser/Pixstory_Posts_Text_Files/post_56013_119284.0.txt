A pay offer of 2 percent was rejected leading thousands of council workers across Scotland to vote to take industrial action.

Staff at schools, nurseries, and waste and recycling centers throughout the country took part in the strike ballot.

It was the largest strike ballot among council workers in more than a decade, the Unison union said.

Nine local authority branches surpassed the required 50% turnout limit required by the Trade Union Act.

Unison's Johanna Baxter said: "Cosla leaders meet on Friday and must put an improved offer on the table if we are to avoid large-scale disruption to council services across Scotland.
"Council workers south of the border yesterday were offered a flat rate uplift of £1925, which for those on the lowest pay equates to a 10.5% increase. You have to wonder why council workers north of the border have only been offered a measly 2% increase when the cost of living continues to spiral.
"Unison has been calling for a flat rate payment to help those on lower incomes. Most council workers earn less than £25k per year."

In this time of inflation, the council workers are being most affected and a pay rise is necessary for them to live and this is being rejected here. The government should be responsible for its citizens when utility and costs are rising in the country.
