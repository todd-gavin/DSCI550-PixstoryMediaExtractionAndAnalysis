AMAZE Y ADELAIDE CRAPSEY


I know

Not these my hands

And yet I think there was

A woman like me once had hands

Like these.


The poem is simple in the form r to haiku. Cinquain’ had existed as a word before her miniature verse innovation, but Crapsey co-opted it to describe the five-line unrhymed form which she used in her finest poetry. ‘Amaze’, which is reproduced below, is an example of Crapsey’s cinquains – and perhaps her most famous poem. It describes the hands that the poet's younger self once had. Resonating to the past and woman she was. She is a bit confused about the fact. At last, the poet leaves her confusion to the readers like a puzzle. It can either be a reference to her mother or she hints at herself. It’s a question open to various interpretations.
