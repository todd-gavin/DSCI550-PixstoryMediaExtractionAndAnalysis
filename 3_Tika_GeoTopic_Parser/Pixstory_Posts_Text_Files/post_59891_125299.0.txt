An alleged terrorist with Jaish-e-Mohammed ties was nabbed by the Uttar Pradesh Police's Anti-Terrorist Squad on Friday. He was charged with planning a "fidayeen" attack on Nupur Sharma, a suspended BJP spokesperson.

According to a statement by Prashant Kumar, additional director general of police (law and order) for Uttar Pradesh, Mohammad Nadeem (25), is a native of Kunda Kala village, which is part of the Gangoh police station area in the Saharanpur district.

According to the ADGP, the police retrieved voicemails and chat transcripts from Nadeem's phone, and they were able to identify Pakistan and Afghanistan as the destinations of these communications.

In addition, they found two SIM cards on him, as well as literature on how to make different kinds of bombs.

He has been detained at the ATS police station in Lucknow under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, according to the statement.

The statement added that Nadeem had been awaiting a visa when he confessed to being in communication with JeM directly since 2018 and that the group had invited him to Pakistan and Syria for specialised training.

The BJP suspended Nupur Sharma as its national spokesperson after she made anti-Prophet Mohammad remarks during a television debate in May, which led to protests and indignation both domestically and internationally.

Additionally, she had gotten multiple death threats.
