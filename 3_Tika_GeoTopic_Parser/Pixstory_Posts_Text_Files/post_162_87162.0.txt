Two weeks ago, I had the privilege of going on my first work trip, for a storytelling project in Paris – here’s my attempt to document an opportunity that I am continuing to learn from as time goes on:

My day started at Pharmacie Du Champ De Mars in the narrow street of Rue Saint-Dominique, where I got my COVID Vaccine certificate converted to be allowed entry into the Parc des Princes.

Rue Saint-Dominique boasted two brasseries – Café Le Dôme and Le Champ Mars – almost attempting to outdo each other with their in-your-face red red and white themes softened by round fairy lights. 

Sipping an espresso was crucial as the sun strengthened into its 10:03 am self.

I let the traffic light guide me into bistrot Le Champ Mars, 400 meters away from the Eiffel Tower with its Parisian style theme of the 40s, not realizing that I’d entered its adjoining Café Richard – an 1892 establishment of wooden paneling, warm lighting, and golden-framed mirrors.

Caffeinated with a re-energized sense of purpose, I was ready to document every inch of Paris possible.
