Yan Xie MPH Ziyad Al Aly MD Summary Background There is growing evidence suggesting that beyond the acute phase of SARS CoV infection people with COVID could experience a wide range of post acute sequelae including diabetes However the risks and burdens of diabetes in the post acute phase of the disease have not yet been comprehensively characterised To address this knowledge gap we aimed to examine the post acute risk and burden of incident diabetes in people who survived the first days of SARS CoV infection Methods In this cohort study we used the national databases of the US Department of Veterans Affairs to build a cohort of participants who had a positive COVID test between March and Sept and survived the first days of COVID a contemporary control n that enrolled participants between March and Sept and a historical control n that enrolled participants between March and Sept Both control groups had no evidence of SARS CoV infection Participants in all three comparison groups were free of diabetes before cohort entry and were followed up for a median of days IQR We used inverse probability weighted survival analyses including predefined and algorithmically selected high dimensional variables to estimate post acute COVID risks of incident diabetes antihyperglycaemic use and a composite of the two outcomes We reported two measures of risk hazard ratio HR and burden per people at months Interpretation In the post acute phase we report increased risks and month burdens of incident diabetes and antihyperglycaemic use in people with COVID compared with a contemporary control group of people who were enrolled during the same period and had not contracted SARS CoV and a historical control group from a pre pandemic era Post acute COVID care should involve identification and management of diabetes Sources
