After wins on the bounce this season the mood around the fanbase is at an all time high It would be easy for everyone including the players to get carried away but it s important to remember that there are no easy games in this Premier League The Fulham side we come up against have already taken points off both Wolves and Liverpool and possess one of the deadliest weapons in the league in the form of Mitrovic If we are to dive deeper into Alexandar we would find that not only is he the joint nd top goalscorer in the league but he s actually top on xG and by some distance too If we are going to win today it s absolutely paramount that we cut off the supply line to him and don t let him challenge our defenders aerially close to our goal Fortunately with a back in possession of Gabriel Saliba White Tomiyasu I feel we are well equipped to deal with his threat but it remains important we don t allow him to drift off the shoulder and challenge Zinchenko at the back post if our shape is as such Focusing on ourselves I don t think any changes are necessary We have midweek against Aston Villa in which players should be rested in preparation for the upcoming United game however I think the game today is important to maintain momentum and continue to make a statement at the top of the league It will once again be exciting to see the fluidity of our attack with the unpredictable rotations making us a very difficult team to defend against I predict Gabriel Jesus will get his name on the scoresheet after having his goal marginally ruled out last week If all goes well hopefully we are able to make it through this fixture with another clean sheet a few goals scored and no injuries going into this especially busy pre world cup period I m predicting a Arsenal with Fulham s resilient block eventually being broken by Arsenal s constantly improving attack COYG Arsenal PixstoryArsenal
