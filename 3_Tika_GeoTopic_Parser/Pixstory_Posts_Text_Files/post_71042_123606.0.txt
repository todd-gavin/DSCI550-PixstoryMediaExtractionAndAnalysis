On the final day of the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, India added six medals, including four gold, to finish fourth overall with 61 medals (22 gold, 16 silver, and 23 bronze). The absence of shooting was expected to reduce India's overall medal count, but unexpected medals from sports such as lawn bowls, judo, and athletics mitigated the impact. Overall, the Indian contingent in Birmingham delivered a commendable performance.
