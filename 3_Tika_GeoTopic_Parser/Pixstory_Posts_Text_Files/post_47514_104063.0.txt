Calling this season eventful for Chelsea would be quite an understatement. Things have been
unprecedentedly chaotic for them both on and off the pitch. Despite the optimism with which
Chelsea’s bid for the Premier League was anticipated by everyone this season, especially after
their winning the Champions League last season, there has been tons of disappointment.

They
did manage to secure the Champions League once again, coming in third behind Manchester
City and Liverpool, but with so much going on behind the scenes as well as on the field, for a
while towards the end this had seemed doubtful too.

To begin with, Chelsea has had a notorious takeover as former owner Roman Abramovich was
forced to sell the club due to the economic sanctions placed on him as a result of his connections with Vladimir Putin who waged war on Ukraine in February.While this was happening at the top level, Chelsea also struggled with controversy with its players – with the
infamous Lukaku interview.

All of this culminated with a topsy turvy campaign for them, finishing
third but winning two out of their last seven matches.

Chelsea should have comfortably clear of the chasing back, yet the were almost pulled in to the
race for the Champions League. At the end of the season, Chelsea found themselves closer to
Tottenham, than to Liverpool and Manchester City.

Summer signing of Lukaku failed to justify
the price, with 15 goals across all competitions. Struggling for goals was a theme for Chelsea
across the season, with their top scorer being midfielder Mason Mount with 11 goals in the
Premier League. Chelsea did manage to make it to the finals of the League and FA Cup, but
they lost out to Liverpool at both occasions.

Chelsea started the season strongly, garnering 29 points out of a possible 39 before losing 3-2
to West Ham at the London Stadium.
