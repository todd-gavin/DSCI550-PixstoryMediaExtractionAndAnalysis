Scoring in FIFA World Cup has to be one of the greatest feelings for an athlete representing
his nation at the highest level of football. And nothing can match any football player's
prestige in FIFA World Cup.
And those who score at just young age take the centre of the stage in the tournament. We
have witnessed many youngsters scoring at a very young age, and many have emerged and
scored their first goal for their nation.
We take a look at the top 10 youngest goalscorers in FIFA World Cup.
#10. Martin Hoffmann (East Germany) â€“ 19 years 88 days
The German legend will never forget his first World Cup goal for Germany; he played for
Germany when the nation was separated into two parts. Hoffmann represented East
Germany and played for them from 1973 to 1981.
In those years, he scored 15 goals for them and became the seven youngest player to score
in a World Cup in 1974; and was viewed as the next big thing for Germans, but the player
struggled to fulfil and retired in 1984.
#9 Divock Origi (Belgium)- 19 years 65 days
The Liverpool legend also had his mark on FIFA World Cup. He was part of the golden
generation in 2014 World Cup, which generated players like Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku,
and Kevin De Bruyne.Origi made his cameo in an impressive way for Belgium and netted his first-ever goal forthem in the 2014 World Cup; in doing so, he became their ninth youngest player.
#8 Julian Green (USA)- 19 years, 25 days
The Bayern Munich midfielder made an impression in FIFA World Cup; having emerged fromthe Bayern Munich academy, he was another player who flopped in the later stages of
football.
But the midfielder made a name for himself in World Cup when he joined the list of youngest
goalscorers in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Later his career did not progress so far, and he
now plays for the German second division club.
