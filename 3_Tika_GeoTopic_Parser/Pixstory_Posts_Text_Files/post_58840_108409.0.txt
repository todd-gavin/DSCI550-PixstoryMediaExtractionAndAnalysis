As anti-Agneepath plan activists continue to wreak havoc across the country by vandalising and torching public property, the Indian Defence Ministry warned on Sunday that anyone engaging in violent protests or arson will be denied admission to the Agniveer programme.


"The Indian Army's foundation in the discipline," Lieutenant General Anil Puri, Additional Secretary, Department of Military Affairs, stated during a press briefing in New Delhi. Arson and vandalism have no place here. At the time of enrolment, everyone will have to sign a certificate stating that they were not involved in the protest or vandalism. No one can join the police force unless they have passed a thorough background check.

They won't be able to join if they have a FIR filed against them... They (aspirants) will be required to state on the enrollment form that they were not involved in the arson, and their police records will be checked.

As widespread violent protests and outrage over the Centre's recently introduced Agneepath Recruitment Scheme escalate, the government has made certain changes to accommodate protesting students' and defence aspirants' concerns. The Centre declared 10% reservations for 'Agniveers' in various Central government posts when they complete their four-year service term under the Agneepath scheme on Saturday.

Aside from that, the age limit for first-year recruitment has been raised.

Puri addressed the changes made to the scheme in response to the nationwide outrage, saying, "The announcements regarding the reservations for 'Agniveers' announced by the different ministries and departments were pre-planned and not in response to the arson that occurred after the announcement of the Agnipath scheme."
