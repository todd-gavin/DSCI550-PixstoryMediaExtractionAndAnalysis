It’s Friday and if you are feeling bored and have nothing to do this weekend then here I am with the list of new movies and web series that you can watch over this weekend in cinemas or OTT platforms.

1. Jurassic World Dominion 

It’s the year 2022 and Universal Pictures selling this instalment of the Jurassic World movie as the epic conclusion of the Jurassic Era. If you are a fan of watching dinosaurs on the big screen then you can’t miss this popcorn entertainer. You can watch this movie exclusively in cinemas.

2. 777 Charlie 

If everything goes by the trend then Charlie 777 will be another blockbuster from the Kannada region. The trailer of the movie looks promising and if you are a dog lover then this movie should be on your watchlist. You can watch 777 Charlie in cinemas near you.

3. Peaky Blinders Season 06 

I think Peaky Blinders needs no introduction and people are waiting for Peaky Blinders to release in India on Netflix because in the UK, show already aired on BBC iplayer and after two months, Netflix got the rights to premiere the show and I can’t keep calm.

4. Jayeshbhai Jordaar 

After the overwhelming response from the critics and underwhelming response at the box office, Ranveer Singh’s Jayeshbhai Jordaar is available on Amazon Prime Video and you can watch it now and decide whether the movie was good or not.

5. Sher Bagga 

If you are a Punjabi movie lover then Sher Bagga should be on your watchlist because your favourite Punjabi actors, Ammy Virk and Sonam Bajwa are back and their on-screen chemistry is ready to win the hearts of the audiences. You can enjoy this movie exclusively in theatres near you.
