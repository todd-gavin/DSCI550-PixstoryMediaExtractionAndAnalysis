 WB Montreal has released the new PC trailer for the upcoming Gotham Knights showcasing some of the game’s more advanced features eager to put on display what the game’s advanced hardware is capable of doing. 
Visually, the PC port will have 4K resolution Ultra-high frame rate, Ray-traced reflections, NVIDIA DLSS2, AMD FSR2, and Intel X Super Sampling for enhanced performance Ultrawide and multi-monitor support.
There will also be expansive customization options which include a field of view slider, ambient occlusion settings, the ability to set a dynamic resolution, and more. Given all these features, the PC version of the open world superhero action game may prove to be the prettiest looking version of the game. 
The game will also have a bunch of villains from Batman’s rogues gallery such as the Court of Owls, Harley Quinn, Clayface, The League of Assassins, Mr. Freeze, Man-Bat, the Penguin etc.
Gotham Knights will be arriving in October and is touted to be one of 2022’s biggest and most hotly anticipated games, and even though Batman will not be present in the game, visually, narratively and gameplay wise, the game has indeed taken some cues from the acclaimed Arkham series. 
After delaying the game to 2022 last year, Warner Bros officially announced the new launch date of October 21, 2022. The game was slated to release on October 25 but they are releasing it a little earlier than planned.
