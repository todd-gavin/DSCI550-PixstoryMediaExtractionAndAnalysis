Last one month, I have been wanting to put together something meaningful. Something that can help people and give purpose to what we are also doing. 
It seemed jinxed. Never has something taken so much time. 
This should have been a footnote but it isn’t . I thought I will begin this post with it. Not just to show the desperation of getting this through because it means so much but because this should be priority. 
The campaign is Mental health and well being - something that each one of us have to work toward to keep it together. 
The ever scary and mounting figures on depression and suicide - more in certain marginal communities than others. The rise is unnerving. And the covid pandemic has made it worse .
But what we however, forget , is that on a daily basis is that many of us really struggle to maintain those levels of sanity. We have minor breakdowns which might not make us rush to the psychiatrists but they surely take a toll on us. 
Frayed nerves are part of our daily living. Juggling between work and home, long travel hours, meeting deadlines, sometimes leave you burnt. 
Besides all this, the pressure of our relationships, always trying to do the best for families. Providing the best/safe space for your children, growing up years, their education. Even dealing with their everyday friends/school issues is exhausting. 
So amid all this, sometimes we do reach that breakdown point. Some times minor things can be a trigger. Sometimes we feel we can’t do it any more. Sometimes you just feel the need to go invisible, disappear just retract. 
At times we need someone to just talk to . We need someone to just hear. 
We at Pixstory want to provide that ear. We aim to bring together experts who can share their advice, opinion. Give tips for healthy living. We can be a great platform for a helpline.
So Let’s share our stories, let’s share how we deal with issues to help others. Let’s share our knowledge . Let’s Discuss Mental Health.
