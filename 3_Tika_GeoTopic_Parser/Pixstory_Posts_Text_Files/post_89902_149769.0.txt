Centre-back Maguire made mistakes in the build-up to two of Germany's three goals in England's 3-3 draw on Monday.
His selection, and place in Gareth Southgate's starting line-up, has been questioned after he was dropped earlier in the season by United.
"Harry is an amazing player, an amazing character," Shaw told BBC Radio 5 Live.
"He's taken a lot of stick - probably more than I've ever seen before in football.
"He never hides away, he's always there. You can have people who can hide away and not want to be in the spotlight. He keeps putting himself in the spotlight, it shows the strength and character he's got.
"Everybody knows he's an unbelievable player. At the moment the confidence might not be there because it could feel like the whole world is against him.
"It's tough for him, but us as players and staff are all behind him because he's a very important player. It shows Gareth's trust because he's played in both games [this week] - and look at the Euros what he's done.
"People need to understand he's a big part of the England team and have to accept it."
Maguire's struggle for form for both club and country are not new - the 29-year-old was booed during England's friendly win over Ivory Coast in March after a difficult period with United.
The following month, police conducted a sweep of his house after he received a bomb threat.
Club captain Maguire was also booed during pre-season in Australia, and has made just three Premier League appearances this season.
