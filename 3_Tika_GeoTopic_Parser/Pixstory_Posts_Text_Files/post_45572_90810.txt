Bridgerton was something I was waiting for with bated breath Dreamy costumes balls and romance What is not to love But unfortunately I binged watch the series over the weekend and now I am suffering from what I call the Post Bridgerton Hangover But the good news is that there is hope The combination of historical backdrop dramatic intrigue and romance has constantly resulted in TV period dramas being among the most successful programmes of all time Often after seeing a very good programme it s difficult to find another one that has the same impact One explanation for this is that after seeing a drama like Bridgerton English speaking viewers are likely to seek out additional English language series to watch As Collider reports though largely unknown in the United States Ukrainian costume drama Love In Chains wowed Eastern European audiences upon its release and for good reason its opulent th century setting as well as the sheer drama and intricacy of its plot are enough to rival anything produced in the United States or the United Kingdom Love In Chains is the narrative of Katerina Verbitskaya Katerina Kovalchyk a teenage serf who is raised as a noblewoman by her aristocratic godmother Anna Chervinskaya Yuliya Aug However she and the other serfs on the estate are still formally Anna s husband Peter Chervinsky s property Stanislav Boklan Katerina falls in love with aristocrat Olexey Kosach Aleksey Yarovenko who is unaware of her actual lineage unfortunately Katerina s life falls apart once her godmother dies and she is condemned to servitude
