Australian culture

You will probably notice some lifestyle differences between Australia and your home country. Here are some insights into Australian culture :

Australians expect everyone to be treated equally. It is customary to thank shop assistants and other service staff when they assist you.

It is important to be on time in Australia — it is polite to call if you are going to be late for an appointment.

Smoking is not permitted in restaurants, bars, nightclubs and many other public covered areas, such as train stations.

Littering is prohibited, as is drinking alcohol in a public place.
