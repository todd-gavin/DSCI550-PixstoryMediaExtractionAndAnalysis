The controversy continues over the decision by the Wimbledon organizers to exclude Russian and Belarusian tennis players. Andrey Rublev was one of the athletes who will be excluded from the English green rectangle who spoke about it. First of all, I don&#39;t know anything about politics. general because I work hard to be a tennis player and that&#39;s my job he said Yesterday some players and I had a call with Wimbledon just to talk about the situation and try to find a solution To be honest the reasons they gave for the exclusion didn&#39;t there is no sense and there is no logic in what they have proposed I could have understood if excluding the Russian and Belarusian players would have any impact but it will not help and change nothing What they are discriminating against us The players of the call have proposed to organizers of the Wimbledon tournament to donate the prize money to humanitarian aid to families and children in need I think such a move would at least really go some way and show that the British government is really on the side of peace and wants to lend a hand Depending on the results of male and female players, a figure of around a million pounds could also come out and I think it is a huge figure that in two months no other sport has donated. For the moment, no one from Wimbledon has exposed itself. Indeed, it seems that they have also asked the organizers of the Rome Internationals to make the same exclusions
