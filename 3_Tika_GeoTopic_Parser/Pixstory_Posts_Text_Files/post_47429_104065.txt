Burnley s campaign for the Premier League this season started off with great hopes all of which were dashed by the end After the club s long serving manager Sean Dyche was sacked in the interim charge was taken by three different managers Mike Jackson Ben Mee and Paul Jenkins all of whom tried to improve Burnley for the better One can say that they were partly successful since Burnley did manage to win three league games which came as a surprise to everyone as this had not happened since April But by the end their adequate enough performance had also gone down the drain and had almost left fans wondering whether sacking their former manager had actually been a smart idea After all if not for Dyche Burnley would probably only have been perceived as a community club and not a Premier League club But it s undeniable that their performance had been going awry under Dyche this season with not one win being secured by them in the opening months and some change was certainly needed to keep them from sinking under Sadly they couldn t figure out what that change should have been Burnley s style of play got found out this season and the once solid defensive team did not have an Arsenal when its go to tactic failed The team was never attacking in nature and always found goals hard to come by and when the defense was porous it spelled trouble for them Sean Dyche s sacking and Burnley s relegation mark an end of an era for the club and even the Premier League Dyche and Burnley for all their criticisms about playstyle had done an excellent job staying on the level of investment and budget they had Dyche himself was such a wonderful character to have around While frustrating opponents with their defensive organization Burnley will certainly be missed from the Premier League While cancellations and rescheduling did disrupt Burnley s campaign a lot having win in the first games is what ultimately sealed their fate
