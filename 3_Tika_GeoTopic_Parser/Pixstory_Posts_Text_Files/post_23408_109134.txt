The victim was years old at the time. in La Huth had accepted Cosby&#39;s invitation at the time already a famous actor to join him at Hefner&#39;s villa but she did not expect that the comedian who in those years starred in films with Sydney Poitier and Richard Pryor would force her into an unwanted sexual act for to which Cosby will now have to pay half a million dollars in damages Bill Cosby had already been convicted in a criminal court of sexual harassment and then released on a formality basis Huth had entered the field in but besides her the verdict in Los Angeles is satisfying to the dozens of women who over the years have told the same story about Cosby, flattered and lured into the bedroom drugged or drunk until they passed out and then assaulted Many of them at the time of the first trial could not be heard because had not come forward at the material time but in the case of Judy Huth the possibility of holding Cosby accountable was admitted because the woman in the was a minor and had sued in a civil court
