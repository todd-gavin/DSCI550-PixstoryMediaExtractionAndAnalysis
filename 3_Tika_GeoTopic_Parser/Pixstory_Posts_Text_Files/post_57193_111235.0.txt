Most of the time, people tend to avoid issues related to mental health, considering it mere and not giving it the required attention.
They think treatment would be a futile way of dealing with it and would not help the person recover.
Besides this, what pricks them more than anything is the social stigma associated with mental health; hesitating to talk about issues that torment you is a problem in most cases.
The constant avoiding and lingering in the position where the situation isn't made better anymore instead worsens.
Sometimes repercussions could be more than a usual weakening of health and can make the patient take huge steps like suicide.

What people need to understand is that as much the pain and physical injury a disease like cancer can cause, with the same amount and even larger than that a mental health issue can cause.

Symptoms or could be some signs that one should not avoid if they see in any of their family members include-
- Someone who is always worried and is intimidated easily by the situation, people who worry a lot could have an anxiety disorder.
- The constant feeling of sadness that exists longer than the normal period is an issue that needs attention. It can be a symptom of depression. People with depression could also have sleep problems.
- Certain physical symptoms can also insinuate the presence of a problem. These symptoms include headaches, stomachaches, and chronic pain (especially backaches) with no apparent cause. 
- Chronic fatigue and anxiety when the body and brain aren't able to handle the extreme overload.
- Intense mood fluctuations can also be the reason of mental distress.
