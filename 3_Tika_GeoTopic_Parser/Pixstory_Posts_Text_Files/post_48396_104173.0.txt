In almost 500 pages, the report shows the  “moral and legal wrongs the American and Californian governments have inflicted upon their Black citizens."

According to NBC News, A new report from California’s first-in-the-country statewide reparations task force details how slavery stroked nearly every aspect of Black life in America, generating many harms that are even felt today. “ 

The reports give a comprehensive look at the results of slavery and generations of discrimination against Black Californians and Black Americans. It finds that the harm to Black communities is substantial and that a variety of deliberately crafted policies, judicial decisions and racism by private actors have built an exclusion of Black people which has not been appropriately accessed.

the authors wrote in a draft reviewed by NBC News “Almost 150 years of active, conscious federal, state, and local government action and neglect of duty have resulted in compounded harms that are unique to Black Americans,” 


The report also covers the harms of decades of political negligence and sustained damage through generations of black Americans. Not to mention the impact it had on the political, economic, social, physical, mental and cultural well-being of Black people, particularly those descended from the formerly enslaved.

The nine-member task force, which a state law created in 2020, is charged with studying the impacts of enslavement on Black Californians and coming up with apparent plans for restitution.

A second report from the California task force, detailing specific reparations proposals and who should be eligible for them, is anticipated next year.
