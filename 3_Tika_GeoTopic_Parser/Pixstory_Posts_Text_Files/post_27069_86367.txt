 Trial of Chicago The Whole world is watching the whole world is watching In a year when Covid took us with surprise and cinema went to it s utter hell Trial of Chicago brought us back to normal When i first heard that Netflix is making a film with a stellar cast as this including the likes of many oscar and emmy winners I thought yet another money piece which would have no effect but I was wrong I was very wrong Trial of Chicago is the best movie of the year I know Nomadland stans must be furious reading this but quite frankly saying we ve had enough of those extreme slow burners where absolutely no event happens If we still have to go movies and not find an escape or learn something or be satisfied with the experience I don t know where this art is going I was sold at the moment I saw Eddie Redmayne in the cast but every single person stole the show in their own way The portrayals are outstanding and so is the narrative Watch out for the riot scene it is one of the best crafted scene of the last whole decade yes it s that good In conclusion Trial of Chicago is a total winner and if you are exploring Netflix original movies this is the one to look out for
