As per the Daily Mail, The Derby County manager has aspirations of managing Manchester United one day. And as per Rooney, this is the only reason why he became a manager in the first place! 

In a recent interview, Wayne Rooney stated, "The only reason why I got into management was Manchester United! I want to be a United manager. I know I am not ready now but I have to plan everything I do to make sure one day it will happen."

Wayne Rooney is currently managing Championship side Derby County. The Rams are currently at the bottom of the table with 25 points, 9 away from safety. But this is not the manager's fault! 

Derby County were deducted 21 points after the club went into administration earlier this year. Even though Rooney could have left the club after this, he decided to stay. He has since done a terrific job to give Derby a chance at survival. 

As per the report, Wayne Rooney was asked to interview for the Everton job after the sacking of Rafael Benitez. But the Englishman refused to leave the Rams midseason. Hence the Merseyside club chose Frank Lampard as their manager instead. 

With just 7 games remaining, Derby County are on the brink of relegation. Hence it is possible that Wayne Rooney could leave the club at the end of the 2021/22 season. It has to be seen where he would go if he were to leave the Rams. 






When can we see Rooney as the United manager? 


Yes, Manchester United are currently looking for a new manager. But as per Wayne Rooney, it is too soon for him to join the Red Devils. Hence we don't expect him to join United in the summer. 

Nevertheless, we believe that Wayne Rooney could take charge of Manchester United a couple of years from now. With fellow legends like Xavi, Gerrard, and Lampard becoming elite managers, we can expect the same from Rooney as well.
