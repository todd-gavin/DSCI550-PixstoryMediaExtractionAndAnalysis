I want Obama to be the mayor and I am sure many will agree with me. We have never had a President like him and I refuse to believe that we have seen the last of him. We need him in Chicago with us. 

Most people are unaware that when Barack Obama first entered politics, his ambition was to become the mayor of Chicago. In 1995, at his yearly lunch appointment with Jesse Ruiz, an old University of Chicago law school student, Obama set out a plan to follow Harold Washington's career path. He'd start by getting elected to the legislature. Then there's Congress. And eventually, City Hall. 

"Barack, Mayor Daley is going to be there forever," Ruiz said, dismissing the possibility of a U of C instructor succeeding him. Ruiz, on the other hand, decided to work for Obama's state senate campaign. That seems to be feasible. 

Chicago Mag tells us that Obama won a seat in the state legislature. His bid to capture the 1st Congressional District seat four years later was unsuccessful. Blocked from his original ambition, Obama went to the U.S. Senate and the White House instead: a respectable career, but not what heâ€™d set out to do.
