(Part 1 is the parent post)

Another thing that comes with privilege is entitlement. The "thank me I'm a nice guy", or the "we are sexist because women entertain sexism", or the "change comes slow, you have to wait". The feeling that they are entitled to gratitude, resistance or patience from us. But let me remind you, you're no toddler. You have to practice allyship without having to be constantly reminded that you're supposed to â€“ especially when women keep fighting for their rights but you bring up uneducated excuses to act like women don't want equal rights themselves. Neither are you entitled to being thanked for being a decent human being. And there's plenty of reasons why women can't just "wait" for the supposed slow change. They are dying. The only change we see coming is regressive. From taking away our reproductive rights from us to the legalization of marital rapes to being killed for wearing what we want to. "Change will come slow" is the oldest patriarchal tactic in the book to calm women down and derail the conversation. Not to mention, women are not allowed to show anger while men are defended even when they commit homicides birthing from anger. So telling women to calm down about the atrocities committed against them is grossly inappropriate.

We demand radical change. We have waited long enough.
