BJP chief JP Nadda declared today that West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar will represent the ruling NDA's candidacy for the position of Vice President of India.

The Jat community, to whom Dhankhar belongs, will receive a strong message as a result of his nomination. Although there had been significant farmer protests against the now-repealed farm rules, the Jat community in Western Uttar Pradesh had continued to support the BJP.

Since Dhankhar has been directly associated with the BJP for the past 20 years, many political analysts claim he has been "rewarded" for opposing  Banerjee in the party's favour.

Between 1989 and 1991, he served as a Janata Dal representative from Rajasthan's Jhunjhunu (Lok Sabha constituency). Additionally, he served as the President of the Rajasthan High Court Bar Association in Jaipur from 1993 to 1998 as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) representing Kishangarh, Rajasthan.

He was appointed governor of West Bengal on July 30, 2019, by President Ram Nath Kovind.  As of right now, he is the National Democratic Alliance led by the BJP's choice to serve as India's vice president in the year 2022.

The TMC-led government is currently in a political conflict with the BJP over the infamous cut money issue, which coincides with Dhankar's appointment. While Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister, challenges with the saffron party's growing dominance in the state, her ongoing dispute with incumbent Governor Tripathi is old news.

The relationship between the Raj Bhavan and Nabanna came to a standstill, notably during the most recent doctors' strike in Kolkata, as the outgoing Governor frequently sparred with Banerjee.

The governor of Bengal had earlier this month asked the elite in the country to speak out about what he called the "decimation of democratic norms" in the region.
