Is your stomach growling at the thought of National Donut Day? 

Outside of the most well-known doughnuts, there are twist doughnuts, fritters, and the widely diversified and popular filled doughnut. The Devil Dog, a chocolate-covered delicacy filled with a thick cream, is one of the most popular filled doughnuts. Glazed doughnuts packed with a variety of delectable fruits are equally popular, with raspberry being a worldwide favourite. 

There's something about that delectable deep-fried snack that makes everyone smile. National Donut Day honours this delectable food, its history, and the women who did something truly remarkable with these delectable treats during World War I.

As per NDY, this day has special significance, and this goes all the way back to the events of the First World War. There wasnâ€™t a lot for our soldiers to cheer about when they risked life and limb on a daily basis, but National Donut Day came to pass, in part, due to the efforts of a doctor in the military in the first World War who sought to brighten the day of the wounded soldiers he worked on. On his first day to the Military Base, he purchased 8 dozen doughnuts and gave one to each soldier he worked on.
