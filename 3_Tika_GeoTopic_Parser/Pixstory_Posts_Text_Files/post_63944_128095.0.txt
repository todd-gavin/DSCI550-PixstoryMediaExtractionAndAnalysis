It is no big secret that survival horror games have begun to dwindle in quality, simply lacking the charm of their elders.With a few diamonds in the rough, the whole genre seems to be like a run in the mud which seems to be a massive grind. 

Survival horror games released in the last five to seven years or so look eerily similar to each other in many aspects, copying certain aspects of the ones that came before them. From trailers to settings, all of it feels like it has been done before and they are just copying that formula. 

What makes  survival horror games so enticing and brilliant is that they use your own mind against you. An example of this is Amnesia: The Dark Descent. One of the most famous horror games of all time, you are always unsure what to do and where to look, what lies ahead or back, left or right, something evil lies in the shadows which is out to get you.  

Survival horror titles like Dead Space and Resident Evil have been famous for the fact that apart from the fact you have to use your own wit to survive, the horror aspect of these games is beyond mere jump scares. These titles make the player vulnerable, exposed, and often helpless. You have weapons and you can kill those who seek to rip your guts open, but the fact is that despite that you are the prey, hunted by a vicious predator which does not let up.

 A major problem with today’s survival horror titles is that you can find too much ammo easily while enemies are significantly weaker, a fault most likely on part of developers who feared that players will put the game down if they can’t fight back easily. This is apparent in games like the new Resident Evil games, and Dead Space 3.

To make a game truly terrifying, the game needs a strong sense of tension and uncertainty where the player is thrust into isolation. Sound design and the element of silence is in fact more vital to building fear than most realize.
