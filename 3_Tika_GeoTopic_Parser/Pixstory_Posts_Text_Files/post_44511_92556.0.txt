The result of Thursday night's sequence of events was not the result Football Club
Barcelona will have hoped for. Xavi's men travelled to Germany in search of a win, but were
held back by a resilient Frankfurt team.

Oliver Glasner's side did well to take the lead and remain in it till minute 66' before Ferran
Torres' equaliser cancelled out Ansgar Knauff's 48th minute strike. Barça kept much of the
ball, as expected. Simply put, Frankfurt didn't allow them to flourish the way they would've
wanted to. The Germans deployed an effective counter-attacking strategy which seemed to
work.

Barcelona manager Xavi Hernandez was first to laud Eintrantch Frankfurt's approach saying
“They have come out like demons on the counterattack,” he said of Frankfurt.

Forward Ferran Torres' claimed that the Walstadion surface ‘wasn’t in good condition’.
“The pitch was not in a good condition. Camp Nou has to be a pressure cooker next
Thursday. It is a difficult pitch, a complicated pitch [to play on].

 The grass was not in the best
condition, and it made it difficult for us."

The Blaugrana couldn't get into their usual rhythm against a solid Frankfurt defence. Fairly
enough, the bumpy and dry surface restricted the flow of the away team's passing game.

"I think the pitch will be better for the second leg. Today the ball did not move well. That is
another reality and it cost us. You had to do one more touch and everything slowed down.

"Well, at the Camp Nou it will be different."

Jose Mourinho's Real Madrid once famously let the grass at the Bernabéu grow doubly
longer a month before a Clásico. It goes to show how two legged ties affect the overall
outcome of a modern day European tie.
