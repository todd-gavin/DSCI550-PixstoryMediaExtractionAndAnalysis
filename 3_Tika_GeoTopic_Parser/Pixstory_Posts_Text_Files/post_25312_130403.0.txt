I know when reading Tessa Bailey books I'll get to laugh, cry, laugh some more and just swoon over her MMCs.
Fox Thornton is the handsome but wildly misunderstood playboy who thinks he has nothing to offer a woman other than his body. Hannah Bellinger sees this and decides to not let her libido dictate their relationship. She wants him to see he is so much more than a good looking man and that he is lovable. And that he was!!! The records. The lamp. The ice-cream nights. definitely was rooting for this couple throughout the whole book and even though it was a slow burn, it was so worth it in the end!ü§å
