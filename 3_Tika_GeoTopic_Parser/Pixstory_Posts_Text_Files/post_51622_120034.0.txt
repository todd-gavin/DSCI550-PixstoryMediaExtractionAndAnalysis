According to reports,

BTS is getting set to deliver a song in honour of the 2022 World Cup.

The K-pop sensations will participate in this year's FIFA World Cup celebrations as a part of Hyundai's World Cup partnership project. 

BTS will take part in the World Cup song project as the worldwide brand ambassador for Hyundai Motors.

The campaign, dubbed Goal of the Century, will promote sustainability and features football legend Steve Gerrard, Korean national team captain Park Jisung, UNESCO ambassador Nadia Nadim, fashion designer Jeremy Scott, and sculptor Lorenzo Quinn. 

The "Hyundai Goal of the Century Pledge," a giveaway event that starts on July 29 and lasts through September 30 will be introduced by the sustainability campaign's ambassadors. The 11 fortunate contestants will each receive a ticket to see the World Cup in Qatar in person.

The project's BTS song collaboration component is expected to be revealed in the second half of the year,
when the 2022 FIFA World Cup officially kicks off and runs until December 18. Fans pondered whether BTS will genuinely attend the World Cup on November 21 and whether their song will indicate that they are slated to perform at the opening ceremony after hearing the thrilling news.

BTS gave a lovely performance at the Seoul World Cup Stadium's 2020 MAMA stage two years ago. 

HOW MUCH EXCITED YOU ARE FOR THE NEW FIFA WORLD CUP ANTHEM ?
