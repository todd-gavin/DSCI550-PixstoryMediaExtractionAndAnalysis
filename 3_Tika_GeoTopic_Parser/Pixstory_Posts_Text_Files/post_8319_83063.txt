For decades the NBA s All Star Weekend has given us plenty of highs From Larry Bird lighting up the three point contest in his warm ups to Aaron Gordon and Zach LaVine seemingly resurrecting the dunk contest the good memories aren t hard to recall This year Stephen Curry gave us another unforgettable moment when he hit threes in the All Star Game But the weekend has had its fair share of duds too Six years removed from LaVine and AG the dunk contest is starting to feel tapped out again The skills challenge seems to need almost constant reinvention The league didn t just change the rules for the Rising Stars Challenge and the Skills Challenge They obliterated them moved them around threw some out brought in some more and assembled something totally new In both cases it worked for the most part Breaking the Rising Stars game into a mini bracket with four teams and target scores made the endeavor far more dramatic The opening moments of the first game to felt as casual as last year s contest but the closer teams got to that mark the more the defense kicked in Once that tone was set it stayed in place for the rest of the tournament You can certainly imagine situations where a target score wouldn t work A blowout for example but those exist in timed games too Each contest in the Rising Stars Challenge was close And whether the score is tight or not every game with a target score ends with a game winner Based on how well this has worked since the league introduced it to the All Star Game one has to wonder how or when it might be implemented outside All Star Weekend Adding the Elam Ending to regular season games feels like too drastic a move But if Adam Silver gets the midseason tournament he s after why not try it there Maybe test it out in the play in tournament The change has helped the All Star Game and now the Rising Stars Challenge Eliminating late game fouling contests at other points on the NBA calendar could be worthwhile
