Had the pleasure of taking a tour of the Taj Mahal with dwighthoward . The sight of it as you enter through the gate is mesmerising. Afterwards a quick visit to the Agra fort. 

I absolutely adore the Taj Mahal, and for that matter every one of the old temples/buildings. They are so beautiful and breathtaking in every sense.

I've not been to a lot of places, but the details on the architecture is superb. Hampi was one of my best travelling experiences, just because of the beautiful architecture I was able to experience.

We have the architecture from all the major religions in the world and each one of them tells a story.

Dwight kept getting mobbed and obliged by basketball fans for a chance to click a picture with, many chanting superman seeing him, which brought a huge smile to Dwightâ€™s face every time! A unique experience for everyone!
