Despite wars and natural disasters, much of Japan’s rich tradition has been kept (or restored), which makes a trip to Japan an unforgettable experience. A trip to the country is undoubtedly a fantastic use of time and money because of the country's seemingly unending list of top attractions, enjoyable activities, and interesting places to see.
Here are some of the top-rated tourist attractions in the nation! 
Mount - Fuji : 
The tallest mountain peak in the nation, towering 3,776 meters over an otherwise mainly flat landscape to the south and east, is tall enough to be visible from Tokyo, more than 100 kilometers distant.
Imperial Palace : 
A must-see when traveling to the nation's capital is the Imperial Palace, the most well-known monument in Tokyo, which features stunning 17th-century parks encircled by walls and moats.
Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park : 
Commemorating the many victims of the world's first nuclear attack, Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park lies at the epicenter of the atomic blast, in August 1945, in what was once a bustling part of the city. 
The Island Shrine of Itsukushima, Miyajima : 
The 30-square-kilometer island of Miyajima, known around the globe as Japan's Shrine Island, is located in Hiroshima Bay and is only a short ferry trip from the mainland of Hiroshima. The Itsukushima Shrine, a Shinto temple honoring the Princess daughters of the wind god Susanoo, is the most well-known landmark on Miyajima.
Osaka Castle : 
Osaka Castle (Ōsaka-jō), was the largest and most significant castle in the nation when it was constructed in 1586 by renowned Japanese warrior and politician Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Despite it having been repeatedly demolished and rebuilt since then, the current building, constructed in 1931, remains true to the original.
