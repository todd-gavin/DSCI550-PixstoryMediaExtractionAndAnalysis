Chelsea have agreed a £47.5million fee with Manchester City to sign forward Raheem Sterling.

The 27-year-old is expected to undergo a medical in the next few days, with Chelsea hopeful Chelsea a deal will be completed in time to allow the England forward to join the club's pre-season tour in the United States.

Sterling has remained Chelsea's top target this summer, even though the Blues were strongly linked with Leeds forward Raphinha and his fellow Brazilian Richarlison.

Sterling has agreed personal terms on a five-year contract with the option of a further 12 months.
