An experiment in Dyarchy and it's failure continues....

When I left the State, he was busy recapturing 
Jhangar. He wrote to me: 

“I was very disappointed not to be able to say good bye to you when you left Jammu as I was at that time in Noshehra trying to recapture Jhangar. The weather was against us, otherwise we would have inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy and would have got a very nice bag. I think the enemy knew what we were going to do and they pulled out of the valley. 

It was disgusting to see a beautiful place like Rajori burnt and hundreds of our nationals massacred and burried in pits just outside the town. I should like to thank you for all your kindness while you were Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir.” 

I must record and pay my tribute to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the Prime Minister of India. 

He was always very kind and courteous to me and gave me his full support. If he was some time too quick to take umbrage he was as easily appeased when he was fully informed. Nothing became him more than his manner of making amends. Panditji has a heart of gold and is a great leader of men. He is, however, an easy prey to the guiles of some of those in whom he places trust. When he assumed office he had not much experience of administration, and at first proved a poor judge of men sometimes. But he is a great statesman and the position that India has attained to-day is due to his sagacity and wisdom.
