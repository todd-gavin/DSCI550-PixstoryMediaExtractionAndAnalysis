It is still so stigmatized in our world for men to talk about their feelings or events that happened in their lives that cause them distress

"Boys don't cry"
"Don't be a sissy"
"Man up"
"You're so soft"

Boys are told these things from an early age and they are carried into adulthood. They're feelings are not validated and told to shut down so men never learn how to express
their feelings in a healthy way. They are told they are only â€œallowed" to show anger because it's the only emotion that is socially acceptable.

So we have grown men walking around with so many pent up emotions. They don't talk about traumas they experienced. Instead they suffer in silence. Many of them hold it all in, until the break.

This needs to change.

We need to create space for men to be more open. This starts in childhood. We need to teach our boys that it is okay to cry, that it is okay to talk about the hard stuff. That
it's okay to be human.
