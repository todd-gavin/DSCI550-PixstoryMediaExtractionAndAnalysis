The whistle blew, play stopped, and Giannis Antetokounmpo strolled off victorious with more than half a quarter left to play.

In what we all expected to be a hotly contested Kia MVP Ladder matchup on Thursday between Antetokounmpo and Stephen Curry, Milwaukee thumped Golden State 118-99 in a wire-to-wire beatdown more lopsided than the final score would indicate. Antetokounmpo simply ran roughshod through the Warriors, churning out 30 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists in producing his 28th career triple-double (and third of the season) to tie Michael Jordan for 18th all-time.

The performance keeps Antetokounmpo at the top of this week’s edition of the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder, while the slumping Curry falls out of the top five.

“We’ve got to keep getting better. We’ve got to keep building good habits. We’ve got to keep going out there and having fun,” Antetokounmpo told TNT in his postgame interview. “Obviously, we know that we’re the defending champs. Everybody’s gonna come play hard against us. But at the end of the day, it’s about us.”

In focusing solely on self, Milwaukee forced 11 first half turnovers on the way to zipping out to a 77-38 halftime lead on the strength of Antetokounmpo’s 23 points on 9-for-12 shooting. Golden State’s 39-point halftime deficit was the most it had trailed at intermission since the 1962-63 season, when it relocated to California.

The Bucks outscored the Warriors 14-2 in points off turnovers in the first half. Over the opening halves of Golden State’s last two outings, opponents have now outscored the Warriors 34-2 in points off turnovers.

Curry, meanwhile, entered the game averaging 26.8 points, but has produced fewer than 15 points in three of his last five games.

Andrew Wiggins led Golden State in scoring (16 points) Thursday with Curry chipping in 12 points.
