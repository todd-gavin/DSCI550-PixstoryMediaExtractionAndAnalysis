Imran Khan Pakistan s now former prime minister blamed the United States for his political demise as he tried to keep his job in the face of rising criticism this month AlJazeera reported that Khan claimed that Washington was working with Pakistan s political opposition to depose him claiming that US President Joe Biden s administration was unhappy with his independent foreign policy approach and a visit to Moscow that coincided with Russia s invasion of Ukraine This narrative is not novel It is a well rehearsed one in Pakistani public discourse Ayesha Jalal a history professor at Tufts University in the US told Al Jazeera It s the kind of claim you make when you re in trouble domestically We call it seeing your troubles as gifts from abroad While experts think Khan s claims of a foreign plot against him are unfounded and primarily political they do underline long standing problems in the US Pakistan relationship which Shehbaz Sharif Khan s successor will have to address I m sure the new prime minister and his staff and the military top brass will be very keen to repair relations said Jalal referring to the effect of Khan s allegations I think that would be very much on top of the agenda
