Belgium football is arguably the best football side in the world right now. They are ranked at the top in the world rankings and have truly earned the title of the 'Golden Generation’. The team has never looked in such great shape and form, filled with extremely talented players who could demolish any opposition in the world. 

However, even after being at the top of the rankings for nearly two years now, the Belgium team hasn’t been able to get its hands on major trophies. The Belgium side made it to the Semi-finals of the Fifa world cup 2018 and the Quarter-finals of the Euro 2020, at both stages they were defeated by sides who went on to win the titles. Still, the Belgium side has great potential and have a great chance to get their hands on the Fifa world cup 2022 trophy. Here are the top 5 Belgian football players to watch out for. 

#5. Yannick Carrasco

Yannick Carrasco has made one of the most compelling comebacks after making a baffling decision of moving to the Chinese Super League club Dalian Professional in 2018. He was at the peak of his career and made an unprofessional decision that cost him two years. However, he returned back to his old franchise Atletico Madrid and started to prove his metal in La Liga. He showed that he hasn’t lost the flair and scored 7 goals and 11 assists in the 2020-21 season. 


#4. Youri Tielemans

Youri Tielemans while playing for Leicester City has been one of the best midfielders in the Premier League. His magnificent performances are also making him a great prospect for Belgium. After starting his career in a holding role, Anderlecht manager Besnik Hasi changed his game by assigning him to a more advanced position. In the 2020-21 season, he has scored 9 goals and 6 assists.
