Want to be seen drinking beer in public in Qatar? Sound unthinkable? Well, do it after a World Cup match in November-December and chances of your getting arrested are relatively lesser. According to an announcement by the FIFA, fans will be able to buy alcoholic beer in stadiums and fan zones at the World Cup.
However, the beer lovers will have no choice – they will have to buy and drink only one single brand, one of the sponsors of FIFA. According to reports, a policy has been finalised by the organisers of the event in the Muslim-majority nation so fans can buy Budweiser beer with alcohol before and after games within the eight stadium compounds, though not at concourse concession stand, and during the evenings at official “Fan Festival”, held at Doha Park. Budweiser is the exclusive beer of the World Cup and has been since the 1986 edition, with parent company AB InBev renewing a deal to remain until 2022 in 2011.
According to FIFA, alcohol will be sold “within the stadium perimeter prior to kick-off and after the final whistle. Inside the stadium bowl ticket holders will have access to non-alcoholic Budweiser Zero,” FIFA said in a statement. “At the FIFA Fan Festival, Budweiser will be available to purchase from 6.30 pm,” the statement further said. Consumption of alcohol in public is prohibited in Qatar. However, it is sold in hotels and bars with licenses.
Another report said beer stands would open in zones around stadiums when gates open for a match and close 30 minutes before each game starts. The stands would reopen for a short time after the game. FIFA did not confirm times but a spokesperson said it had focused on “catering for those who wish to enjoy an alcoholic drink while being respectful towards the local culture”.
