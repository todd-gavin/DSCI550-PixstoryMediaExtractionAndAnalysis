In a match, that people were literally not looking forward to, Novak Djokovic defeated Nick Kyrgios to win the 4th consecutive Wimbledon title. 

Novak beat Kyrgios in an unevenly matched competition, as the 20 time grand slam winner was facing a first time grand slam finalist. Novak was dominant throughout and made no errors, and left Federer in the dust as he went past him to win his 21st grandslam, as he chases Nadal at 22 grandslams. 

Nadal had to quit the tournament due to an abdominal injury, otherwise he surely would've won the grand slam!
