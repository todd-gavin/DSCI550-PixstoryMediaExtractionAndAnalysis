Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka has won the England Men’s Player of the Year award for the 2021/22 season. The English winger beat the likes of Tottenham striker Harry Kane and West Ham’s midfielder Declan Rice to clinch the exalted price for the first time. The 20-year-old sensation had an incredible spell for the England national team last season playing a pivotal role in their runner-up success at the Euro 2020 last summer. He has also grown to be an integral part of manager Gareth Southgate setup owing to his consistent form for club and country that has earned him a regular call up to the Three Lions and also a place in Arsenal’s starting XI. Speaking after receiving the award, the Gunners winger showed his surprise and was grateful for the honour the award rewarded him with. “No way I did not expect this honestly, so yeah, I’m honoured. It’s really nice.” England will look to secure a win over Italy in Milan tonight as they seek to turnaround their poor run of form in the UEFA Nations League in a bid to leapfrog the relegation zone.
