The French star team, Paris Saint Germain have ended their campaign with a Ligue 1 title and a
place in the quarterfinals of the UEFA Champions League. The team had appointed Mauricio
Pochettino as the gaffer for the team and expected him to win all the trophies that were at his
disposal.

However, things didn't go as planned. They were shocked by Nice in the Coupe de France and
Real Madrid staged one of the biggest comebacks in the UEFA Champions League.

They had a
two-goal lead only to be surpassed by the Los Blancos in the quarterfinals of the continental
tournament.

However, their Ligue 1 quest went as they wanted. Paris St Germain had lost the throne to Lille
in the previous term but were able to conquer it back with ease. The French capital outfit was
able to garner 86 points from 38 games and ended the season on a high with two back-to-back
wins. The team was also able to score 90 goals and conceded just 36 throughout the season.

The team registered their biggest win of the campaign against Metz on the final day of the
season. They maintained a clean sheet while pinning five past the relegation battling side.

Player of the Season: Kylian Mbappe

It has to be this French young star. After breaking it to the side at the early age of 18, Kylian
Mbappe has grown beyond the bounds of the Ligue 1 club.

When the other stars found it tough
to score the goals, Kylian Mbappe took the league and other competitions by storm. In the entire
season, the player scored 39 goals and 22 assists across all competitions. In the French
league, the player went on to score 28 goals and had 18 assists to his name. These numbers
were possible due to his sheer pace and goal-scoring abilities.
