As speculations ramp up for Mbappe’s move to Real Madrid, the French attacker and his Brazilian colleague were seen with the England legend, David Beckham. 

Kylian Mbappe has been spotted posing for pictures with Paris Saint Germain teammate Neymar and former English player David Beckham in Qatar, as France forward’s a decision on his future draws near. 

The attacker is in the Gulf state with the Ligue 1 outfit of their end of season schedule, despite speculation that his days with the Parc des Princes outfit are numbered ahead of a switch to Real Madrid. 

Nevertheless, Mbappe- who revealed his future would be announced before he begins France duty next month- was all smiles with Neymar, another PSG player linked with a move, and England legend Beckham, himself a former Blancos star. 


What was the picture of Mbappe?

In a post on Instagram on Tuesday, the striker showed a snap of him, Neymar and Beckham smiling together in the nation’s capital Doha.

A secondary shot showed him, Beckham and team-mate Acharaf Hakimi laughing together in a stadium. Mbappe did not elaborate in his comments on the pictures, merely including the nation’s flag of Qatar alongside PSG’s red and blue colours. 


When will Mbappe announce his future?

The story of Mbappe’s next step has been the highest transfer saga of the season after PSG refused to sell him to Madrid last term heading into the final year of his contract.

The forward now looks set to depart from Parc des Princes and move to Santiago Bernabeu, with terms reportedly agreed between player and club. 

Liverpool has also kept tabs on him, with a last-gap newed offer PSG themselves looks to have fallen short.
