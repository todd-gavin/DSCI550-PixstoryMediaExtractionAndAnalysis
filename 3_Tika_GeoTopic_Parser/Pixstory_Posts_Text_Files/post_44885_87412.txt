Manchester United is open to all redevelopment plans for their Old Trafford stadium including proposals to totally rebuild the stadium on the same site Plans to bulldoze their current home ground and replace it with a modern new version are said to be premature but they are not ruling anything out as they investigate all options The club has yet to hire a developer but companies bidding for the contract have begun to present a variety of possibilities and club executives are maintaining an open mind at this moment What do we know so far The team aims to modernise the stadium in order to give supporters a better matchday experience The year old stadium requires more than a fresh coat of paint to bring it up to the level of other Premier League venues Over the years the focus has been on increasing the capacity of the South Stand but there are a variety of options on the table as they seek to improve the current venue including demolish the current stadium and construct a new one from the ground up At this time that appears to be the least likely alternative as they would prefer to complete the work in such a way that the team could continue to play their home games at the stadium but all options will be evaluated It is understood that they intend to stay at the same location No firm decision will be made until a master planner is hired and the club has stated that they will involve supporters throughout the process Collette Roche chief operating officer gave an update to the Fans Forum late last month She said Turning to stadium development since our last meeting we have been assessing the capabilities of globally leading consultants who want to help us develop a masterplan for the modernisation of Old Trafford with the ultimate aim of improving the matchday experience for fans
