We all have experienced the feeling of restlessness and being bored by something. Boredom is a universal experience.
But what could be the reasons for chronic boredom?
Chronic boredom, also known as ennui, involves being stuck to feelings of weariness, dissatisfaction and apathy. The sense of lethargy can be either general or related to any specific domain of your life, like work, studies, or hobbies.

Ennui could be an exhausting mental state, so it becomes essential to comprehend its meaning. 

Reinhard Clifford Kuhn, in his book The Demon of Noontide: Ennui in Western Literature, wrote,  "In the state of ennui, the world is emptied of its significance. Everything is seen as if filtered through a screen; what is filtered out and lost is precisely the element that gives meaning to existence. Music is no longer an aesthetic world of sound but a series of notes. Instead of a painting, one sees only a conglomeration of meaningless colours on a canvas; a book becomes a series of words, one strung after the other. It is a sensation very similar to that of watching a television program with the sound turned off."

These words in the above paragraph very well explain the futility one feels when they're the victims of ennui, the constant state of finding everything meaningless because all of it has lost its value.

Besides all, the most important thing to understand is the difference between ennui and boredom; people often use it together with the same context. Still, boredom is a short-term feeling, while ennui is chronic.
It doesn't matter how mere or trivial it seems to discuss ennui; the discussion and understanding are necessary to help the person overcome it, as it can even lead to depression.
