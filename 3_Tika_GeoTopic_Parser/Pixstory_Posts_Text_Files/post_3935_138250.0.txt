Teacher's Day, a rose in the hands of a teacher instead of a book 
Teachers day, a day in my memory where all my seniors used to dress up in Sarees and become a teacher for the day. Right from the supervisor to the teacher it's our seniors and it is truly a nostalgic moment for me. 
Teachers day is that day when we give cards, flowers, Greetings to our teachers and that moment of happiness is seen in their eyes and face. Now all of these have turned into messages, but with the same warmth. 
Thanking all the teachers who have been a life teacher, each and every teacher have taught us some lessons and it's not just the teachers in the school, but everyone who have been with us and have taught us right from the scratch like our parents, siblings and our support system. 
Thanking all my life teachers and wishing each one of you happy teachers day.
