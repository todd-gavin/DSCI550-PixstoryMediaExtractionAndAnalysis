After the fashion show at the Caff Paszkowski in Florence in January this year, the Chiara Boni brand La petite robe returns to the New York catwalks where it has already shown in the past to present the spring summer collection The show will be held in September at The Gallery at Spring Studios It is no coincidence that the designer continues the discourse begun years ago on the American market because this market can count on a strong and consolidated clientele since in fact she has obtained acclaim and visibility in the major Department Stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus where she is present with dedicated corners and a wide selection of garments, some of which are made exclusively New York has always welcomed us with open arms and the return to the Big Apple seemed completely natural to us after these years of pandemic says the designer The American market constantly stimulates me to new challenges My collections have become a must for my clients so much so that I have successfully expanded the range of proposals with beachwear but above all with an ever-widening selection of separates jackets tops trousers and skirts
