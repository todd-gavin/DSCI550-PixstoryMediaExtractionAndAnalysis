Because of his mentality, the goalkeeper believes the Brazilian midfielder did not reach his full ability.

Anderson, a former Manchester United midfielder, has the potential to be the best player in the world, according to Ben Foster. During his career with Manchester United, the Brazilian won four Premier League titles and the Champions League. Due to his uneven performances and injury issues, Anderson was in and out of the squad at times.

What's been said so far?
Foster, on the other hand, believes that the ex-Gremio and Porto star could have reached the top if he had put in more effort.
"He could have been the best player in the world at one point, I promise you he could have," the ex-United goalkeeper told the UTD Podcast.

"Everybody would say that he could have been the best in the world at one point.
"But he just didn't care, he didn't care about anything. Honestly, he didn't care about anything [laughs]. But you put him on a pitch and he was like that. 

"Carlos Tevez was the same sort of thing. Put him on the pitch and oh my god. There has got to be something in being South American, there's got to be something in that."
Anderson appeared in how many games for United?
Overall, the Brazil international played 181 times for the club. In his first season with the club after signing from Portugal in 2007, he appeared in 24 Premier League games.

However, a cruciate ligament tear and knee and ankle problems kept him out for extended periods in the following years, and he never surpassed that number. Anderson was loaned to Fiorentina in January 2014, then returned to his homeland in February 2015 to join Internacional. He then went on loan to Coritiba before concluding his career with Adana Demirspor in Turkey.
