Like Kafka's world characters,  we continue to struggle against the forces by using our equipment to achieve our dreams. 
Kafka defines a maze without an exit where the common man is perpetually struggling to find justice but gives up because of the totalitarian rule and grotesque bureaucracy.

The situation is prevalent in today's world, where people struggle to find a way to exit the labyrinth created by the government and bureaucrats.
The search for justice is so relevant to today's time because even the lawmakers could not prohibit the wrong; it is all a delusion.
Like Kafka's The Castle, the government has kept itself distant from the people it should serve.

The one who suffers the most is the level of society, the common people for whom the law is inaccessible. Money gives you the power to break the rules.
The laws are enforced to violate people's fundamental rights instead of protecting them.
Gun laws in America can be one such example. Yet, as it has become one of the biggest threats to human lives, the government still could not take measures.

Even overturning Roe v Wade could be another such violation of the fundamental rights of humans. Law is merely an ideal, in both Kafka's and our world. What lies within it is profound darkness that is often ignored and portrayed as not deceiving the innocent. Law, for what it should do is to unite people but what it does is divide them for their identity, gender and race.

We can all know that Kafka's world was brutal, dark, hopeless and bizarre. 
And unfortunately, these absurdities exist in today's world.
