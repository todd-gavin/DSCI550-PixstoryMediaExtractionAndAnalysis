We must always remain united. your disposal for anything I will not give up an inch in this room and you must do the same in training away at Dall Ara We come from difficult results but the performances have always been there In Milan there will be thousands but we go we play as we know I won&#39;t be there physically but mentally I&#39;ll be there with you I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll fight for me even on the pitch These are things we&#39;ve already experienced once unfortunately But we&#39;ll win again on this occasion
