After drawing the match against Lens by a scoreline of Paris Saint Germain PSG wins the Ligue league title but as a football fan I am not surprised at all because after bringing superstars like Sergio Ramos Lionel Messi Achraf Hakimi and Gianluigi Donnarumma in last summer transfer window Nasser Al Khelaifi s President of PSG main target was to win the UEFA Champions League and that dream got shattered when Real Madrid beat them in Round of Winning the Ligue title was never the topmost priority for the PSG s board and Mauricio Pochettino Manager because they already knew that team of this quality will never fail to win the league After all the quality of playing of the remaining teams in the league is very low as compared to PSG Even before the start of the UEFA Champions League PSG were the favorites to win the UCL because in the last two seasons PSG were the finalists in and semi finalists in the season but because of a lack of team bonding and I don t know why Manager was more reliable on individual brilliance and never worked on team performance The match against Real Madrid where PSG got knocked out was the perfect example of team performance where Real Madrid played like a team till the end and won the match and on the other hand PSG had no clue on how to be compact and play as a team even when they are leading the match But whatever is said and done dominating the league throughout the season is no joke and congratulations to all the players of PSG for winning the title especially Sergio Ramos my favorite footballer and I hope he plays well next season for PSG and helps them to win more titles
