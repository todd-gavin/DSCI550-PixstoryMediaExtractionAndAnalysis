It s been a while since I had visited a beach and the experience of visiting the beach after a very long time was blissful Beach visits have always given me comfort and moments where I can forget about my tensions and relax down Within years of visiting the beach a mood of happiness have been associated with it and it always enlightens me even while I approach the beach when I m low With the beautiful natural colours around me and the pleasant sound of the waves it s just too hard to come back from the waters Visiting a beach at various times of the day also contribute to the way I feel about the experience of visiting the beach As in the day time might be more of a sunny and ice cream combos which go pretty well Whereas if it is in the evening it s more of a chai samosa time with the perfect time to watch a sunset along with the waves
