What can you do to stop this horror against children in Afghanistan? 
They choices ahead of an Afghan child: 
They are brainwashed and violated at fanatic religious schools and turned into killers
They are targeted at schools by fanatic groups, if it happens to belong to Hazara community, as happened two days ago 
They have to work or beg on the streets and suffer all his life due to violence and unbearable stresses from a young age.
