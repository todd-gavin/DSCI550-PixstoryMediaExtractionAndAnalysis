Concerns about the future of Players.
Apart from organising tournaments the Government should increase the Sports Quota for sports like Table Tennis as only then parents will let their children play the sport regularly at a higher level by knowing that their is a future within the sport for them. My present goal is that the National team of our State should comprise solely the kids that come from our academy. Presently 75% of the National Teams of my State in every category are players from my academy. I know that this will be tough to achieve but with the players and myself working harder every day, it is a possibility.
The question of security of the future is what makes mant players leave this sport. As even after giving 5-6 years to the sport they might get nothing, some just play Nationals to get into a good college and then leave the sport as their isn't a proper system which will provide them the means to sustain themselves. So that is why the Government needs to have certain schemes to help these kids and let them follow their passion.
