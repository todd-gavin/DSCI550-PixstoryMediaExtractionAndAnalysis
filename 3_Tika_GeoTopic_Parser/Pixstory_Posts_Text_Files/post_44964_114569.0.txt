Olivier Giroud, a former forward for Chelsea and Arsenal, has said that due to a lack of playing time at Stamford Bridge, he nearly threatened to leave for Tottenham.

Since joining Milan, whom he helped lead to Serie A championship victory last season, the 
France attacker has discovered a new lease on life in the top division.

The veteran attacker is now disclosing that he recommended to the Chelsea manager Frank 
Lamaprd that he would rather try for a swap to Spurs, who are fierce rivals of both the Blues as 
well as the Gunners with whom they communicate the north London derby. However, it took some imaginative inspiration from the forward to get his move.

In a news conference this week, Giroud said, "At the time, I wasn't receiving consistent playing 
time at Chelsea; I was the third-choice striker, so I attempted to figure out a solution with Frank Lampard." "I couldn't stay there any longer. Lampard informed me that he required a replacement when I tried to leave.

"He told me that I had more chances, and he gave me the chance to take them. I believe I 
scored goals in the season's final 10 games.
Italian clubs at the time were particularly 
interested.

At the conclusion of the 2020–21 season, Thomas Tuchel's team won the Champions League, and Giroud was an unused replacement. In July of last year, Giroud signed a two-year contract to join Milan.

He quickly paid back Stefano Pioli's team's trust in him by amassing 38 games in all competitions with 14 goals scored, which was his finest performance since the 2016–17 season he played at Arsenal.

That increased the World Cup champion's chances of being selected for France's team for their title defense at Qatar 2022. Later this year, He already won the Ligue 1 title with Montpellier ten years earlier.
