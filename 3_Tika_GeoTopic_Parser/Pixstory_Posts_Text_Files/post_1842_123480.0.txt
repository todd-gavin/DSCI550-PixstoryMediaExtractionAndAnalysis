WW II still seems to threaten mankind.

An unexploded World War Two bomb submerged in an Italian river has been revealed due to an extreme drought.

The 450kg (1,000lb) bomb was found by fishermen on the banks of the depleted River Po in Italy. Large sections of the 650km (400 mile) river have dried up in Italy's worst drought for 70 years.

The unexploded device, which Italian military officials said contained 240kg (530lb) of explosive, was discovered near the Lombardy village of Borgo Virgilio in July.
