My Journey in football began in the early s at the age of I started playing football just to be away from my classes It just started naturally to bunk my classes sports was a way that I could skip my classes We could play football in our school and I joined it and I had never thought that it would become my career It never struck my mind that the goals I scored and prevented in my school would make my career During that time there wasn t a proper football setup so there were no age groups I remember scouts from the Football association came up to the school games and grounds where football was played to select players for the Nationals As there weren t any age groups a person just had to be a good player to play in the team sub juniors juniors and seniors all used to play together All of us used to train together which helped me a lot at the earlier stages of my career as I could learn from my seniors We were like family as even the children of coaches used to play so everyone was very close to each other The training methods back then were very different there was more focus on passing and running rather than the team tactics We were really motivated and enthusiastic if the coach would tell us to come to the ground at A M we would be there by A M I believe that this commitment is missing these days among the players I used to play as a left wing back I was a very aggressive defender I also did come up to help the attackers in the attack and pick up the ball from the midfield to take it forward
