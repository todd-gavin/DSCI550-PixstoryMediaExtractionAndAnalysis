Top Gun: Maverick, directed by Joseph Kosinski, shows no signs of stopping down. 

In its second weekend, Tom Cruise's Paramount and Skydance tentpole is performing quite well. Hollywood Reporter said that If projections hold true, the sequel will earn $85 million or more in its second appearance, marking the smallest drop ever — 33 percent — for a film opening to $100 million in the United States. 

In North America, the summer tentpole grossed $25 million on Friday, bringing the total to $230 million for the day. By the end of Sunday, that figure should have risen to $290 million, with a global total of $540 million. Top Gun 2 is also performing well worldwide, having crossed the $200 million mark on Friday and is still going strong.

On Saturday, Top Gun: Maverick became Cruise’s top-grossing film domestically when passing up 2005’s The War of the Worlds ($243.3 million), not adjusted for inflation. That’s after zooming past the first Top Gun ($180.3 million) and Cruise’s Mission: Impossible films, including the last installment, Mission: Impossible — Fallout ($220.2 million).
