Sylvia Plath is one of my favourite poets of all times According to me her poetry is an essential catalyst if one wants to explore the theme of feminism and mental health If you read her poetry carefully you will realise that she was struggling with her mental health for a long time Ultimately she even took her own life Her poetry tells us how the mental health of women was never taken seriously in her time In Lady Lazarus she talks about how doctors wrote off her illness and she was even held in hospital against her will Women mental concerns were written off as hysteria in those times they were termed as madwomen In addition to this her poetry also explores the feminist themes All her life Plath struggled to establish herself as a female poet However she was always overshadowed by her patriarchal father and later her husband She addresses these concerns in her poem Daddy Plath is an epitome of fighting spirit and an inspiration to women poets around the world Even when the writing world was dominated by men she crafted a space for herself with her unique writing style It is unfortunate how her life ended but her poems remind us that how far we have come as women and how far we still have yet to go
