Juventus’ decision to push for Arkadiusz Milik might eventually help them sign another target – Leandro Paredes.
The Bianconeri are still not done yet with their moves in the transfer market as they want at least two more signings. Juventus are eyeing another striker and one more midfielder to bolster their squad.
Up front, the players they are considering are  Memphis Depay or Arkadiusz Milik. Meanwhile, for the midfield, the Old Lady only have an eye for PSG midfielder, Leandro Paredes.
However, according to Calciomercato.com(via ilbianconero.com), Juve’s choice for a new striker might affect their ability to sign Paredes.
Following the Old Lady’s failure to sell Adrien Rabiot, it’s financially difficult for them to move for Paredes.
That’s why it’s important for them to get the best deal possible for the forward position so they can still sign the Argentinian international. For that reason, it’s more likely for Juventus to push for Milik instead of Depay.
