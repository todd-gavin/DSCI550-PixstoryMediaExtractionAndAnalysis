Microplastics detected in human breast milk for first time, scientists startled🧐:-
For the first time, scientists have found microplastics in breast milk, raising concerns over potential health risks for infants.😥
🎗️Microplastics, as the name implies, are tiny plastic particles which are less than five millimetres (0.2 inches) in diametre-smaller than the standard pearl used in jewellery.
🎗️They cause pollution by entering ecosystems from a variety of sources like cosmetics, clothing, food packaging, and industrial processes.
🎗️Though first discovered in 2004, microplastics have permeated everywhere-in deep oceans; Arctic snow and Antarctic ice; in shellfish, table salt, drinking water. These tiny pieces could take decades or more to degrade fully.
🎗️However, the discovery of these tiny particles in breast milk has started scientists.
🎗️According to the Guardian, microplastics were found in the breast milk samples taken from 34 healthy mothers, a week after giving birth in Rome, Italy. The scientists detected microplastics in 75 per cent of them.
