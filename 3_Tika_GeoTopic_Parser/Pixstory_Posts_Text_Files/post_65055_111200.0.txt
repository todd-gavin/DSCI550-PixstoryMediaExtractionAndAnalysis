Sankri village which is far away enough from from any town so there is very little to no light pollution that gets in the way of this view! I hope to get another crack at it at the top, but it was even more overcast with snowfall later. Kedarnath in one of my favourite traks. For the first time in my life, I managed to witness this magic, loved every bit of it. 

Have you been here?
