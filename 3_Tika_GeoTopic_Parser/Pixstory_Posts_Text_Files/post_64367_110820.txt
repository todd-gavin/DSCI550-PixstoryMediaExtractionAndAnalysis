In simple terms the Pink tax is the gender based pricing I e women paying more for the commodities in the market that are specifically marketed for them Of all the other industries examined the premium for women was the largest in the personal care sector The biggest price difference was in hair care products where women pay almost fifty percent more than men did Women do not have to pay the pink tax as such The additional fee that is incorporated into the product s retail price has been labelled as pink tax For the same goods there is a price difference between men and women While visiting the shop I observed how a men s razor cost rupees while a women s razor cost rupees Similarly the most affordable ml deodorant for men costs rupees while the price of an essential women s deodorant in the same quantity site starts at rupees Women are the disadvantaged group they work more but are paid less On one hand we are paying less yet we are charging them more for almost similar products that are sold to men The gender gap is further widened and a certain idea of beauty is reinforced when expensive products marketed toward women are mandated People s mental health might be harmed by not adhering to such aesthetic standards making them more prone to developing a social anxiety disorder despair and loneliness Additionally the division is made wider by the identification of colours with genders The idea that blue is associated with boys and pink with girls restricts the options available to the two genders and forces them to conform to social norms while also marginalising other genders There is an urgent need for women to speak up against issues that affect them and discriminate against them The level playing field for men and women would ultimately improve if women were encouraged to participate and voice their opinions Image source Grazia
