I have never seen anything like this. 

Yesterday India stamped its authority in wrestling and how!

First came Bajrang Punia, growling and snapping like a wild boar. Lachlan McNeil of Canada faced him, in freestyle 65 kg final. 

Bajrang Punia never gave him a chance. Twice he caught hold of the poor Canadian, and shoved him aside, so forcefully that the Canadian appeared dazed. 

Bout over in about 6 minutes. 9-2 to Bajrang Punia. 

And even before you could say "Waah Bajrangi Bhaijaan", came in Sakshi Malik. 

Sakshi Malik was also hissing like a viper. Again there was a Canadian up against her - Ana Godinez Gonzalez. The Canadian lady scored the first points. 0-2. And then it become 0-4. 

But then Sakshi moved and caught hold of the Canadian. A takedown to make it 2-4, chained into another to make it 4-4. Then the piece de resistance: With the two still grappling on the floor, Sakshi twisted this way and that, before leaning forward and pinning Gonzalez's shoulders to the floor. 

A fall. Match over. Sakshi Malik, Commonwealth Games gold medalist.

Two Golds won, without much sweat. As a viewer, you felt dazed. What is happening? Is it really that simple to win a gold? 

Then comes Deepak Punia. His opponent is the defending champion - Muhammad Inam of Pakistan. 

By this time, Indian women's team is playing Australia. And by the time the game finishes, I get to know that Deepak Punia has won his bout as well and secured the third Gold of the night. 

Had these three bouts happened one after the other, it would have fetched us three golds in less than 15 minutes. 

For good measure, we won one silver and two bronze medals as well in wrestling last night. Three golds. One silver. Two bronzes. 

What a night, rather midnight yesterday was! What an honour for the 75th year of our Independence!
