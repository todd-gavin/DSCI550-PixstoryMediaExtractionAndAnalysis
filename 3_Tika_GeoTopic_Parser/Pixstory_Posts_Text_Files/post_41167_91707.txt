I agree when you read it you are surprised that a whole day to dedicated to partying It may sound childish or even superficial The younger generation these days is called the generation of lazy people who just need another excuse for partying and be unproductive members of society But is this the case No We are surrounded by war pandemic poverty unemployment etc Everyday is a struggle for most people and they don t even get a chance to relax breathe and live in the moment In this scenario having a day dedicated to partying is a great idea according to me This day however was not merely founded because we all enjoy a good party It was in fact inspired by a book Flight A Quantum Fiction is a novel written by Vanna Borita The book was published in and the ending features a countdown until April rd when a synchronised celebration will take place all around the world Following the publication of the book the concept of World Party Day soon gained traction with the first event taking place in The special thing about this day is that it is not limited to a religion or a country It has no political connotations and everyone over the world can celebrate it Moreover there is also no fixed definition of how you should party on World Party Day You may go out for drinks with your friends or you can wear your pajamas and watch Netflix and order a pizza That is a party too This World Party Day is all the more special because it falls on a Sunday So before Monday comes back to haunt us lay back and party hard
