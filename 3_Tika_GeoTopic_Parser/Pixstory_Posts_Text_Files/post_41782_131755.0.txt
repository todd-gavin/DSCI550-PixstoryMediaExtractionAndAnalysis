Australians are very creative when it comes to food! You can pretty much put anything on your burger barring one thing. Pickles! As belly rumbles say, people, put the pickle jar down; they have no place in this place. It is because Australian sliced beetroot in tins is pickled. 

Moreover, no brie or blue cheese in the fancy cheese. Also no American cheese! a straightforward piece of delicious Colby or Cheddar. 

Also a quick tip from me and Sara McCleary, as good as burgers are, using a barbeque outside enhances their flavour even more. They are simple to create, fuss-free, and delectable to eat. The hardest part will be preventing a kooka (kookaburra) from stealing a burger while it's cooking.

Tempted to eat a burger yet?
