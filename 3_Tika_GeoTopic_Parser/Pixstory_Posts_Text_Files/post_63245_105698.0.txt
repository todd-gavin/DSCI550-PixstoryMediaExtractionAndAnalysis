Sheamus gained a lot of prominence during 2009 on WWE's ECW brand. When the superstar moved to the Raw brand, he received a rapid push. It hadn't even been a year on the main roster for the Irishman when he won a battle royal which earned him a shot at John Cena's WWE Championship.

The two superstars faced each other in a Tables match at TLC pay-per-view. Before the main event, no one expected Sheamus to come out on top at the end of the night as he was relatively a newcomer.

The contest itself was inferior to the conclusion it produced. During the dying moments of the bout, Cena was trying to superplex Sheamus from the top turnbuckle to the middle of the ring through a table. But Cena awkwardly slipped from the turnbuckle, which led to him falling through the table. Sheamus wasn't unscathed either, and he stumbled at the same time on the outside of the ring.

Sheamus did not offensively end the contest for the win. However, according to the rules, he cleanly won the match. It was indeed a great idea to put the newcomer over in a big way. That night's climax turned the "Celtic Warrior" into a big star from that point forward.
