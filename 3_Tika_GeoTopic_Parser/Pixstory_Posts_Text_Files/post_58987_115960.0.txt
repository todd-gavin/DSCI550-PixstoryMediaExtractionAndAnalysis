A very objectionable document has been recovered by Bihar Police in which the India vision has been discussed in which converting lower caste is the main focus. 
The document states that if only 10% of the total muslim population will be standing with PFI it would be very easy to go on with the plan.

Two individuals, including a former SIMI member and a retired Jharkhand police officer, have been detained by the Bihar police for allegedly engaging in anti-Indian activities, according to SSP Manish Kumar on Wednesday.

The accused received visitors from different states during the previous two months. Manish Kumar claimed that those arriving changed their names when arranging their travel and lodging.

Mohammad Jallauddin, a retired Jharkhand police officer, and Athar Parvez, a former SIMI member who is currently a member of PFI and SDPI, are among the accused who have been taken into custody.

In the state's 2001â€“2002 bomb bombings case, Parvez's younger brother was sentenced to prison after SIMI was outlawed, according to SSP Manish Kumar.

The police also provided an excerpt from an 8-page document titled "India Vision 2047" that they (the accused) had shared amongst themselves, which stated that PFI was "confident that even if 10% of the entire Muslim population rallied behind it, PFI would subjugate coward majority community & bring back the glory."
