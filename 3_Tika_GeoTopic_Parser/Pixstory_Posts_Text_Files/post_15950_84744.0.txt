Highlights
•
Dietary calorie restriction resulted in significant reduction in body weight and CRP particularly in severely obese subjects.

•
Diet durations ≤12 and >12 weeks had the same effect on reducing CRP. However, beneficial effects were seen >12 weeks.

•
Effect of calorie restriction on inflammatory markers TNFα, sTNFR1, sTNFR2, IL6sR, IL-8, and IL-12 showed variable results.


Abstract
Background and aims
Chronic inflammation in obese patients can be managed through a calorie-restricted diet, characterized by reduced C - reactive protein (CRP). This study aims to assess the role of such diet on CRP.

Methods
Literature searches were performed using search engines. Randomized controlled trials were included. Calorie-restricted diets in combination with non-diet interventions were excluded.

Results
Calorie restriction decreased CRP in obese patients with a mean difference of −0.22 (95% CI -0.40 to −0.04, p 0.006).

Conclusions
Calorie-restricted diet reduces CRP. Diet administration >12 weeks had a beneficial effect.
