Women have the moral right to make decisions about their bodies Because women are more affected by the abortion debate than men both individually if they are considering an abortion and as a gender abortion is an important part of women s rights Pregnancy has a huge impact on the woman who is pregnant In Roe v Wade Sarah Weddington once told the US Supreme Court A pregnancy to a woman is perhaps one of the most determinative aspects of her life It disrupts her body It disrupts her education It disrupts her employment And it often disrupts her entire family life And Mrs Weddington continued And we feel that because of the impact on the woman this is a matter which is of such fundamental and basic concern to the woman involved that she should be allowed to make the choice as to whether to continue or to terminate her pregnancy And the philosopher Judith Jarvis Thomson wrote a great deal turns for women on whether abortion is or is not available If abortion rights are denied then a constraint is imposed on women s freedom to act in a way that is of great importance to them both for its own sake and for the sake of their achievement of equality and if the constraint is imposed on the ground that the fetus has a right to life from the moment of conception then it is imposed on a ground that neither reason nor the rest of morality requires women to accept or even to give any weight at all Abortion bans are unethical They deny women their right to choose and force the unwilling to bear the unwanted Putting a child up for adoption is always an option but why must a woman go through all the physical mental and emotional damage of carrying a child if she doesn t have to keep it in the end What guarantees that the baby will find supportive parents Its putting that child in a vulnerable position A woman should be able to decide whether she wants to carry a fetus not some Mr Thompson on the internet
