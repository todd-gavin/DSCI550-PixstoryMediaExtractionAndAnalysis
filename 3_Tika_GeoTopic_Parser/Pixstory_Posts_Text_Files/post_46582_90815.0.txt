Itâ€™s news duds time for our D.C boys. According to me, the jersey look good but is too feminine for my taste. Although the thought behind it is beautiful, maybe it could have being designed differently. However, I am holding my final judgment until I see the D.C dudes in the jersey. After all, these handsome men and pull anything off. Am I right?

Sporting News reported that for the 2022 MLB season, Nike and MLB are extending their City Connect programme, with seven more teams receiving unique, city-themed jerseys. The new jerseys will be introduced between March and July, and will be worn on the field for the whole 2022 MLB season. 

The Washington Nationals are first up, with their cherry blossom-themed uniforms, leaning heavily into the capital's lovely spring imagery. 

The uniforms, which pay homage to Washington D.C.'s cherry blossoms, have a base grey (anthracite, according to the announcement), which helps the cherry blossoms' pink pop and stand out a little more, as well as the ivory of the detailed "WSH" on the front.

The "WSH" off the front also has textures that pay homage to the city's "neoclassical architecture," according to the press announcement. 

When you look closely, you'll notice that the uniform has outlined cherry blossoms all over it, which is a wonderful touch that adds texture and character to the design. 
The caps use the same font as the "W" on the chest, and the cherry blossom motif extends all the way through the cap. 

The City Connect uniforms will be worn during the Nationals' opening-weekend series against the Mets on Saturday, April 9.

What do you think about the new jersey?
