At IEO we started the robotic lung surgery program in and we were among the first to believe in this approach comments Prof Lorenzo Spaggiari Director of the IEO Lung Program and Professor at the State University of Milan In recent years the robotic technology of the da Vinci system has of the first systems for robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery used in the world has evolved up to the fourth technological generation with the da Vinci Xi system which has been used in more than 100 years of robotic procedures performed in IEO We have followed this evolution by investing not only in technology but in time and resources for training and continuous updating of nurses and doctors We did it for the good of today&#39;s and tomorrow&#39;s patients because we have no doubts that the robot will be in the future of surgery It will be the surgeon&#39;s tool of the future like the state until yesterday the scalpel and just like the scalpel the surgeon will continue to control it The intuition, the creativity that exists in surgery and above all empathy cannot be technologized therefore the function of thought linked to the personality of the surgeon and his vision will not only remain intact but will be amplified to as the automation processes become more sophisticated When the surgeon perceives the potential of this tool, a world of possibilities opens up to him from which it becomes mentally almost impossible to take a step back The robotic lobectomies were performed in IEO on a population of patients of average age years range years with a male prevalence Lobectomies were mainly performed in patients with primary tumors of the lung adenocarcinoma as histology more frequent in over 100000000000000000000000000000 The Pathological staging showed how the indication of robotic lobectomy mainly finds space in the stages initial Stages IA B Stage IIA Stage IIB however the robotic approach has been used in about 1 of locally advanced stages highlighting its role in all oncological stages
