Zinedine Zidane is reportedly travelling to Qatar to finalize his PSG deal. The Frenchman is being touted to take over the managerial position from Mauricio Pochettino as per the Sun. 

The former Real Madrid manager is held in high regard by the Paris Saint Germain administration. The PSG bosses had tried to sign the French legends multiple times. But a deal was not completed between the manager and the club. 

However, as per reports, PSG have finally managed to capture their man. As per Ramon Fuentes, "Zizou is travelling to Qatar to finalise his contract with PSG's owners".

Zinedine Zidane is best known for winning the hattrick UCLs with Real Madrid in the last decade as a manager. The French magician had a spectacular playing career as well, also helping his nation win the event in 1998.

Mauricio Pochettino has failed to win the coveted UEFA Champions League title in his last two seasons. To add to this, the Argentine has reportedly failed to capture the dressing room completely. Hence, PSG are looking to sack the manager in the coming days. 

The UCL is high on the priority list for PSG. Hence Zinedine Zidane could be the best bet for the Parisians as they look to taste European glory for the first time under the Frenchman.
