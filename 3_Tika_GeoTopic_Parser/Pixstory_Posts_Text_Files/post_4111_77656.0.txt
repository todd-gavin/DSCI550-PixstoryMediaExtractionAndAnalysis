Being a singer myself I always get appreciated for singing Lag Ja Gale and Mere Khwabon. I find these songs soul touching. The voice gives the vibe on these songs. Lata Ji's voice is unmatchable. I even love her Malayalam songs like Kadhali Chenkadhali which still are a must try in singing reality shows. Praying for her speedy recovery.
