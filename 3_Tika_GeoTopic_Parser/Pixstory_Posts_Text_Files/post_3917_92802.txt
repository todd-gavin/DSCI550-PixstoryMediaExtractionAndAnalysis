There is this trend among the food vloggers in Kerala that s going around with a food item which is called as ChattiChoru It is an authentic non veg meal which is ideal when one is close to starving as its flavours just rides the boat in your mouth The smell I got while I entered the restaurant itself made me really want the food ASAP What all comes in it Definitely the main ingredient is the rice which is first set as the bottom layer Then eventually each side dish is put into like some squid beef fry prawns with some pickle with a sun dried chilli along with some vegetarian ingredients like beetroot curry yam curry with some coconut chutney with a piece of fish fry and definitely the crisp of pappad will always be there in a South indian meal Well this is something you have to definitely try on when you come to Kerala Trust me you will lick your fingers after the meal
