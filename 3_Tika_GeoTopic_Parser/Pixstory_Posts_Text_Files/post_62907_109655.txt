Getting a safe and a legal abortion is much safer than giving birth Women are about times more likely to die during or after giving birth to a live baby than to die from complications of an abortion The reasons you mentioned are dated beliefs Safe abortion does not cause infertility It doesn t result in complications either if you ever wanna get pregnant again There s a very very small chance of that but the chance stays whether or not you get an abortion That s life you can t predict things It s like saying don t treat cancer because there s a chance of it coming back Forcing people to undertake these risks against their will is a fundamental violation of bodily autonomy and human rights In many cases if you don t seek an abortion you die You Die So you understand what that means and what overturning Roe has unleashed on women This is some way to be in favor of women huh There s no universal healthcare no universal childcare no paid family medical leave and we have one of the highest rates of maternal mortality among rich nations It s not about life because if it was those many kids and women wouldn t suffer Pregnancy is a dangerous phenomenon The number of people who die because of it is too high for us to just shrug it off Abortion ban is murder
