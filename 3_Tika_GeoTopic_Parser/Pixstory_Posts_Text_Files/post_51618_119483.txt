In his whole career Sergio Ramos has made a lot challenges on Lionel Messi but he probably never thought he d have to deal with them in practise session The two former La Liga players now only compete against one another during practises after they are brought together at PSG But that doesn t implies that they are less competitive A video from a PSG practise session has gome viral in which the Argentine striker clearly displeased with the Spanish centre back s strong contact Messi who was obviously not pleased with the challenge wasn t for letting it go easily In the video the former Barcelona player can be seen taking the ball and going away from the Real Madrid legend before that he brutally kicks him in the left leg Following his goal Messi confronts Ramos and despite the Spaniard s efforts to make amends Messi isn t having it The Argentine likely thought the test was pointless preventable and in any case way too difficult for a training exercise Ramos makes one more attempt to speak with Messi before turning away in frustration probably believing that he is exaggerating given that the ex Barcelona player was obviously not prepared to go on so soon Messi and Ramos did not have the successful Paris debut season they had hoped for they will be aiming to fix the situation in the next season They might need to start getting along a little better on the practise field for that to happen Ramos played in just Ligue games last season due to injury missing the majority of them Messi performed below expectations scoring just goals in games his lowest goal scoring season since when he was just years old Do you think that two swords can be in a single cover
