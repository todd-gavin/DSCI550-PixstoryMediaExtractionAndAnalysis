This makes me so happy!! 

Finally WB has outed this ridiculous, off putting person as the face of one of the most beloved superheroes of all-time. 

It saddens me to see how they have been accused of assault and battery, sexual assault, grooming and indecent behavior and there are still people who are defending them. 

Just because they are a good actor and embodies the role doesn't mean that they should be allowed to portray a superhero that so many people look up to. 

It would be as good as throwing away all of our morals. Ezra Miller never deserved to be "The Flash". Hopefully the studio would make sure to keep involvement of such problematic people in publicly anticipated projects, to a bare minimum.
