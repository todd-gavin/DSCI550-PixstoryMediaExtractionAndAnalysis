Bollywood at the time Gangs of Wasseypur was released mainly catered to tier one cities, and in the case of Karan Johar's well-known movies, to NRI viewers. The criminal series filled a gap in the genre and steered the camera toward underrepresented groups in Hindi cinema. The success of GoW made it feasible for stories based in small-town India to grow in popularity throughout the ten years since its release. Actually, there is a clear connection between the movie's continuing appeal and the contemporary rise of culturally distinctive South Indian hits. For instance, the KGF films adopt a similar time-hopping gangster epic structure but in a manner that is obviously more "masala.

Before the concept of making movies and television shows accessible to watch from the comfort of your own home was even a twinkle in Reed Hastings' eye, Gangs of Wasseypur was a streaming hit. To put things in perspective, House of Cards, Netflix's first original series, came out a year after GoW, a movie that now appears to be built for the kind of creative freedom that streaming was able to give directors. It seems sense that Kashyap was the first choice for the lead role in Sacred Games, Netflix's first Indian original.

Nawazuddin Siddiqui received possibly the second well-liked role of his career for the drama, which, like GoW, portrayed a complex gangster saga spanning decades. However, GoW's serialised format, large cast, and nearly six-hour runtime almost make it seem as though Kashyap had intended it to be seen in episodes by future generations. If you stop to think about it, the same audiences who formerly pirated his movies online eventually became the target market for streamers when they began offering services in India. The industry pushed the limits after GoW's success, or, to put it more cynically, learned that entire demographic groups they'd previously disregarded now had purchasing power.
