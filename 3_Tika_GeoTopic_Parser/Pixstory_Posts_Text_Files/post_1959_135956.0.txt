Border Patrol authorities recently confiscated cocaine worth around $12 million near the Texas border. The cocaine was concealed as baby wipes. According to them, it was their greatest narcotics seizure in in two decades.

This seizure is especially alarming because of the fact that the criminals smuggling these narcotics over the border are essentially empowered by our country's lax immigration policies, which let almost anybody to enter regardless of the damage they may inflict. This, along with the country's enormous number of drug dealers and drug users, is a recipe for disaster.



Our neighborhoods and our nation as a whole have been devastated by illicit substances. These drugs are laced with abundant and inexpensive fentanyl and other lethal substances to reduce manufacturing costs at the cost of human lives. Our nation has stringent drug regulations, but it seems that we need to develop more innovative solutions that will disrupt the market and make it unprofitable to manufacture these substances in the first place.
