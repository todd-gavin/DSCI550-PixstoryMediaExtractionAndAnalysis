For most Indians for that matter tea is something you can absolutely not survive without Early morning tea afternoon tea evening tea and the bedtime tea Lots and lots of tea are for a lot of Indians for their happiness and daily functioning without a fuss I remember not finding food to eat on one of my journeys but always finding tea A rainy morning and my favorite thing to do is have tea Well now we all know that the key to us Indians hearts is a cup of yummy tea We can judge you on how you make tea but please don t judge us for that It s the truth tea really is a magical invention that was brought to India by the Britisher s but now we are a true tea kingdom as the largest consumers There are innumerable brands and types of teas in India but my favourite is Masala Chai Masala chai is a mixture of herbs and spices and it s one tea you won t mind ordering while on the road It s light and refreshing with a hint of a distinct flavour Whether you like it or not it will be served in every dhaba The most opulent restaurants will include this tea on their most opulent menus Drinking a hot beverage in the desi way is a pure Indian touch
