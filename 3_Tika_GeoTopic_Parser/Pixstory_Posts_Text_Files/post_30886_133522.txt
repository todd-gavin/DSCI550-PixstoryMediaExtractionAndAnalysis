The Napoli coach Luciano Spalletti spoke of the sensational market rumor that sees the name of Cristiano Ronaldo alongside that of the Neapolitan team I would like to see who would give up coaching Ronaldo and then have the opportunity to discuss it for life Speaking with De Laurentiis he told me that I haven&#39;t received anything concrete yet Just a few days away I find it hard to carry out such an operation The arrival of the Portuguese would lead to the farewell of Victor Osimhen Spalletti believes both strikers two players capable of deciding matches When it comes to champions of this kind never a problem If we talk about the Portuguese someone who solves things even on his own someone who has won the most Champions has scored more than everyone With these players there is no problem Just as there are none with Osimhen
