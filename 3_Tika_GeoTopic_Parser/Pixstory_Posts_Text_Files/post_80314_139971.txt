Arsenal A Europa League Preview Arsenal travel to Switzerland for their opening game in the Europa League After failing to quality last season The Gunners are yet to crack this competition A devastating defeat in Baku a semi final knockout vs Villarreal more recently have stopped the Gunners getting hands on this silverware Of course Champions League qualification is the minimum aspiration for the club but conquering a European competition which has improved vastly over the years would go a long way mentally for a young squad would add a rare spot in Arsenal s trophy variety in recent times and would be a good opportunity in what s aspired by the fans to be the last season in the Europa League particularly with the new Champions League format coming into play in the coming years The Europa League is a great opportunity to provide game time to either promising youth such as how Bukayo Saka came onto the scene vs Frankfurt but also an opportunity for backups to get minutes After Arsenal s squad has been reduced drastically in size there s hardly any deadwood if any so with that there s very few nd choice players This could be a pro for better momentum to maintain into league games but due to the already excessive fixture congestion quite a few starters playing twice a week isn t ideal Turner Cedric Holding Saliba Tomiyasu Tierney Lokonga Xhaka Vieira Martinelli Nketiah Marquinhos Saka would be the team I d largely anticipate tonight and most group stage games I think the competition should be one Arsenal go very far in and hopefully win With the form the quality there s no reason The Gunners can t go all the way and have that edge in the decisive games where they ve fell short before A good group for travel but also for quality a manageable one to balance with the League other cups vs FC Zurich in Switzerland is where it begins on what is hopefully Arsenal s last appearance in the Europa League for a while
