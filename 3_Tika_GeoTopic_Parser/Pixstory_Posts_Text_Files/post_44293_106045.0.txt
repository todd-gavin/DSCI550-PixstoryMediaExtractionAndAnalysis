The France international midfielder is set to complete a permanent move to Marseille following his successful loan spell with Ligue 1 outfit.

Matteo Guendouzi’s move to Marseille will soon be completed as Arsenal step up their
attempts to shift a host of unwanted squad players this summer.

Guendouzi spent the 2021-22 campaign on loan in the south of France and enjoyed a
fine season, helping Jorge Sampaoli’s side to a second-place finish in Ligue 1 and
forcing his way into Didier Deschamps’ France squad.

And his move is now set to become permanent, with the midfielder one of several
players who want to move on in the coming weeks.

How much will Arsenal receive for Guendouzi?

Arsenal will receive around 10.5 million euros for the France international. The transfer
fee was agreed upon last summer as a part of the loan that initially took Guendouzi to
Marseille.

Marseille originally paid around 8.5 million euros to take the midfielder loan for the
season and had an option included in the deal to make the move permanent in the
summer of 2022.

The option is now set to be triggered, with the deal to be wrapped up
soon after Guendouzi’s involvement with the France national team in the UEFA Nations
League is over.

Who else will Arsenal sell?

Arsenal remains in talks with Fiorentina over the sale of Lucas Torreira. The Serie A
side has expressed a willingness to sign the midfielder on a permanent deal after his
successful loan spell last season but has yet to table a suitable offer for the Uruguay
international.

Torreira wants to join Fiorentina and Arsenal still hopes a deal can be agreed upon in
the upcoming weeks.

Hector Bellerin’s future has yet to be decided, with the defender keen to join Real Betis
permanently following last season’s loan spell.
