The teenager who killed Barnard student Tessa Majors during a botched robbery was sentenced Wednesday to 14-years-to-life in prison.

“At the end of his sentence, Rashaun Weaver goes home. Tessa doesn’t,” Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Matthew Bogdanos said before Rashaun Weaver learned his fate.

Weaver was 14 years old when he and two other youths accosted Majors and stabbed her to death in Manhattan’s Morningside Park in December 2019.

His sentencing in Manhattan Supreme Court closes the legal book on a crime that shook New York City. Weaver’s two teen accomplices have already been sentenced for their roles in the 18-year-old’s killing.

Tessa Majors’ family detailed — in a victim impact statement read by prosecutors — how she held onto her iPhone for dear life when Weaver demanded she hand it over on Dec 11, 2019.

“It contained three years’ worth of songs she’d written; songs she was planning to record over the winter break, which was only a week away. As far as the family knows, those songs were stored nowhere else but on her phone,” the letter, read by Bogdanos said.

Weaver and his friends from school, Luchiano Lewis and a 13-year-old set out to mug someone in the park that night, Lewis said in September, when he pleaded guilty in the case.

After their first attempts failed, the group set their sights on Majors, who was jogging down a set of steps on W. 116th St. near Morningside Drive, Lewis said.

“Rashaun turned around, ran up behind Tessa Majors and kicked her hard in the back. I watched her stumble. Rashaun started screaming, ‘Give me your money, run your pockets, I’m not playing,’” Lewis detailed in court.

Weaver stabbed the Ivy League freshman four times, with enough force to cause feathers from her coat to fill the night air, prosecutors said.
