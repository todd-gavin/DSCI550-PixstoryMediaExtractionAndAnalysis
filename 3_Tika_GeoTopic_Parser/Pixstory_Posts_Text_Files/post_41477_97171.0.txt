This year's NFL draught could be unlike any other in recent years, with a considerable wait before any of the guys who pass, catch, or run with the ball are selected. 

US News reported that with no sure-fire quarterback prospects in the draught and numerous good-but-not-elite receiving prospects, offensive linemen and defensive linemen should dominate the early rounds, with Ohio State receiver Garrett Wilson at No. 10 on The Athletic's composite big board of 70 draught analysts. 

Among the history of the NFL, there has never been a draught without a quarterback, receiver, running back, or tight end in the top ten picks, with a player from those positions going in the first round.

The one year that didn't happen was in 2013, when four offensive linemen, led by tackles Eric Fisher and Luke Joeckel, were selected in the top seven, with receiver Tavon Austin becoming the first skill position player taken by the Rams at No. 8.
