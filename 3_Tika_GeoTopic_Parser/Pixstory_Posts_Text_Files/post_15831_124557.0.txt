Abstract

Aims

It is now understood that almost half of newly diagnosed cases of type 1 diabetes are adult-onset. However, type 1 and type 2 diabetes are difficult to initially distinguish clinically in adults, potentially leading to ineffective care. In this study a machine learning model was developed to identify type 1 diabetes patients misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes.

Methods

In this retrospective study, a machine learning model was developed to identify misdiagnosed type 1 diabetes patients from a population of patients with a prior type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Using Ambulatory Electronic Medical Records (AEMR), features capturing relevant information on age, demographics, risk factors, symptoms, treatments, procedures, vitals, or lab results were extracted from patients' medical history.

Results

The model identified age, BMI/weight, therapy history, and HbA1c/blood glucose values among top predictors of misdiagnosis. Model precision at low levels of recall (10%) was 17%, compared to <1% incidence rate of misdiagnosis at the time of the first type 2 diabetes encounter in AEMR.

Conclusions

This algorithm shows potential for being translated into screening guidelines or a clinical decision support tool embedded directly in an EMR system to reduce misdiagnosis of adult-onset type 1 diabetes and implement effective care at the outset.
