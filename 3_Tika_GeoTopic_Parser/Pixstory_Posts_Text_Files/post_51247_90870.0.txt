In 2017, he received the Padma Vibhushan, India's second-highest civilian award, for his contributions to social welfare.

Jagadish Vasudev was born on 3 September 1957 in Mysore, Karnataka, India. He is the youngest of the five children[4] of Susheela Vasudev, a homemaker, and B.V. Vasudev, a physician at the Mysuru Railway Hospital.[5]Aged thirteen, Vasudev took yoga lessons from Malladihalli Raghavendra[6] daily throughout his youth, albeit without spiritual aspirations.[7]

Vasudev studied at Demonstration School, Mysore and Mahajana Pre-University College. He graduated from the University of Mysore with a bachelor's degree in English.[8]

Vasudev's first business was a poultry farm in a remote part of Mysore[9] that he set up with borrowed money.[10] While in the process of constructing his farm, he also got into the construction business with a company named Buildaids.[10]

At the age of 25, he rented his businesses to his friend and travelled for about a year.[11] According to Vasudev, his main motive in starting a business was to fund his urge to travel and explore.[12]

In 1983, he taught his first yoga class in Mysore. Over time, he began conducting yoga classes across Karnataka and Hyderabad, travelling on his motorcycle, subsisting on the produce of his poultry farm rental and donating the collections received from his students.[11]

In 2022, Vasudev began a 100-day, 30,000 kilometre trip from London across Europe and the Middle East on his motorcycle to campaign to "save soil" from degradation.[13]
