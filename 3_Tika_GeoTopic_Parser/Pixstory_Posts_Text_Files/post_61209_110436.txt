I went to mcleodganj and Dharamshala last year with my family and my friend It is a perfect choice for some chilled out time in the Himalayas The beautiful monasteries waterfalls lakes and quaint cafes in the backdrop of the mighty Dhauladhar Himalayas contribute to making Mcleodganj an interesting tourist destination I did paragliding for the very first time there and that was an amazing experience the view was super amazing the height of mtrs is one of the best sites in the world for paragliding First picture was taken at the top of triund trek It s a hours of trekking there were facilities of eating and staying overnight We did camping for first time and experience was amazing and it was toooo cold there You guyz should visit this place atleast for one time you won t regret it
