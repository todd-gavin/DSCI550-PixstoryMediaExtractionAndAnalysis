While President Donald Trump has repeatedly hinted towards trying his luck again in to acquire the White House a re examination of an law could topple his plans for the next presidential elections According to The Huffington Post report the old Reconstruction era law could keep the th US President off the ballot in at least six Southern states including North Carolina Georgia and Florida due to his alleged role in the Capitol riot It is to note that the law re admitting six former Confederate states to the Union obligated them to prevent insurgents from running for office Now as per the report the same law is being reexamined which might lead to Trump being off of primary and general election ballots in the said states However it would only happen if the investigation into the January Capitol riot result in the former US President being convicted of inciting an insurrection Under the th Amendment s third section people who swore to defend the constitution but ended up taking part in an insurrection against the US are barred from holding either a state or federal office stated the report The Huffington Post further added that other language in the post Civil War amendment makes many experts believe that only Congress can enforce the ban This implies that Senate Republicans could block any such action But notably the law that readmitted the six US states has placed the burden on just them to keep the individuals who have been involved in insurrections from seeking office This according to the report potentially makes it considerably easier to keep Trump off the primary and general election ballots of North Carolina Georgia and Florida
