Heat waves on land and depressions in the sea this year have started early in and around India, most probably because of an unexpected climatic anomaly which could, in turn, be linked to global warming.

Another series of weird weather events were the three dust storms that affected Mumbai city and its surrounding region in January and February 2022. The dust storms originated from the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan and affected Mumbai via the Arabian Sea.

The reason behind early heat waves, early depressions and the weird dust storms is the continued persistence of a north-south low-pressure pattern that forms over India during winters when a La Niña phenomenon is occurring in the equatorial Pacific Ocean.

During a La Niña winter, a north-south pressure pattern sets up over India, which can funnel in bitterly cold temperatures far down into peninsular India unlike during an El Niño winter when the cold blast of air tends to be more confined to the north.
