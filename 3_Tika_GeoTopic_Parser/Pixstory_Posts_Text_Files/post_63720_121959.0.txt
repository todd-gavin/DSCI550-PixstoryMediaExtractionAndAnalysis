There are several metal bands out there who have produced wonderful concept albums featuring brilliant stories and enchanting concepts.
 
Concept albums are albums whose lyrical content and even music at times, is tied together by an overarching theme which defines the whole record. This is unlike a rock opera which features concrete characters.
 
 Some bands have made such brilliant concept records that they deserve their own live action movie, so that a wider audience beyond the band’s own fanbase can see and experience the story.
 
Nightwish managed to achieve great success when they capitalized on this idea in 2012 and made a whole movie based off their album ‘Imaginaerum’. That album had a brilliant concept, and many such metal albums exist with certain bands possessing the means to realize the vision of their albums and see it in feature films.
