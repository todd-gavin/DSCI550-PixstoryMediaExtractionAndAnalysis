I don t think such misconceptions should defame surrogacy and this is more than just objectifying or exploiting the female body In reality surrogacy is a good option to consider It instead provides a safe place for a baby to grow Moreover it s a matter of choice the whole process takes place professionally and the commissioning parents do know how important the surrogate is to them So they take care of her needs and requirements carefully There is no mistreatment from the child s parents they put extra effort into caring for the surrogate mother Besides there s a bond between the intended parents and the surrogate in this process of choosing surrogate maternity Also single people members of the LGBT community want to become parents and for them surrogacy is one of the best options to choose It is instead a more rewarding gift for both the surrogate and the intended parents
