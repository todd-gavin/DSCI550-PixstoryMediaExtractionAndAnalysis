Waiting for Berrettini&#39;s match Sinner the only Italian to have managed to access the third round of the Indian Wells tournament Fognini succumbed only to fever The South Tyrolean easily overcame the Serbian Djere in two sets both with the score Eliminated Sonego instead defeated by French Bonzi in two sets and there wasn&#39;t much match between the two Sinner won all the bars and two breaks and already in the first set he quickly got on with the service available and brought home Same script for the second and exactly the same Bad result for the other Italian engaged in the Italian night Sonego loses in two sets against the French Bonzi who will face Sinner in the third round The tennis player from Turin gives up in just minutes of play and after too many mistakes After a balanced start two mistakes on the forehand by Sonego they open the way for their rival who takes the opportunity to throw him into confusion and close the first set The second set is not much better Very good Bonzi at attacking Sonego and not making him reason when the match goes badly
