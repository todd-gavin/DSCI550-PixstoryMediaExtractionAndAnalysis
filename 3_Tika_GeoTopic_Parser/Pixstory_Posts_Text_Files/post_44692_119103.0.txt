Donation of Diamond Gemstone and White Sapphire Gemstone

There is a method of pacifying pratikula planets (planets that give adverse or 
malefic results) by way of gem donation. This is known as Ratna Daan or Ratna Arpana.

The following things are to be offered along with a beautiful natural jyotish quality diamond/white sapphire.
- Diamond/white sapphire that has the characteristics described in the 
texts. It can be of any size provided it is natural and beautiful.
- Piece of gold.
- Piece of silver.
- White rice.
- Milk
- Yoghurt
- Sandalwood
- White silk cloth
Dakshina/Offering in terms of currency to the Brahmin.

All these things should be donated to a wise, capable, devout and practising Brahmin (priest of the highest Hindu caste) on a Friday morning before 10 am. 

Those who are not in a position or unable to perform the ritual given above should donate a diamond or white sapphire to a poor young lady on a Friday evening. 

Donation in such a way pacifies the negative results of the Planet Venus and blesses the individual with health, wealth and happiness.

Period of effect of Diamond

Once worn in an auspicious time frame the diamond is effective for a person for 7 years. On completion of this period one should wear a new diamond. The existing diamond should be sold or given to a loved one. The same diamond is effective for that person for equivalent amount of time. If such a diamond is jyotish quality then it will be effective for a span of 7 years for every new individual it reaches.
