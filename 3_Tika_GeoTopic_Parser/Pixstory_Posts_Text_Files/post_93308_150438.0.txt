I totally agree that pandemic while taking a toll on our lives has seriously hampered our ability to be socially comfortable. 
Especially the people who have already been suffering from the social anxiety had to face the brunt. A brief report released by the WHO about the impact of Covid 19 on the mental health across the globe brings out sad realities to forefront . The headlines reads- COVID-19 pandemic triggers 25% increase in prevalence of anxiety and depression worldwide. 
The people worst affected are the women, young adolscents and the people from the spectrum of gender. Being too long in the confinement of homes ahve seen a rise in the number of domestic violence and abuse cases in India as well as worldwide. The young adolscents have had a stark rise in the cases of suicidal incidents, self harm indulgences, and substance abuse. 
As was the worldwide devastating effects on thr most vulnerable of the groups, people from the LGBTQI + communities were hit by the negative impact. Lacking thr I frastructure and medical facilities for people from the non-binary, most of thr hospitals in the world are heteronormative increasing the resistance to seek these facilities. There was inappropriate behaviour in addition to complete lack of knowledge as to how to respectfully tend to their needs. The situation became worse in the pandemic as hospitals were already lacking beds, additional false stigma around the members of thus community exacerbated the conditions. 
Social and emotional Isolation caused them to be cut off from their companions, friends and people they confided in. Moreover, a lot of the members already have toxic family environment and strained relations with parents over their sexuality. Without having an money yielding job at the time of the pandemic, they forcibly had to move in with their families. 
The world's tragedies hit differently to different people. And also unfairly.
