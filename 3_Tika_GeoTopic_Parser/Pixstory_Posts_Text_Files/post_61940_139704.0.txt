Amazon Prime recently released the first two episodes of The Lord of the Rings spinoff The Rings of Power. It has been a marvel for critics even though fans find objection with the casting of characters of color.
The series revolves around the events that have been set before The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Ring. It details the dark Lord Sauron’s rise to power and the creation of the Rings of Power in Middle Earth.
Despite fan backlash due to casting controversy, this Amazon series is a breath of fresh air. It ultimately breathes new life into Tolkien’s beloved stories and harkens back to the world that raptured hearts so long ago.
