Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) online Davos Agenda 2022 summit on January 17. However, the headlines and social media trends about the event revolved around the moment when the PM stopped speaking midway through his speech. A large section of social media users, including leaders from opposition parties, alleged that the reason for the abruption was a teleprompter failure. PM Modi was mocked for not being able to deliver a speech without a teleprompter.

The official Twitter account of Congress posted a 37-second video of the disruption during the live stream along with hashtag #TelepromptorPM. The hashtag #TelepromptorPM has been used by several verified Congress accounts to take a dig at the PM. Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed, West Bengal Congress, West Bengal Pradesh Mahila Congress, Manipur Pradesh Congress Sevadal and Tamil Nadu Pradesh Congress Sevadal made the same claim.
