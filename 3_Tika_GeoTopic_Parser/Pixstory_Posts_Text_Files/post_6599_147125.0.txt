On September 19, Alt News received a series of videos on our WhatsApp tip line (+91 7600011160) clubbed together as an incident of child kidnapping in Delhi. The tipper, who was most likely aware of our work on child-kidnapping-related rumours, shared these videos with the accompanying message that these rumours were again gaining momentum.
Clip 1: Woman in burkha allegedly kidnaps a child and escapes in an auto
In the first clip, we can see a woman in a burka approach a child begging. As the child hands over something, she manages to drug him and then the child loses consciousness. Immediately after this, a man arrives in an auto-rickshaw at the scene and they put the child in the vehicle and make off.
This clip has been viral on Indian social media since July 2022 and has been debunked by Alt News on multiple occasions. It is a staged video from Egypt created by a group of men who had planned to earn money through social media views. The full fact-check can be read here.
Clip 2: A woman travelling in a bus with a child is confronted by police and bystanders
In this clip, we see a woman seated on a bus, who is confronted by a police officer carrying a baby. The officer says that he will shoot her if he finds out that the child does not belong to her. He asks her twice about whose child she stole, to which she replies that she does not know and they can take the child away. She also suggests that they should go to the hospital and get a DNA test done.
