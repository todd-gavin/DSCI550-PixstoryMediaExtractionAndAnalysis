Hope is a life saver which we don't talk much about. All of us might have had situations wherein we wanted to give up, we wished not to wake u the next morning. When that day gets over we see pain starting to reduce and this is life. Life isn't always tragedy it leaves some amount of hope in us to learn and to survive. 

We find the courage to survive, a reason to fight, and live a life amidst everything. Many people ask whom should I live for!  The only answer is for yourself you should live for yourself and nothing more. Even if the whole world abandons you, you have a brain and body fighting for yourself. How can forget yourself when all you have is you?
