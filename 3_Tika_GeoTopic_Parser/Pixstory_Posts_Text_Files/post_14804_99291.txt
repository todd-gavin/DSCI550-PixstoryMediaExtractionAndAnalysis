A new service dedicated to all people vaccinated or recovered from Covid who want to know their degree of protection from the virus is underway Cerba HealthCare Italia is proposing it, which in its centers offers an innovative test called IGRA Interferon Gamma Release Assay which evaluates the response immune system of memory T cells which play a key role in reducing the severity of Covid Prof Francesco Broccolo virologist and scientific director of Cerba HealthCare talks about it Cerba HealthCare has developed an ad hoc service that helps to make informed choices regarding the fourth vaccine dose which currently recommended only for the overweight and some categories of frail patients All other people who are in doubt about the usefulness or otherwise of a booster can receive through the immunological screening offered by Cerba useful indications on the effective coverage of the doses already received and on their degree of protection against the serious effects of SARS CoV infection In fact, each individual responds differently to the anti Covid vaccination based on heterogeneous factors genetic structure immunosuppression autoimmune pathologies type of vaccine In the Cerba HealthCare centers it is possible to carry out a test to evaluate the neutralizing antibodies protective against infections from SARS CoV and the new IGRA test which measures memory T lymphocytes to evaluate the effectiveness of protection against the disease and the infection itself The two tests are combined to define the so-called no-responders or those who are in any case at high risk of SARS CoV infection or to develop the disease. To carry them out, a simple blood test is enough, again Francesco Brocco to explain why the new candidate test to become a very important weapon of prevention and health protection. Following an infection or vaccination, specific memory cells are created capable of to activate in case of encounter with the pathogen While the antibodies produced have the role of neutralizing the virus before it enters the cells, the T cells have the task of recognizing and eliminating the cells infected by the virus For this reason, although these components do not prevent the disease are essential to reduce its severity
