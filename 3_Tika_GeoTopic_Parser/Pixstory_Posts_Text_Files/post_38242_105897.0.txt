Gareth Bale could extend his stay in LaLiga after finishing up his nine year stay at Real Madrid. The Welshman has reportedly been offered to Getafe CF!

The Real Madrid star has been underutilized for the past few seasons at the club. Injuries have hampered the winger's career. To add to this, his contract with Real Madrid has also ended. 

Rumours suggested that Bale would move to the Premier League or some other league in the United Kingdom this year. However, the Welshman could stay in LaLiga itself. 

According to Getafe President √Ångel Torres, Gareth Bale's agent has offered the Welshman's services to the Madrid-based club. Getafe finished the 2021/22 season in 15th place in the LaLiga table. Hence Bale could face a massive gap in quality around him if he decides to move to Getafe. 

As per the time of this post, no decision has been made by Getafe CF regarding the future of Gareth Bale. The Welshman and his teammates scripted history over the weekend as they led the Wales National to the 2022 FIFA World Cup. 

Hence a very important season is ahead for Gareth Bale as he has a World Cup to look forward to this season.
