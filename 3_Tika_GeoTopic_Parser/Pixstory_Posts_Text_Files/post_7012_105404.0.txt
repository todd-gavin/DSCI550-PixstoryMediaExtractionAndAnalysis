On 16 May, it was reported that the privatisation of the government-owned helicopter service provider Pawan Hans Limited had been “put on hold.” Just 17 days earlier, on April 29, the government had declared Star9 Mobility Solutions Private Limited’s Rs 211 crore bid as the winning bid for the government’s 51% stake in the helicopter company.

On the day reports that the deal had been put on hold appeared, these reporters had published in The Wire and NewsClick an article investigating the antecedents of a consortium of three companies that came together to set up Star9 Mobility. The article had pointed out that little information was available in the public domain about the Cayman Islands-registered Almas Global Opportunity Fund (AGOF), the largest stakeholder in Star9 Mobility, and that there were doubts about whether AGOF met the eligibility criteria laid out by the government to participate in the bidding, and that an adverse order had been passed against AGOF by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) shortly before Star9 Mobility’s selection as the winning bidder.

On May 28, these reporters published in The Probe an article delving deeper into the antecedents of AGOF. In that article, we detailed the links between AGOF and a controversial Zimbabwean businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei. The report described how AGOF had allegedly acted as a front for Tagwirei to channel his funds and that AGOF had allegedly continued to do so after Tagwirei was sanctioned by the governments of the United States of America and the United Kingdom. The article further pointed out that two government documents suggest that allowing the sale of Pawan Hans to Star9 Mobility would constitute a violation of government rules – due to the adverse order by the NCLT against AGOF and due to AGOF appearing to not meet the eligibility criteria to bid for Pawan Hans.
