In the previous two seasons, the club has struggled without a playmaker and are heavily dependent on Harry Kane and Heung Min Son for creating the chances as well as scoring the goals. Both have partnered 37 goals in the English Premier League. In 2020/21, they set a single-season record of combining for 14 goals. They accounted for 21% of goals combined. Harry Kane and Son scored 40 goals out of 68 goals in the English Premier League and 11 goals were scored by Gareth Bale. This clearly indicates the problem that lies in Tottenham Hotspur. 

Moreover, the departure of Dele Alli and other players unable to create goals have cost Tottenham Hotspur a place in the Champions League and Europa League. The Argentine international on the other hand had seven G/A last term and has better numbers than other Spurs players excluding Harry Kane and Heung Min Son. 

Also, signing Paulo Dybala would allow Tottenhamâ€™s new acquisition, Dejan Kulusevski to prosper on the right flank. Currently, the player has combined to perform as both playmaker and a winger. A win-win situation for both amidst the tough times to get a suitable club or a player.
