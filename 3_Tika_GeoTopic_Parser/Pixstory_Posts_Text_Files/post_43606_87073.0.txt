The concert was held at the main stadium of Jamsil Staclium in Seoul for a total of three nights (Mar 10th, 11th, and 12th), and was simultaneously conducted through an online live streaming due to the ongoing pandemic. Through the offline performances and cinema live streaming, a total of 2,465,000 people watched the concert. In particular, the second night was broadcast in real time at 3,711 movie theaters in 75 countries around the world.

At the North American weekend box office, the concert ranked third after Robert Pattinson's "The Batman" ($66 million) and Tom Holland's "Uncharted" ($9.2 million). Tickets at the North American theaters for the BTS concert are reported to be $35, about four times the average price of $9. BTS said on their official SNS, "Thank you ARMY (fandom name) for joining us at such a miraculous concert for three days. Even if it's a cold winter or a warm spring day, ARMY and BTS are always together," showing their gratitude to their fans. After the Secul concert, BTS said through their agency that they are preparing for "PERMISSION TO DANCE ON STAGE - LAS VEGAS" in Las Vegas on April 8th, 9th, 15th and 16th.
