Locating healthcare in daily trans lives Moderator Pavel Sagolsem Program Manager Nazariya edited in the speaker s own words This fireside chat is a conversation starter that looks at how trans people navigate healthcare in their daily lives while exploring the questions What are our stories What are our narratives What are our desires What are our wishes What are our expectations I would like to begin with my pronouns I ve always identified as a genderqueer person ever since I was a young child But of course it took time to actually realize what genderqueer is and to come across a community I think when you are a little different as they call it then finding a community becomes one of the ways through which you start understanding yourself or you start exploring yourself from a point of self affirmation and the same thing happened when I moved to Delhi I was studying applied linguistics and translational studies at Hyderabad Central University where I came across cultural studies and feminism That s where I found conversations which had more relevance to my life my feelings my desires When I came out in Hyderabad figuring out myself and understanding my community became more important and I decided to go for another Master s in gender studies When I came to Delhi the queer faternity that I interacted with was genderqueer people and they asked me What are your pronouns The pronoun they were using for themselves was ze I could make a little sense of it as a linguistic student but I asked further How did these pronouns come about They told me that it s basically for people who are genderqueer genderfluid and it s a mix of he and she As a linguistic student I know that when h and sh come together they become j and it makes perfect sense This really captured my interest and I could find a certain belonging a certain worth a certain identity or certain terms that basically talks about my experience which I also couldn t have really found words to express in
