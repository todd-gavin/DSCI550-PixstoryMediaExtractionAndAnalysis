I breathe freely Do not take the air from me Do not be so hard on me It is better not to fall together You can never delete me You want to hear me speak and talk to me You can never delete me If you think this hard work of yours is healing This is not rotating I wish you would hear from me Whatever happened is enough Power is overthrown If you stand in the face of thoughts The vastness of this world is everyone s burden The only truth is that it remains stable The world is everywhere And if you want to find a solution If we think together I breathe freely The voice of freedom will remain above any other voice Above all sounds No matter how severe the storm of oppression And the darkness of night cover the distances You can not enrich the whole world with just one color And change the system of the earth And change the air flow I breathe freely Do not interrupt my air And do not hold me tight Otherwise we had better be separated I can breathe freely Do not interrupt my air And do not hold me tight Otherwise we had better be separated
