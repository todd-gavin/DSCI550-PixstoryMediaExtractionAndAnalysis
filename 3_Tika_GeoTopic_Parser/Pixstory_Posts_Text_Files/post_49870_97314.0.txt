‌Why are school uniforms needed? Uniforms are necessary to reduce the bigotry faced by students in schools. In this era of trend and fashion dresses-a, the stark difference is marked between dresses of students from different strata of the economy. This would cause an inferiority complex among children and also promotes bullying. School uniform makes it easy to identify students of a particular school and prevents anyone else from infiltrating into the students and causing violence.

‌Uniforms are keeps the focus of students on studies and will be less concerned about clothes and trends. Wearing uniforms enhances school pride, unity, and community spirit. Uniforms symbolise discipline and encourage decent behaviour.
