Not an easy period for Giacomo Bonaventura who has missed three of the last six league games, two due to suspension and one due to knee pain. The tests he underwent ruled out serious problems but the pain does not go away and yesterday the midfielder Fiorentina had a separate training session The situation is still very stalemate to date Bonaventura&#39;s return for Sunday&#39;s match between Fiorentina and Empoli L which seemed obvious a few days ago is now seriously under discussion
