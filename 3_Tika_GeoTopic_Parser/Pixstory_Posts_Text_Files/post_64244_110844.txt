Well well well Indian Politics is all about drama isn t it And this recent Thackrey Shinde is proving to be a nail biting intense turn of events which is keeping people at the edge of their seats with all the recent developments To give a brief about it the NCP Sena Congress in Maharashtra is facing a major issue with keeping its government intact as Eknath Shinde MLA and Cabinet Minister has rebelled against the Thackrey government due to major ideological issues within the party Shinde with other MLAs has said that it is becoming difficult to work with the NCP led alliance and the party is losing the essence of Hindutva which will adversely affect the future of the party On the one hand where Mr Thackrey thought that it would be easy to restore peace within the party it is becoming extremely difficult to keep the crisis under control And to add to this the Governor of Maharashtra Bhagat Singh Koshyari has asked the Thackrey government to prove his majority on June And if majority prove nahi hui Then the Sena government will be replaced by BJP sigh This comes after seeing that almost MLAs of the party want to exit the government and an appeal filed by the BJP ahem ahem However with futile emotional negotiations and a tired spirit Uddhav Thackrey has resigned today even before the Supreme Court s verdict came on the floor test So now what Kehna mushkil hai kyuki jis politics me aage ke moves pata chal jaye vo politics kaisi Isn t it Nevertheless it would be interesting to watch what happens next whether the Thackrey government will find its way out or the BJP government has a new victory on its card Image source Timesnow Hindi
