From the Turin Olympics in every edition she had won at least one gold medal. won at least one gold in Olympic Games in a row She did it Sure one thing that means a lot to me she said still very excited about the result but I think I haven&#39;t fully realized what I did yet Ask me the same question in ten days and I&#39;ll give you a better answer now i have too many sensations buzzing in my head every time i compete i see the ring on the track and something magical happens years ago this should be his last olympics before he retires but never say never
