This is so annoying! I mean come on! Have some courtesy. We live in a civilised manner.😂
It's especially irritating if the teacher usually grates on you for not answering properly, or it's a subject you're not very good at, and then finally, you know the answer and you what to answer and just as you've raised your hand someone blurts it out🤦‍♀️😂
That's just not cool!
