Located on the Rupshu Plateau in Southern Ladakh, Tso Kar is a breathtaking lake renowned for its size and depth. It is a unique lake, but unfortunately, is not well-featured on the Ladakh itineraries. There is a beauty about the lake which comes from its very difference- 

Tso Kar is a heavily saline lake with weeds, nettles and other lake plants growing within and a tendency to form salt crusts on the outside. Though it is not as large as the Pangong Tso or Tso Moriri, Tso Karâ€™s strength lies in its serenity. 

Since not many people visit the lake, those who do actually end up enjoying a greater level natural beauty in a blessed solitude which the popularity of the two other lakes denies their visitors. Visiting Tso Kar is a wonderful experience while on your Leh Ladakh road trip, and if you really want to know all about the various lake landscapes of Ladakh, a trip to Tso Kar is a must-do.
