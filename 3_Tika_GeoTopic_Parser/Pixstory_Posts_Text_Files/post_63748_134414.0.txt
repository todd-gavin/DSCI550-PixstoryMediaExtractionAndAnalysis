 The second expansion for Turtle Rock Studio’s first person multiplayer shooter is almost here, as Back 4 Blood: Children of the Worm is set to release on August 30. Children of the Worm is scheduled to release as part of the Back 4 Blood Annual Pass, Back 4 Blood: Deluxe Edition, Back 4 Blood: Ultimate Edition, or as a standalone purchase.
The DLC brings with it a new campaign act, new enemies, weapons, skins, and even a new playable character in the form of Prophet Dan, who is integral to the new campaign chapter.
As for the character of Prophet Dan, he will have his own unique abilities, including adding a random effect after reviving a teammate, boosting Team Damage and Resistance, as well as enhanced combat prowess when a teammate has been incapacitated. The developers at Turtle Rock have also confirmed that the new expansion will add eight exclusive character skins and 12 exclusive weapon skins, along with new weapons, accessories, and cards.
For the unversed, here’s the full story description from the Back 4 Blood development team:“The Back 4 Blood story takes place after a catastrophic outbreak where most of humanity has either been killed or infected. Hardened by the unspeakable events and emboldened to fight for humanity, a group of veterans of the apocalypse called the Cleaners have rallied together to take on the parasite-infected horrors known as the Ridden to take back what is left in the world.”
Released last year on October 8, Back 4 Blood is now available now on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One consoles, PS5, PS4, and PC with those having access to Game Pass also being able to play the game.
