It s been no secret for sometime now that Declan Rice is a top talent the country s best teams are trying their best to get hands on For a period of time Manchester City seemed best poised and in position to pay West Ham United s asking price That deal however did not go through and City signed Jack Grealish for the same kind of money in the summer of Now with two seasons remaining on his contract Rice may possibly want to leave the Hammers in pursuit of Champions League football David Moyes team have done incredibly well this season particularly in the Europa league bug Rice wouldn t be to blame if he does decide to make a move to a team that plays consistent Champions League football and competes for the top spots in the Premier league The first thing to say is that he is not for sale Moyes told his pre match press conference ahead of his side s clash with Everton But if you are interested it will be north of that because m m was cheap last summer and m just now would be minimum but he is not for sale The defensive midfielder has been right at the heart of West Ham s success this campaign even playing centre back on occasion I look at what Tottenham did with Harry Kane albeit it in a different way They said no there is a price and if someone wants to pay the price then we d probably do it If they don t then he s not going anywhere That s it they have kept him
