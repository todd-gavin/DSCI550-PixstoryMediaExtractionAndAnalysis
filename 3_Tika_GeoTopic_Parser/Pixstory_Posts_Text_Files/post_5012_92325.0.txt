Events and event marketing are a great way to connect with your existing and potential customers. 

Whether it's a webinar, a conference, a meetup, or an in-person workshop, events allow you to let people know what you're all about and how you can help them.

They're an opportunity for you to be seen in a positive light by the people who matter most: your customers. Events provide you with an opportunity to show off your brand in real-time, as well as build customer trust and rapport by inviting them into your world. They're also a great way to provide customers with value outside of what they can get from your product or service alone.

Plus, they're a lot of fun!

Here are some very quick event-planning tips if you're new to events:

• Do your research. Know your audience. What will they want to know? What don't they know that they need to know? What should you skip over because it will be too basic for them?

• Set goals for yourself and for the event. This could be as simple as "I want people to walk away knowing that I can help them," or "I want attendees to sign up for my free trial."

• Be prepared! Make sure your equipment works and rehearse beforehand.

• If you are doing a live event at a venue, make sure it's is easily accessible.
