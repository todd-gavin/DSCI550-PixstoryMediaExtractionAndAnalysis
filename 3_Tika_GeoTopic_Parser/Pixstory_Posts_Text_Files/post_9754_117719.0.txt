August 8, 1982. 

A line drive foul ball hits a four year old boy in the head at Fenway. Jim Rice, realizing in a flash that it would take EMTs too long to arrive and cut through the crowd, sprang from the dugout and scooped up the boy. 

He laid the boy gently on the dugout floor, where the Red Sox medical team began to treat him.

When the boy arrived at the hospital 30 minutes later, doctors said, without a doubt that Jim's prompt actions saved the boy's life. 

Jim returned to the game in a blood-stained uniform. A real badge of courage. 

After visiting the boy in the hospital, and realizing the family was modest means, he stopped by the business office and instructed that the bill be sent to him.

This is what a sports hero looks like!
