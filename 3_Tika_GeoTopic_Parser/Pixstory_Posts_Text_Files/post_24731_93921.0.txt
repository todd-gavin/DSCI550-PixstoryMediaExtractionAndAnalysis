Thumping win over Olympic Lyon sets stage for semi final against Eintracht Frankfurt, who defeated Barcelona. This is the first time West Ham reached a European Semi final after the 1999 Intertoto win. 



After the first leg 1-1 draw at London stadium, it was a must win situation for the English club at Lyon. Lyon were dominating in the first leg, and they started hitting the upright post, shot from Ekambi beat Areola at first but bounced off. West Ham defended well in their box, without giving much space for Lyon and winning almost aerial balls and crosses. Both Moyes and Bosz used 4-2-3-1 for the match, captain Dembele as striker for Lyon and Antonio for West Ham. 


West Ham were not much in attack in the initial minutes, and there was Bowen with a chance at the back post, which he couldn't turn into a goal. Goal came in the 38th minute from Fornals' corner, which Dawson connected at first post. They doubled their lead in the 44', with a shot from captain Declan Rice, which deflected to defeat Lyon keeper Pollersbeck on its way to the back of the net. 


At half time, Lyon made a double change at Midfield but Fornal's brilliant through ball found Bowen through behind defenders, and his flat shot from just outside the box went past the keeper. Bowen, who has scored in the first leg also, has scored 3 times in 7 matches for West Ham and 15 times in 43 matches in the season. 


Areola kept the goal clean with a fingertip save from Gusto shot, which was otherwise  in its way to goal for sure. West Ham, who have started the season with great performances, are at 6th in the Premier league now. They will be hoping to reach the final and to get glory through Europa league in the season by winning the semi final against Frankfurt, which are scheduled for 28 April (1st leg) and 5th May(2nd leg). Club has won the Premier league but FA cup 3 times (1963-64,1974-75,1979-80) and European Cup winner's cup in 1964-65.
