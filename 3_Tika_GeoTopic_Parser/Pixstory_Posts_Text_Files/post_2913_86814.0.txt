Covid-19 completes two years as a global pandemic. Ever since people became acquainted with the term ‘endemic’, everybody is waiting for the novel coronavirus outbreak to move on to that next phase. Some countries want to call it ‘endemic’ now, despite the WHO warning. What is involved in the change of nomenclature? 

It was on March 11, 2020 that the WHO Director-General had made the announcement, adding, “We should be more aggressive”: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32191675/

Over the next two years, the virus has claimed more than 6 million lives worldwide (nearly 1 million in the US), far more have been affected (though recovered), and life has been disrupted in an unprecedented manner: https://apnews.com/article/covid-pandemic-two-years-later-1fe466bba2353cadde10e4fb40be025c

Where would we look for hope? There’s the vaccine, proven somewhat successful, then there’s the treatment under research, but the most optimistic way out is that Covid-19 should become endemic – a routine, harmless phenomenon like seasonal flu. 

Spain and other European nations are making tentative plans to officially label Covid-19 as endemic: https://www.euronews.com/2022/01/18/spain-to-move-from-treating-covid-19-as-a-pandemic-to-an-endemic 

The WHO, however, has warned against considering the pandemic over: https://www.axios.com/world-health-organization-covid19-endemic-pandemic-425e98f6-bdaf-48da-b832-11f2884c4aad.html

So, the question is, when can we call a disease endemic? In simple terms, when the virus has stabilized and its behavior follows a set pattern. The novel coronavirus, however, is still evolving, and its behavior is not yet predictable: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/two-years-into-the-pandemic-covid-19-still-surprises-experts

But nations are impatient to move on. As long as it is ‘pandemic’, it remains a public health emergency, and must take top priority for resources. If the number of cases – and the mortality rate – seems manageable within a nation for a certain period, it would like to remove the ‘pandemic’ tag. The official decision, though, should come from the WHO.

Also, ‘endemic’ may sound far less malevolent than ‘pandemic’ (hence the high hopes), but that need not be the case. At a social level, yes, the world can come out of the great disruption, but at an individual level, the threat to life may remain. Tuberculosis, HIV and malaria are among those diseases considered endemic in different parts of the world; and they continue to claim lives: https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-spain-world-health-organization-pandemics-6d9e495e0f6dec94acefabeb0a935b8e
