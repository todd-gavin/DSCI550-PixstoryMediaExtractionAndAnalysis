#9) Alfredo di Stefano


Before Pele, Maradona, Messi and Ronaldo announced their arrival on the central stage, it was Alfredo di Stefano who ruled the hearts of the fans. Coming from a poor background, the player went on to become the most prolific scorer in the history of the game. 


Entertaining the fans in Colombia and Argentina in his youth, the player made it to Spain and helped Real Madrid to win eight titles in 11 seasons. In his tenure, he scored 300 goals in less than 400 games. The player could feature on any part of the pitch and still find the back of the net. He was elite with his elite central defending and midfielder skills as well. 


#8) Paolo Maldini


In football, the term “defenders” is synonymous with “Italians”. None of the players could emulate the discipline of the Italians on the pitch. Amongst the best central defenders to ever be a part of the game, Paolo Maldini comes first. The versatile defender played the role of a fulcrum in Italy’s defense for a decade. He participated in four FIFA World Cup tournaments and won 26 trophies with the red half of Milan. His commitment to the defense was second to none. Before he hung up his boots, he helped AC Milan to win seven Serie A titles. 


#7) Zinedine Zidane


People would remember Zidane for his headbutt but on the other hand, the Frenchman was class personified. He marshaled the midfield with his world-class footwork and took the ball out of the tight spaces. One can remember Sir Alex Ferguson mentioning that he could win anything with Zidane and ten logs of wood. Zinedine Zidane was that class player. With his daunting physical presence in the center of the pitch, Zinedine Zidane was a complete package in the midfield for both the French national team and Real Madrid.
