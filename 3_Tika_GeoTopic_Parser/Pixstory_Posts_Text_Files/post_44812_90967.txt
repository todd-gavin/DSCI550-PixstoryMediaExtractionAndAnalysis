Ghana and Nigeria faced off at the MKO Abiola stadium in a world Cup Qualifier on Tuesday night In a game that most would ve expected Nigeria to master Ghana took the plaudits by heroically knocking one of Africa s prominent footballing nations out of contention at this year s World Cup What followed was ugly shameful and not in script with anything the Nigerian FA will have hoped for Hundreds of disappointed Nigerian fans took to the pitch vandalising stadium property getting involved in physical abuse of opposition fans and creating an atmosphere unasked for at one of Nigeria s lowest moments in their recent football history Reports from Abuja suggested that Joseph Kabungo the Doping Officer appointed by the CAF died amidst a stampede Reports of his death however manipulated were true On account of statements made by both the Nigerian FA and the CAF this morning the Zambian s death via Cardiac arrest has been confirmed I was notified and ordered that he should be rushed to the hospital He didn t make it He died just as they got to the hospital I was heading to the dressing room of the Nigerian team when the General Coordinator Kabore Hubert Bosilong from South Africa called my attention Dr Kabungo suddenly started gasping for breath he said Rumours of a stampede and of fans assaulting Kabungo were however false Regardless the aftermath of Tuesday s game was quite obviously bizarre and has no place in football However it is important to state the facts as they are According to the information from our own medical officer Dr Onimisi Ozi Salami who was appointed by Fifa as medical officer for the game Dr Kabungo was found gasping for breath near the dressing room of the Ghanaian team May his soul Rest In Piece
