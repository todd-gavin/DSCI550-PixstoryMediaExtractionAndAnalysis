 We can understand that Fossil fuel subsidies are a key impediment to a transition to a clean energy system They are unlikely to deliver permanent emission reductions to meet climate change targets A shift is necessary to fund the clean energy transition and could heighten the contributions to long term continual emission reductions while generating additional economic and social benefits in particular with jobs public health and gender equality The more taxpayers invest in renewables the bigger the benefits The more taxpayers foster fossil fuels and nuclear power the greater the burdens We need a shift to stop accelerating the climate crisis and harming public health Even if the cost of the renewable source is low carbon technologies are still operating with an infrastructure a utility regulatory system a power grid a highway system a combustion engine centric fueling system built for a world powered by fossil fuels These massive infrastructure projects were built up with public sector support including tax credits low cost loans and outright donations from the federal government So if we keep both the fuels we cannot see a visible change in the climate crisis We also have examples like Germany which put in place strong incentives in the early part of this decade to motivate demand for solar modules encourage installations of wind farms and support the biofuels industry
