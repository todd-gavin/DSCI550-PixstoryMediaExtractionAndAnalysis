Football is a team game and passing is the most important part of it Individually it is not possible to excel in football and passing is much needed to achieve victory Everyone can kick the ball but it takes a lot of skill to kick the ball accurately towards your team mate Tips to improve PASSING ACCURACY CONTACT POINT Using the inside of the foot to kick the ball while leaning a little bit forward during performing a pass will create weight and accuracy in the pass AMOUNT OF POWER The amount of power should be decided depending upon the distance between you and your team mate For short distance just push the ball whereas for long distance Swing the leg backwards before hitting the ball with power FIELD AWARENESS After receiving a pass and then having the view of the field will take a lot of time and may cause loss in possession on the ball You should always check your shoulder while playing for taking the view of the field so that you are now aware of where your players and opponents are positioned It will be so easy to play a pass to any player you want AREAL PASS OR GROUNDED PASS The choice between the both depends on the distance and the position of the opponents If you want to play a pass to a distant player and there is opponent in between then always go for areal pass as it will be harder to intercept the ball for the opponents When in short distance play a grounded pass with little power Whereas in long distance play a short pass only when no opponent is near by the trajectory of the ball Try Focusing on the passing attribute Passing seems to be a very easy skill but it is the most important one Always add passing drills in the training sessions The coaches or managers of the teams should add RONDO game as well in the training sessions Thankyou
