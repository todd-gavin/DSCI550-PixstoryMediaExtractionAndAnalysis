Today Marcell Jacobs will return to Italy and after missing the Nairobi meeting due to a gastrointestinal virus, high fever and also bouts of vomiting and dysentery, he will put himself in the hands of the Fidal doctors to understand the extent of the viral attack and to understand if and when he will be able to return to run The goal of being there in May in Savona where I will run the meters for the first time but still early to understand if I will make it The troubles for Jacobs and his physiotherapist started the evening before the race in Nairobi It would have been the first opportunity to see him again in the distance with which he won the gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics instead he spent several hours in the hospital before resting and recovering enough to be able to face the long journey back to Rome Tired and debilitated Marcell just wants to rest and to sleep He has already canceled a series of commitments scheduled for the next few days and as soon as we arrive in Rome we will undergo the necessary tests to verify to what extent the virus has affected him and to rule out that even I, although I don&#39;t show any symptoms, am involved The words collected by La Gazzetta dello Sport from Paolo Camossi the sprinter&#39;s coach He will be taken care of by Dr. Ferrario, a Fidal doctor I would preach caution but it depends on when he will be able to get back on his feet and then return to training Usually in situations like this about a week is lost The from Savona are on the calendar in ten days Marcell will have to reintegrate drink lots of fruit juices and stay calm The advice is not to hurry
