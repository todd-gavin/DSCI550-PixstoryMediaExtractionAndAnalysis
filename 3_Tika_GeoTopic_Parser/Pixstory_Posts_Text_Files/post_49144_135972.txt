Children today are growing up in a world of constant technology They re always carrying their phones with them and they re constantly using computers and other devices I strongly believe that children should not be allowed to have too many devices or for that matter until a certain age even a phone It s important for parents to set good examples for their children and to ensure that they re getting the most out of their time online One way to do this is by encouraging them to play outside instead Playing outside allows children to develop healthy social skills problem solve and learn about the world around them It also helps them learn how to take care of themselves in case of an emergency Playing outside also helps stimulate their imaginations something that can be vital as they begin exploring different career paths later on in life Ultimately it s important for parents to encourage their children to spend as much time as possible outdoors it s one of the best ways that they can grow into happy responsible adults
