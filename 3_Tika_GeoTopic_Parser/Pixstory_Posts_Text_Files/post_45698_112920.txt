NASA TV reported that H is a quasar powered by a supermassive black hole located about billion light years from Earth Astronomers used NASA s Chandra X ray Observatory to determine the spin of the black hole in H making it the most massive one to have an accurate measurement of this fundamental property as described in our press release Astronomers estimate the actively growing black hole in H contains between about three and billion solar masses making it one of the most massive known By contrast the supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way galaxy weighs about four million suns This composite image of H contains X rays from Chandra blue that have been combined with radio data from NSF s Karl G Jansky Very Large Array red and an optical image from the PanSTARRS telescope on Hawaii white and yellow The researchers used nearly a week s worth of Chandra observing time taken over two decades ago to obtain this latest result The supermassive black hole is located in the bright dot in the center of the radio and X ray emission Because a spinning black hole drags space around with it and allows matter to orbit closer to it than is possible for a non spinning one the X ray data can show how fast the black hole is spinning The spectrum that is the amount of energy as a function wavelength of H indicates that the black hole is rotating at a modest rate compared to other less massive ones that spin close to the speed of light This is the most accurate spin measurement for such a massive black hole
