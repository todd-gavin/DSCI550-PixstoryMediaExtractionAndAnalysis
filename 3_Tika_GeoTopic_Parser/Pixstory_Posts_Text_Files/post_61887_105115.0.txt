Charlie Puth "accidentally" confirmed that he is collabing with BTS. 

ARMYs have been speculating that it is likely that Charlie could be working with BTS on a new song. Now, with this seemingly confirmation, fans are impatiently waiting for BTS to drop the release date.

Charlie's collab with BTS comes off of heels of his collab with Jungkook of BTS on a version of Charlie's 2017 hit with Selena Gomez "We don't talk anymore"

When asked about the speculations, Charlie told to a backstage interviewer at KIIS FM Wango Tango 2022 that he heard about the speculation, and that neither he nor anyone from his camp knows anything about the release date. 

Whether this was a sleep up or a well designed plan on Puth and his management's end is for the fans to speculate. 

Upon asking to provide further details, Puth went seemingly silent about the whole thing. 

ARMYs took this opportunity to tease Charlie and draw parallels with how RM/Namjoon of BTS slips up like this, often times revealing details that he wasn't supposed to share. 

Fans of both the artists are eagerly waiting for more details to come out and anticipation for the song just keeps on building.
