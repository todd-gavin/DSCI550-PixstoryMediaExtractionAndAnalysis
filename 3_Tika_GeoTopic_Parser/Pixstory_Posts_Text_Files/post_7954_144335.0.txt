A firm called Henley and Partners has taken upon itself to track the wealthiest cities in the world.
New York is #1, predictably. Followed by the usual suspects Tokyo, SF, London, Singapore and LA.
But more interestingly, the report lists Mumbai as among the "wealthiest cities of the future".
India's financial capital apparantly has 60,600 resident millionaires, 243 centi-millionaires, and 30 billionaires. 
It currently ranks 25th globally in the wealthiest cities list.
I wish someone juxtaposes these findings with a report tracking the homeless and the poor. 
Mumbai may be an "emerging" wealthiest city but just one visit and anyone can see in the squalor that it has already emerged as among the most unequal.
