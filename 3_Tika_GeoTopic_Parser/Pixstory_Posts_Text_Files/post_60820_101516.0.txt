Well, an NFT to start with. The app I used here is feasible and takes less storage. Good for basics and to start with art, photo, drawing, sketch...NFT stands for Non-Fungi token, pics, images, gaming, and videos are stored and shared using blockchain. The transaction can be done also in cryptocurrencies or in without them. The Open sea is the largest marketplace and Go art is one of the greatest apps till now to deal with. That's all till now. Thanks. See ya next time. Take care.
