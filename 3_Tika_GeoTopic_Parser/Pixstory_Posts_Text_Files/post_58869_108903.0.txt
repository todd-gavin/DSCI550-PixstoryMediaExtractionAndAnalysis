While the all-new Mahindra Scorpio will undoubtedly be larger than the current-generation Scorpio, a leaked brochure suggests that it will also be larger than the Tata Safari. The new Scorpio N is 4662mm long, 1917mm wide, and 1870mm tall, with a 2750mm wheelbase and 200mm of ground clearance projected. The Tata Safari, on the other hand, is 4,661mm long, 1,894mm wide, and 1,786mm tall. The new Scorpio N is 206mm longer, 97mm broader, and 125mm shorter than the current-generation Scorpio thanks to these proportions.

The SUV will also have an unique controller for the four-wheel-drive system's 4-Xplor knob, which will only be available in the top-spec optional four-wheel-drive variants. The new Scorpio-N will have four different 4X4 settings. There is no information on whether the low-ratio transfer case is available. However, it's quite likely that Mahindra will only offer the low-ratio transfer case with the Thar, which is only off-road competent.

Rear Penta-link suspension with Frequency Selective Dampers will be used by Mahindra (FSD). On terrible road surfaces, the FSD minimises the horizontal movement of the car. According to the leaked material, the new Scorpio's high-speed handling, turning, and road manners are far superior to the current-generation car.
