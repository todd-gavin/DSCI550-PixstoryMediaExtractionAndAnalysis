On the 24th of August, more than two weeks into the Premier League season, Manchester City will travel to the Camp Nou for a charity friendly against Barcelona.

Pep Guardiola, the City manager, and Joan Laporta, the president of Barcelona, spoke at a press conference at his former club on Monday to confirm the match. Juan Carlos Unzué, the club's former goalkeeper and coach, who was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) two years ago, joined them. The game's earnings will go to Fundación Luzón, an ALS research organisation.

The match will take place when the Premier League season begins, with City visiting Newcastle United on the weekend of August 20-21, followed by a match against Crystal Palace the following week. Despite this, Guardiola insisted on bringing a quality squad to Catalonia, prompting Laporta to suggest Bernardo Silva, who has been linked with a summer transfer to Barcelona.
