One of the many reasons I prefer to travel solo is this. I hate when people cancel on you like that.🤦🏻‍♂️

Especially last minute. I think it's so rude to cancel plans last minute because people have already prepared for you being there. I personally hate when people do that. Y'all ever feel that too?
