With lots of joy and celebration, we welcomed Lord Ganesha today on the auspicious occasion of Ganesha Chaturthi. Chanting mantras, we offered him laddoos, incense, and garlands of red flowers and doob grass. 
The doob grass, Lord Ganesha's favourite, has cooling properties and health benefits. It is believed that once while fighting a demon, Lord Ganesha swallowed it, which gave him immense burning in his abdomen. Lord Vishnu gave his lotus Lord Shiva tied his cobra to his belly but nothing helped. Finally a group of sages placed 21 leaves of Doob on his head. Miraculously the burn ebbed. Thus Lord Ganesha 
declared that whoever worshipped him with Doob leaves will receive his blessings forever. 
It is also believed we should not look at the moon today. Chandra was cursed by Lord Ganesha because he laughed at him. According to the curse, Chandra would lose his luster and no longer have any use. 
Chandra was afraid and pleaded for mercy. Lord Ganesha finally conceded. But curses cannot be reversed, only altered. So Ganesha wore moon on his forehead, and on this day we should not look at 
the moon as it is a reminder that arrogance will lead to one's downfall. Hence he is also called Balachandra, the boy who wore the moon. 
On this auspicious occasion, may Lord Ganesh bless all of us with eternal bliss and prosperity. May he 
destroy all our obstacles and guide us in our new beginnings.
