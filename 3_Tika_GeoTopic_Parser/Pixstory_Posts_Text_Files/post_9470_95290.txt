Sisterhood is the story of Jana and Maya teenagers more or less representing Macedonian Gen Z culture They are close friends who swim and party together Their mobiles blink day and night exchanging everything around Both families are typical in chasing and advising them But they are teenagers in the social media age they chase their pleasures no matter what On such a day at a party Maya is dumped by her crush despite Jana s attempts to make them closer Maya is just evolving from her reserved nature and a rejection turns heavy in her heart Elena a girl much sought after by boys also by her crush becomes their worst enemy Anything against her would be the duo s first priority Sisterhood s storyline takes a major shift here Dina Duma in her first feature film takes a classical approach It s a straightforward movie Jana and Maya are our regular teenagers I couldn t spot things they do beyond our imagination What s impressive is our undivided attention Camera connects us along with the characters Especially all good and bad scenarios in this film are happening around water bodies When thinking of fluctuating teenagers that was a brilliant technique applied by Dina Sex on the verge of adulthood is another layer of Sisterhood Your close friend can be deceiving at any point Desire to win and prove invokes the devil in teenagers Relationships turn toxic in no time When secrets are mutual the rule game by the dominant never wins Last scene of Sisterhood is remarkable in this context where I even thought there would be a sequel We are left with an unfinished feel Social media influences drive the theme when portraying a teenage story Videotaping bullying forceful revenge plots etc are not new to us still you would feel them bit heavy in Sisterhood I am totally impressed by the sisterhood and enmity of debutants Jana Mia Giraud and Maya Antonija Belazelkoska in this film They force you to ignore other flaws of the film
