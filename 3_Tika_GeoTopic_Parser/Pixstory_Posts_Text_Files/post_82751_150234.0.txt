Time Machine : The perfect story of time by H G wells
As many of them said that this book is great, I also feel the same because this book tells about the time traveler who traveled to the future. In the future, he saw some purple crewed people and the Morlocks, these are two different species in the future of the story. Thinking like this is great, some people may write very artificially like people are very intelligent, nothing to eat, etc... in the future of the story but H.G Wells wrote Fantastic showing interest in the readers to read the book.AÂ  9/10 book. A great book to read.
