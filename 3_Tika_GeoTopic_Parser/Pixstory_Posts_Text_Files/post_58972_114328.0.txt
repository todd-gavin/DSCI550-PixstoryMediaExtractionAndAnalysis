On Thursday, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann married Gurpreet Kaur, a doctor, in his Chandigarh home. Arvind Kejriwal, the mayor of Delhi, arrived at Mann's house for the wedding. Before leaving for Chandigarh, Kejriwal spoke to the media and wished Mann a happy marriage as he "embarks on a new path."

Mann's home was more heavily guarded when visitors began to arrive. Raghav Chadha, a Rajya Sabha member, was among the first to arrive.

Mann has been married twice. Kaur is the youngest of three sisters and holds an MBBS from Maharishi Markandeshwar University in Mullana, Ambala. Given that Mann's mother Harpal Kaur is connected with Kaur's family, it seems likely that the marriage was arranged.
