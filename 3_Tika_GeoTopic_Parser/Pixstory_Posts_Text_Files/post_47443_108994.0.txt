Barcelona have set themselves for a grand summer after using economic levers to come out of
the financial troubles. They are in talks with Cesar Azpilicueta, Marcos Alonso, Angel di Maria
and other attackers.

They are also in talks to sign Brazilian winger Raphinha from Elland Road
outfit. According to the reports, the Premier League outfit has set a huge price to sell him as
they avoided relegation.

The Brazilian has been strongly linked with a summer move to Camp Nou after another

next destination for the 25-year-old, but it has also been reported that Leeds won't let him go for
less than Â£47 million
