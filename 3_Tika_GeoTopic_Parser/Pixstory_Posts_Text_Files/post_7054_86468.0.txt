In Manipur, the trends show that the BJP is all set to emerge as the single largest party but may fall short of touching the halfway mark, according to the data released by the Election Commission of India at about 4.00 p.m.

Out of the total 60 seats, the status was known for 46 seats in which the BJP has emerged as the single largest party with leads in 22 seats, Janata Dal (United) and National People’s Party has secured leads in 6 seats each, the Naga People’s Front in 5 seats and the Congress in just 3 seats.

With the counting underway, Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh of the BJP seems to have won his seat in Heingang with a comfortable total of 24268 votes and former Chief Minister Ibobi Singh of the Congress was seen leading in the Thoubal constituency with 14324 votes.

The Assembly polls in Manipur were conducted in two phases on February 28 and March 5. In 2017, the Congress had emerged as the single largest party in Manipur but the BJP later stitched a coalition with the NPP, NPF and the LJP and formed the government.

However, during 2022, the BJP and its former allies, National People’s Party (NPP) and the Naga People’s Front (NPF) fought the elections separately.
