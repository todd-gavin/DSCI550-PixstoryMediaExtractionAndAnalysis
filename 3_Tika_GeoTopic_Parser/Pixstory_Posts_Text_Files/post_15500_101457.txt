The proposal by the president of the Lombardy Region Attilio Fontana to position the maxi screen in Piazza Citta di Lombardia to allow Milan fans to watch the match on Sunday would be fine for me then it is clear that the authorization is given to them by the police headquarters but it could be an absolutely adequate The mayor of Milan Giuseppe Sala explained it on the sidelines of a press conference at the Gallery of Modern Art, commenting on the proposal of the Lombard governor The real problem is that to do things you have to request them and Milan must do it I also explained it to Scaroni he knows very well he added If Milan requests it, I can certainly lend a hand for this giant screen Fontana&#39;s proposal is good To the journalists who asked him if he was worried about any tensions that could arise between fans on Sunday the mayor replied I don&#39;t believe At the moment the situation is quite calm, I see more of an organizational problem than a safety one, he said. The fact that there is a team that wins the Italian Cup and one that wins the Scudetto is not bad for the city, he added, speaking of how the championship went. Then the fact of having two teams in the Champions League and having matches that attract tourists is a very very good thing for the city and for the hotels There is a rivalry but Milan is better than another team
