Constitutional Adviser to Bikaner continues...

While these negotiations were going on, the Maharaja of Bikaner, asked me to see the Maharaja of Jodhpur on one of my trips to Abu. 

I accordingly landed at Jodhpur where I was met by Shri Jai Narain Vyas, then the Prime Minister of Jodhpur. It transpired that the Maharaja was not in town and I could not meet him. I talked to Mr. Jai Narain Vyas on all matters on which he sought my advice. 

The question that they wanted to discuss was the merger of the three States of Jaipur, Jodhpur and Bikaner with the Rajasthan Union. Another question which was common to the two states and needed solution was regarding the status and position of the Jagirdars. 

The Maharaja of Jodhpur did not like the Maharaja of Bikaner inviting his Prime Minister, Jai Narain Vyas, to Bikaner for the negotiations he was having with the Praja MandaI. I was commissioned to explain to the Maharaja of Jodhpur that Bikaner Praja Parishad people wanted the advice of Jai Narain Vyas and Gokal Bhai Bhatt and that was why the Maharaja had invited them. 

On the 18th May 1948 Mr. V. Shankar, Private Secretary to Sardar Patel wrote to me as under: 

“I enclose a copy of the letter which Sardar has written to His Highness of Bikaner. Sardar feels that East Punjab High Court requires strengthening and your presence there, particularly in view of the likelihood of the vacancy of the Chief Justice, would be necessary. In any case if you are in the East Punjab High Court you can be considered for the other provinces as well. On the whole he feels that it is in your own interest to revert to the East Punjab High Court.”
