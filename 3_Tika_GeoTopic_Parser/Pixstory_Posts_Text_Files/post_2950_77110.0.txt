It is called the 'nuclear option' if Russia invades Ukraine. And Russia is convinced that the U.S. and NATO will not use the option. But according to media reports, disconnecting Russia from the international banking system SWIFT is being mulled as one of the measures if Russia goes ahead and invades its neighbour.

Swift is an acronym for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. It is one standard system for the world that securely connects and helps in interactions between more than 11,000 global financial institutions and companies. It is estimated that the system sends 42 million messages a day which are basically about almost all the transactions like payment orders, currency exchanges etc. In other words, without this, it is almost impossible to be connected to the global banking system.

If the U.S. and other Western powers decide to force SWIFT to remove Russia, experts say that Vladimir Putin could be staring a long tunnel of financial ruin. 
Iran is touted as an example of an economy that was removed from SWIFT. The economy has not been able to recover that one single move. 

According to Russian officials, the governments will not ahead with such as a move as it could undermine SWIFT itself. At the same time, Russian officials say that their own system to transfer financial data is strong enough to withstand the problems that may arise if the country is disconnected.

Russia and China have been planning to break the Western dominance of SWIFT by having their own system. For instance, in November 2019, the head of the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) announced plans to establish a new payments system to rival SWIFT. But those plans haven't taken off so far.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told his country's parliament that the U.K. and the U.S. are discussing the possibility of banning Russia from SWIFT if Russia invades Ukraine, having amassed over 100,000 troops on the border.
