“I am very happy to be back home -  because that is how I feel here, at home. I am extremely delighted. 

“It was always a pleasure to receive messages from Juventus fans when I was in England. My focus was completely on Manchester United, but I missed the fans here. Juve supporters are special, they really get behind the team. 

“When I was at Man Utd I kept in touch with Mister Allegri. He was my coach here the first time, and we enjoyed some great moments together. I’ve always had a good relationship with him. He is the right man here and this was the right moment for me to come back.

“My heart chose Juve for me. I felt inside that this was where I wanted to come and that’s when the decision was made.”
