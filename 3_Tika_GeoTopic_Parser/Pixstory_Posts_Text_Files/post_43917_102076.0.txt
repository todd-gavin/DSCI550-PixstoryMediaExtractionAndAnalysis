Looking back at Arsenal’s season, central defender Rob Holding was pleased with the progress the club has made on and off the pitch. Arsenal finished the season in 5th with 69 points, their highest points tally since 2018/19. After a season’s absence, they are back in the Europa League.

“Yeah I think the progress this year especially has been massive.” Holding remarked. While there is certainly disappointment in the Arsenal camp to have let Champions League football slip through their fingers, it is important to note that the club is moving along in the right direction.

Holding said the fans have especially played a big part this year, having them back after two years of covid certainly has helped the team a lot. The connection with them is stronger than ever and the fans fully back the team and the manager.

There is a growing sense of optimism at Arsenal over the club's future under Mikel Arteta.
