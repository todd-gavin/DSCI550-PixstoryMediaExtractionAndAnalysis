Regina Spektor is a famous pianist, singer and songwriter born in Russia but had to migrate to America due to severe oppression of Jews in Russia.

‌She was recognised for her fourth album, Begin to Hope and attained a Gold certification by the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America)

‌Due to her popularity and eminence in music Mayor Bill de Blasio declared June 11, 2019, Regina Spektor Day in New York City.
‌
‌She was born in to a musical Russian-Jewish family. When she was 9 year old, her family had to leave Soviet Union. It was the period of Perestroika, when Soviet citizens had the license to emigrate. Her passion for piano studies led her parents to ponder on not leaving the Soviet Union, but they eventually had to emigrate due to the harsh ethnic, racial and political discrimination faced by Jews. 
‌
‌Later, the Spektor family was admitted to the United States as refugees with the help of HIAS (the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society). Her condition after migration was so comforting for her passion, she couldn't afford her piano. She had a time when she had to play on tabletops to remember the notes. 

‌She has made a strong statement on Russia-Ukraine war: "Today my heart hurts because no matter how many great works of art and music (Guernica.... Masters Of War... Most of Okudzhava and Vysotsky... Vonnegut... Remarque... all those films in all those languages...) portray the horrors of war, new Masters of War seem to rise up again in all the nations... Sending new children to slaughter each other," She wrote on Instagram.
‌
‌There were, and still are, real Nazis in the world," Spektor added. "But in Ukraine that are just millions of civilians being pulled into a war, and in Russia there are children being sent to fight and die for no reason other than the bottomless and horror filled 'more more more more more more more' of politicians and corporations. And it's terrifying."
‌
‌She is an inspiration to millions with her statement to 'the Guardian': "I worried I’d be a mother and not an artist. Now I want to scream at women: You can be both".
