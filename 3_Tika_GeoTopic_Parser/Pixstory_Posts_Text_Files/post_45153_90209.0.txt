Lionel Messi has an illustrious international track record.

No South American player has found the back of the net more times for his country than the Barcelona legend. Yes, even the great Pele is included.

Messi scored Argentina's 81st goal in the team's recent 3-0 home victory over Venezuela in 2022 World Cup qualifying.

Only Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal, 115 goals), Ali Daei (Iran, 109 goals), Mokhtar Dahari (Malaysia, 89 goals), and Ferenc Puskas (Hungary, 84 goals) have scored more goals in men's international football history.

Messi has not only scored a lot of goals for Argentina, but he has also contributed a lot of assists â€“ 47 to be exact.

However, that impressive total does not place him at the top of the list of international assists by a single player in the twenty-first century.
Messi must settle for second place in that category, with his PSG teammate Neymar taking the gold medal.

The ten international players with the most assists in the twenty-first century:


Neymar (Brazil)

Games: 116 | Assists: 51


Lionel Messi (Argentina)

Games: 159 | Assists: 47


Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal)

Games: 184 | Assists: 41


Mesut Ozil (Germany)

Games: 92 | Assists: 40


Kevin De Bruyne (Belgium)

Games: 85 | Assists: 39


Eden Hazard (Belgium)

Games: 115 | Assists: 34


David Beckham (England)

Games: 81 | Assists: 32


Dries Mertens (Belgium)

Games: 101 | Assists: 31


Cesc Fabregas (Spain)

Games: 110 | Assists: 31


Wesley Sneijder (Holland)

Games: 134 | Assists: 31


Neymar's international record is truly obscene. In addition to his 51 assists, Brazil's talisman has scored 71 goals, which will almost certainly surpass Pele's total of 77 before calling it a day with the national team.

While Neymar leads the way in assists, he does not have the best assists-per-game record among the players mentioned above.
