A thrilling free to play cross platform multiplayer War Thunder is one of the most awesome if at times ridiculously irritating experiences being pretty much the ultimate weapons simulator For a game that came out ten years ago Gajjin Entertainment s Massively Multiplayer Online MMO is really appealing balancing out the video game and realistic elements side by side For those fascinated with armoured weapons platforms and combat War Thunder is the ultimate go to game providing history as well details regarding the armour weaponry engine etc Boasting great graphics and physics the game is a massive but ultimately rewarding grind However the thing that makes you want to stay is that every battle is different in some way or another even if it is on the same map From its combat to its damage model War Thunder unlike World Of Tanks plays out more like a proper simulator with a fine balance between gaming and realism unlike the former which plays out more like an arcade For a new player the game with all its details might seem rather overwhelming at first but the devs at Gaijin have very cleverly placed various tips tricks and hints all around the game to make it more of an engaging challenge rather than hardcore headache This includes tutorials for each vehicle category jotting down the basics and showing you how to get yourself started Furthermore in some cases you can also earn in game currency for doing it too which is a good incentive The game features several countries all which include at least a list of aircraft tank and battle ships to choose from Each nation has their own set of unique vehicles all of which are played differently even if some share a design similarity Above all War Thunder is a game of observation thinking learning and strategizing with these four things forming the crux of how you play the game You have to learn how to play the vehicle you chose you have to watch your enemy learn about their vehicles and how to fight them as well as about the various maps and game modes
