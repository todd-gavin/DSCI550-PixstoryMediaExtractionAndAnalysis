Do u guys adjust the column width and row height of excel sheet manually??????
It's definitely time taking when u have many rows and columns.🥴
There's an easy way to auto fit the column width and row height of the whole excel sheet....
1. Ctl+A (select all cells)
2. Alt+H+O+A  (for adjusting row height)
3. Alt+H+O+I  (for adjusting column width)
And done 😁
