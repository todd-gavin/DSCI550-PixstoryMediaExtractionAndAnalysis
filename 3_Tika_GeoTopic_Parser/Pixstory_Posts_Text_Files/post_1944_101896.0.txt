Elon Musk was recently accused of sexual assault. He is alleged to have exposed himself to a flight attendant. He responded by saying, "If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light.‚Äù He Kama called the story a "politically motivated hit piece."

Why is it always the case that whenever some controversy happens to a public figure - regardless of their political party - a sexual assault allegation follows? Allegations of sexual assault have been weaponized by the media, politicians, and the public to ruin careers.

Sexual assault allegations are so powerful because of two reasons. First, there are generally no witnesses to them, so the decision ultimately rests in the accused credibility and likeability. Second, particularly when it comes to wealthy and powerful individuals, we have been conditioned to more easily believe that they would have abused their money and power.

Whatever the truth of the matter is, one thing is certain: the timing is very suspect. Elon Musk has been a powerful figure for some time now. One would think that these allegations would have come to light years ago.
