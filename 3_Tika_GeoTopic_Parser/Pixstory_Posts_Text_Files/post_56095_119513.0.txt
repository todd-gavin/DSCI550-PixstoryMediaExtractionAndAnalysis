They Flee From Me

BY SIR THOMAS WYATT

They flee from me that sometime did me seek
With naked foot, stalking in my chamber.
I have seen them gentle, tame, and meek,
That now are wild and do not remember
That sometime they put themself in danger
To take bread at my hand; and now they range,
Busily seeking with a continual change.

Thanked be fortune it hath been otherwise
Twenty times better; but once in special,
In thin array after a pleasant guise,
When her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,
And she me caught in her arms long and small;
Therewithall sweetly did me kiss
And softly said, “Dear heart, how like you this?”

It was no dream: I lay broad waking.
But all is turned thorough my gentleness
Into a strange fashion of forsaking;
And I have leave to go of her goodness,
And she also, to use newfangleness.
But since that I so kindly am served 

They Flee from Me’ is a short lyric poem written by Sir Thomas Wyatt. Some analysts have indicated that the poem could be autobiographical and pertaining to any of Wyatt’s affairs with women of the court of Henry VIII. Nevertheless, the lyrical voice is a dramatic first person that conveys impressions and complaints about a a loved one who left him.
