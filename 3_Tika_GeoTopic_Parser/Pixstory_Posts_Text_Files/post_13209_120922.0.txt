The Italian Foreign Ministry announced on Monday that the first group of Afghan refugees, which includes 300 people, entered Italy from Iran and Pakistan as part of the "Humanitarian Corridor" project.

This corridor will allow more refugees to enter this country who have fled from Afghanistan due to the fear of the Taliban.

The Italian Foreign Ministry said that the aim of this plan is to help "asylum seekers and persecuted Afghans to live with dignity and security here in the future", which was taken from them by the arrival of the Taliban in Afghanistan.

In the framework of this project, which was created in cooperation with Italian and international charity organizations, the Italian government intends to help settle 1,200 Afghan immigrants from Iran, Pakistan and other countries neighboring Afghanistan in Italy. In this settlement plan, priority is given to Afghan women and children.

 The number of Afghan refugees who are smuggled into Italy is increasing. According to UN statistics, 3280 Afghan refugees have reached this country by sea this year. According to this organization, Afghans now constitute the majority of asylum seekers who take the dangerous sea route to enter Europe.

In the past few years, the Italian government has tried to create legal entry routes for refugees so that they are not forced to make dangerous smuggling journeys. However, few of these asylum seekers have been able to reach this country through the intended route of Italy.

Italian authorities say that they saved more than 1,100 refugees from drowning in the Mediterranean Sea in the last 2 days.
