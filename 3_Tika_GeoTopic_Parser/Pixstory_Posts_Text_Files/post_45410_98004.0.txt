For a long time, the Serbian international midfielder has been linked with a lucrative move to Old
Trafford.

Mateja Kezman, the agent of Lazio player Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, has reacted to rumors that
his client wants to join Manchester United, calling the statements attributed to him "false news."

The Serbian international has been linked with a move to Manchester United for some time, with
eye-catching displays in Italy hinting at a big-money move to England.

Milinkovic-Savic has been mentioned in transfer rumors as a possible replacement for Paul
Pogba in the past. With the Frenchman's contract set to end in the summer, discussions have
taken place at Old Trafford about how to go on without him.

The midfield is one of the areas that United intend to improve this summer. According to 90min,
Declan Rice of West Ham United is the favorite prospect, while Ruben Neves of Wolves joins
Milinkovic-Savic on a long list of probable replacements.

PSG is said to be concentrating on Pogba, with Milinkovic-Savic being one of several other
players under consideration.

Former Chelsea striker Kezman, who currently represents his fellow Serbian, was said to be in
talks with Manchester United and Ligue 1 powers Paris Saint-Germain about a summer move,
with Old Trafford emerging as a preferred destination.

Sergej has no shortage of proposals for the summer market," Kezman stated of the interest in
Milinkovic-Savic, according to Foot01.

"We're in talks with Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain right now." Sergej wants to join
Manchester United, but he is focused on the season finale with Lazio."

The Red Devils are looking for another combative midfielder, and Declan Rice of West Ham has
emerged as a key target.

It's possible that Milinkovic-Savic is being considered by a team that is gearing up to welcome
Dutch coach Erik ten Hag into their dugout at the conclusion of the season, but rumors of official
talks have been debunked.
