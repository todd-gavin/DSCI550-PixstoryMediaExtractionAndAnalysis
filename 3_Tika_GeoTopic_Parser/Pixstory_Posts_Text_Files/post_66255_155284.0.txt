The Matrix Reloaded ramps up the action and adds more to the lore of The Matrix universe but it also takes away some of the intrigue.  Morpheus has turned into a preacher rather than the mysterious "Master" of the first film and the love story between Neo and Trinity, the kissing scene, the sex scenes, the rave party etc. take the film too far out of its sci-fi genre for me.  That's not to say it's a bad film, any scenes inside the Matrix itself are still exciting and some of the design choices I found quite unique.  For example,  little things like the computers in the security(?) room within Zion are pretty cool and look like living blueprints on a white background - haven't seen anything like it before of since. The fights in this film are good, but not quite as smooth as the first film, and there is an overeliance on CGI for some of the action which makes certain scenes look terrible (Neo vs all the Agent Smith's comes immediately to mind) - the CGI has not aged well!  The storyline involving Agent Smith becoming a "virus" is smart and I really enjoyed the Locksmith idea but there was a lot going on in this film when you think about it, I personally feel some of the twists could of waited till the next film but anyway I'm not the director!  My favourite characters in this film however have to be the Twins and their power of intangibility - effectively becoming ghosts!  The freeway chase scene is the standout of the film however and arguably contains the best stunt sequences in the whole trilogy!  Just a shame the movie feels a bit sluggish in getting to it.
Final verdict: Any scenes outside of The Matrix felt boring, the CGI is incredibly dated now and the overall film feels a bit too slow for me.  But, it also has some incredible stunts, good martial arts sequences and thought provoking, if not confusing, dialouge.  It's a good sequel, but, the first film is better.
