Thanks to the expertise in cardiac physiology and optical microscopy present within the National Institute of Optics of the National Research Council Cnr Ino of the University of Florence and the European Laboratory of non-linear spectroscopy Lens, a new protection mechanism was discovered which the heart applies in the presence of ventricular tachycardias The work published in the journal Basic Research in Cardiology has demonstrated how in the presence of rapid rhythms in the heart complex electrical oscillations are established which lead to the resynchronization of the heart rhythm, in other words a sort of self-defibrillation Our heart contracts with rhythms regular thanks to a sequence of electrical impulses called action potentials Cardiac arrhythmias are alterations in the frequency and propagation of these impulses Among the various cardiac arrhythmias we find ventricular tachycardia in which the heart rate is significantly increased explains Leonardo Sacconi first researcher of the Cnr Ino Quest the latter is a dangerous type of arrhythmia as it can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation with fatal outcomes Researchers have studied the electrical dynamics underlying ventricular tachycardia also going to explore what measures the heart takes to counteract arrhythmias We have observed that the electrical signals precede the spontaneous termination of a ventricular tachycardia they are characterized by an oscillatory dynamic of impulses of different duration from one beat to another called alternans explains Valentina Biasci first author of the study and research fellow at the Lens Exploiting optogenetics an emerging technique that allows to manipulate the electrical activity of the heart through the use of light it was possible to amplify the oscillatory dynamics during ventricular tachycardias
