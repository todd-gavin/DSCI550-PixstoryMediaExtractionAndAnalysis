C Newman F P Dunne Abstract Aims Patient reported outcomes PROs are reports of the patient s health status that come directly from the patient without interpretation by the clinician or anyone else They are increasingly used in randomised controlled trials RCTs In this systematic review we identified RCTs conducted in women with diabetes in pregnancy which included PROs in their primary or secondary outcomes We then evaluated the quality of PRO reporting against an internationally accepted reporting framework Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials CONSORT PRO guidelines Methods We searched online databases for studies published using a combination of keywords Two authors reviewed all abstracts independently Data on study characteristics and the quality of PRO reporting were extracted from relevant studies We conducted a multiple regression analysis to identify factors associated with high quality reporting Results We identified citations Thirty five articles were included for review Only of RCTs included a PRO as a primary or secondary outcome Out of a maximum score of the median score was indicating sub optimal reporting A multiple regression analysis did not reveal any factors associated with high quality reporting Conclusions Researchers should be mindful of the importance of PRO inclusion and reporting and include reliable PROs in trials Sources
