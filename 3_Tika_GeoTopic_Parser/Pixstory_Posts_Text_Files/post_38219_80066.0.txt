As per Daily Mail, the video was taken at 7 pm on Sunday (6th February, UK time). Jack Grealish who clearly looks drunk can be seen along with Riyad Mahrez and Kyle Walker in the said video. 

Though Kyle Walker and Riyad Mahrez look sober, Grealish on the other hand looks odd. As per the report, the Manchester City midfielder wanted to enter a German beer cellar at the Manchester city centre. 

But Grealish was deemed too drunk to enter the beer cellar. Owing to this, the staff denied him entry. The video was taken after the said incident took place. And Grealish can be seen talking to someone about the same in the TikTok footage.

The person who recorded the video can be heard shouting "Jack's burst, he's not allowed inside, look at him, Jack's burst". The TikTok user named Mizormalc also captioned the video 'Man like Jacky too drunk to get in'.

Jack Grealish is seen wearing a white hoodie in the video. There is also a man walking next to the forward who can be supporting Grealish so that he doesn't fall. 

Manchester City did not have a training session on Monday. Hence it is clear that none of the players broke the curfew to go outside. City's next game is a Premier League fixture against Brentford at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday. 


Pep Guardiola certainly won't be happy 

The Manchester City player has already had a similar incident earlier in the season. Jack Grealish had reportedly arrived "too drunk" to training along with teammate Phil Foden post the Leeds United game in December. Owing to this, the manager was unimpressed and had benched both the players for the game against Newcastle United. 

As per the Daily Mail report, Manchester City have responded to the video. The news agency state "The club also refutes any suggestion that the players were drunk and insist it was their own decision not to go into the packed Albert Schloss (German bar)." Hence, it has to be seen if Pep Guardiola takes any action in the coming days.
