Let's glance at SAFFRON for health.

This extracted spice from the stigma of crocus genus flower is really worth its value.
Used for centuries, the health benefits are diverse (and amazing) and when added to your cooking, gives it a subtle, earthy, floral flavour and aroma.

Saffron has a sedative effect on the nervous system as well as having antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuro- protective effects. It also promotes the production of the
hormone serotonin - your happy hormone.
These are saffron's overall benefits, with mind health, stress relief and sleep being tops for me.

Balances mood
*Reduces depressive symptoms
• Improves sleep quality and length of sleep
• Helps with stress relief and anxiety
*Reduces PMS symptoms and menstrual cramping
• Assists with weight management. It acts as an appetite suppressant.
• Increases libido in both men and women
• Supports eye health, lost eye and retinal function, particularly with age

As with all things related to diet, dosage and efficiecy is important so if you are looking to gain these health benefits by adding saffron to your diet.
