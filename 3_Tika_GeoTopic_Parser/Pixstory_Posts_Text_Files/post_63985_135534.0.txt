 
Netflix’s Cyberpunk 2077 based anime spin off, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is now very close.  As part of the announcement, the company also released a new “NSFW” trailer ahead of the show’s debut next month.
 
The anime is a collaboration  between Cyberpunk 2077 Polish games developer CD Projekt and Japanese animation studio Trigger (Little Witch Academia, Kill la Kill) that tells the story of a street kid trying to survive in the technology and body modification obsessed Night City.
 
Much like any CD Red content, the anime too like the game will feature exorbitant amounts of gut wrenching violence and extreme sexual content, thus likely proving itself to be a sensory overload.
 
 According to the official description, "the series tells a standalone, 10-episode story about a street kid trying to survive in Night City - a technology and body modification-obsessed city of the future. Having everything to lose, he stays alive by becoming an edgerunner - a mercenary outlaw also known as a cyberpunk."
 
Announced back in 2020, the series has been in the works for some time and will consist of 10 episodes, each 30 minutes long. All of the ten episodes will stream at once on Netflix by September 13.
