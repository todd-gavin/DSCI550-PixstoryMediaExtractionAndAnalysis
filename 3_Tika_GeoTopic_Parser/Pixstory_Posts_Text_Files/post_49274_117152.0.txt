Seven, from Taylor Swift's 2020 album Folklore, announced and released overnight might probably be one of the best songs on the album. 

Talking about the song in Folklore Long Pond Studio Sessions, a documentary about the album, Swift talked about seeing a child in a grocery line store throwing tantrums and wondering when in adulthood does one stop doing that, screaming whenever it feels like, without thinking of civic sense or, "civility" as she describes in the song. 

The song is a perfect blend and has references to various feelings and situations - The song is addressed to the narrator's childhood friend, that they're not in touch with anymore, but have always loved them. With references to child abuse, being forced to staying closeted as a consequence of unsupportive environments, childhood friends, nostalgia, pure unadulterated support and love, naivety and innocence - coupled with Swift's calming vocals on the song, it might just be the comfort song for many queer kids out there.
