Women economic activists from Balkh, Jawzjan, Samangan, Faryab and Sar-e-Pul provinces held a two-day handicraft exhibition in Mazar-e-Sharif.

According to Bakhtar, the head of the UN Development Program at the fair signed a $ 1.5 million contract to support businesswomen in northern Afghanistan.

Praising women's economic activity in the field of domestic production, especially handicrafts, Achim Steiner said at the exhibition that the organization is trying to help families achieve self-sufficiency through domestic production by launching development and economic programs.

The exhibition is sponsored by the United Nations Development Program.

Bakhtar News Agency did not provide details of the signed contract by publishing this news.

The fair is being held in Mazar-e-Sharif, with the exception of the health and education sector, which has expelled women from most government offices.
