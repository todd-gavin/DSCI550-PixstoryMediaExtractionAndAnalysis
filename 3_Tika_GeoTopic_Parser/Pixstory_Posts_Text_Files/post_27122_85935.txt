Women for me are the backbone of our society Even though I believe in Humanism I agree that women have been oppressed of opportunities for far too long Shah Rukh Khan once said that he has been made who he is by the women of his life Women play the penultimate role in everyone s lives This woman s day I will be honouring all the women who have inspired me starting with the queen herself Taylor Swift Now I will give a disclaimer that if you are a Kanye West fan you might as well skip this and also unfollow me Taylor s life has been inspirational to anyone who looked closely and noticed the little things from the Kanye West fiasco to her being called out for dating many men none of the struggles Taylor Swift had to face made sense constantly the woman was put through miseries that quite frankly no one deserved but as Taylor herself says But I got smarter I got harder in the nick of time Honey I rose up from the dead i do it all the time You can be a fan of any artist but if you listen to Taylor Swift there will be a part of you that will admit that she is an undeniable genius The problem is that people judge Taylor by Blank Space Shake it off kind of songs While that is also Taylor the real Taylor can only be discovered in songs like Exile The Last time Mirrorball All too well August and plenty others There is a lot more to say about the genius of this woman but I ll just say that years down the line when someone will ask me how was the prime phase of Taylor Swift how was Folklore Evermore and all her albums i will just quote Taylor by saying It was rare I was there I remember it All too well
