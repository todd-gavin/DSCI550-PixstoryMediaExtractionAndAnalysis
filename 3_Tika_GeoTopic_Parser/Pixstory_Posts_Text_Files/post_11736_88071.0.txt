Broccoli has more protein per calorie than steak, according to an earlier version of this article. This is inaccurate; protein accounts for more than half of the calories in a serving of steak.



It's easy to lose sight of how much protein individuals really need to stay healthy in a world where plant-based diet is becoming increasingly popular. According to SCL Health, a little less than half a gram of protein per pound of body weight is advised, or 10% to 35% of your daily caloric intake should come from protein. That's also a lot less than you might think.

There are many more items that contribute to that daily protein consumption, whether you consume enough meat to satisfy that recommendation or you follow a fully plant-based diet as a vegetarian or vegan. Vegan-friendly foods like almonds, peanuts, lentils, and quinoa, as well as vegetarian-friendly foods like milk, eggs, and Greek yogurt, are all good choices, according to Healthline. However, one vegetable in particular has a startling amount of the substance.

Broccoli is a good source of protein.
Broccoli, like most green vegetables, is a fantastic provider of a variety of nutrients. According to Healthline, it contains a lot of vitamin C and K, as well as a lot of potassium. It will also increase your fiber intake.

However, the fact that broccoli contains a substantial amount of protein may surprise you.

According to Healthline, one cup of broccoli has only 31 calories and 2.5 grams of protein. According to the USDA's Natural Agriculture Library, each gram of protein has 4 calories, therefore protein accounts for 33 percent — or 13 — of the calories in broccoli.

While the green veggie doesn't have as much protein as edamame (which has 18.4 grams per cup, according to Medical News Today), it's still a low-calorie, vegan-friendly method to get additional protein in your diet.
