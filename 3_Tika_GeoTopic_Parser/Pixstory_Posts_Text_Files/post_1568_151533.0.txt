Who starts alongside Fox? No question. Monk. The Kings have been historically bad and unwatchable over the last 16 years. They barely cross anyone’s radar and rarely play on national TV. Sacramento has been a place for players to go and disappear into insignificance. It wasn’t that way when White Chocolate came into town in the 90’s and it could all start to change this year especially if the highlight reels are filled with crazy Fox to Monk lobs. The Kings need to be watchable. They need to be must see TV again. The Fox-Monk pairing was electric at Kentucky and it can be again in Sactown. Fox is the fastest player in the NBA and Monk is a high flyer. What makes them electric is they love playing with each other. It could be a tight competition between Malik Monk and Kevin Huerter. Many experts believe Huerter will be the starter. The 24-year-old Huerter, who came over in a trade with the Atlanta Hawks in the offseason, has the size advantage and has experience playing the shooting guard and small forward positions. Chemistry matters. #startMonk
