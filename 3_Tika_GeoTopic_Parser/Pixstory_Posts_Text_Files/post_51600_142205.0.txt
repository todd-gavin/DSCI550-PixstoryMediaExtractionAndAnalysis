REST IN PEACE üíê
HER MAJESTY QUEEN ELIZABETH II
The English Football League, which governs the three divisions below the Premier League, announced that the games in the second-tier Championship as well as League One and League Two start on Tuesday,
tributes to the Queen will be paid at venues around the nation.
However, the Premier League has not yet announced when the top division will resume play as logistical problems are anticipated to arise prior to the State Funeral, which will take place in London on September 19.
Before their upcoming top games later on the week some Premier League teams like Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Tottenham in the Champions League.
Manchester United, Arsenal, and West Ham in the Europa League will return to action in European competition between Tuesday and Thursday.
On Tuesday, Liverpool will host Ajax, while Wednesday sees Manchester City host Borussia Dortmund.
Given the extensive security measures in place for the queen's death, it appears that the games in London are most at risk.
Tottenham will play host to Leicester on Saturday, Brentford will play host to Arsenal, and Chelsea will play host to Liverpool on Sunday.
Most sports resumed in Britain over the weekend¬†after a general shutdown on Friday, a day after the queen died at the age of 96.
