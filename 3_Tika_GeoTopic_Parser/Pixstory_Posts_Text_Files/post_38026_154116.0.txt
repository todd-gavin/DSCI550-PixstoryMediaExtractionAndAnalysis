Arsenal beat Liverpool to make it 8 wins out of 9 PL games. With a commendable start to the campaign, Mikel Arteta's Gunners are surely title contenders this season. 
The Gunners had just won 1 of their 19 fixtures in all competitions against Liverpool. Hence a win against the Reds was in the cards for a long time for the North London club. Playing at home, Arsenal certainly did not disappoint in a goal-scoring affair. Winning the game 3-2, the Gunners have retained their position at the top for another weekend. 
Arsenal have now beaten Tottenham and Liverpool back to back, proving why exactly they are on the top of the table currently. But the Gunners are facing a heated challenge by Man City, who are scoring goals with ease. 
The Erling Haaland-led side is just 1 point behind the Gunners and they are currently unbeaten. The two English powerhouses were set to lock horns on the 20th of October, but the game has since been postponed. The two games against these clubs could eventually help decide the title picture in the long run. 
No matter what happens, the Arsenal fans should certainly be proud of how the club has started the season. Will the North London side pick up a few titles this season? Only time will tell...
