There have been eleven mass shootings since Friday. That's three days, just three days.

According to the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive, there were 306 mass shootings in the United States from January 1 to Sunday, compared to 327 and 256 respectively in 2021 and 2020.

There were locked doors â€” as republicans claimed were the reason behind the massacre in Uvalde, not the guns, there were more cops, there were more shields. Yet this happened. Seems like the problem is not all of that after all. No good guy with a gun, no doors could stop it.

The shooter was described as an 18-20 year old white male. Sounds like a pattern, doesn't it?

We can't go to parades, we can't send our kids to schools, we can't go to supermarkets, we can't even step out of the house because we never know who with an easy access to gun is looking for a bloodbath on the streets. Let's not even start on the domestic violence cases where all these women are tortured on gunpoint or even killed because a bloodthirsty abuser was allowed to carry gun.

It's the guns. It's the damn guns and there's no other way to put it.
