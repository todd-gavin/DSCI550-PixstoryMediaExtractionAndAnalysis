Real Madrid took a huge stride in their quest for the Champions League as they comfortably disposed off a struggling Chelsea side at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday Since the start of the season Carlo Ancelotti has been successful in formulating a formidable Real Madrid team which apart from the slip up against Barcelona has been in stellar form throughout the season Pundits around the world felt that Los Blancos would struggle and will take time to find their pace after the dramatic departure of Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varane But it s been clear for some time now that Italian manager Carlo Ancelotti and his squad has termed those remarks as false claims after becoming the favorites for Laliga and knocking out Paris Saint Germain in the UCL Chelsea left the pitch on Wednesday a well defeated side as the brilliance of Karim Benzema and Real Madrid s midfield made life hard for the Blues Benzema s individual performance topped with a hattrick deserves applause as he was the key man for the Whites at the comfortable disposal of Chelsea We take a look at few points from Karim Benzema s performance at London DROPPING DEEP FROM ATTACK As we all know Karim Benzema is a no non sense striker But since the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo he has improved his game and not only in defence but in midfield he has a significant contribution His flexibility in movement down the pitch playing one or two short passes with Kroos Modric was crucial in breaking down the experienced Chelsea defence of R diger and Thiago Silva CHEMISTRY WITH VINICIUS AND VALVERDE Is it the chemistry or the ability of foresight which Benzema has still remains a debate but one thing is certain Benzema s passes magically gets distributed to Valverde or Vinicius with pin point precision His passing ability helped him move forward up the pitch while pacey players like Vini Jr took the ball forward PRESS TILL THE END While two of his goals came from stunning headers but the third one was yet another mistake from a goalkeeper in the UCL knockouts Benzema s intelligent pressing forced a mistake from Mendy after which he scored completing his hattrick
