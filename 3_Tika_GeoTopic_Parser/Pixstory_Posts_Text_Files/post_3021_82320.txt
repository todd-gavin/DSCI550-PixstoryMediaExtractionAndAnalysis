Novak Djokovic who missed out Australian Open because of his stance on Covid vaccines says he is not exactly against vaccines as such but strongly favors freedom to choose what you put into your body So much that the world s number one men s tennis player is willing to let his chances at Wimbledon and French Open go rather than get a shot But is it a question of personal freedom and individual rights when a the vaccines have proved their efficacy and there s no scientific argument against them and b the infectious nature of the pandemic implies some collective responsibilities as well I was never against vaccination but I ve always supported the freedom to choose what you put in your body he told the BBC in a long interview this week He confirmed that he d had vaccines in childhood and does not want to be associated with the anti wax movement Yet he sticks to his own stance on vaccines even after it led to his deportation from Australia last month Djokovic has won grand slam titles and being forced out of the Australian Open he let his chief competitor Rafael Nadal make history winning the st grand slam title Still he is prepared to skip even Wimbledon and the French Open but won t change his stance on the vaccine Even a Covid infection twice failed to change his mind Is this rational logical He doesn t want to sound irrational He says he s keeping his mind open about the possibility of being vaccinated because we are all trying to find collectively a best possible solution to end Covid But in that case why not consider the data over more than a year now Before the vaccines were developed and during early stages of their introduction there was skepticism and even conspiracy theories but now more than billion shots have been administered worldwide we have seen their benefits outweigh side effects they have saved lives A vaccine skeptic if rational would have at least changed their arguments after a year Plus there s question of duty too to stop the spread and save others
