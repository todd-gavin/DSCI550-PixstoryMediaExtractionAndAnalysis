Pangolins are said to be world s cutest mammals and like most innocent animals that comes at a hefty cost for them Pangolins are anteater like creatures with huge scales that are traded illegally in China and Vietnam Every day some pangolins are poached making them the world s most illegally trafficked mammals Despite the fact that pangolin scales have no established therapeutic value they are utilised in traditional medicine to treat everything from lactation problems to arthritis The scales are usually dried and processed into a powder that can then be made into a tablet The pangolin is a shy nocturnal creature with no teeth making it essentially harmless to humans When attacked by natural predators this animal which has poor vision curls into a ball which they cannot pry open for meat due to the pangolin s hard scales But this defense is useless against human hunters who shoot use snares traps and nets to catch them or just pick up the curled pangolins and bash them to death with machetes They re suffocated with smoke beaten and boiled alive
