For the first time in two years ever since the Covid first made its appearance the authorities in China seem to have lost control of the spread of the disease with every passing day recording more numbers than the previous day and spreading to newer places The country has been following the country s zero covid strategy with the authorities rely on mass testing tracking tracing and hospitalising positive case citizens in the high risk category But of late the country has come under tremendous strain with the Zero Covid policy failing to stop the spread of the disease According to health officials over new cases have been reported in the past three days alone with the highly transmissible Omicron subvariant BA making its presence felt in China China has now revised its guideline on testing according to which it no longer requires citywide testing In what is being called the dynamic zero Covid policy According to new guidelines only people in the designated areas of a city are to be tested in a tight span of hours Previous guidelines of September said that cities with fewer than million residents should complete nucleic acid testing for every individual within two days Cities with more than million were expected to complete the task within three days Now not every individual will be tested China is unlikely to shut cities as it did previously Chinese President Xi Jinping had indicated that the authorities should ensure that the economic hardships are not brought on people But he had also said that China will stick to its policy of zero Covid The new policy was announced by Jiao Yahui head of the Bureau of the Medical Administration of the National Health Commission It is not necessary to conduct citywide testing each time She specifically stated that the ultimate goal was to ensure that all positive cases are found only in those under quarantine instead of in communities Zero Covid policy may no longer be the state policy
