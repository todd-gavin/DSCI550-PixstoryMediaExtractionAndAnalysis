We often speak about misinformation and ongoing hustle on social media platforms that make it difficult for people to become a part of a shielded space where their opinion is not only respected but is also respectfully denied when others don t agree with it The prevailing atmosphere of hate and impertinence on other social media platforms has made it hard to raise a cause without receiving acrimonious remarks But thankfully someone is doing it for us here standing for a cause without feeling intimidated or questioned by wrong ideas Pixstory app has this motto to proliferate transparent and authentic information that never aims to traduce anyone Big names like Arsenal collaborating to support such a cause is truly a way of taking it to another level of achievement Together they ll be able to create a more hate free platform
