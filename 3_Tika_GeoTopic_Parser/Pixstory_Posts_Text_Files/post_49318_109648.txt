I am appalled I am absolutely terrified by the fact that I am less protected than inanimate objects in my own country A gun has more rights than I do as a woman It is a dark and unfortunate day in the history of America and it will always be remembered as one where women were once again let down America has become a living hell for the marginalized communities With the rising racism misogyny transphobia homophobia just fascism anybody who s not a white cisgendered heterosexual man is victimized This is shameful and bigoted We stand proud as the greatest country in the world but the truth is we are a country filled with people who want to kill their own We are a country where shooting children in school is more acceptable than seeking abortion We re a country where sexual predators are less illegal than women not wanting a baby We are a sorry excuse of a country Women did not fight so long so men could go around making laws like they own our bodies We need our rights and we will fight for them Bans off our bodies
