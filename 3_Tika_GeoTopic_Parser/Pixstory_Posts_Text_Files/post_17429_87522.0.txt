The jeers and whistles that reverberated across the Parc des Princes were deafening. The PSG fans were clearly unhappy with their team’s exit from the UEFA Champions League against Real Madrid.

To make their displeasure known, the fans singled out Lionel Messi and Neymar. They booed the duo before the start of the team’s Ligue 1 game against Bordeaux on Sunday.

Mauricio Pochettino’s men went on to beat their opponents 3-0, thanks to goals from Kylian Mbappe, Neymar and Leandro Paredes. However, for a team that has invested so much into conquering Europe, the result does very little to make up for their disappointing capitulation against Madrid in midweek.

With Kylian Mbappe scoring for the second time in the tie, PSG led 2-0 on aggregate with 29 minutes to go at the Santiago Bernabeu. However, in an epic meltdown, they allowed Karim Benzema to score a stunning 17-minute hat-trick to bow out of the competition.

PSG have been very poor in recent weeks, winning just two of their last five games across competitions. Nevertheless, they’re still in pole position to win Ligue 1, as they sit 15 points clear at the top of the table with only ten games to go.

Winning the league has become very easy for the Parisians due to their vast superiority to other teams in the division. However, they’ve never really risen to the occasion in Europe.

When PSG signed Messi to complement Neymar and Mbappe in attack, it was meant to spur them to win the Champions League. However, when things got tough against Real Madrid, only Mbappe’s presence was felt.

Messi and Neymar were atrocious over the two legs. So fans have every right to register their unhappiness at the duo’s disappointing performances, even through boos and jeers. Messi notably missed a penalty in the first leg in Paris.
