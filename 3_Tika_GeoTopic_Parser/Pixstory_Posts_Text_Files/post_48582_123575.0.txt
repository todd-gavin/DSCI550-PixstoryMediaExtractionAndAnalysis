There are several players who might depart the Knicks before the start of the regular season, but Derrick Rose will not.

Regardless of their interest in Derrick Rose, the New York Knicks are still assembling their roster for the upcoming season, which will feature Rose.

Tom Thibodeau believes the point guard, who he has trusted since his tenure with the Chicago Bulls, is non-transferable, according to Michael Scotto of HoopShype. Julius Randle could actually say us goodbye this time.

I'm kinda glad for this. I didn't want him to leave at all.
