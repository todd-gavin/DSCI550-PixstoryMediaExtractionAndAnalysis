A U S study published by The BMJ suggests that a healthy lifestyle is associated with a longer life expectancy among both men and women and they live a larger proportion of their remaining years without Alzheimer s disease The findings show that a healthy lifestyle is associated with longer life expectancies but crucially the extra years did not mean extra years lived with Alzheimer s The number of people living with Alzheimer s and other dementias is expected to triple worldwide by from an estimated million in to million in A healthy lifestyle adequate exercise cognitive engagement and a healthy diet may reduce the risk of dementia and extend life expectancy Also reaching older ages is associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer s So although a healthier lifestyle may delay the onset of Alzheimer s dementia the question remained as to whether it might increase the years spent with the disease To investigate this lesser known issue further a team of U S and Swiss researchers analyzed the potential impact of a healthy lifestyle on the number of years spent living with and without Alzheimer s The study analyzes data from participants aged years and older average age with no history of dementia within the Chicago Health and Aging Project CHAP Participants completed detailed diet and lifestyle questionnaires and a healthy lifestyle score was developed based on a hybrid Mediterranean DASH Diet a diet rich in whole grains green leafy vegetables and berries and low in fast fried food and red meats late life cognitively stimulating activities at least minutes a week of physical activity not smoking low to moderate alcohol consumption Cognitive activities included reading visiting a museum or doing crosswords For each lifestyle factor participants received a score of if they met the criteria for healthy and if they did not Scores from five lifestyle factors were summed to yield a final score ranging to A higher score indicated a healthier lifestyle Promoting greater engagement in healthy lifestyles may increase dementia free life years by delaying the onset of dementia without extending life years spent with dementia
