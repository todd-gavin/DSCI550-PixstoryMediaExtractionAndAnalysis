Regular viewers of PBS will already be familiar with Essie Davis’s delicious portrayal of Miss Phryne Fisher, lady detective, but for everyone who hasn’t spent the last decade watching Masterpiece Mystery!, 

As per vulture, take this recommendation for the clanging siren it is: Run, don’t walk, to your nearest Acorn TV subscription, as the 1920s-set Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries is the proverbial bee’s knees. What’s more, its 1960s-set spinoff, Ms. Fisher’s Modern Murder Mysteries, which launched its second season earlier this month and stars a sparky Geraldine Hakewill as Peregrine Fisher, Phryne’s long-lost niece, is the cat’s pajamas. 

More than the cat’s pajamas, it’s hot. If Phryne always found a way to play the sex-positive femme fatale in 1929 Melbourne, the Melbourne Peregrine lands in in the 1960s is downright horny. Match the series’ many eclectic murders up with two solid supporting casts, some luscious costuming, a couple of smo(u)ldering hot romances, and this this cheerfully sexy, unapologetically feminist vibe, and you’ve honestly got the perfect double-feature summer binge.
