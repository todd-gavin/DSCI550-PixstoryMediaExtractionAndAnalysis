Once Osho proclaimed Love should be like breathing where ever you are with whomsoever you are or even if you are alone love goes on overflowing from you It s not a question of being in love with someone it is a question of being in love Love is always nbsp a dangerous pathway which is narrow lined full of sweat and blood shed It s like choosing the less travelled road by a strange traveller The road is full of mystery dirt and covered with leaves As osho distorted love transformes nbsp us a overflowing river and in any kind of defeat distress and deformity it flows its fragrance towards the entire universe It s not a question of with whom you are in love it s a question of whether you are in love or not It is not necessary for one to have love with somebody else or a person You can love anything in the world living or non living but it should be something which makes you more Humane in nature The ultimate goal of every human is to become the Aroma of Almighty and Humanity is the way of life to achieve this endorsement
