Vasant Panchami is a Hindu festival that marks the preparation for the arrival of spring. The festival is celebrated by people in various ways, depending upon the region.

On this day, people worship Goddess Saraswati to get enlightened with knowledge and to get rid of lethargy, sluggishness, and ignorance. Basant Panchami is celebrated on the fifth day of the bright half of the Hindu month of Magha, which usually falls in late January or February. The Vasant Utsava on Panchami is celebrated forty days before Spring, because any season's transition period is 40 days, and after that, the season comes into full bloom.
