Nasa has announced plans for the International Space Station ISS to be officially decommissioned in After dozens of launches since got the station up and into orbit bringing it down will be a feat of its own the risks are serious if things go wrong Nasa s plans for the decommissioning operation will culminate in a fiery plunge into the middle of the Pacific Ocean a location called Point Nemo also known as the spacecraft graveyard the furthest point from all civilisation Finding Point Nemo will be the final stop in a complex and multi staged mission to transition the operations of the ISS to new commercial space stations and to bring the remaining structure safely down to Earth Originally commissioned for a year lifespan the ISS is outliving all expectations It has already been in operation for years and Nasa has given the go ahead for one more decade thereby doubling its total planned time in orbit Purpose of the ISS The ISS has enabled one giant leap for science and collaboration across mankind involving five different space agencies US Russia Europe Canada and Japan The modules and parts of the ISS have been built progressively by many different countries only coming into contact for the first time in space The monumental conglomerate structure now stretches the length of a football field and is the largest human made object in space It is visible by the naked eye from Earth while it completes its daily orbits passing km above the Earth s surface Research in the so called microgravity environment of the ISS has yielded breakthroughs in drug discovery vaccine development and medical treatments in the last decade The ISS also helps to monitor Earth s ecosystems and natural disasters in real time It is used to test future spacecraft technologies and to study health effects of long term spaceflight for the possibility of future human exploration of the solar system Full story at The Conversation Image Courtesy
