With his goal against the Citizens, the Senegal international equaled a Premier League record
previously held by Manchester United icon Sadio Mane, who became only the second player in
Premier League history to score on his birthday against a team that started the day on top.

The Senegal international, who turned 30 on Sunday, was one of the goal scorers as Liverpool
drew 2-2 with league leaders Manchester City away from home. The former Southampton
player was named in the Reds' starting XI for the 28th time in the 2021-22 season, and his
second-half equaliser helped his club depart the Etihad Stadium with a share of the points.

Belgium international Kevin De Bruyne put Pep Guardiola's club ahead in the fifth minute after
Bernardo Silva set him up. Despite this, the lead only lasted eight minutes, as Diogo Jota equalised for the visitors thanks to a Trent Alexander-Arnold assist.

Gabriel Jesus, who beat goalkeeper Alisson in the 36th minute, guaranteed that the hosts
headed into the halftime break with a lead after a goal-filled first half. Jurgen Klopp's team
ramped up their game in the second half, knowing that anything less than victory would mean
disaster in their quest to become league champions.

Mane equalised for Liverpool just a minute after the game resumed, thanks to Mohamed Salah's
final pass. With his one-of-a-kind achievement, the reigning African Player of the Year joined the
Manchester United legend in the hallowed ranks of the English top flight.

Furthermore, the Anfield kings' goal, which came just 46 seconds into the second half, was the
first time they had scored in the first minute of the second half in a league game since January
2019. 

It was the first time the Citizens have conceded in the 46th minute of an English top-flight
match since November 2004, when Damien Francis scored against Norwich City.With seven games remaining, the teams at the top of the Premier League are separated by just
one point.
