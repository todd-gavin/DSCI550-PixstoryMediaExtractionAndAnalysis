Heavy metal is a very diverse genre, just like rock and  despite the fact that it is predominantly an underground genre, it too is guilty of harbouring many songs that are criminally overplayed due to their more mainstream inclinations. 

Now having a metal song that appeases the masses is definitely a good thing as it introduces an otherwise overlooked genre to a wider audience. 

While it may be true for some, the problem is that overplaying these songs does not reflect the sound for a majority of the bands. Overplaying a song can render it overrated by music critics and magazines which overshadows the better songs created by them. 

Now just because a song is overrated or overplayed does not make it bad instantly, in fact some of the biggest classics are classics because they have been ridiculously overplayed in movies, serials and video games. For example, Master Of Puppets is held as a staple for metal as it should be, as it is beyond a doubt a brilliant song. 

But the fact remains it is not Metallica’s best song. Same goes for songs like Du Hast, Trooper, Walk or any of the other songs on the list. They are merely guilty of being overplayed, which lessens their appeal.
