Elon Musk delivered a second letter to Twitter for the termination of the gigantic billion deal The company deceived Musk about the actual number of spam and bot accounts on their platform Musk sent a letter in July claiming that the company s inability to prove how many bots and spam accounts were on its service was a reason to back out of the deal According to Twitter s response his attempt to pull out of the agreement is invalid and unjust The second letter was made public on tuesday citing the testimony by former head of security at Twitter Peiter Zatko as a distinct justification for scrapping the deal Peiter Zatko s attorneys stated late Monday that the former employee had received a subpoena from Musk s legal team on Saturday and that he intended to comply The subpoena asks for any documents that Zatko may have related to the alleged jaw dropping security lapses at the social network as well as any information about spam
