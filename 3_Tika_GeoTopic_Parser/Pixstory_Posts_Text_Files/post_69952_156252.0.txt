People make the decision to take their own lives every day, which is a tragic part of  the reality we live in. But it can seem like celebrity suicides occur at a higher rate than people who aren’t famous or have a following.
There may be a simple reason for this. After all, if someone we don’t know commits suicide, it’s unlikely that we’ll hear about it, but when a celebrity does so, we read about it online or see it on the news. With this in mind, the perception of celebrity suicides happening at a higher rate makes sense.
On October 16, prominent TV star Vaishali Takkar committed suicide. The actress, 29, was discovered hanging from a ceiling fan at her house by the police, who also uncovered a suicide note that seems to indicate Takkar was being harassed by her ex-boyfriend, who was already married.
In her suicide note, the actress has alleged that her ex-boyfriend, a businessman who is an acquaintance of Takkar's family and lives in the same locality, was harassing her
According to the authorities, the man is currently missing from his home and is absconding.
As the nation awoke to the terrible news of Takkar's untimely death, a little video footage of the TV actress from an earlier interview surfaced online.
The actress referred to her close friend Sushant Singh Rajput's passing as a "murder" in the viral video that has gone viral on social media. According to rumours, the star of "Kedarnath" committed suicide in 2020.
