Undoubtedly, I could assure you that Color Purple is the best book I have read. All the elements in the book give us the power to resist and to live amidst the chaos. 

Alice Walker is an American Novelist and the first African-American woman to win a Pulitzer Prize for her book 'The Color Purple'. The book is a novel in an epistolary form which makes it the most convenient to read.

Color Purple revolves around many women, their life, freedom, choices, suppression, struggle, fight and the men in their life. The novel opens with the recording of Celie in her diary that she was abused by her father (originally stepfather) at a very young age. She, being brought up in a patriarchal and racist culture; unlearns stage by stage to become an independent woman both financially and emotionally. 

The book also talks about the concept of God. The general concept of God being white, even in India we see goods being painted blue in pictures rather than accepting they are black. The impact of colonisation and marking the most 'superior being' 'white' denotes the patriarchal conditioning and its depth. Celie understands through her love interest Shug that God isn't like all the misogynistic men in her life. God is gender-neutral what you want it to be. If a God exists your happiness is what matters to God and finally God is not a 'him' but an 'it'. (continued)
