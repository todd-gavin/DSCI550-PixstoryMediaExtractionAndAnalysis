In honour of National Dog Day, it is only fitting that we recognise some of the most heroic dogs in the world.

My favourite is the Killian dog that saved the baby from abuse!  

As per various news reports, a Labrador Retriever named Killian rescued his small companion from ongoing maltreatment. 

The story goes that after doing some research online, Jordan and Benjamin Hope recruited a nanny for their son. They chose to hire the babysitter for five months because they felt so good about their choice. 

Alexis Khan, however, was not the fantastic babysitter she represented herself to be. She would often reprimand the infant and slap him. If Killian, the couple's dog, had not alerted them to the abuse, it would have continued for at least five months. When the babysitter would show up, Killian would remain close to the infant while acting hostilely toward the caregiver. 

The parents were concerned and decided to conceal an iPhone under the sofa to record what was going on. This revealed everything, and if it was not for Killian, they would never have known.

It is true that dogs are truly manâ€™s best friend!
