Arsenal will be looking to spend money in the summer to invest in their squad as they prepare for a long campaign of trying to break into the top 4 and competing in the Europa League.

Perhaps high on Arsenalâ€™s priority list would be signing a midfielder, as the squad lacks both the depth and the quality to make it to the Champions League this season. Arsenal would be looking to sign a number 8, someone who could progress the ball up the field and be an 
upgrade over Granit Xhaka.

One of the players on the radar for Premier League clubs would be Frankie De Jong. While the midfielder is performing well at Barcelona and happy to stay, the club might be looking to cash in on the player given their dire financial situation. Arsenal should look to move in for the player and add him to their midfield. The following indicate the player will do well at the club:

1. He is great at progressing the ball

Frenkie De Jong is a player that can find a pass between the opposition lines. The midfielder averages a successful passing rate of 93% across short and medium distances. He is also capable of maintaining possession and passing under pressure, being within the top 8% of midfielders who would be capable of doing so.

De Jong is equally capable of carrying the ball himself, with the midfielder possessing the 7th most progressive carries per 90 minutes in La Liga last season.

While Granit Xhaka adequately performs the role of progressing the ball at Arsenal, his speed and athleticism are something that can be upgraded. Frenkie De Jong is an athletic player, capable of running up and down the field. He would add much mobility to the Arsenal midfield.
