I am a careless girl till last 2 year . 
But when this covid pandemic hits my life got change . 
I start caring more about my health and family's health. 
I got to know about the value of money. Because in this pandemic many of us get unemployed. 
I get to know the importance of life .
This pandemic taught me many things I start valuing my relations .
