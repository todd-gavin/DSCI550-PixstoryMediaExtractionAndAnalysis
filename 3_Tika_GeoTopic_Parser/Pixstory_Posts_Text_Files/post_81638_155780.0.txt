Colombia beat China 2-0 in today’s Group C clash at Mumbai’s D Y Patil Stadium. Linda Caicedo put the South Americans ahead with their first goal of the World Cup in the ninth minute after keeper Liu Chen fell over a ball rolled into the box from the right wing. Caicedo doubled her team’s lead in the 23rd minute via another driven cross from Orianna Quintero on the right wing. On this occasion, she had time to take a touch and smash it onto the top right corner with her left foot. In the 37th minute, Caicedo set her teammate Rodriguez through on goal but her shot was straight at the keeper. Colombia went into the break 2-0 up. China came closest to pulling one back in the 55th minute as Wang A F tried her luck from the outside the box; the keeper Luisa Agudelo was equal to it. In the 62nd minute, Wu Y J chipped a shot that bounced awkwardly near Agudelo but she did just enough to turn it away from the goal and clear. Rodriguez capped off a smooth passing move for Colombia in the 81st minute with a well-placed shot from the edge of the box but keeper Chen dived to clutch it in her arms. The goal China were searching for never came but even as late as the 91st minute, a gilt-edged chance from a sublime cross was squandered as Zhang H P watched her effort whisk past the goal. The last chance of the game came in the 96th minute as keeper Agudelo came out to meet a cross and nearly injured herself in the process. 
China came into the match on 3 points having defeated Mexico 2-1 on Matchday 1. This is Colombia’s first victory in the group and takes them ahead of China on goal difference. Colombia might consider themselves in a stronger position to qualify now as they would back themselves to get a better result against Mexico than China will against Spain. China will need a victory against Spain and be able to overcome their goal difference deficit to qualify for the quarterfinals.
