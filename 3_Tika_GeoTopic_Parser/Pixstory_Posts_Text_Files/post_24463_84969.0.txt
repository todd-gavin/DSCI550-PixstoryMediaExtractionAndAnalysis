During construction work at Palakkad Fort which is widely known as Tipu’s Fort and is situated in the heart of Kerala’s Palakkad Town, as many as 47 cannon shells were found. The shells were discovered from the western side of the Fort, when the ground was being dug up for drainage purposes as part of restoration work undertaken by the Archaeological Survey of India.

The ASI has shifted the shells to a protected place where they will be cleaned scientifically. These will be displayed inside the Fort on Women’s Day on March 8.
