Experts suggest that local problems and politicians with strong ties to their communities caused the unexpected election results in western Sydney, with major parties boosting their vote in certain regions but losing secure seats in others. 

The Guardian reported that In Fowler, Dai Le, an independent candidate and former councillor, defeated Labor's Kristina Keneally by a margin of 14 percent. 

Le, who was born in Vietnam and moved to Australia when she was 11 years old, told Guardian Australia that during the election, her community was "searching for true and real representation."

“The people understood, at the end of the day, that only the locals understand us, and would fight for better services and federal resources,” she said.

“Ultimately the community has not seen 
improvements from previous federal representatives, and this time they believe they wanted one of their own to represent them, who is connected to them, and will fight for them, just like other electorates.”
