Had India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru written a letter to then Prime Minister of Britain Clement Attlee in 1945, referring to Subhas Chandra Bose as a “war criminal”? Had Nehru alluded to Bose supposedly entering “Russian territory”? A facsimile of a letter purportedly written by Nehru, addressed to Attlee has been circulating on social media platforms for the last couple of years.

It was also shared in 2018.

The copy of the ‘letter’ allegedly written by Nehru castigates the Russians for allowing Bose to enter their country, calling it a “clear treachery and betrayal of faith by the Russians”. The letter further exhorts Attlee to “take note of it and do what you consider proper and fit”. It may be noted that there are several versions of this letter doing the rounds. Alt News found that BJP leader Subramaniam Swamy had made a claim in December 2014 about a letter supposedly dictated by Nehru.

Prima facie, the above image that is shared repeatedly on social media appears to be fake. It is replete with errors. Clement Attlee has been referred to as Clement ‘Attle’, and the first line of the letter states, “I understand from reliable source” (instead of “I understand from a reliable source”). The letter is dated December 27, 1945. It surprisingly refers to Russia as “an ally of the British-Americans”, when the opposite was true for 1945 when the world was divided into opposing ideological blocs. There are two things worth noting here:

1. Subhas Chandra Bose has been referred to as a “war criminal”
2. The date of the letter is December 27, 1945 whereas the official account states that Bose died on August 18, 1945.

Did Nehru ever write such a letter?
How true is the claim that India’s first Prime Minister had called Bose a “war criminal”? Or that he was cognizant of Bose supposedly being alive and escaping to Russia, referring to the same in his communication with Clement Attlee?
