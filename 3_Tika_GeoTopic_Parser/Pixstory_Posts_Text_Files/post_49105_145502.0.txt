Posture is one of the most important aspects of your health and well-being, and it has a significant impact on your personality. Poor posture can cause neck pain, back pain, headaches, fatigue, and more. It can also lead to stress levels and affecting your overall mood.
There are many factors that contribute to poor posture - genetics, age, height/weight/ build , location (e.g., indoors vs outdoors), lifestyle choices (such as sitting at a desk all day), and even the way you sit in chairs or drive cars.  In fact, there are several scientific studies that suggest how good or bad your posture is related to various aspects of your life.
Here are just a few examples:
- Poor posture can lead to low energy and fatigue, which can impact your mood and performance in school or at work.
- Good posture not only looks better on you physically, but it also reduces stress levels and improves emotional well-being.
- Slouching increases the risk for back pain, neck pain, headaches, asthma symptoms,and more.
