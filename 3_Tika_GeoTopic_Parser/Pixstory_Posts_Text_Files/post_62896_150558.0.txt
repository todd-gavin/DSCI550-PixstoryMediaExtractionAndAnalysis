Heat is what makes these hurricanes large, powerful, and extremely rainy. The quantity of heat trapped on Earth increases steadily as a result of what we do to the planet â€” we burn fossil fuels and ir releases massive volumes of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
Both the ocean water and the air are getting warmer. All that heat is available to aid the development of the storm when a young hurricane develops in the Atlantic. That is what happened to Ian. The storm was rather weak when it first began to develop. However, it developed very swiftly as it travelled across the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico's extremely hot water. It went from being a tropical storm to a hurricane just shy of being category 5.
Heat is the fuel of a storm. In a way, humans and especially big industries are directly responsible for the destruction that Ian is causing. Climate change is considered a primary factor behind most disasters around the world, including Hurricane Harvey in Houston, Texas, Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and Typhoon Mangkhut in China. And obviously, the recent Pakistani and African floodings
