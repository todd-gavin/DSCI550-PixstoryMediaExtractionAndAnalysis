I disagree Laws restricting gun ownership infringe on people s right to self defense and make them feel unsafe Guns are used for self defense million times every year according to the National Rifle Association Police officers cannot always safeguard everyone Stricter gun rules would make it more difficult for people to protect their homes and families according to percent of males and percent of women surveyed by Pew Research Individual gun ownership is protected under the US Constitution s Second Amendment Criminals will still be able to obtain guns and breach the law despite gun control regulations Gun control laws give the government far too much power perhaps leading to government tyranny and the confiscation of all firearms from civilians Background checks and microstamping are examples of gun control legislation that violate people s privacy To avoid unintentional gun deaths more gun restriction is not required instead education about weapons and gun safety is required Gun laws would make it impossible for citizens to defend themselves against foreign invaders Strict gun control laws have failed in Mexico and will fail in the United States as well The Second Amendment was meant to guarantee all able bodied men s right to own guns so that they may join the militia and help keep the peace and defend the country if necessary Other than that Laws prohibiting the possession of firearms are racist Current gun control laws usually target inner city poor black neighbourhoods which are seen as more dangerous than white gun owners For example in response to Nat Turner s Rebellion also known as the Southampton Rebellion in a law was passed prohibiting free black people from keeping or carrying any firelock of any kind any military weapon or any powder or lead and all laws allowing free black people to possess firearms were repealed So yeah americans should totally be allowed to own guns Source ProCon org
