When the Los Angeles Lakers acquired Russell Westbrook a year ago fans of the Purple and Gold asked Why Not One year later more fans are asking Why Westbrook s first season back home didn t go as planned The Lakers immediately became the favorites to win the NBA Championship with Westbrook on board but failed to make the playoffs altogether and it was bumpier than anyone could have imagined He averaged his lowest point total since his second season in the NBA with consistent shooting slumps His minutes per game dipped to his fewest since the season as former head coach Frank Vogel contemplated benching Westbrook There were even rumors of trading him for John Wall at the trade deadline to salvage the season As the fit proved unworkable hearing jeers from the home crowd further ailed the former MVP s confidence With Westbrook blowing easy layups and losing the ball on routine plays some around the league also wondered if his eyes or hands had problems The Lakers season became deplorable and some blame can be attributed to Westbrook s lack of willingness to adapt However Westbrook was the most durable Lakers player logging games in a variety of starting lineups that never allowed Westbrook to find a role Westbrook s play improved as the season progressed too keeping the Lakers slim playoff hopes alive He finished the season averaging points rebounds and assists Westbrook rocked the rim with a vintage slam over Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert in mid January Westbrook was in the middle of a tough stretch offensively scoring in single digits in three of the last four games The dunk gave Westbrook some juice as the Lakers ended their three game losing streak with a six point win Westbrook is expected to opt into his million contract for next season That leaves him under contract for one season with the Lakers before he can hit free agency A keyword for Westbrook going into next season is sacrifice one that new head coach Darvin Ham said was part of his conversations with the point guard
