Fentanyl deaths have doubled in two years and black men are seeing the biggest increases in drug overdoses So why isn t Vice President Kamala Harris doing something about the illicit drugs coming into the country through the southern border When the Biden administration assumed power it promised us that Harris who is of black and South Asian descent was a new type of revolutionary champion for people of color especially black Americans And the president put her in charge of one of the country s biggest crises albeit one of his own making as record numbers of illegal immigrants and drug traffickers have swamped the southern border It s clear she s failing and with deadly consequences Shockingly Harris doesn t seem jolted by the fact that fentanyl overdoses are the top cause of death for Americans aged to more deadly than car accidents cancer and suicide Drug overdoses are also more fatal in this prime age group than COVID While the Biden administration continues to push ineffective policies and COVID fearmongering people are dying in isolation and desperation from drug overdoses Harris would rather send safe smoking kits to Americans to promote racial equity than stop foreigners from smuggling deadly drugs over the border Harris focus on Central and Latin America to supposedly attack the root causes of illegal immigration makes it clear this deeply unpopular vice president would rather build the economies of foreign lands than save the US citizens she s sworn to protect The White House s Root Causes Strategy July announcement makes only glancing mention of dialogue to fight drug trafficking Her strategy hasn t yielded any results either Illegal border crossings mushrooming to record levels with million migrant arrests at the southern border last year Many of the illicit drugs trafficked from the south especially fentanyl originate in Communist China Harris apathy and ineptitude haven t stopped dealers from funneling these drugs across our border and killing US citizens
