I say religion is one of the reasons why many people hate sex workers and consider them sinners For example To preserve you from the evil woman from the smooth tongue of the adulteress Do not desire her beauty in your heart and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes for the price of a prostitute is only a loaf of bread but a married woman hunts down a precious life Proverbs Can find many of these in many forms of the Bible and Islam Religion prostitution is banned in Hinduism prostitutes are mentioned but respect given to them can be debatable Many other religious books have the same problem Religion draws people towards them and propagates certain norms according to their convenience This also includes chastising women and their sexuality Functioning between dualities when almost everything in the world is dynamic The world isn t black on white it s pink purple grey blue turquoise blue and so on Religions don t accept it and I don t think they can ever Faith is always subjective but it is not fair to impose or treat people differently just because religion says so People should live according to their convenience It s a choice for a human to not choose prostitution the same way to choose prostitution Sex workers are humans who work like anybody for their living Don t ostracise them because of the word sex in it
