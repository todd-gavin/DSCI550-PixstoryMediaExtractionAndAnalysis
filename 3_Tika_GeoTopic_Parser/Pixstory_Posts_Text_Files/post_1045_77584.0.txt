Mitchell Starc has won his first Allan Border Medal, beating Mitchell Marsh by just one vote to be awarded the top honour on Saturday.

The left-armer took a total of 43 wickets at 24.4 across all formats during the voting period, which included him playing a key role in Australia’s 4-0 Ashes triumph, and at the T20 World Cup.

Marsh, who was player-of-the-match in the T20 World Cup final in November, enjoyed his best white ball season for Australia and was named best men’s T20I player of the year
