Telescopes observing in space and on Earth immediately after NASA purposefully crashed its Double Asteroid Redirection Test spacecraft into the asteroid Dimorphos noticed a jet of dust and debris astronomers refer to as ejecta. Follow-up studies now reveal that the solar wind is pushing the asteroid's dust away from it, producing a tail resembling those we are accustomed to seeing trailing comets. DART, a planetary protection experiment, sought to determine whether hurling a robot probe at an object from Earth could alter the object's orbital course. A future manoeuvre like this could save humanity from an unpleasant meeting with a comet or asteroid that poses a severe threat to our planet's impact.Fortunately, Dimorphos poses no such threat (and in fact no known near-Earth objects are currently considered to be a significant danger). But there are plenty of asteroids and other space rocks out there that we haven't yet discovered or started tracking, so the data gained from DART could literally come in handy at just about any moment.The collision took place on Monday, Sept. 26, and within less than two days, a well-defined tail was easily visible from ground-based telescopes.
