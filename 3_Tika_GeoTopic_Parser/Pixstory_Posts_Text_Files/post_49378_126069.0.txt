Violent video games cause more aggressive behavior in players. It's backed with research. And I mean, it's pretty basic, right? A child's environment and culture influence them. Especially in a society like ours where all the social evils are somewhere on the top of the chain.

The American Psychological Association (APA) has stated that "violent video games are linked with increased aggressive behavior." The APA is not alone; several other groups have reached similar conclusions. In fact, they found that kids who played violent video games were more likely than those who didnâ€™t play them to engage in physical fights with other kids.

In 2011, a study by the University of Missouri-Kansas City found that "younger players who had an increased exposure to violent video games were more likely to be involved in physical fights." In another study, researchers found that playing violent video games increased blood pressure, heart rate and anxiety levels in young adults.

Some studies even suggest that playing violent video games can lead to criminal behavior. A study conducted by Vanderbilt University found that playing violent video games leads people to act out violently on the streets. In fact, it's shown that most teen mass shooters have a history of playing violent games.

So yeah, just because they're games doesn't mean they're harmless. They aren't. It's not to say they are the main culprit of violence but they surely do add to a culture that normalizes violence against the weak.
