Sadly, catastrophes frequently occur as a result of the world's growing drug epidemic. Families may find it difficult to deal with the effects of what transpired for individuals who suffer from the affects of an overdose. 

Additionally, it might be challenging for others without an understanding to empathise with those families. The goal of International Overdose Awareness Day is to close the knowledge gap between those who do not understand and those who are all-too-familiar with it. 

Wearing silver and purple is one way to commemorate this day. You can purchase a badge from businesses like the Overdose Day website, or you can plan your attire accordingly. If your workplace has a clothing code, you can persuade your higher up to organize a day where coworkers wear these colors. 

Light a candle in remembrance, host an education program about overdosing, provide safe spaces for people to tell their stories, and be active if youâ€™re passionate about this subject. Nevertheless, share this holiday on your favorite social media websites using the hashtag #overdoseawarenessday and let everyone know what day it is.
