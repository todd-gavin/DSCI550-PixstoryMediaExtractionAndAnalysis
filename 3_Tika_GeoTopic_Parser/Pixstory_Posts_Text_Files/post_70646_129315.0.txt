According to documents filed in a Delaware court on Thursday, billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, who is trying to back out of his agreement to buy Twitter Inc., is requesting records from advertising technology companies as part of his effort to learn more about bot and spam accounts on Twitter.
Tesla's CEO has accused Twitter of withholding information about how it determines the percentage of bots using its site, and Twitter has responded by suing him for trying to break the $44 billion deal. Oct. 17 is the date of the trial.

Musk's lawyers have subpoenaed both Integral Ad Science (IAS) and DoubleVerify for any documents or communications on their involvement in reviewing accounts or participation in any audit of Twitter's user base.

IAS and DoubleVerify, which are both based in New York, use technology to independently verify that digital ads are viewed by real people. Advertisers use the services to ensure the ads they pay for are seen by potential customers and not automated bots.

Twitter, IAS and DoubleVerify did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The metric measures users who log onto Twitter through the website or apps that are able to serve ads or used paid products like subscriptions, according to Twitter filings.
