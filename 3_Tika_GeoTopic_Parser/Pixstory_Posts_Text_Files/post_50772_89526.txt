Mark Pomerantz and Carey Dunne were two of the top investigators on the team that was probing Donald Trump and the Trump Organisation They resigned on February rd stating that the former President had committed felonies and should have been charged According to Pomerantz Trump had lied to several banks by filing bogus Statements of Financial Condition which is a felony in New York State According to the people familiar with the case Pomerantz and Dunne left the investigation because the District Attorney Alvin Bragg who was presiding over the case The investigation unraveled after weeks of disagreements between the veteran prosecutors and the new District Attorney Pomerantz and Dunne were confident that the investigative team could demonstrate that the former President had intended to inflate the value of his assets but Bragg wasn t convinced and decided to not pursue an indictment against Trump Due to this the investigators were not able to present the evidence to a grand jury and this was the last straw for them as they resigned Bragg s predecessor Vance Jr had in his final days of office decided to move towards an indictment but Bragg s desicion has for now appeared to remove one of the greatest legal threats that the former president has faced Pomerantz in his resignation letter had some harsh words and wrote that No case is perfect whatever the risks of bringing the case may be I am convinced that a failure to prosecute will pose much greater risks in terms of public confidence in the fair administration of justice Trump s lawyer said that the charges against his client was baseless and unwarranted and also said that Pomerantz had repeatedly failed to show the results of his investigation to the District Attorney on several occasions Trump s company in its statement called Pomerantz a never Trumper and applauded Bragg for following the law and making a fair decision Trump himself has denied any wrongdoing and has also made indirect verbal attacks against the people investigating him including Pomerantz The investigation is still ongoing under Bragg as the investigators are still trying to unearthen new facts
