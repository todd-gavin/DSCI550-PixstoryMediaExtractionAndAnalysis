Strategic playbook continues....

These deepening ethnic fault lines leave the Army, dominated by Punjabis, with no other option but to embrace the ideology of Islam much more intensely in the days ahead. There is a perception being spread in the Army that Pakistan is ripe to take over the leadership of the Islamic world and the armed force must perforce prepare itself to lead the way. The already ‘orthodox’ officer corps and soldiers will find it convenient to align with the idea of an ‘Army of Islam.’ Another ‘Zia’, say, in the next couple of years, will help hasten the process. Such a development would also narrow down the widening ethnic and sectarian schisms that threaten to break up the country.

The Army today, because of its political, military and corporate interests, is part of the elite, and hence is likely to face challenges from the religious right, as it offers an alternative and inclusive model of governance and authority. The Army’s elitist character neutralises its role as an arbiter and allows the religious right and other affiliated groups to project themselves as an alternate centre of influence. The rise of the Taliban in Swat and other areas in Malakand in 2008-2009 was helped to a large extent by the token measures taken by the Taliban leaders to help the small peasants and landless labourers from the clutches of big feudal landlords.

Terrorist groups like LeT and religious parties like JI have gained popular support by employing their resources in providing educational and social welfare services to the public. These are bound to attract more people towards the religious right, thereby providing a ground for confrontation with the elite of the society, including the Army.
