 Hey There Delilah is a hit song by American band Plain White T s It was released in May as the third single from their third studio album All That We Needed Since then the song has become the epitome of romance Its soft tunes and endearing lyrics are charming the audiences even years later The song was written by frontman Tom Higgenson after meeting Delilah DiCrescenzo a nationally ranked American steeplechase and cross country runner through a mutual friend around In an interview Higgenson stated I thought she was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen I told her I have a song about you already Obviously there was no song But I thought it was smooth DiCrescenzo turned him down as she was dating somebody else at the time but kept in touch with Higgenson A year later he had finished the song About the actual writing Higgenson said Because I wasn t with Delilah I had to imagine If I was with this girl what would I want to tell her In late Higgenson brought DiCrescenzo a disc with the finished song Ultimate Guitar reported that DiCrescenzo stated she found it difficult to deal with the popularity of a song written about her When I m at the gym it s playing when I m at the pool it s playing Part of me wants to scream at the top of my lungs that it s about me Another part of me wants to cower and say it s not It was so beautifully written There was pressure to live up to this ideal I didn t know how to be polite but you know ditch him
