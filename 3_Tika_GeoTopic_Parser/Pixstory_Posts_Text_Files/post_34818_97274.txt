I don&#39;t know what will happen but I don&#39;t feel like excluding anything These are the words of CONI president Malag regarding the possible exclusion of Russian and Belarusian tennis players from the Rome Internationals He would like to follow what was done by the Wimbledon organizers and therefore exclude but on the other side who points out that tennis players represent themselves and not the nation At the moment there will be Russian athletes, he added We respect the situations but what we highlight is that the IOC has invited all international federations to exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes Does it seem right to you that everyone adapts and a union of players is not Il Coni the Cio so let&#39;s follow the Cio
