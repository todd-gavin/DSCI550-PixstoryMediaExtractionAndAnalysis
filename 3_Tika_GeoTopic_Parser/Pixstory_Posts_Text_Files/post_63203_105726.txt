I ve got wandering feet In this kitchen tonight Trying to be somewhere But not quite Blessed with a destination Make a cup of vanilla tea Add sweet drops of honey Remember your eyes Looking through me Right into my heart Run my small hands Against the smoothness Of the countertops Where all those countless Memories were made My sun touched toes Walking in this room Coral Reef nails Trying to find you Though you aren t here My red mug and I Settle in this wooden chair With sighs and tears I say a silent prayer Wandering to find your touch
