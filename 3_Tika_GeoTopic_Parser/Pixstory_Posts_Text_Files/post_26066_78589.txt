Encouraging more women to take up entrepreneurship and carry forward their ideas with a plan has become a priority since the pandemic Because since the pandemic As we already see a decline in the workforce of the formal sector to the informal sector there is has been a massive shift in the women workforce in general Thus it is absolutely important for Government non Government regulatory organizations to come together to increase skill development training programs for women and while we do have programs for education I would want to highlight that while we do have many educational schemes for girl child in UP It is really important to introduce local skilled based programs in small districts villages and cities Because even if their drop out rate is a concern they can still carry forward a skill with themselves and be self dependent and reliant This gives them the courage to support not just themselves as an independent women but also their family and being the head of the house themselves We could also move further from sewing training health care training catering and hospitality to also the training opportunities which involve the IT sector mechanical training management sector and digital industry Thus moving ahead from the stereotypically defined jobs women are confined to and helping women have a shift from manual based tasks
