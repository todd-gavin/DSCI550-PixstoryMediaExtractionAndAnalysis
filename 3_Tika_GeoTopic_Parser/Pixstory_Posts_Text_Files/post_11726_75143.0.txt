Whether you’re looking to drop excess pounds or add some muscle definition, getting results involves maintaining a healthy diet and getting regular exercise. But depending on your body type, some diet and workout plans may work better for you than others. If you have a higher percentage of body fat and little muscle definition, you may have what is known as an endomorph body.

What is an endomorph?
American researcher and psychologist William Sheldon introduced the classification of different body types in the 1940s.

Through his research he concluded that, based on our skeletal frame and body composition, we each have an inherited body type, or somatotype, that determines whether we’re leaner, heavier, or somewhere in between. Because of this inherited body type, reaching weight loss and fitness goals often requires an individualized program.

What should an endomorph eat?
If you have an endomorphic body and you’re looking to lose weight or gain muscle definition, you may consider a fitness plan and diet that’s specific to your body type. According to the diet’s theory, endomorphs have a slower metabolism. Since you don’t burn calories as fast as ectomorphs and mesomorphs, excess calories are more likely to convert to fat.

According to proponents of the diet, because endomorphs have a harder time losing body fat, dieting alone may not be enough to lose weight. It’s also important to incorporate physical activity into your daily routine. This is a common recommendation for anyone looking to improve their overall health. An effective fitness plan includes a combination of weight training and cardio training.
