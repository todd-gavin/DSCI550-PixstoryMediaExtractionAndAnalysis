Sonnet 55 is a very passionate poem by Shakespeare. He focuses on the power of poetry to immortalise his love. 

The poet contends that his poem will outlive palaces and cities, and keep the young man's good qualities alive until the Last Judgement. The sonnet unveils the progression of time, from the physical aspects built by man (monuments, statues, masonry), as well as the primaeval notion of warfare depicted through the image of "Mars his sword" and "war's quick fire", to the concept of the Last Judgment. The young man will survive all of these things through the verses of the speaker. Generations may eventually bring the world to a weary halt, yet still, the love, respect and praise will remain. The idea of doom is biblical in origin, as is Judgement Day which appears later on in the sonnet.

The poem conveys the message that great and noble souls leave an indelible impact on their fellow beings and they are remembered by posterity for a long time to come. Monuments and statues, howsoever ornate and rich, fail to immortalize the rich and the powerful.

There is an irony wherein, the sonnet keeps the young man as the lady who gets repeated in the sonnets hidden! Shakespeare has his ways!
