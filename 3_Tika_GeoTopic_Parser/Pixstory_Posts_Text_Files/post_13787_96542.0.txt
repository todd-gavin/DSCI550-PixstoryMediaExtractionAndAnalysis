Nearly a month has passed since Kolkata’s Mohun Bagan Athletic Club held their elections to fill up various posts including general secretary, vice presidents, executive committee members etc. But till date, the club remains a headless body as the officials have failed to pick up a suitable candidate to run the 132-year-old institution with rich history. Old members of the club say never in the past Mohun Bagan club, widely known for their green and maroon jersey, had remained without a president. On April 23, 2022, in the annual general meeting of the club, the general secretary Debasis Dutta announced the name of the president will be declared in the next couple of weeks.
The historic club, who famously defeated British side East Yorkshire Regiment to win the IFA Shield in 1911, are now facing problems at more than one front. First, Mohun Bagan have ceased to become a public club after it's football team was handed over to businessman Sanjiv Goenka in a hush-hush decision that left a large number of club members and supporters unhappy. The move also forced the club to accept Goenka’s decision to change the name of the football team to ATK Mohun Bagan.
There were rumours in the football circle that the club were now indirectly run by the ruling party in the state of West Bengal, Trinamool Congress (TMC). That it wasn’t a rumour only was confirmed in the recent club elections. Among the four vice presidents elected (unopposed, of course), two are members in the state cabinet, one is the spokesperson in the party. The newly elected football secretary is the younger brother of the state chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Initially a ground secretary was elected, but he resigned three weeks later; reasons unknown. His place has been taken over by a relative of the state sports minister. Club insiders claim the president will only be installed after the name receives the green signal from the ruling party. Till then, the chair can wait to have an occupant!
