The rain pours on,
Memories flood through,
My heart a light barricade,
Ruptured by a forgotten desire.

I stare straight into the sky,
To find my stars,
Only to find it all empty,
Resembling my life clearly.

The Dark Night awaits, 
It welcomes my demons,
Makes me abandon my dreams,
Tells me to run far away.

As an angel her thoughts ponder,
Upon me even when I don't wonder,
How do I let of the memories,
That have clutched my heart forever.

Tell me how it'll never happen,
She has left her essence,
As it withers so does my existence,
Always been a dismayed lover.

She took away the pictures,
Offered her to take my eyes,
She's engrained into them,
She foolishly thought I lied.

Her name is etched on my heart,
It wails out to her,
Begging for a chance,
To fulfill my only love.

As these tears fall,
The loneliness inside intensifies,
The only cure abandoned me,
Now I belong to her fading nostalgia.
