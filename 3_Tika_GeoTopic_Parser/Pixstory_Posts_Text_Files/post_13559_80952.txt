One of the criteria for measuring male zeal in a patriarchal society is the sensitivity to hijab and determining the type of cover for women In fact showing sensitivity means monitoring a woman s hijab and correcting her behavior which is in fact a proprietary and obsessive view of women This means that the woman does not have authority and has an owner and in the gender hierarchy of power distribution in the family structure she has a lower position compared to the power of the father and the eldest son of the family In such a situation the woman s right and authority is taken away she loses her will and authority as a free human being On the contrary a man has the authority and even the decision maker of the type of woman s clothing Women are therefore independent and empowered The right to cover is a part of their identity
