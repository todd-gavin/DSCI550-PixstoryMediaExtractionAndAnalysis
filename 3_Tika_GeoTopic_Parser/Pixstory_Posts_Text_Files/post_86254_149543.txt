Dogs are the best friend of humans People adopt breed dogs but they hate street dogs Why They re also dogs They ll love you back if you ll love them I m not saying that adopt them but atleast feed them love them equally as you love your pet dog Street dogs will never bite you until and unless you re not hurting them In my college campus there are so many dogs and they live there only and campus care committee feeds them take care of them but not only campus care members do all this but we also them and I can t tell you guys how much they love us and I can say their love is selfless
