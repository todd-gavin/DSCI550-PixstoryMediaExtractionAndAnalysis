👉Seek information as far before traveling as possible, even if the destination is one you have previously visited. Health conditions can change quickly in certain areas of the world.

👉For specific recommendations, see a travel medicine specialist or a healthcare provider familiar with the area you will be visiting at least 4 to 6 weeks before your trip. 

👉Make sure your routine vaccines, including the seasonal flu vaccine, are up-to-date.

👉Get the immunizations and take the preventive medicines recommended by your healthcare provider. Since some of these must be given or taken weeks before travel, contact your healthcare provider as early as possible.

👉Research emergency medical care during your trip and what medical evacuation services are available in case of serious illness. Contact your health insurance plan to find out what is covered in other countries.

👉Take 2 copies of your medical insurance information with you and keep them in separate areas. If you are traveling as part of an organized tour, contact the agency regarding medical services available and any additional insurance that might be available.

👉If you have any infectious disease symptoms when you return home, contact your healthcare provider and describe where you have traveled.
