Word on the street is that feminists are angry, that they have stopped laughing at offensive jokes and are no longer smiling at men that make them uncomfortable. Word on the street is that women are no longer adhering to values that keep men's enjoyment over women's dignity.

Women are penalized by society for showing interest in men. Examples include abortion restrictions, slut shaming, discussions about women's "worth" lowering, and having to give up all ambitions in order to care for a man and children.

And guess what else society penalizes women for? Not showing interest in men. Women are constantly met with privacy invasions and behavior policing when they are not interested in men, when they say no. From asking them to "smile because he gave you a compliment" to "explain to him politely despite how uncomfortable he makes you." Or, worse. We're attacked, beaten, brutalized, raped and killed.

It feels like there's no escape for us. So word on the street is that women have stopped tolerating being treated like commodities and are speaking up, that they are fighting back, and they are calling out men for their careless behavior instead of cleaning after them. They are refusing to "learn to take a joke."

And the word is right. Women are angry, and so should be you.
