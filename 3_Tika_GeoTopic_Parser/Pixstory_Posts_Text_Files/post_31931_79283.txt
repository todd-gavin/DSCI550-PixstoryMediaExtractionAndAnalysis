Fabrizio Romano has revealed the details behind Dejan Kuluveski s transfer from Juventus to Tottenham Hotspur The year old has swapped Turin for north London and he is ready to help Antonio Conte s side for the rest of the season However it appears as if Tottenham could end up splashing out a huge amount of money on a player who has only scored nine goals for Juventus transfermarkt Speaking on his personal Twitter account on February the rd Romano revealed that Spurs have paid million Euros million to take Kuluveski on loan until the end of the season They will be forced to buy the Swede if he makes starts from now until the end of the season or if Conte s side qualify for the Champions League If this happens Spurs will pay Juve million Euros million Now if neither of these things happen there is also an option to buy included in the deal and that is also set at million Euros for next summer and million Euros million for this summer So if things go to plan this could be an expensive transfer for Spurs However if he helps Tottenham qualify for the Champions League you would think Daniel Levy would be very happy to pay Juve The clause that worries me is the starts one because what if Conte starts Kuluveski times and he fails to do anything Spurs would have no way out and they would have to fork out a huge sum of money So that clause concerns me but ultimately it is up to Kuluveski to prove to Tottenham and Conte that he can be a key man in the future Let s see how this all pans out but this deal represents a huge risk to Spurs
