The Premier League is well and truly back, and the fixtures are starting to come thick and fast. Just days after our victory against Fulham, we are looming on another matchday tomorrow – where we will host Aston Villa. Here’s all the latest transfer news ahead of tomorrow’s encounter…
 
Despite having a fully available squad just a week ago, there are now three key injuries within the team:
 
#1 – Zinchenko

The Ukrainian was a surprise absentee against Fulham, after suffering a sprain to his left knee. Fortunately, this was only a precautionary matter, and he may be in contention to play in tomorrow’s home fixture against Villa.
 
#2 – Elneny

It came to light this morning, thanks to reports originating from David Ornstein, that Mohammed Elneny suffered a ‘significant injury’ versus Fulham, and while the full extent of the injury is not known, he is ‘expected to miss [a] considerable spell’. It really is bad news; it’s never nice to hear a player has picked up an injury, and it’s even worse when it’s in a position where another player is also injured. Arsenal are now very light in midfield and could be forced to enter the transfer market to find a defensive midfielder.
 
#3 – Partey

The Ghanian was another one who missed out against Fulham, with a slight injury to his muscle. From all the reports it appears the injury to Partey is minor, and he should be back within a few weeks.
 
With Partey’s history of injuries, and Elneny set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines, Arsenal may feel obliged to go and sign a holding midfielder to play the number 6 role in out 1-4-3-3.
 
There are, however, options within the club too. Sambi Lokonga is a player I like very much, but I do prefer him playing in the number 8 role. Alternatively, Ben White or Oleksandr Zinchenko could cover the role. Both are technically secure, excellent on the ball and have already proven how versatile they can be.
 
A tricky situation.
