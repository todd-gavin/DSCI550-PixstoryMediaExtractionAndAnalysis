The US announced further sanctions against Russia for its war in Ukraine on Wednesday, targeting a major commercial bank as well as "a global network of more than 40 individuals and companies managed by US-designated Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev." , as reported by CNN.

The US Treasury Department said in a statement that it was also targeting "businesses operating in Russia's virtual currency mining industry, which is reputedly the world's third largest," noting that it was the first time it had "identified a virtual currency mining corporation."

The Biden administration's steps on Wednesday are the latest in a series of measures aimed at punishing the Kremlin and its backers for invading Ukraine at the end of February. 

It’s unfortunate that hundreds of service members and civilians have died in the conflict, which US and European officials predict might last months. 

According to experts who talked with CNN, sanctions are unlikely to discourage Russian President Vladimir Putin from escalating action in Ukraine right away. Earlier this month, the US Department of Justice unveiled its first criminal charges since Russia's war in Ukraine began against Malofeyev, indicting him for sanctions evasion attempts.

Let’s see what happens next!
