The Los Angeles Lakers faithful hadn t seen their team in over a week before L A hosted the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday but the Purple and Gold s return turned sour after they lost The Lakers suffered a crushing defeat even though LeBron James and Anthony Davis returned from injuries In the aftermath they fell games behind Play In Tournament spots with five games to go drastically reducing their chances of making the postseason Understandably the atmosphere at Crypto com Arena became less enthusiastic as the Lakers neared the defeat on Friday But even when the crowd energy changes Russell Westbrook says it has no impact on his game I don t pay attention to this crowd to be honest he says For the first time in six weeks Westbrook got to share the floor with both Anthony Davis and LeBron James The Lakers Big played its st game together in the loss against the Pelicans Westbrook previously admitted to the many lineup changes taking a mental toll on the NBA MVP However he still tries to approach games with the same mindset regardless of whether James and Davis are by his side My mindset is always play with the cards you re dealt Westbrook says Whatever s on the floor you ve got to use it If AD and Bron are playing then we make sure we as a team implemented and used all that we have and go from there
