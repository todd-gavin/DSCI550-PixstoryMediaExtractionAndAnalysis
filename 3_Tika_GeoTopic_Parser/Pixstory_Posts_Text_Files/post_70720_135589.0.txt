Kettles and hobs are two of the most-used appliances in the kitchen, used to make hot drinks and food. However, with energy costs on the rise, many are looking for ways to cut their bills. A TikTok user, who goes by the name @dinosaurdannyx, recently helped Britons and did an experiment to find out how much energy and how much cost was involved with boiling two litres of water at room temperature.
Firstly the engineer worked out how to measure the flow of gas used by his stove. From there, he found out that it cost him 1.99p to boil water using his hob. 
After using his electric kettle to boil the same volume of water, he said it cost 3.49p, almost twice as much.
He said: “The results of this actually surprised me.”
Although kettles overall use less energy, the differing prices of electricity and gas meant the hob worked out cheaper.
The TikTok user asked others not to try this at home and was simply finding out the difference in cost for his wife and others who asked.
He added: “If you’re looking for an energy saving, you go for the electric kettle. If you’re looking for a cost saving, go for the hob.
“If you’re looking for time, then that depends upon what you’ve got and how much you value your time.”
