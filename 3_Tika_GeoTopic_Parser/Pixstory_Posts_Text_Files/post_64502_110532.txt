Set in the regency era the story of Pride Prejudice revolves around the theme of identifying the actual goodness behind the prejudices and superficial qualities of a person The story revolves around the dramatic series of emotions and family rattles in between breaking down the boundaries of caste system The Bennet family who are much furious about searching a suitable boy and getting at least one of their girls out of married as Mr Bennet s property is entailed to a son of which the family is deficient The characters of this novel are quite distinct and engrossing in their own way as their outer appearances and inner character are very uniquely detailed The book successfully brings out the feelings of unrequited love being finally recognized rage vanity and snobbery are active althrough to demonstrate the emotional violence on characters I enjoyed reading the book and would recommend it for the people who love reading about family drama fiction and classic regency romance fiction novels The best part of the book is that even after being years old the language and story of the book never feels too outdated or hard to read
