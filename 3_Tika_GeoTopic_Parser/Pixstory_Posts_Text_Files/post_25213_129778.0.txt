A late rakhi gift indeed but I love my brother for these❤️
2 months ago I showed these to him asking him how they were and he was like colour is too girly, bjy something that would go with both outfits and then ge got me a pair for rakhi✨ such a smartass I must say😂
So, here's just me showing off my new shoes and posing in them🫶 again, for showing them off!! Cause why not😎
