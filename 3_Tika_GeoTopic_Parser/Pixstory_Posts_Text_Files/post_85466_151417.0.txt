Saka and Martinelli’s widthBoth Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli were regularly taking up wide positions when receiving the ball. Tottenham Hotspur provided a different type of test, with Antonio Conte prepared to lose possession of the ball and take the chance on the counter. With this in mind, it was clear we wouldn’t find it easy to scythe through them. Instead, we played a wide game.Xhaka and the fans are in love againGranit Xhaka was the MOTM, and arguably should have received the same accolade in the Brentford victory - now he may be working towards a player of the season award at the club. Arteta has worked wonders with Xhaka, who looks mobile, efficient and now adding goal output in his overall play. He now looks irreplaceable, and completely reinvented.Gabriel Jesus = commitment and energyJesus was signed to lead the front-line of the attack, to score the chances we create and add a level of dynamism. He’s also here to win us games purely from his attitude and his commitment to raise the standards. Gabriel Jesus is in the leadership group for a reason, and alongside Zinchenko, we have players who realise the importance of being prepared for the big games.Saliba completes the coreAny great side requires a core that makes up the spine of a team, a label which many pundits use to measure the quality of a top side. Saliba had another superb game, yet to be dribbled past plus 11 recoveries. In the first half, he walked out of pressure in our own penalty box - and he appeared to do this in slow motion. He positioned himself in areas of danger, sweeping up any threat and starting moves.AtmosphereThe Emirates is now a place to be feared. The atmosphere and good feeling grew towards the end of the last season, and the stadium was quite simply bouncing. We seem to have found the right level of noise, with Mikel Arteta and the team behind-the-scenes sourcing the pre-match song and the creative chants for Zinchenko and Saliba.
