Namda are felted carpets that are created by pressing and wetting wool fibres then embroidering the resulting fabric These are widely utilised as cheap and efficient mattresses and floor coverings in Kashmiri homes In every home in Kashmir regardless of wealth there are spaces for people to sit on the floor They tend to their guests while seated on the floor Going back hundreds of years the floor would become excruciatingly cold to sit on during the winter Namda and Gabba would intervene to save everyone during the winter and to give everyone with a comfortable sitting arrangement on the floor Gabba was a clever method to use the rags from the house and turn them into a useful item and Namda would have done the same The customary oriental seating arrangement is done on the floor in the living room of traditional Kashmiri homes This layout of the floor is well illustrated in numerous tiny paintings where royalty is portrayed quartered on opulent carpets and large around the circular cushions with opulent covering Kashmir s flooring is a result of the region s exceptionally cold climate when it became required to endure the subzero temperatures The namdas gabbas and woollen carpets are made of wool to keep the people warm Since it is now a well known Kashmiri handcraft there are people all over the world who would love to own one for their homes Namdas are still utilised locally for the same functions in people s houses today
