According to the Exit polls, BJP is set to regain Uttar Pradesh, which if happens truly will be historic as since independence no CM has completed a full term and got relected and Yogi Adityanath might be the first one to do so.

BJP is projected to get more than 240 seats while SP will getting around 150 seats and Congress have to settle for less than 10 and BSP for around 10-15.

Now, these are the exit polls, for the exact results we have to wait for the count to end and results to arive by the end of today.
