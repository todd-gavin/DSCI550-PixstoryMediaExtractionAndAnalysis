Just watched the movie “Kaun Pravin Tambe” (Kaun - Who) which is available on Disney+ Hotstar and after watching the movie, I want to say that, now Everyone will know who is Pravin Tambe and we all know the struggles he did to fulfill his dream.

“Kaun Pravin Tambe” is the inspired biopic of the cricketer Pravin Tambe where we get to see his journey from 1984 to 2013 and how he remains dedicated to playing at least for the Ranji Team.

The movie jumped from 1984 to 1986, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2011, and 2013. From 1984 to 1986 we got to know that he started loving cricket and how cricket becomes his passion. 

In 1995, when he grew older, we saw that he is playing well and his chances of playing in Ranji are good but his new coach suggested he bowl spin instead of medium pace and he struggled.

From 1997-to 1999, Director showed the life of Pravin Tambe when he got married and had two kids.

The biggest setbacks in Pravin Tambe’s life came when he met with the accident and the team he is working for and playing cricket with, that team got shut down the reason that movie didn’t elaborate much.

If I tell anything after this, so it will be a spoiler for you and I don’t want to tell you the spoiler because I want you all to watch this movie. After all, this movie will motivate you and you will think about your passion.

Scenes, where Pravin Tambe is managing his work life, cricket, and marriage all at the same time, are amazing and we will his pain through and through.
