“It's easy to look back and question decisions you have made in the past, but it's unfair to punish yourself for them”. This is what I woke up to this morning. A friend had posted a long note from Charlotte Freeman ( till today I didn’t know if her, just googled her) . The note was long but I thought let me start with the start. On world mental health day, isn’t this what we should emphasize- just forgive your self for your past mistakes or decisions, learn from them move on . The theme of mental health day is calling it a global priority. It is a global priority for sure, since all of us came out to resume life after covid 19, there is more reason than there ever was to make it a global priority. At times I feel the world is Re learning life and still taking baby steps and needs all the help in the world to love that life and live it. But I guess, we also need to prioritize mental health at individual level. Reduce negativity and toxicity in our lives. Stay safe as far away from negative, if not possible physically then stay away mentally. Let go of the past (easier said than done, well Yes). We have to remind ourselves, we don’t do things knowing they are not good in the longer run, we invest in people thinking this person or that thing, that job, that shift is the best. If it doesn’t turn out so, “can we blame ourselves for not knowing back then what we know now” well how was it possible. We grow, learn and evolve. What we are today is because of our decisions of yesterday, the good/bad/ugly ones. Some turn out good, even the ones which are seemingly bad might have paved ways to something great in your life . So trust this journey, as Freeman puts it. It will all start to make sense soon, she adds . Prioritise your mental health, well being. Keep up hope and heal .
