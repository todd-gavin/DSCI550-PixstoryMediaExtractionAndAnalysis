India Science is 50k Strong on youtube. That is indeed a great milestone and deserves a celebration. But why is it just a beginning?
Here are a few facts:
1. We were launched on Youtube on 11th April 2020, and in the span of 1 year, i.e till 10th April 2021, we gained 12.6k Subscribers.
2. From 11th April 2021 to 10th April 2022, we gained 21.8 Subscribers. *Almost twice of the first year*
3. From 11th April 2022 to 06th October 2022, we have already gained over 15.5k subscribers. 
Which clearly means *' The Growth is Growing'*
Now this deserves a better celebration. 
There is a long way for us to go, and 100k is not very far..
