All of us have our trauma! Each one of us has different levels and due for different reasons. Then how are we supposed to compare them? 

I have often seen people neglecting the so-called lesser trauma. You have encountered people telling you: see this person has a lot of trauma than you, they are handling it, so you just move on! I mean yes, I see them, I realise their trauma that doesn't make mine any lesser! 
I may not be able to move on within a wink and it's completely normal. We have very different situations that affect us all mentally in different ways. Even if it is the happiness it depends on individuals. All you can do to a person is listen, and empathise with them rather than judge or motivate them. Sometimes people don't need your motivation but are in a stage to talk about the trauma of years and want a listener without judgement. We are not experts and we cannot use our comparative motivation others! All we can do is listen and maybe give a hug!

Mind is a puzzle it gets stuck on this beyond your imagination and you get bouts of it throughout your life. Never give up as your concerns are valid and don't forget to seek help if you can't handle them by yourself
