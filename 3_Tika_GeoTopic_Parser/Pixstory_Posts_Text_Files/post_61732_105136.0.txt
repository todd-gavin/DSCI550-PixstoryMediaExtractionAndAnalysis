According to a recent report by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), Muslim students have been victimized by rampant Islamophobic sentiment.

Islamophobia in U.S. public schools is a prevalent and ongoing problem. Interviews were conducted with more than 500 muslim students, in the state of California. 

The results while heartbreaking are not really surprising, as the study found high levels of bullying and harassment and even discrimination from peers and adults alike. The most shocking thing of this study was that even the teachers did not hold back discriminating against the students. 


"Muslim students of all ages have been ostracized and mistreated in the past because of their faith and perceived, yet clearly false, association with 9/11 and other acts of terrorism,” said Amr Shabaik, the civil rights managing attorney for CAIR’s California chapter, which conducted the study.

The report said nearly half of the students, 47.1%, reported being bullied for being Muslim. That is more than twice the reported national average of 20%.

The details of the report are troublesome to say the least, as one in three students wearing hijab reported that their hijab was offensively touched, tugged or pulled at. 

Reports like these hold up a mirror to America, as the land of the free is still not the land free from discrimination and prejudices. It is imperative for the American Society to do better and have equal respect for the traditions and customs of all the religions.
