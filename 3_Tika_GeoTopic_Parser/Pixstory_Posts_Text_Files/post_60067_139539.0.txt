The Bihar Chief Minister met with the chief of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Sharad Pawar, and stated that he wanted the majority of opposition parties to band together, despite criticism from his former ally, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), for forging "opportunistic" alliances with non-BJP parties.
"A fantastic conversation took place. These (BJP) individuals are not working. Getting on the same page is crucial. I only need the majority of the opposition to be released. It will be in the country's best interest if (the opposition) unites "Following their meeting in New Delhi, Nitish Kumar stated.
Former union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad criticised Kumar for going to Delhi and claimed that the Bihar chief minister was there although his own state was experiencing a drought. Prasad called Kumar's affiliations a "political pilgrimage" and asserted that the nation has moved past such opportunistic coalitions.
He is attempting to bring these parties together, but after 2014, the nation moved past such opportunistic partnerships and will never again trust one, according to Prasad. Prasad mocked the assertions made by Janata Dal (United) and its ally Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) that Kumar might serve as the opposition's prime ministerial face in the general elections of 2024, saying that Kumar was the "last one in the queue" that also included Mamata Banerjee, K Chandrasekhar Rao, and Arvind Kejriwal.
Prasad called Kumar's assertion that the BJP won't even secure 50 seats in the Lok Sabha "daydreaming," but he added that he "cannot prohibit anyone from daydreaming."
Earlier, Kumar had stated that he had no interest in representing the opposition as prime minister in the general elections of 2024.
