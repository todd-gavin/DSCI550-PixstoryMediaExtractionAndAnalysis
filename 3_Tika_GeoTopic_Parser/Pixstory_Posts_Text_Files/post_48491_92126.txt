Deuteronomy Hear O Israel Yahweh our God Yahweh is one Psalm For great is Yahweh and most worthy of praise he is to be feared above all gods For all the gods of the nations are idols but Yahweh made the heavens Isaiah You are my witnesses declares Yahweh and my servant whom I have chosen so that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he Before me no god was formed nor will there be one after me Christians worship God exclusively because the Bible makes it clear it is God who created the heavens and the earth Gen As a consequence if God created all things then there can be no other god Any other god that people choose to worship is in reality something they have created or dreamt up for themselves You ll notice that the gods of the Greeks Romans Hindus and Egyptians all had something to do with creation such as the sun moon and sea All of these things were made by God himself As a result God correctly instructs all people to worship him rather than the things he made Unfortunately people choose to ignore God s decree in this matter and as a result they will face God s judgement cf Romans
