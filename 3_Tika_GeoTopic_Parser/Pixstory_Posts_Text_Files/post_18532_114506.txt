Nadal withdraws from Wimbledon The news came as a surprise yesterday evening at a surprise press conference convened around dinner time As you can imagine I&#39;m here to retire I have an abdominal injury I&#39;ve been thinking about the decision all day I think there is no point in going on the pitch even though I have often tried in my career but if I continue to play the injury will get worse and worse Nadal&#39;s words effectively stop the Majorcan&#39;s hope of winning the Grand Slam and reverse the situation which in the afternoon he thought it was manageable But no. I made this decision because I don&#39;t think I can win two games Nadal said again I can&#39;t serve I can&#39;t serve at the right speed and I can&#39;t make the necessary movements Imagining myself winning two games is impossible It&#39;s a matter of respect for myself not being competitive and making things worse makes no sense I&#39;ve had abs problems for about a week now but things were more or less under control But yesterday was the worst day Kyrgios thus goes directly to the final of the Wimbledon tournament and looking forward to see who will be his challenger between Djokovic and Norrie Nadal&#39;s streak at the Slams stops at matches for the title in Australia for the title at Roland Garros and the victories here at Wimbledon earlier today
