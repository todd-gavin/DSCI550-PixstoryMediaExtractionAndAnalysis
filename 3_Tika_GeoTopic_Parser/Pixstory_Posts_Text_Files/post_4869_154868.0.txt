The Mahakal temple is one of the 12 jyotirlingas in the country. The temple is dedicated to Hindu diety Shiva, who is also known as the destroyer or the god of time and death.
The form of Shiva in the Ujjain is that of Mahakal- the Lord of Time and Death. Kaal means time and death in Sanskrit, hence Shiva is also called Mahakaleshkar, and the temple is believed to be the  most sacred abode of Shiva.
Situated in banks of river Shipra in Ujjain, the Mahakaleshkar temple is believed to be built on 6th century  AD by Kumarasena, the son of Chandpradyot, former King of Ujjain.
As per Hindu Mythology it was built by Lord Brahma.
Over centuries it was redeveloped by multiple kings and kingdom came, hence having strong influences of the Bhumija, Chalukya and Maratha architectural style.
The lingam of Mahakaleshkar is known to be Dakshina Mukhi which means its south facing. This is the only south facing Shiva lingam in the country which is believed to be in direction of Yama- the God of Death, and Lord Shiva symbolises as the master of death or Mahakaleshkar.
Temple's unique south facing feature is upheld by the tradition of Tantric Shivnetra.
The magnificent temple is built on five storeys, one of which is underground.  The first is the Mahakaleshkar lingam and the second storey is the Omkareshkar Mahadev Idol. The third level houses the image of Nagarchandreshwar- Lord Shiva and Parvati seated on a ten-hooded snake.
The shrine of Nagchandreshwar opens only on Nag Panchami
