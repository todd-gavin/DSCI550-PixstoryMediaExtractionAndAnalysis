With Arsenal’s third game of the new league season soon to be upon us, Mikel Arteta took to the press office earlier today to speak on everything surrounding the club in the build up to kick off. Here’s the key points he made…


After injuries played a key part in our demise towards the end of last season, being able to say that all of the Arsenal first team are fit and available is a weight off everyone’s shoulders. When asked on the fitness of the returning players, Arteta responded positively; ‘Everybody is OK. Cedric, Fabio [Vieira] and Emile [Smith Rowe] played for the Under 21s. They are OK, they have trained all week so should be available’.
The return of two young and talented players is great news for Arsenal, who can only benefit from greater depth in our forward positions. The prospect of watching Fabio Vieira is surely an excitement for all Gooners, following the impressive season he had for Porto last year- where he accrued 20 goal involvements in 27 league games.


Since joining the club this summer, Marquinhos has been given the chance to train with the first team, and in recent weeks has been playing for the academy. It’s been an almost unanimous opinion from those watching these games that Marquinhos is too good for youth football, so reports of a potential loan to gain first team minutes have arisen. However, Arteta has quenched such rumours, saying that he is pleased with the way the young Brazilian has settled, and that he won’t be leaving on loan.

With just two years remaining on his current deal, focus has shifted to securing the long-term signature of Bukayo Saka. As he has consistently suggested in recent months, Arteta remains “confident” that he will sign, but accepts that he “would like to get it done so it’s not a distraction”.
Tying Saka down to a new contract could prove to be the best business Arsenal will do this summer.

There’s all your key points from Arteta’s conference…
