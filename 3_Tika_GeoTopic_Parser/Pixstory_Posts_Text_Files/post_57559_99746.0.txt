A diet rich in fruits and vegetables has been scientifically proven to provide numerous health benefits, such as reducing your risk of several chronic diseases and keeping your body healthy. However, making significant changes to your diet can sometimes seem very overwhelming. Instead of making substantial changes, it may be better to start with a few smaller ones. And it’s likely more manageable to start with just one thing rather than all of them at once.

These ways can make your diet healthier :

--Choose whole-grain bread instead of refined
You can easily make your diet a bit healthier by choosing whole-grain bread instead of traditional refined grain bread. On the other hand, whole grains have been linked to a variety of health benefits, including a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.

--Add Greek yoghurt to your diet
Greek yoghurt (or Greek-style yoghurt) is thicker and creamier than regular yoghurt. It has been strained to remove its excess whey, which is the watery part of milk. This results in a final product that’s higher in fat and protein than regular yoghurt.

--Eat eggs for breakfast
Eggs are incredibly healthy, especially if you eat them in the morning.
They are rich in high-quality protein and many essential nutrients, such as choline, that people often don’t get enough of.

--Increase your protein intake
Protein is often referred to as the king of nutrients, and it does seem to have some superpowers. Due to its ability to affect your hunger and satiety hormones, it’s often considered the most filling of the macronutrients. One study showed that eating a high-protein meal decreased ghrelin levels, the hunger hormone, more than a high-carb meal in people with obesity defined grains have been associated with many health issues.
