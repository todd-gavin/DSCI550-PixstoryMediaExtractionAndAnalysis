BOMBAY RAINS IN I have never lived in Bombay Mumbai sounds very parochial backward I am afraid In fact I have never visited the metro But I have heard so much about its legendary monsoon rains For people like us one of the best ways to experience the legendary Bombay rains vicariously is to watch the song Rimjhim Gire Saawan from the film Manzil It has a fresh faced Moushumi and an equally fresh faced Bachchan running stomping and playing around in the heavy downpour Quite remarkable how Basu Chatterji managed to record the song in the heavy downpour The female version of the song rendered by Lata is what I like better simply because of its breathtaking picturization The film started sometime in with a Zanjeer esque Bachchan in some of the scenes and finally released in when Bachchan was about to hit his ugly Coolie and Mard phase Splendid song With the two lovers oblivious to the world
