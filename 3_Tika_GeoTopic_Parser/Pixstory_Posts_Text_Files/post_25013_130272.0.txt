In this article, we shall be talking about 5 such instances where underdogs defeated favourites in the FIFA World Cup in the most unexpected fashion.

#5. South Korea beat Germany 2-0

This one is one of the most recent events on this list and perhaps one of the biggest and most shocking upsets of the last two decades. In their final group stage match of 2018, defending champions Germany needed a win to qualify for the the knockout stages after suffering an unfortunate loss against Mexico in their first match.

The match was drawn 0-0 at 90 minutes and Germany went all in for a goal after that in injury time. However, little did they know that the South Koreans had a big surprise in plan. The underdogs took the lead at 90+2’ from a corner.

Germany were impatiently looking for a goal and thus their goalkeeper Manuel Neuer got all the way up to help in the attack. Turned out he was putting the last nail to Germany’s coffin as a loss of possession led Son Heung-Min to score South Korea’s second goal with which they sealed Germany’s fate in the World Cup and sent them home.

#4. Senegal beat France 1-0

Senegal shocked the world on 31st May 2002 when they defeated a star-studded France team 1-0 in their first match of FIFA World Cup 2022. What made their victory even sensational was the fact that France were the defending champions having lifted their first FIFA World Cup trophy just in 1998.

Senegal’s Papa Bouba Diop gave them the lead in the 30th minute and were able to defend the 
lead for the remainder of the match. France, who had the likes of Trezeguet, Henry and Vieira in their team, were not able to find the back of the net in the entire match. Senegal went all the way to Quarter Finals in World Cup 2022 where they were finally knocked out by Turkey.
