Now, ahead of Adipurush's teaser launch, Kriti Sanon, Om Raut, and producer Bhushan Kumar were clicked at the Mumbai airport as they head to Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh. 🔥Along with the teaser, the first official poster of the film was also be released yesterday on the Sarayu River Bank in Uttarakhand. In the photos, Kriti looked stunning as she wore a blue Anarkali suit, while Om and Bhushan kept it casual as they posed for the paparazzi at the airport 🔥🔥The teaser shows Lord Ram in deep meditation underwater as demons from all directions come swirling in. He aims his arrows to take a few out when we get the first glimpse at Saif's Lankesh with ice-blue eyes, praying at a mountain. 🔥We also see him showing off his 10 heads to a woman sitting at his feet. He rides a demon-dragon-creature into battle and on the other side, Lord Ram is joined by his own army that includes Laxman and Hanuman with the vaanar sena.😍There is a short glimpse at Kriti's Sita as she swings in a meadow with Lord Ram smiling at her. It is followed by scenes of battle between the demons and the vaanar sena in Lanka. And all of it looks quite bad. The CGI reminds one of pre-2010 Bollywood, a far cry from Prabhas' own Baahubali series.❤️❤️❤️🔥Adipurush produced by T-Series Films and Retrophiles is being simultaneously shot in Hindi and Telugu. ✅The movie is reportedly based on the epic Ramayana, where Prabhas will play the role of Raghava, Kriti will play the role of Janaki, Saif will be seen in the role of Lankesh and Sunny Singh will play the character of Lakshman.❤️
