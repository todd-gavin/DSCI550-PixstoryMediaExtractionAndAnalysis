The Aurora Borealis, commonly referred to as the Northern Lights, are the result of interactions between the Sun and Earth's outer atmosphere. Aurora displays usually increase during times of the solar maximum.  They also usually show a greater frequency during the winter months, where the nights are longer and the skies generally void of haze. Although harmless to life on Earth, the Aurora can cause power disruptions in satellite communications and in radio/TV broadcasts.
