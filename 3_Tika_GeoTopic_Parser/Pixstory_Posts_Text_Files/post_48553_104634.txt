Such accusations are rich coming from someone who claims to research and read religions Religion in all its forms has different interpretations And all the accusations you made have absolutely nothing to do with how American Christians see christianity It is more about some evil people hiding behind religion to carry out their evil acts Once again having nothing to do with them being American Christians true Christians everywhere have always stood against wrong and always will We are normal people living normal lives not some secret cult trying to harm innocent children and nuns There are evil men all around in and out of america They do it in the names of all religions but that does not mean they represent the religion or the religious population of that country No Because when we try to generalize them we are labelled xenophobic or racists Then why are we being met with such generalization So many atheists commit unforgivable crimes so do we pack them all in one single box and accuse them all of that crime Once again I ask why is the general Christian population having to take the brunt of what people in power do We are just trying to live our lives with Christ in our heart and following His teachings
