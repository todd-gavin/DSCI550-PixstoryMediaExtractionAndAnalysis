The majestic midfield trio of Real has been together for over 7 years now, going into the history books of the beautiful game. 



Chelsea manager Tuchel said after the historic Champions league quarter final at Bernabeu, "we were beaten by pure individual quality". For sure, Chelsea lost to the experienced midfield of Real Madrid. Before the game, Tuchel planned 2 things, Reese James against Vinicius Jr and overload midfield, making Mount drop into midfield. But eventually, Modric's artistic assist broke the hearts of fighting Chelsea players. 



Brazilian Casemiro, Croatian Luka Modric and German Toni Kroos joined at the heart of Real from 2015. Together, they have won 3 champions league(15/16,16/17,17/18), 3 Club world cup (2016,17,18), 2 Uefa super cup (16/17,17/18), 3 spanish super cup, (17/18,19/20,21/22), 2 la liga (16/17, 19/20)


These three have played together over 225 matches for Madrid. Casemiro joined first, in 2013, followed by Modric from Spurs and Kroos from Bayern Munich. By now, Casemiro has played 496 matches, Kroos 356 and Modric 429. 


In 2014-15 Kroos and Modric won Club World cup and UEFA super cup but Casemiro was at Porto that season on loan. And in 2013-14 Modric and Casemiro together have won Champions league and Spanish cup winners cup before Kroos coming to Madrid. 


36 year old Modric is still looking in his prime, playing an important role in wins against star flooded PSG and Chelsea, both coming from behind. With the experienced squad Ancelotti is looking to add another UCL trophy to the record tally of 13. While Casemiro plays a vital role in balancing defense, bridging transition to attack, Kroos's role is unparalleled accuracy in passing. He sends balls like a rocket launched with infrared and delivers set pieces that create danger in the opposition box most of the time. 


Ancelotti has previous experience of handling great midfielders before from AC Milan -Gennaro Gattuso, Clarence Seedorf and Andrea Pirlo.


Between them they won six Serie A winner’s medals and were pivotal in Milan winning two Champions League titles (2003 & 2007).
