Pau Torres


United had only 5 Premier League teams who were ahead in terms of conceding goals. It is rather a worrying trend. United are linked with ex-Europa League winner Pau Torres. United have been after him for quite a while. His positioning and good defensive awareness are what the bosses are after. His ability to run and close down the gaps is what United need when they are under pressure from the opponents. He is a very good progressor with the ball. He is not afraid of progressing with the ball in the middle third of the pitch. 


Pau can also pop in with a goal or two to help his team. This season he has already scored 4 goals. 

Goncalo Inacio


The defender, who plays as a centre-back, does not have any problem playing at the right or left centre-back position. He usually rushes down to close the space. His hard-working nature and ability to intercept passes crosses his ability to deal with one on one situation. He has only one yellow card this season, which is something United want. A player who is disciplined while making defensive actions. 

Midfield


The United midfield has been a thorn in their foot. Their inability to buy a midfielder and go for other filled up places has not boded well for the Mancunian club. Erik Ten Hag’s priority will be to buy a defensive midfielder. There is a list of players United are linked with. 


James Garner


The 22-year-old, who is at Loan to Nottingham Forest, has been making waves there. The Englishman is known for finding his teammates very well. He is known as the dead-ball specialist, as he scored 3 goals from there. He is a typical box-to-box midfielder rather than a defensive midfielder. He usually creates chances in the game rather than sit back and build up the play. Due to his athletic prowess, he is able to dispossess opponents. His recovery rate, pressurizing opponents to commit errors is noteworthy. Plus as he is part of United, so it won’t burn in their pockets to get him.
