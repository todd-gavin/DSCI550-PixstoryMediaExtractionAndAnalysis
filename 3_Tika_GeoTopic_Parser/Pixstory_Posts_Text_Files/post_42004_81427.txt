By this point it is pretty clear that we need to move forward and away from the unhealthy and unethical status quo which is characterized by a detrimental environment and groped by capitalism But without knowing what to move towards how do we move in the first place In this sense Solarpunk also provides a direction it becomes a goal an inspiration for us to commit to consequential change thus rooting itself into the present as much as it is a figment of imagination of the future Solarpunk is a genre of ecologically oriented speculative fiction characterized both by its aesthetic and its underlying socio political vision Sylva Originated as an art movement in the early s essentially on the internet solarpunk dares to envision a future with an underlying assumption Said assumption being humanity was able to solve all major contemporary challenges Solarpunk envisions a world that works on principles of social justice sustainability economic equality and other values without having its roots in fossils or capitals Majorly green with clear blue skies buildings mostly made of glass for better absorption of sunheat lapped with plants all over them renewable sources such as solar wind and tidal for energy generation are a few characteristics of the solarpunk vision Furthermore solarpunk goes on to imagine an anarchical system characterized by sustainable production consumptions and distribution at the community level instead of large shady corporations feeding on fossil fuels to satisfy and further fuel unhealthy consumerist patterns A homegrown economy where technology is used to solve all contemporary problems in a low carbon generation manner As such perhaps one of the most dominant characteristics of solarpunk is not turning back the wheel of time and going back to the era before fossil fuels existed Instead solarpunk encourages technological development and imagines harmonious co existence of humanity and technology In stark contrast with cyberpunk Solar punk embodies the ideals of anti consumerism egalitarianism decentralization social inclusivity and self sufficiency
