Yes I m THAT friend the one that always prefers comfort over style I mean i dont look completely homeless but definitely underdressed among my group of friends who are dressed impressively head to toe as you can clearly make out in the picture above And it s not that I put zero efforts to be presentable at all times but sometimes I really prefer wearing something that ll be comfortable in nbsp for longer rather than something trendy but uncomfy like they say you pull off clothes better when you re comfortable in them even though they may be basic you re comfy and hence confident As for this picture above I Love shoes but would I wear them in peak monsoon when it rains unpredictably and be all uncomfortable when they get all soaked ABSOLUTELY NOT Afterall I was just there to have fun with friends
