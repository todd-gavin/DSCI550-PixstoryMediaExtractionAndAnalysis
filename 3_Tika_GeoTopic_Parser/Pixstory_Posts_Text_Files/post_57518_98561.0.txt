Since the leaked draft of overturning the right to abortion was disseminated in the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade, there's complete mayhem in the milieu.
The constant dismay surrounds every mind, and the only question is, how can their country go back 50 years?
A lot has been said about this everywhere, and social media is flooding with a whole movement where people think that talking about their stories and experiences of abortion online would put pressure on the government and their representatives to change their opinion and not make abortion illegal.
Many think that it can move public opinion and turn into a movement where people from all over the country would come together to narrate their stories on social media.
Women shared their stories of how abortion saved their lives, and they're bestowed upon the life they're living now.
A woman took to Twitter to describe her experience,
“I had an abortion when I was 19 and I’ve never felt comfortable talking about it online. We talk about destigmatising many things, but we desperately need to destigmatise abortion.”
Well, yes, that's what we need to do, destigmatise abortion and not associate it with religious values and killing of an unborn as many the women don't choose to be pregnant; it happens to be a matter of an accident, an indelible mark on them which comes with disgrace and ignominy from the society. These women have a right to live without the horror of being excluded from the community.
Another tweet read, 
“I had a legal abortion shortly after Roe v. Wade was passed. I do not regret it because it was an accident, and I was too young to be a mother.”
These women online have a vision that these narrated stories and experiences would change people's minds, and it would turn into a movement, a fight against women's rights.
