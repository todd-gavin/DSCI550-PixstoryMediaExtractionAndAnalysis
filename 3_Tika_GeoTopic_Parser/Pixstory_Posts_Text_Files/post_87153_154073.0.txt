Cristiano Ronaldo made headlines when he announced his move from Juventus to Manchester United in 2021. It marked a return for the Portugese modern day legend to the club where he became a world class attacker. 
United paid a fee of £‎12.5 million to bring their former frontrunner back to the club. It was reported that Ronaldo had signed a two year deal with an option to extend the contract by one year. That would keep him in Manchester till 2023. Initially Ronaldo wage bill was said to amount to but later reports suggested a sum of £385,000 a week. 
This meant that the No.7 had to take a pay cut of more than £6 million annually at the Red Devils. At Juventus, Ronaldo was receiving £500,000 a week. But the forward’s agent Jorge Mendes had to make a hasty deal that involved a pay cut so that his transfer could be secured before the transfer window shut. 
Annually the £20 million deal at Old Trafford was detailed as initial £13 million (€15m/$18m) with add-ons of up to £7m (€8m/$9m). Although some media houses reported that the £385,000 Portugal’s captain earned last season has come down to £360,000 because of the failure to qualify for the Champions League. 
Ronaldo’s unhappiness in United
After just one season at his darling club, Cristiano Ronaldo has felt extremely unhappy and dissatisfied as a United player. This had a lot to do with how Manchester United performed last season. Ronaldo was vocal that they needed to change their lackluster management system and bring in new players both on-off the field. 
A new manager in the form of Erik Ten Hag was brought in at the start of the season but that didn’t stop Ronaldo from trying his best to offer his services to other big clubs in Europe. Eventually the transfer window shut and he had to stay put at Manchester as he goes on to miss an entire year of Champions League football.
