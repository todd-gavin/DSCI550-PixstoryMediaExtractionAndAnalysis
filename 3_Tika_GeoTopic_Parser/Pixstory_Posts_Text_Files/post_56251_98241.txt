 According to Judge Samuel Alito abortion rights are deeply flawed and exceptionally weak mentioned a right that was nowhere in the constitution According to Politico he said survey of history ranged from the constitutionally irrelevant to the incorrect Alito continues adding that its thinking was exceptionally weak and that the original decision has had damaging consequences He also points out that The inescapable conclusion is that a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation s history and traditions Alito writes The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion the draft concludes Roe and Casey arrogated that authority We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives Alito declares that one of the central tenets of Roe the viability distinction between fetuses not capable of living outside the womb and those which can makes no sense He also describes doctors and nurses who terminate pregnancies as abortionists Alito s use of the phrase egregiously wrong to describe Roe echoes the language Mississippi Solicitor General Scott Stewart used in December in defending his state s ban on abortions after weeks of pregnancy Alito s words mark the impertinence of abortion rights in the country We have cultural ages that don t stand with killing Unborn babies have the right to life they should not be killed The pain the fetuses have to undergo is large Abortion denies the chance to adopt babies and yes those doctors should be called abortionists because the original text of the Hippocratic Oath traditionally taken by doctors when swearing to practise medicine ethically forbids abortion If you don t wish to keep a child you can always choose to adopt Republicans do stand with all the people and fight for the rights of everyone
