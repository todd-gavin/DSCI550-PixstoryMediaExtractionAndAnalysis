The story of Manokamna played by Nushrratt Bharuccha, a small-town girl from Chanderi, Madhya Pradesh who has to find a job as she has a deadline of a month or else she will get married as per her parent's wish. So this leads her to the escapade of landing a job as a saleswoman in a condom manufacturing company. How this decision affects her life & her loved ones forms the rest of the story.

The movie which seemed in the trailer to be a witty comedy about sexual illiteracy in India fails to address its fundamental issue effectively.

Most of the movie is about boring one-liners & punches and nothing exciting happens during the extremely long duration of 2 hrs 27 mins.

Just like many small-town comedies which have seen a rise in Bollywood in recent years, it's a predictable film. After the first 30 mins, it's pretty easy to figure out how the rest of the story is gonna unfold.

The social boycott, misogyny, sudden change of heart, a spineless man shown as the hero, everything we have seen a thousand times before, it's all here.

The only good part is Nushrratt, who carries the entire movie on her shoulders. But you'll get bored of her due to the almost 3-hour long running time. If anything, this film proves her might as an actress who with the right script & screenplay can deliver an entertaining story which sadly isn't 'Janhit Mein Jaari'.

If the makers have created a balance in the comedy & awareness part of the film, it would have made it enticing & impactful. But most of the film is dumb punch liners & family dramas and fails to shine a bright light on the issue of safe sex & sexual illiteracy in the country.
