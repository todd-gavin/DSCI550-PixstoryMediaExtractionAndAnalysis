In Retirement continues Even to day in fact and in reality we have a unitary Government in India why not translate this reality into a Constitutionality Though the Constitution is federal the Government in truth is unitary If someone asks me who rules India to day my answer will be the Congress High Command and not the Parliament or State Legislatures The writ of the High Command runs throughout the country and its mandate is obeyed in the Parliament Where the party is not in power in all States then its writ will cease to run It is time to make safeguards against such eventualities whoever has majority in Parliament rules and there shall be no conflict between Centre and States A considerable number of intelligent men now wasting their time in mutual squabbles about offices and ministerships will become available for constructive work on the economic plane and of a selfless character Par liament will also be manner with better class of members than today and good people will be available for Central Ministership Moreover a sense of loyalty to Bharat as one country will develop and there will be no States to which people can owe allegiance and loyalty If my proposal is accepted crores of rupees which are now spent on State Ministeries Secretariats motor cars etc will be saved for utility work and schemes for benefit of the citizens Cost of administration will go down considerably The headache you get and the time you spend in settling quarrels amongst State Ministers and State politicians will be saved and you will be able to utilize it for economic development of the country The problem of arranging States on linguistic basis will disappear Let them be organized on any basis People who are now fighting for States will not demand them if the States are not to be autonomous and they are to have no Ministers and Legislatures At least throw out this hint and see the reaction Chances of the country lapsing with different fighting units or an togonistic units will be considerably reduced To be continued
