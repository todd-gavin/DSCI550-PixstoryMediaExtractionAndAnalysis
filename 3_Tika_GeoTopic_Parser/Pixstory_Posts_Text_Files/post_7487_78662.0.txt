A heartless man caught on video knocking his 2-year-old son to the floor inside a Harlem restaurant has been arrested, police said Tuesday.

Mandelo Stroman, 26, turned himself in at the 32nd Precinct stationhouse Monday and confessed to the assault, which unfolded in the Red Star Chinese restaurant on Adam Clayton Powell Blvd. at W. 147th St. about 5:40 p.m. Saturday, cops said.

Surveillance video from inside the restaurant shows Stroman carrying the small child into the restaurant vestibule, setting the tot on the floor and then hitting the boy “with a closed fist in the stomach,” according to court documents.

“The child was struck with such force that he was knocked to the ground,” prosecutors said, adding that the little boy “appeared to cry out in pain.”

The attacker then placed the victim in a stroller and the two left the restaurant.

Cops quickly released the video and asked the public’s help identifying the assailant.

Stroman is charged with assault and acting in a manner injurious to a child. A Manhattan Criminal Court judge ordered him released without bail during a brief arraignment proceeding late Monday.

The judge issued an order of protection barring Stroman from contact with his son.

Stroman lives a block away from the restaurant, cops said. He has a criminal record but it wasn’t immediately clear if any of his past arrests involved domestic violence offenses, a police source said.
