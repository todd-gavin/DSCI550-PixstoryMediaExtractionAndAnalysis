Chelsea s bizarre desire to play Saturday s FA Cup quarter final at the Riverside behind closed doors has been criticised by Middlesbrough Chelsea s ticket sales were halted last Thursday as a result of the UK government penalising Roman Abramovich for his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin The Blues are only permitted to continue operating under a special government licence that allows existing ticket holders to attend games but no new sales including home and away matchday tickets are permitted Chelsea have sold tickets out of their initial away allocation at the Riverside believing they are now at a sporting disadvantage and that a game behind closed doors would be the fairest way of proceeding in the current circumstances Middlesbrough whose home tickets had all sold out termed the move bizarre and without any merit whatsoever in a statement on their website after Chelsea contacted them to request the game be played in front of an empty stadium They wrote All concerned are well aware of the reasons Chelsea have been sanctioned and that this has nothing to do with Middlesbrough Football Club To suggest as result that Middlesbrough and our fans should be penalised is not only grossly unfair but without any foundation Given the reasons for these sanctions for Chelsea to seek to invoke sporting integrity as reason for the game being played behind closed doors is ironic in the extreme We currently await formal notification from the FA of the next steps but rest assured Middlesbrough will resist Chelsea s actions in the strongest terms Chelsea have been in discussions with the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation about ticket sales for the game but has been unable to find a breakthrough as yet and a request to give tickets away to fans for free has not been answered by the government
