Today, the United Nations Human Rights Council approved a resolution on Afghan women and condemned the violation of women's rights by the Taliban. Mark Lemon, executive director of the World Rights Group, said that if the United Nations ties the protection of women's rights to international aid, it can exert pressure on the Taliban.

The United Nations Human Rights Council has called on the Taliban to end restrictions on women.

VÃ¡clav Balk, the Czech ambassador on behalf of the European Union, who presented this resolution, said: "Since August 2021, the human rights situation in Afghanistan has worsened, especially for women and girls."

He said, "The restrictive measures implemented by the Taliban make women invisible in the Afghan society."

This resolution was approved with the support of dozens of countries. China described the resolution as "unbalanced".

Decisions of the UN Human Rights Council are not legally binding, but because of their political weight, they can lead to official investigations.

Observers say that despite the Taliban's previous promises, women's rights have been severely violated.

Mohibullah Tayeb, Afghanistan's representative in this council, who was appointed by the previous Afghan government, said that the Taliban's restrictions are equivalent to "gender apartheid".

Michelle Taylor, the US Ambassador to the Council, has also expressed concern about the actions of the Taliban. He says the Taliban's policies create an environment of "constant fear" in Afghanistan.
