Best goalkeeper in Ligue yet another recognition for Gianluigi Donnarumma awarded on the evening of the UFNP Awards assigned by the French Assocalciatori to the best players in the country Donnarumma&#39;s season characterized by alternating with Keylor Navas PSG precisely at a crossroads with the Costa Rican goalkeeper who he could leave Paris to start elsewhere Close to the awards Donnarumma looked back on his season I played half of the games but the award means that I worked well and played excellent matches it was a good year in Ligue and one bad move in the Champions League made us collapse despite having dominated for a long time against Real Madrid No alibi we could have done better Next year but we will bring home many trophies If I feel like the number I already know I am And I will be here again next year
