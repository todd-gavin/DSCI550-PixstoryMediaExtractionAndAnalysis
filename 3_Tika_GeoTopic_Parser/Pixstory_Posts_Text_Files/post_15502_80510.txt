An international team led by the Istituto officina dei materiali of the National Research Council Cnr Iom has identified the multifunctional characteristics typical of quantum materials in a material known as EuSn PI The results of the study published in PNAS constitute a step forward in the field of potentially useful quantum materials for electronics and sensors of the future We have demonstrated that EuSn P possesses extraordinary characteristics, for example its quantum properties are interconnected to the electrical ones, moreover these properties change as the depth of the material changes Each layer of this material contains a different element and depending on of whichever element is exposed the electronic properties of the surface change together with the magnetic properties explains Giancarlo Panaccione of the Cnr Iom The fundamental characteristic of quantum materials is precisely this conformation of theirs which is called in or even in which underlines their ability to incorporate different characteristics These materials show electric properties and magnetic properties that influence each other The study of the interactions between electric and magnetic properties has led to the discovery of new entities the quasi-particles which represent in materials science the analogue of elementary particles for high-energy physics It is a field that has opened new doors to research and confirmed old theories The field of quantum materials is constantly growing and of enormous interest for optimized energy management and other applications The research results are not yet directly applicable to current devices but confirm that the study of quantum materials paves the way towards a vast number of applications These results constitute the transition from the notion that a material corresponds to a function to that of aluminum i.e. the idea of a material capable of performing even very different functions concludes Panaccione The first possible applications will be energy efficiency and the miniaturization of electronic devices of the future
