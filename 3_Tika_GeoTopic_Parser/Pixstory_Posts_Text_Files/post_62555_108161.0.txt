Giraffes are the world's tallest land animals, with adults reaching heights of up to 20 feet (6 metres). While their enormous size is well-known, few people know much else about these magnificent creatures. Despite their humongous height, giraffes keep a low profile, often chewing leaves quietly in the background as other animals take centre stage.

One fact about giraffes that is both adorable and surprising is that they babysit. Yeah you read it right!

In nursery herds, mother giraffes will frequently travel and browse with their babies. Because the babies enjoy hanging out and playing together, they are watched over by single females in a cr√®che. The babies in this "nursery" develop through playing with one another, gaining physical and social abilities. They begin eating leaves around the age of four months, but continue to nurse until they are six months old. This allows the other mothers to feed and socialize in peace, confident in the knowledge that their babies are being looked after until they are ready to take over the babysitting chores themselves.It takes a village to raise a child, and the children of these majestic mammals are no exception.
