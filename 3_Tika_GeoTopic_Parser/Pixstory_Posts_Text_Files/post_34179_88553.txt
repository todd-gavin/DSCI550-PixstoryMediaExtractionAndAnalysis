At the end of the match against Sampdoria which ended up for the blucerchiati, the Venice coach analyzed the match as follows The verdict on the clear field we prepared the match and committed suicide We then didn&#39;t have the strength to get it back psychologically a tough moment We are working hard to get out of it we talk a lot and we prepare for matches with anger but often we complicate life I take responsibility for the boys&#39; mistakes but we all have to do more They challenged us and they are right you can&#39;t block a game like this The mentality is built day after day by thinking about the mistakes and not repeating them it was a continuous error by everyone The team is not serene and when they play with the pressure of the result the mechanism gets stuck Until Saturday we are defiant then the referee blows his whistle and our legs tremble We find it hard to go beyond our mistakes because they often repeat themselves and we lost games with an advantage Then we met the big names who took away our self-esteem and this is where our experience and quality had to come out by finding goals from individual situations If we combine that we give away goals, we put Sampdoria on the right track Then they had an opportunity when there were ten of us because of Henry&#39;s bullshit in fact I got pissed because they are wrong signals At the end of the first half the referee came to tell us that he pardoned him pretending not to hear an insult in English Now we have to keep up our strength we have and play the next game to the fullest Right now we need to talk little and do more on the pitch Today I don&#39;t like the chatter the team should be helped and not penalized
