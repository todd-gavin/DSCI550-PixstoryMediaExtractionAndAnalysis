Mazepin, who is about to enter his second year in F1, has had his spot on the grid thrown into doubt as governments and organisations impose more sanctions against Russia over the country's invasion of Ukraine.

Motorsport's governing body, the FIA, has banned drivers from Russia and Belarus from racing under their national flags, but will allow them to compete.

However, Motorsport UK says it will not let any Russian or Belarusian drivers or teams compete in the United Kingdom.

That means Mazepin will not be allowed to compete in July's British Grand Prix.

Motorsport UK chairman David Richards said the motorsport community needed to play its part in opposing the invasion of Ukraine.

Haas, which finished last in the 2021 F1 constructors' championship, is no longer displaying the logo of its major sponsor, Russian fertiliser company Uralkali, and there is speculation the two will part ways.

Nikita Mazepin has made very few public statements about his future since the Ukraine invasion started.

Russian Formula 1 driver Nikita Mazepin will not be allowed to race in the British Grand Prix, even if he still has a seat with the Haas team.

Motorsport Australia also considers a ban on Russian drivers. This could mean that, even if Mazepin would keep his seat, the Russian could be banned from multiple races.

Rumors suggest Haas have decided that Nikita Mazepin will not continue with the team, with Pietro Fittipaldi stepping in to replace him. The official announcement is expected soon, as the Brazilian will also be behind the wheel for the Bahrain pre season testing.
