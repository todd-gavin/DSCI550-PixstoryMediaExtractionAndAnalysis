G Michael Felker MD MHS Svati H Shah MD MHS Abstract Background Mobile health mHealth platforms can affect health behaviors but have not been rigorously tested in randomized trials Objectives We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of a pragmatic mHealth intervention in patients with HF and DM Methods We conducted a multicenter randomized trial in patients with both HF and DM to assessing a mHealth intervention to improve physical activity and medication adherence compared to usual care The primary endpoint was change in mean daily step count from baseline through months Other outcomes included medication adherence health related quality of life and metabolomic profiling Results The mHealth group had an increase in daily step count of steps day at months whereas the usual care group had a decline of steps day LS mean between group difference steps day CI p Medication adherence measured using the Voils Adherence Questionnaire did not change from baseline to months LS mean change in mHealth vs in usual care p The mHealth group had an improvement in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary Score KCCQ OSS compared to the usual care group LS mean difference points CI p Thirteen metabolites primarily medium and long chain acylcarnitines changed differently between treatment groups from baseline to months p Conclusions In patients with HF and DM a month mHealth intervention significantly improved daily physical activity health related quality of life and metabolomic markers of cardiovascular health but not medication adherence Sources
