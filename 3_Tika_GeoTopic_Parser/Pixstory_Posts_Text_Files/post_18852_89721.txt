With Italy now out of the World Cup after the defeat against North Macedonia, he will have much more to think about than the next team he will play for when his contract with Chelsea expires. Speaking about Jorginho&#39;s future, agent Joao Santos has thought about it making assumptions about what could happen after June It is a dream for him to play in Serie A His heart is here Today he can play in teams Milan Inter Juve Rome or Naples In the recent past both Milan and Barcelona have been interested in the blue player as he said the same Joao Santos Opening now towards the top Italian teams even if Chelsea cannot sell or buy for the moment so we have to wait Juve I know Cherubini from his experience at Foligno but there are many clubs that are interested in him In the past I spoke to the Psg Barcelona and also with Massara from Milan I don&#39;t know if they are still interested The reality is that nothing can be done right now Chelsea can&#39;t sell they can&#39;t buy and can&#39;t renew contracts
