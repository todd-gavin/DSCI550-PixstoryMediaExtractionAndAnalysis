I am am spiritual, so it has been my observation that spiritual people do feel stupid around not-so-spiritual people, but they perceive it to be the opposite - that is, that it’s the not-so-spiritual people who feel stupid, ignorant and “exposed” around them. At least, that is my observation with a good number of spiritual people I spoke to (not all of them, of course), and it was also my own experience when I suddenly became overwhelmingly spiritual myself, which, fortunately, didn’t last very long.

If you are spiritual yourself and you feel stupid around not-so-spiritual people, this is a very good sign. Continue your practice and try to be around not-so-spiritual people as much as possible, until there’s no stupidity left in you!
