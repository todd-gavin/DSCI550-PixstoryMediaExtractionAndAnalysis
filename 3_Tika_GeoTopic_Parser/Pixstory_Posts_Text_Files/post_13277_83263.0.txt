Peace and an end to war is a dream for every citizen of Afghanistan, but with each passing day, the path to achieving this dream becomes more complex and difficult.
Peace should not be a dream!
Peace is a dream for the people of Afghanistan right now, but the Afghan government must work to make that dream a reality. Peace and stability should not become an unattainable dream for the people of Afghanistan and we should dream of peace and tranquility for generations, but we may not experience it in our lives.
In the first step, the Afghan government must formulate a clear strategy for war and peace; What the current situation shows is the lack of it in the country's diplomatic apparatus. As long as we do not have a clear strategy in this regard and each time we come to the talks with a few assumptions, we will not achieve a positive result and peace will remain a dream and our regret will be more and more every day.
In the second step, the government must be able to obtain the support of neighboring countries and countries in the region for the peace process in Afghanistan and the government's peace strategy, and convince them that peace in Afghanistan will also benefit them and cause security threats in their countries. Also be reduced.
With a clear war and peace strategy and a strong presence behind the negotiating table, the Afghan government is expected to be able to untie the knot of peace in the country, make the Afghan people's dream of peace a reality, and improve the country's political and security stability.
