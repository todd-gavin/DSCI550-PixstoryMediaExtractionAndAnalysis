Ben Shapiro's conservative media outlet, The Daily Wire, has hired a former Disney employee to help expand its subscription streaming business. 

Hollywood Reporter said that in particular, as it continues to invest in the entertainment industry, the company has appointed Eric Caballero as its new Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), who will be in charge of all marketing efforts. The company claims that legacy companies like Disney have abandoned their family-friendly roots. 

Caballero most recently held the position of vice president at Disney's division for the distribution of media and entertainment.

Among other projects, Caballero will lead marketing for The Daily Wire+, the companyâ€™s streaming platform. While it includes politically focused content from The Daily Wire as well as some other conservative programming, the company is moving further into entertainment, committing $100 million to produce kids and family fare, and expanding into original movies (including a Gina Carano-led offering called Terror on the Prairie).
