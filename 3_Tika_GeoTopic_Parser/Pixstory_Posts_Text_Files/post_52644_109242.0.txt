You reach out to your friend and talk about your job problem, and she starts talking about something entirely different. Does this sound familiar? Do you ever feel that the person is preoccupied?  Effective communication begins with listening with a clear intention. When you feel distant or distracted, take a deep breath and redirect your attention. When you are mindful, you hone your listening abilities. 
We are lost in our digital bubbles and have no time for others, even when we make an effort, a constant distraction from technology takes over, and we miss out on good associations. When a person share one’s thoughts, he is giving a piece of you but we do not have the time to sit and talk, tell stories. Listening carefully and purposefully without  interrupting the other person is the need of the hour as the high tech communication has made interactions intrusive, taken the helm over by text messages and emojis. 
If someone wants to remove their stumbling blocks or share their accomplishments, feel fortunate and give them a patient ear. An avid listener is a guiding force, a sounding board, and a therapist for a friend. To take it further, gently ask questions while hanging on to the person’s words and giving undivided attention. When we lend an ear, we pave an inroad to non-verbal communication, an effective gateway to understanding. Never hijack the conversation, enter their world, and be compassionate and genuinely interested in the person by attempting to understand the point of view of the other person. Listening is more important than talking as we have two ears and one mouth. 
Have you ever visited old people living by themselves and see how  eagerly they are looking for someone to listen to them?  It is not only them we all love the vibes of a good conversation and a desire to be understood. When you listen profoundly with curiosity, it makes a conversation delightful.
