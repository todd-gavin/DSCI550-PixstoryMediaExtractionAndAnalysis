I'M WONDER WOMAN!🌟
I wonder where my keys are 
I wonder why I went upstairs
I wonder where my mind has gone
I wonder who will annoy me today
I came upon this humorous menopause poster 😂 when looking for women's health posters.♀️

Menopause is a transition in a women's life as her menstrual cycle comes to an end.
It is confirmed 12 months post the final period.🩸
Symptoms like hot flashes, weight gain, headache, vaginal dryness, mood swings, and not being able to concentrate; are experienced during menopause.😢
But good nutrition can help prevent or ease certain conditions that may develop during and after menopause.🥙
⭐ Aim 2-3 portions of protein daily
⭐ Alcohol can worsen hot flashes. 
⭐ Abstain from smoking
⭐ Increase calcium, vit D supplements
⭐ Minimum 30 minutes daily physical activity can reduce anxiety, insomnia and pain.
