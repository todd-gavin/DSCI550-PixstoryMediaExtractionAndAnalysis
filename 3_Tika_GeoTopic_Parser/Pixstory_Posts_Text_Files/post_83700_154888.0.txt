How do you recognise true love?
How can you tell if it is genuine?
A philosopher named Sartre once said, "In love, one and one are one." This is a simple and straightforward rule.
When the other person becomes a second you, when they are your favourite hello and least favourite goodbye, when you can finish their sentences, and when you are intimately acquainted with features about them that no one else is.
Love is when one and one make one rather than when one and one make two.
