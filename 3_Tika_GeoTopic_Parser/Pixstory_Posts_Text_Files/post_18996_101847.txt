Yesterday evening Di Maria played his last match for PSG He scored and made an assist against Metz then was greeted with great affection for his fans for seven seasons Now it&#39;s time to think about the future the Argentine hasn&#39;t yet made it known where he will play next year even if Juventus remains the most probable track Di Maria said on the non-renewal that it was more a choice of the club I would have liked to stay one more year to realize the dream of winning the Champions League with PSG Here we are we came close we lost in the final and this is my only regret I am convinced that the boys will soon make it he said at the end of the last match of the French championship won by his own PSG On the future at Juventus he replied saying no but laughing Which leaves understand that they could soon be new If he signs with Juventus No laughs ed I&#39;m calm I think of myself and my family Later I&#39;ll see what will be the best solution for the future
