“Children are a crushing responsibility”. - Leda

To raise a child is not an easy process, some mothers have to raise their children under limited financials, others have to raise them with an absent partner, the list for a mother’s struggle goes on and on. 

As a man it is hard for me to understand the complexity of motherhood, but watching two recent Netflix movies did make me think about the other, more painful aspect of motherhood, “The Failed one”. 

Netflix released its heavily acclaimed “Pieces of a woman” last year with Vanessa Kirby winning millions of hearts and coming very close to winning an Oscar, the movie is about Martha losing her child to a still born moment, while Martha’s journey is the one which is portrayed in the film, Martha’s mother, played by Ellen Burstyn goes on a journey parallel to hers as she makes peace with the fact that her daughter is broken due to a miscarriage. The movie tackles two women who are finding it difficult to tackle this one challenge to their desire of being a good mother, with both losing their child in very different ways. 

The second movie is Netflix’s recent sensation, “The Lost Daughter”, a cast with Olivia Colman, Dakota Johnson and Jessie Buckley already made me go for it, but it is the plot of the movie that intrigued me a lot. Olivia Colman plays a woman who has failed in her upbringing of her children, when she decides to take a vacation to a warm and cozy place, she meets Nina, played by Dakota Johnson, while I don’t want to provide any spoilers, I think its safe to say that Nina and Leda find an unwanted but profound connection with each other to the end where Nina goes to Leda seeking answers to the problems of her life. Nina, also in some ways has failed to keep her motherhood desire as the child becomes overly stressful for her. 

Both the movies show a very different light of motherhood, a pain and suffering usually not talked about but most importantly, not understood.
