House of the Dragon, the prequel to "Game of Thrones", has garnered the largest ever audience for any new movie or series that has ever been streamed on  HBO.
Staying true to the roots of Game of Thrones, this series exceeded my expectations in the first episode itself.
House of the Dragon, so far, is as epic as GOT was during its peak. It feels like a fresh start after an undisputed letdown in the GOT finale.
The first episode has everything that we've admired about GOT, be it the amazing cinematography, the soothing yet spine-chilling music, or the sheer uncertainty of the plot. The cast did a great job in illustrating the gravity of their characters.
The CGI of the Dragons, if I may say, looks better than anything cinema has ever offered us yet. It's heartening to acknowledge that they've not modified the incredible music of GOT. With a huge budget, they've made certain that the world of Westeros is the best that we've witnessed yet.
If you are a true fan of Game Of Thrones then you know G.R.R. Martin is one of the best writers known to mankind and beyond. Teamed up with D.B Weiss & David Benioff they created the masterpiece known as ( GOT ) " Game Of Thrones " which sadly came to end after 8 amazing seasons with 73 episodes. GOT was so effortlessly created & written it literally kept millions of viewers from all around the world and every walk of life entertained for over 8 years and coming back more each week. It was the most watched series ever in history and after watching House Of The Dragon season 1 episode 1 (The Heirs of the Dragon), it has no doubt the same magnificent skill of creativity as Game Of Thrones, if not more.
The reception, the premiere has got is well deserved. It wouldn't be wrong to say that dragons have woken the GOT fans from a long slumber after the debacle in the season finale.
Eagerly awaiting the future episodes over the next two months. Let's hope it continues to shine just like the premiere!
