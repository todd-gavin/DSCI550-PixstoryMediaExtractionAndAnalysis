Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who just suffered a 37-point defeat in her GOP primary on Tuesday, floated the idea of running for president in 2024 on NBC's "Today" show. One might argue that this is brave move but there are also some saying that this move will bear no fruit.

The Washington Post reported that Cheney has previously mentioned the prospect, but on Wednesday she said she wasn't especially offended by her party's historic reprimand. She also swiftly changed her House campaign into a leadership committee with the intention of blocking Trump in 2024.

Let keep in mind that the 2024 campaign is quite close, even in the best-case scenario for Cheney — a scenario in which she is shrewdly playing the long game and betting on Trump's ultimate demise. 

The initial campaigns will probably start soon, as Cheney pointed out. Despite the fact that Trump has a number of legal issues and there are indications that GOP voters may choose someone else as their next nominee, such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), there are also few signs of a significant anti-Trump shift within the party. 

It's also possible that Cheney is only using this supposition for political purposes, as many politicians do.

Let’s see what happens next!
