'March Madness' has been trending for two days now, and is currently trending at #2 after 'St Patrick'.

Friday's March Madness slowed a little, with the higher seeded largely taking care of business. On the second day of the NCAA tournament in 2022, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, Miami Hurricanes, and Iowa State Cyclones were the only double-digit seeded teams to advance. Meanwhile, the Auburn Tigers, Villanova Wildcats, and Purdue Boilermakers all won important games.
