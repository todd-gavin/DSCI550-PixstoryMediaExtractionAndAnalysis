She worked so hard and cared about her nation She genuinely intended to dedicate her entire life to serving the public when she took the Coronation Oath and that is exactly what she did all her serving years She had donated many hours to numerous causes yet it is impossible to calculate how much good she has accomplished across the Commonwealth or how much impact she has had for good Her dignity is probably what has struck me as most impressive She served as the greatest and most powerful ambassador for Britain for years She also studied international affairs and UK politics and provided advice to Prime Ministers She visited opened reopened addressed and founded countless institutions organisations and businesses She shook countless hands and flashed countless smiles Her kindness spoke for itself Bringing up her negatives especially those where she probably had not much to do herself after she died is kind of shallow in my opinion Truly a low blow
