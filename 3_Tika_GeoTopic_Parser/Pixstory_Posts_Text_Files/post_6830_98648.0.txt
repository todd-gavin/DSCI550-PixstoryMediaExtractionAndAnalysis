A 2:12 minute-long video montage where the police can be seen violently attacking civilians is viral on social media with the claim that Muslims in Assam took out a rally demanding a separate nation, and this was how the police responded to their demands.

The video is accompanied by a Hindi caption that reads, “Muslims took out a procession in Assam to demand a separate country, look at their condition now. The Chief Minister of Assam is two steps ahead of Yogi”.

The video was shared on Twitter by user DRajlaxmisaini, who claims to be a doctor.

It is also viral on Facebook with the same claim.

Fact-check
We watched the video carefully and observed a few anomalies:

At no point in the video, do we hear the police or the victims speak to each other in Assamese.
We noticed a Hindi signboard and a barricade in the first 20 seconds of the video.

Taking these clues, we broke down the video into keyframes and performed a Yandex reverse image search on one of the stills. This led us to various videos of this incident uploaded in April 2020, which suggests that the video could be from the Phase-I of the lockdown due to COVID-19.

One of these videos was uploaded on April 6, 2020, where we can clearly see the name of the police station where the incident took place, as well as an SUV with an Uttar Pradesh number plate. The description of the YouTube video suggested that the video is from UP’s Bareilly where police were enforcing lockdown orders.

We performed a keyword search on Google and came across various articles and video reports about this incident. As per an article by The Times of India, published on April 6, 2020, a police team had visited the Karampur Chaudhary village in the Bareilly district to enforce lockdown orders. During this, the villagers gathered and attacked the police, and additional forces were called in.
