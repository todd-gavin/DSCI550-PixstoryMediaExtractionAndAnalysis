In addition to his record-breaking speed, Australian runner Peter Bol is bringing a new look to the team as the Commonwealth Games get underway in Birmingham, England. 

As per Al Jazeera, a new generation of South Sudanese Australian athletes is redefining what it means to be "an Aussie," and Bol is one of them. 

The athlete gained widespread recognition at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, where he qualified for the men's 800 m final for Australia for the first time in 53 years. 

Bol finished fourth, and the accomplishment enthralled an avid sports-loving Australian population.

“My goal has always been since moving to Australia to embrace the new culture but also Sudan is part of my story and who I am, so I embrace both,” Bol, who was born in Khartoum to South Sudanese parents, told Al Jazeera.

The 28-year-old has also been breaking records, setting a new men’s Australian and Oceania record in his signature race in the recent Diamond League athletics meet in Paris.

And despite the disappointment of finishing seventh in the recent World Athletics Championships, he is hopeful of bagging a medal in Birmingham.
