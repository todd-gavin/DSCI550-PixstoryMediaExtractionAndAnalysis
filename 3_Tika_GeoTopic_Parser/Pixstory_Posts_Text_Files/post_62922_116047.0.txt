You know how you see the pictures of every city that can't stop gushing over the beautiful museums or art galleries? Or sky diving or the zoos?

There's more to places than that. We go to these different countries, travel to the big cities and feel like we've done exploring but that's far from the truth. You will never know the true beauty of a place unless you live there like the locals.

Only after a week or something, sightseeing might become rather monotonous. Additionally, it is rather superficial. Have you considered eco-tourism, farm stays, month-long language immersion programs in foreign countries, cooking classes, and spending time with the locals at a home-stay? Instead of the glitzy fa√ßade and all the half-truths that mass tourism promotes, try staying at one place longer and learn more about how life is actually lived there.

I've seen a lot of places and, not to say traveling to big cities over the week wasn't fun, but staying a little longer has always given me the best experiences. Staying with a family hosting has been better than staying at a five star. I would always suggest you spend some significant time at a place. In my personal experience, exploring a place has always been better than being in a hurry to leave for the next.
