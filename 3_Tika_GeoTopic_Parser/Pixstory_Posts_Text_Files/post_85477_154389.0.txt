A superb match, filled with performances that have raised the game for Arsenal this season. Our attackers have been clinical, and the team overall look prepared for the challenges. Here are my player ratings below:_Ramsdale: 6/10_Distribution wasn’t as sharp as we’re use to, and couldn’t stop the conceding of the two goals._White: 7/10_He just keeps getting better and better. Ben White has made the RB position his own, putting his own stamp on the role. He’s now enjoying the attacking side of it._Gabriel: 6/10_His mis-kick led to the Nunez equaliser, and misjudged other air balls. His composure is being tested at the moment, so he just needs to find his feet again._Saliba: 8/10_Saliba is doing Saliba things at the moment, cleaning up and adding composure to a defence under pressure against Liverpool. A much more physical game, he dealt with his challenges well._Tomiyasu: 8/10_Won every battle down his side. He finished the match with the most duels and tackles won, and it was a master-stroke from Arteta to deploy Tomiyasu. Liverpool will have trained for Zinchenko or Tierney, to then come against our cleanest tackler in the side._Partey and Xhaka: 7/10_Didn’t win the midfield battle in the first half, but stepped it up for the second half. Their experienced mattered in the end. Crucial to how we play._Ødegaard: 6/10_Didn’t control the game like we know, but his work-rate is undeniable. He screened the final third and kept the pressure on through his presence off the ball._Martinelli and Saka: 9/10_Match winners. They are becoming the guys who win you games, with goal output coming from all sorts of shapes and sizes. How good are these guys?_Jesus: 7/10_No goal, but kept the pressure on Liverpool. Influential in two of our goals.
