7 Michel Vautrot
The Frenchman, Michel Vautrot, is remembered as one of the best referees of all time. He officiated many games in his life, including three matches in 1986 and two at the 1982 FIFA World Cup. In 1986, he presided over a European Cup match between Barcelona and FC Steaua Bucharest.
Michel Vautrot was awarded the IFFHS honour for his excellence in refereeing, and he was once suspended from refereeing after being involved in match fixing as AS Roma paid him 50,000 Euros in the 1986 European Cup semi-final between Roma and Dundee United.
 
6 Pedro Proenca
One of the first referees to supervise both the Champions League and Euros finals in the same year. Despite the fact that he refereed international matches for the majority of the year, Proenca was a top-notch officiator. He was added to FIFA's elite level in 2009 and became a FIFA-affiliated referee. He was named Best Referee of the Year by the Portuguese Football Federation in 2007 and 2011.
 
5 Howard Webb
Howard Webb, the Premier League referee, has been one of the most entertaining referees in football history. Despite criticism for his favouring decision, he remains one of the best referees to have overseen many games since Mark Clattenburg.
Webb began his career in 2004 and quickly rose through the ranks, eventually being named to the FIFA list in 2005. He was inducted as a referee in the 2010 World Cup and retired in 2014. He then went to Saudi Arabia to officiate and is now seen on BT Sport.
