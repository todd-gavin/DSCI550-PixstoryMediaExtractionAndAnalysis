Do not count the candles but see the light they give Don t count your years but the life you live A birthday is not only a time to think about your birth but also a time to think about your rebirth To recall your birth is to call in a new beginning No matter how things went yesterday or last year you always have the capacity to try again A birthday is a time to celebrate birth itself It is an expression of thanks to God for being born and still being alive It is also an occasion to rethink your life Your birth was the beginning of your life God created you to serve a purpose in this world Every time you have a birthday it is an indication that you still have work to do for the kingdom of God Your birthday is a sign that you have yet another chance to fulfill your unique mission
