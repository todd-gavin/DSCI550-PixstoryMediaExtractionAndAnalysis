The post Empoli Juventus interview with the Juventus goalkeeper Wojciech Szcz sny reason for reflection not only in terms of the championship it was a very tough match against an excellent Empoli Today the fundamental thing was to bring home the three points but above all when he commented on what is happening in Ukraine and which is consequently also involving his native country Poland Szcz sny let it be known that his national team should not take the field against Russia for the play-offs to go to the next World Cup Message relaunched also by his Polish companions I and my national team mates made the choice not to play the match against Russia I prepared my post without knowing that we would not play the match I am happy that my team mates made the same choice All national teams should do as we did of Poland then we&#39;ll see if Fifa will have the opportunity to give the World Cup to Russia I don&#39;t think so If we lose it at the table we will lose it with our heads held high
