Online professional network, LinkedIn has launched its deep sales platform, thereby opening up a new category of B2B sales intelligence technology.
As per LinkedIn, the technology is a breakthrough solution for businesses as it learns from data to make predictions and recommendations at a scale that may not be possible for sellers to achieve on their own. 
LinkedIn Sales Solutions is building the deep sales platform, which is the next generation of Sales Navigator, with the ability to deliver timely and actionable insights for organisations to focus on the highest-probability accounts and approach buyers with ‘welcomed and relevant outreach’ for better business outcomes.
The deep sales launch comes after LinkedIn’s recent global research revealed that only 20% of buyers are in-market for services in a given year, which makes understanding buyer intent critical for all sellers.
The LinkedIn State of Sales APAC 2022 research reveals that 81% of Indian buyers say that working remotely has made buying easier, while 84% of Indian sellers say they have seen a deal lost or delayed in the past year because of a decision maker changing roles.
This corroborates the increasingly important role of sales technology in helping sellers understand buyer sentiment and intent. The deep sales technology by LinkedIn Sales Solutions aims to help sellers build more effective B2B connections by delivering actionable insights and recommendations in three priority areas:
- Account insights: Targeting accounts that have the best chance of success.
- Relationship intelligence: Identifying decision-makers and finding the best path to reach them.
- Buyer intent: Capitalising on the right moments to reach out, based on signals and alerts of key moments such as organizational growth, job changes, and change in strategy.
