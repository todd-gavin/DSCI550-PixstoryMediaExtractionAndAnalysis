 Call Of Duty: Warzone Mobile as the name suggests is a mobile version of the popular free-to-play game, and much like its original version is a battle royale similar to PUBG and Fortnite. 
In collaboration with Call of Duty studios and technology teams across Activision, Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile is being co-developed by a multi-studio mobile organization that includes teams from Activision Shanghai Studio, Beenox, Digital Legends, and Solid State Studios.
Activision has announced that Call of Duty Warzone Mobile will release for iOS and Android in 2023, with pre-registration for Android version available as of now, promising to deliver the same 120-player experience as the one you get for Warzone in PC or console. Featuring a big map,  you can traverse the landscape using various land-based vehicles and aircraft as well as walk it.
Alongside vehicles, you expect enough weapon and Operator variety to find a playstyle that suits you best. To ensure that Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile is accessible to as many people as possible, Activision is promising control customisation. So, depending on your preferences, you should be able to tweak the controls to match them.
Built for mobile devices to ensure an amazing handheld experience, Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile is set to feature mobile-specific events, playlists, and content as well as deep control customization options to support both Call of Duty veterans and new recruits alike.
A big part of Activision's marketing for Call of Duty going forward is cross-progression. Warzone Mobile will feature the same weapons as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II and Warzone 2.0. That means that if you unlock a weapon or Operator in one game, it will be waiting for you when you boot up the others.
Similarly, Battle Pass progression will be shared across the three Call of Duty titles. Beyond that, your Friends lists and chat channels will persist on each game, meaning you can chat with your pals regardless of which one you're playing.
