Joan Laporta the president of Barcelona is over the moon for having brought Robert Lewandowski to the Blaugrana, one of the most prolific strikers of recent years He is rebuilding a Barca that seems capable of having its say again both in the league and in the European arena and this merit goes to number one fan of coach Xavi The president still dreams of seeing Messi end his career with Barcelona He confessed this in an interview when asked if it was true that Xavi himself had asked to bring the Argentine back to Catalonia Laporta said said that it is only a wish that he would like to see come true but that no discussion to that effect has started There is therefore no negotiation at the moment Messi&#39;s time at the Bar is not over as we all would have liked I believe that Barcelona owes a moral debt to Messi We would like the his career ended with the Bar shirt applauded on all fields wherever he goes
