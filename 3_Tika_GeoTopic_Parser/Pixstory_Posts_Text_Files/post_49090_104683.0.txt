Arming teachers is actually a very good idea. It is in nation's best interest. Armed teachers can protect kids better than unarmed ones and will be able to hold off the shooter for longer for the cops to stop him, even if not take him down entirely.

I don't see a problem in it. It's like suddenly children's protection does not matter just because of your silly take on firearms. Teachers have been jumping between the gunman and the students since forever, wouldn't it be better if they're better prepared for it?

Not to mention, any teacher that could possibly harm students should not be in the classroom in the first place, regardless of firearms or no firearms. This solution protects our constitutional rights and the lives of a lot of children. It is the best we could come up with.
