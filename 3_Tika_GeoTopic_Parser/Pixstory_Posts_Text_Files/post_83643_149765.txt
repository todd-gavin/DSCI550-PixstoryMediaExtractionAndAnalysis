Saving money is hard there I said it and I accept it and understand that very well We all lose track of our expenses although some of us are really good savers and do it just so easily yet some of us still struggle during month end Personally speaking I myself have been in situations where I d have to give up on things because I hadn t saved any money and never utilised in proper way again I don t recommend stop all that your spending your money on and be frugual person I wouldn t advocate that by myself But as It s good to realise this mistake and just like I identified the pattern and fixed it so can you Let me just explain it to you see maybe next month when you do recieve money just take a moment and think of all the expenses that you have to have to incur no matter what let s say of what you received and put aside a little amount for your personal use be it eating something out or anything else I m guessing you re still left with some amount that can and there you have it you just saved of what you received Now I know some of you would say okay fine but this is just in theory how do we apply it see if assuming you re an Indian I know we mostly make our payments through UPI so my advice would be just withdraw all of what you received and deliberately just put aside some money to say and forget you even had that money See we all are humans and I understand our wants and needs confuse us to buying things we don t want just because it created a feeling of satisfaction in us but give it a try habits are only buit when you realise a pattern and do something about it
