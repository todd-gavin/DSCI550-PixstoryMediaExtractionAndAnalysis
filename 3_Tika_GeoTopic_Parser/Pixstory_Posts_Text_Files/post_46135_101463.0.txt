" God has a plan for your life .‚Äù I have heard these seven words countless times growing up . When I was small I often thought that one day I would know what God‚Äôs plan for me was . However , I have learned as I have matured that this is not so . I believe that obedience has a great role in God‚Äôs plan for our lives . Therefore , I believe that God‚Äôs plan for your life starts with the day you were born .

There are two ways I interpret the phrase ‚Äú God has a plan for your life ‚Äù. The first way , is that I read that phrase with the future in mind . For example , when I think of who I will marry , where I will live , where I will go to college , etc . I often wonder where God will take me in the future .  The Bible talks about how God has a plan for each and every person He created . 


The second way I interpret the phrase ‚Äú God has plan for your life ‚Äù is on a much more detailed scale.  I believe God has a purpose for everything that happens . For example , one morning when was running late for school and I was tempted to think - God why me ? I believe that it didn‚Äôt ‚Äú just happened ‚Äù. God could be trying to teach me a little something about patience or slowing down in life .

God places people in our lives and allows us to go through situations that will help us in the future . So the next time someone pulls out in front of me , or takes the last ice cream sandwich in the freezer , I will think about what God might be trying to teach me . After all , He does have a plan for my life .

*Always Remember*
We may make our plans , but God has the last word . We may make our plans , but God directs our actions . üßø‚ù§Ô∏è
