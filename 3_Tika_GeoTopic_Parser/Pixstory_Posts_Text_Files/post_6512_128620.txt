According to the researchers the current research proves that COVID severity was connected to the distorting of B cell traits and shows for the first time that this distorting was altered by simultaneous HIV infection Collectively utilizing longitudinal samples from the first SARS CoV wave in South Africa the study demonstrated that HIV co infection had a massive effect on the B cell reaction to SARS CoV In addition the investigators noted that the B cell reaction to SARS CoV infection in PLWH was markedly distinct in the present group of individuals with primarily mild to moderate COVID with lower GC function and a contrasted rise in EF activity These findings indicate that the B cell reaction in PLWH was oriented toward the EF pathway rather than GC maturation Additionally it was pointed out that it was necessary to evaluate the impact of HIV infection on COVID immunity especially in light of new SARS CoV variants Besides understanding the influence of COVID vaccination on the B cell memory compartment will also be critical
