Fans encountered numerous issues all day long trying to reserve their tickets for the September 20 T20 match between India and Australia at Mohali's IS Bindra PCA International Stadium, which opened ticket sales on Monday. IE reported that according to information, despite concerns of issues, about 40% of the 27,000-seat stadium's tickets were sold on the first day through the online ticketing service Paytm/Insider. Despite the PCA's earlier announcement that the online ticket sales would begin on September 11, the internet platforms shifted the date back a day because Sunday was designated as a day of national mourning for the passing of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. All ticket sales, with the exception of those in person, are now exclusively permitted online by the Punjab Cricket Association.
