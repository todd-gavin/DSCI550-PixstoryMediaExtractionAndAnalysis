External Actors in the Afghan Problem continues....

Karl W. Deutsch, more than four decades ago, observed that, if outside resources constitute the main capabilities committed to the 
struggle on both sides, then it is appropriate to speak of war by proxy - an international conflict between two foreign powers, fought out on the soil of a third country; disguised as conflict over an internal issue of that country; and using that country’s human and natural resources and territory as a means for achieving preponderantly foreign goals. Internal war within a country depends on indigenous factors as well as the impact 
of forces and influences from outside the area of conflict. The extent to which foreign powers could contribute to the growth and expansion of revolutionary, insurgent and terrorist movements by means of various 
kinds of military, political and economic assistance, is usually unlimited. 

And in this context, external intervention and influences in fuelling the Afghan conflict right from the time of the Cold War till present, is 
significant. 

Prolonged conflict in Afghanistan has had serious geo-strategic implications for the region as well as the entire globe. Although scholars like Maass erroneously talk about the “geo-strategic insignificance” of Afghanistan, the location of the country at the crossroads of Central, South and West Asia remains very vital. Afghanistan shares its borders with Central Asia on the north, Chinese province of Xingjian in the east, 

Iran on the west and south-west, and Pakistan and Pak-occupied Kashmir on the south and South-east. Unfortunately, this has to a large extent, brought about instability and civil war instead of yielding benefits for being so strategically located.
