Three sports science academics have urged nine Australian sporting groups to amend their regulations on transgender athletes' participation. 

Elizabeth Rose, Beth Hands, and Helen Parker wrote to nine sports in March, according to The Australian. 

According to reports, the professors presented biological proof indicating male testosterone levels throughout and after puberty give players an athletic advantage. 

The ability to build tissue in their muscles, bones, and cardiovascular systems is seen as crucial in giving these competitors an advantage over female opponents. 

Insidethegames reported that the findings were presented in two publications published in the International Journal of Sport and Society by the professors. 

Parker told The Australian that she was concerned about the lack of response from various organisations, including Cricket Australia and the Australian Football League. 

“I'm concerned that there hasn't been an acknowledgment that this information has come through," Parker told the publication.
“My request was that the board take on the information and discuss the issue of trans women in sport at least at board level again, and ask: 'Is our policy of transgender participation appropriate now that we have this biological information?'

"I hope that the rise of elite trans women athletes like US swimmer Lia Thomas and the UK cyclist Emily Bridges is really a wake-up call and alert sports boards to really look at what they're trying to achieve in terms of advancing girls and women in their sport.”
