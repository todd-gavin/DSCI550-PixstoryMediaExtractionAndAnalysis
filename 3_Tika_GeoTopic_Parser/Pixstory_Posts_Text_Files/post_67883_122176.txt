The season of the Pro Kabaddi League PKL is around the corner but before that the scene is abuzz with the preceding auctions The teams have already announced their list of retained players Some top names like Pawan Kumar Sherawat Deepak Niwas Hooda and Pardeep Narwal have been released by their franchises As we await the much anticipated auctions let s look at what is the all important FBM or the Final Bid Match in the auction The FBM FBM is pretty similar to the Right To Match RTM card used in the Indian Premier League IPL auctions in the past Through the FBM the former players who have been released by their respective franchises might go back to their former team by themselves even without their former teams making a bit for them in the auction The Final Bid Match regulation permits the teams to repurchase their released players prior to the auction but the prices must match those offered by the new team that is bidding for them For instance Deepak Niwas Hooda has been released by the Jaipur Pink Panthers ahead of the auctions He will go under the hammer Now whichever team places the highest bid can avail the services of him for the new season until the Jaipur Pink Panthers use their FBM card on him and matches the final bid of the other franchise who wants him for the new season The total number of FBM Cards that may be used is however limited No FBMs may be deployed if a team has retained six elite players One FBM card however may be utilised if the team has retained only five elite players The FBM card was introduced prior to Season giving the teams a new range of options for assembling their squad Nitin Tomar Parvesh Bhainswal and Rishank Devadiga were among the well known players on whom FBM cards were used in the past Image Credits UMumba Twitter
