Yay lookism is getting an anime ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³
But have you read the webtoon yet ? 
If no then go read it what are you waiting for ? 
It follows the story of a boy called daniel who happens to be bullied because he is fat and presumably ugly . But one day he gets another alternate body before starting in a new school. And that body happens to be super cool and fit , not to mention good looking. 
Daniel shoots to popularity in no time, but how long will all this last till the trith comes out ?
