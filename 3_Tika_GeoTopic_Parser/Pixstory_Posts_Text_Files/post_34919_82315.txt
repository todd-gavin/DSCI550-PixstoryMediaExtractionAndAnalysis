And over the moon Federica Brignone who in combination conquered a historic bronze medal with which she takes the podiums to two in these Games Already having two medals fantastic Surely the one I expected most was the super-G I did my best and I&#39;m not there successful but I&#39;m very happy with the other two medals After the super-G my head was a bit down and I was really tired Fatigue also due to a long year as she herself confirms This winter was OK OK OK and then from January onwards it was such a stress come here not tested positive for Covid and then everyone was going crazy about this situation It wasn&#39;t easy Federica Brignone managed to make the most of the exit of the favorite Mikaela Shiffrin to conquer the bronze medal Surely there weren&#39;t many athletes today but these two girls Michelle Gisin gold and Wendy Holdener silver were skiing great in slalom I didn&#39;t have a chance with them and I didn&#39;t have too much distance from downhill to look for a better medal I was lucky that Mikaela Shiffrin got out But this is skiing this is the sport I just tried to ski at my best but without taking too many risks
