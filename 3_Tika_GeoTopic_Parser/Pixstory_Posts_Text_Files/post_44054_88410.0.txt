El Clásico has been played for over a century and is one of the most thrilling soccer games to watch, not only because of the intensity of the game, but also because of its history.

In 1902, the two teams played each other for the first time. The inaugural League El Clásico, however, took place in 1929. It was held in Barcelona's Les Colts stadium, but Barcelona fans were forced to witness their first El Clásico defeat as Real Madrid defeated them 2-1. They did, however, have the final say, winning the rematch 1-0 and claiming their first LaLiga title.

The name was originally intended to refer to league matches between the two Spanish teams, but it has since expanded to include every time the two teams play, including title games.

Between Madrid and Barcelona, there have been 248 competitive matches and 33 exhibition matches. Real Madrid has won 100 of the 248 competitive matches, compared to 96 for Barcelona (and 52 ties). Barcelona has won 19 exhibition games compared to Madrid's four (and 10 ties). Barcelona has 115 victories against Madrid's 104 in all matches (and 62 ties).

Despite the fact that we no longer get to see Messi and Ronaldo compete, their legends live on. With 26 goals, Messi is the best goal scorer in El Clásico games. Alfredo Di Stefano and Cristiano Ronaldo are tied for second place with 18 points. Messi also has the most assists (14), and is tied for the most hat-tricks (two) (two). With 11 goals in total, Madrid's Karim Benzema is the current active player with the most goals in El Clásico games.

El Clásico has seen numerous spectacular goal celebrations, with the ball often being thrown in the face of the other team. For example, after Messi scored the game-winning goal against Real Madrid in the 93rd minute in 2017, he celebrated by removing his Barca shirt and raising it up to the crowd, displaying his name and number on the jersey.
