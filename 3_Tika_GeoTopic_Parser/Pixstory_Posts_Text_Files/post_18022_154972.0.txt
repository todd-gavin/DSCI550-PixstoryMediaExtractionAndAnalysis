Sydney Sweeney is continuing to make big moves in Hollywood. The 25-year-old actress will take the lead in Sony Pictures new Barbarella movie, according to Deadline. 
Sweeney is also expected to work as an executive producer on the film, which is based on the French comic book series by Jean-Claude Forest. It was originally turned into movie in 1968 starring Jane Fonda and John Phillip Law. Sweeney confirmed the news herself on Instagram, sharing a poster of Barbarella and writing, "Time to save the universe."
The logline for the original Barbarella on IMDb reads, "Barbarella, an astronaut from the 41st century, sets out to find and stop the evil scientist Durand Durand, whose Positronic Ray threatens to bring evil back into the galaxy." It's unknown if the new version will follow the same plot.
Emmy-nominated actress Sweeney is currently filming for a Spider-Man spinoff. She recently opened up about how she doesn't have the income to take a lengthy break from acting. Sweeney has tackled roles such as Cassie on Euphoria, Olivia on The White Lotus and dozens of others. She says the entertainment industry is "built to try to make you backstab people".
