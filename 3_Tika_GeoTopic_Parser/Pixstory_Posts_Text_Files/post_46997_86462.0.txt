You slip into the back row at your ex’s wedding, hoping to remain unobserved, but then you realize you’re naked. You open your mouth to give a big presentation at work, and suddenly all your teeth fall out. Or you’re sitting in a final exam for a class you’ve never attended.

When you wake up and realize you’ve been dreaming, images fade quickly, but the feelings they evoke can linger into your morning.

Everyone dreams, and while many of our dreams share common themes, each nightly story is singular and personal, weaving together fragments of memory, imagination, and emotion. Though experts have compelling theories, why we dream and what dreams mean aren’t well understood — but that doesn’t mean you should dismiss dreams as weird mental home movies.

Instead, you can use your dreams to tap into insights and meaning in your life.

Although we’re unique as dreamers, some types of dreams seem to be consistent across cultures and history. This makes sense, as humans share similar emotions,” says Sanam Hafeez, PsyD, New York City-based neuropsychologist and director of Comprehend the Mind, an assessment and treatment center.

And then there are shared experiences.
Being stressed at work

These dreams tend to literally reflect anxiety about a professional situation. Maybe you’re anxious about botching a big presentation or missing a deadline.


Seeing someone who’s dead

Dream interpretation here leans on how you felt about that person. If the person was beloved by you, this could simply reflect that you’re still mourning. If the person hurt you or caused fear, that could mean you’re still carrying those feelings.

Being naked

This could tie to feelings of insecurity, vulnerability, or being judged (especially if people around you in your dream are fully clothed).

Falling

If you’re fearful in the dream, it could mean you feel out of control about a situation.
