Juventus are one of the few clubs which were heavily involved in the winter transfer window.  The Old Lady signed Serbian prodigy, Dusan Vlahovic and are preparing to annouce the signing of Denis Zakaria.

Juventus striker, Alvaro Morata was linked with a move away from the club in the winter. Additionally, the signing of Vlahovic from Fiorentina only made it certain that the Spanish stiker would accept a move from one of his suitors. Now, the former Real Madrid striker has made a final decision in regards to his future.

As reported by Fabrizio Romano, Alvaro Morata has decided to STAY at Juventus atleast until the end of the 2021-22 season. The Spaniard was linked with a move to North London clubs, Arsenal and Spurs. Sergio Aguero's unanticipated retirement meant that even Barcelona were on the lookout for a striker.

As things unfolded, Juventus boss, Allegri wants Morata to stay at the club and play alongside Dusan Vlahovic. Morata has 5 goals and 3 assists to his name in the league so far this season. He had started seven of the last 10 games for the Old Lady in all competitions, which shows that he is an integral part of Allegri's plans.

Spurs were considered the favorites to secure the signing of Alvaro Morata, as the transfer window draws to a close on Monday. The 29-year old's current contract runs out in the summer of 2022, which means that either Juventus will offer him a new contract or he will be allowed to leave the club in the summer as a free agent.
