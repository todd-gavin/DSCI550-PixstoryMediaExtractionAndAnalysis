Weakness
The strength has turned to the weakness in the ongoing campaign. The lackluster form of Liverpoolâ€™s defense and fullbacks have cost them games. At the earliest, the manager will have to address the issue. Liverpool have not done the aging midfield and replacing them in the summer transfer window. Also, the departure of Sadio Mane has also caused troubles for Liverpool as Mohamed Salah is yet to resume his form in 2022/23.
Opportunities
Liverpool have an opportunity to arrest their slump in form and achieve big in the season. With this being the World Cup season, few key players would not be available for most of the teams. They can target hitting above their weight in the 2022/23 season despite the poor start. 
Threats
Liverpool face the threat of finishing outside the top four in their current form. The club has failed to gain the momentum whereas their manager is succumbing to the eighth season syndrome. It remains interesting to see if he can stall the slump in the form. Also, the big money signing, Darwin Nunez, has not lived up to the hype. A poor season for the Uruguayan striker would put Liverpool off guard in the ongoing campaign.
