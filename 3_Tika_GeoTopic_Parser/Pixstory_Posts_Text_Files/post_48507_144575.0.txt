Reincarnation does not exist in Christianity. There is no biblical basis for it, and the belief in reincarnation is actually a form of paganism. In Christian theology, death marks the end of one life and the beginning of another - nothing more.
Christianity is based on the belief in one god who created everything and then laid down his law for humanity. Reincarnation would contradict this idea because it suggests that a person's soul can be reborn in another body even after they have died. It takes away the point of the judgment day.
Judgment day is a term mentioned in the Bible that refers to the day when Jesus will judge humanity. It is also known as the Day of Judgment, or Doomsday. We, Christians, believe that on this day, everyone will be judged according to their deeds in life.
Many Christians believe that we are all sinners and deserve punishment for our sins. However, Christ has already paid for our sins with his death on the cross. On judgment day, he will deliver us from our punishments and allow us into paradise permanently. So, no, I don't believe in reincarnation. I believe in eternal life. :)
