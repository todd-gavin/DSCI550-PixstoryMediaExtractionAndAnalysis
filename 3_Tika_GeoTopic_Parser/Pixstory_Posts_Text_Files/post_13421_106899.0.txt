The Afghanistan Independent Journalists Association  reported the disappearance of a local journalist in Kapisa province

The  Afghanistan Independent Journalists Association  says Abdul Hanan Mohammadi, the association's deputy governor in Kapisa province, has disappeared.

The local journalist was quoted as saying in a newsletter, quoting members of Mr. Mohammadi's family, that the local journalist and a friend had disappeared on Sunday, June 12, in the Hessa I district of Kapisa.

The Journalists' Association's newsletter states that Mr. Mohammadi's contact numbers are not available, and that the organization has begun its efforts to clarify the fate of Abdul Hanan Mohammadi.

The Afghanistan Independent Journalists  Association  has emphasized that the leadership of this organization has contacted local Taliban officials in Kapsa province and asked the Taliban to clarify the fate of this journalist.

The Journalists' Association has expressed deep concern over the fate of Abdul Hanan Mohammadi.

Since the Taliban came to power, the media has come under intense threat and pressure, with more than 80 journalists and media workers detained, tortured and threatened by the Taliban.

According to Reporters Without Borders, in the first three months of Taliban rule, 43 percent of Afghanistan's media outlets disappeared, and in total, about 60 percent of journalists have lost their jobs since the Taliban came to power.

The Taliban have beaten and detained journalists in various parts of Afghanistan in recent months.

Recently, the British National Union of Journalists said that since August 15 last year, when the Taliban came to power, media workers have been severely restricted.

The union said the Taliban last month arrested and tortured Mirza Hassani, a journalist, for posting news on social media.
