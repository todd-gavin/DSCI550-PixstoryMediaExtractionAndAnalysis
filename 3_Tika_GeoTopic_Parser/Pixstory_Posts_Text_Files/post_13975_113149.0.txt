The largest airline in India, IndiGo, had more than half of its flights delayed on Saturday due to a high number of sick calls from its cabin crew. According to sources, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has taken note of this situation and has asked the airline for a report on the delays.
Notably, Saturday also signalled the start of the second stage of the recruitment effort for cabin crew personnel at Air India, which is owned by the Tata Group.
Less than half of IndiGo's flights left within 15 minutes of their scheduled departure time on Saturday, according to data obtained from the Ministry of Civil Aviation, which measures on-time performance. Every day, IndiGo offers 1,600 flights both domestically and internationally.
