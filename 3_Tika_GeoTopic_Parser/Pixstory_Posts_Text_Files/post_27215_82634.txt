The collector&#39;s tour of EVERY TIME COS is out, a song that EMMA presented in the competition at the Sanremo Festival. There is also an autographed limited edition version of the disc. The video that you can see at this link is an aesthetic video in which the viewer is projected into a universe steeped in gloomy and futuristic atmospheres that refer to the Sci fi world Emma plays the role of an android an alien whose nature, appearance and character are the result of a world in which the homologation is so deeply rooted as to make one lose awareness and to which she decides to rebel by becoming aware of one&#39;s own wishes and making one&#39;s voice reach out loud. Very Emma
