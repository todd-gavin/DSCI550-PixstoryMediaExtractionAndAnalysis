New laws proposed in Welsh would ban a range of single-use plastics, enhance air quality and reform agricultural support will be put before the Senedd over the next year, the first minister has said. Bills will also be introduced for coal top safety.

Mark Drakeford said the "ambitious" plans had a "clear focus on Wales' stronger, fairer and greener future".

Conservatives criticized a plan to expand the Senedd. The Senedd reform plans, which also change the voting system for Senedd elections, were disclosed by Mr. Drakeford and Mr. Price in May and supported by a special Welsh labor conference last weekend.

Legislation, ministers say, to modify the way council tax is put up to make it fairer, will also be brought forward that year.

The Clean Air Bill would include "ambitious air quality targets" and a "more robust regulatory framework to support them", said Mr. Drakeford "accompanied by measures to make sure all parts of society play their part in reducing pollution".

The Bill on Single-Use Plastics will prohibit or restrict sales of commonly littered items such as plastic straws and cutlery.

Ministers say the Agriculture Bill will change how aid for the industry works, focusing on sustainable food production and rewarding farmers for taking action to protect the environment.

The Bill on Infrastructure Consenting aims to make the way major infrastructure projects are agreed upon simpler "providing more certainty for communities and developers".

The Bill on Coal Tip Safety is aimed at improving how disused coal tips are managed by "protecting communities living in the shadow of these tips, as the risk of weather-related damage to them increases".
