Homework is a ridiculous idea in my opinion. It is a way to get kids do some intensive labor at an age where they should be allowed to explore and rest. It's just a way to make them get used to the hustle culture but it essentially stops any growth in them.

In essence, it compels kids to return home after a demanding day of class and extracurricular activities to complete work that's literally not helping them. Instead than requiring pupils to discover these concepts on their own, teachers should teach them in class. It prevents kids from leading healthy, balanced lives that include getting enough sleep and participating in activities that keep them physically and mentally strong and active.

It's absurd how much stress homework puts kids under, especially when they're already under pressure to perform well in school, get into a good college, make friends, and keep active. There is no need for homework.

How is a student expected to complete three to four hours of homework, prepare for numerous exams and quizzes, play sports, get active in the community, eat nutritious food, and get enough sleep in a single day? That can't be done.
