According to new Q Scores, despite being one of Hollywood's most likeable actors, Will Smith's reputation has suffered significantly as a result of the iconic Oscars slap gate incident with comic Chris Rock. 

The change occurred a few months after Will Pinkett Smith yelled, "Keep my wife's name out of your f***ing mouth!" after King Richard actor smacked Rock on the Dolby Theatre stage as the latter made fun of his wife's baldness. 

As per RW, the actor's image unexpectedly declined, and he is still feeling the aftershocks of the Oscars jab. While studios examine the public relations implications, many of his projects, including Emancipation, I Am Legend 2, and Bad Boys 4, have essentially been placed on pause.

Though Will Smith has made several attempts to reconcile the matter, his reputation has severely been damaged after the Oscars 2022 incident, revealed new Q Scores obtained by Variety. 

Alongside Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, Smith was one of Hollywood's most adored performers prior to the tragedy. Following the slap, the Ali star's positive Q Score rating fell from 39 to 24, indicating that only 24% of those surveyed currently think favourably of him.
