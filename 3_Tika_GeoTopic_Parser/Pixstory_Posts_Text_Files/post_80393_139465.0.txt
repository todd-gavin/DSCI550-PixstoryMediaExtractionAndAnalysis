It was for the first time in 32 years that a head coach had managed to win a major trophy in his first season as a manger at Arsenal. In 2020-21 Arteta's role was finally changed from that of a head coach to the manager of the club. 
He achieved desirable results that season too when he lead arsenal to a fantastic FA community shield win against Liverpool in the finals. 
Arsenal under Arteta however soon had to face a new low as they finished 8th in the Premier League which meant that they wouldn't be a part of any of the European competitions for the first time in 25 long years!
In 2021-22 things improved a little for Arteta's arsenal as they managed to get things back under control. However by the end of the season the gunners messed things up once again. Despite being a strong contender to finish within top 4 for major part of the premier league that season, they lost the all important fourth place to Tottenham due to poor performances in the final few matchdays and landed up in the Europa League after finishing 5th. 
However Arteta's men have seemingly been able to turn the tables with some incredible performances so far this season of the premier league. Several new signings including those of Gabriel Jesus and many others seemed to live upto their worth as the team has won 5 out of its 6 opening games till now and sit at the top of the Premier League table currently. It's time for us now to have a deeper look at Mikel Arteta's managerial numbers.
