Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce produced a trademark performance to win a record fifth 100m title at the World Championships on Sunday.

The Jamaican exploded out of the blocks and had the race sewn up way before crossing the line in a championship record time of 10.67 seconds.

Fraser-Pryce won her first world 100m title 13 years ago but says her latest victory means the most.

"It's my favorite world title -- doing it at 35, yes, I said 35," Fraser-Pryce told reporters after the win.

"Whenever I'm healthy, I'm going to compete. I'm hungry, I'm driven and I always believe I can run faster and I'm not going to stop until I stop believing that."

In 2017, Fraser-Pryce had an emergency C-section when she had her son Zyon, subsequently taking two years away from the track to rehabilitate and focus on motherhood.

Despite fears she would never reach the summit of the sport again, the Jamaican only improved year on year.
