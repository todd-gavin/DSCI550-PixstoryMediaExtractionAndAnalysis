Diego Costa is set to make a return to the Premier League with an unexpected move to Wolves.It has been four years since Costa left the Premier League after a successful stint at Chelsea.
The Spaniard is set to have a trial at Wolves this week which he is expected to pass. Once hedoes, Costa will be available to be signed by the club as he is currently a free agent. As perrules, only free agents can be signed outside the transfer window.
The move is a desperate attempt by the Molineux side to get a replacement for Sasa Kalajdzicwho was injured in the weekend. The club confirmed in a statement that the star signing had
picked up an ACL tear in the game against Southampton. The Austrian is set to be out for theentirety of the season.
"Sasa felt a pain in his knee late in the first half against Southampton. Unfortunately, scansreveal an anterior cruciate injury and he will see a knee specialist tomorrow [Monday]," astatement from Wolves read. "We now need to support Sasa in his recovery and further updateswill follow‚Äù.
Costa had joined Atletico Madrid after leaving the Blues. Since then he had many ups anddowns with manager Diego Simeone, eventually deciding to leave the club in 2020. This wasthe end of his third proper stint with the Madrid club. As a free agent he was signed up byBrazilian side Atletico Mineiro for their 2021 season. He returned just six goal contributions with
Mineiro letting his contract expire. Since the start of 2022 he has again been a free agent.
If he does make a move to the West Midlands, Costa will be up against a star-studded line up ofstrikers from other teams. It is known that he will not return the Top Goalscorer form that heonce had but he will look to help the Wolves who are languishing in the bottom half of the table,placed fourteenth.
