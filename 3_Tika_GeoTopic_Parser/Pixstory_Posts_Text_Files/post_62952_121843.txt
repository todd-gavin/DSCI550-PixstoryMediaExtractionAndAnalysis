It s not necessarily mimicry of the past I d like monochromatic movies to come back for how aesthetic they are Black and white s psychological unreality is a fundamental component of its potency As a projected moving image on the screen which all movies are and as it plays out in an unlimited variety of shades of grey which is specific to this particular medium a black and white movie is twice separated from reality Whether we say it out loud or not we all understand that black and white films do not accurately depict reality Black white movies can challenge and reformulate the limits of mimesis however and depict the world as it might be rather than as a disappointing duplicate of reality Black and white have a mystical unearthly allure It s easier to consume fiction like that It creates a beautiful distinction between fiction and reality I just think it s great
