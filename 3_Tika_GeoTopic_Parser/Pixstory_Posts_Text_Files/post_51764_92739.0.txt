Real Madrid vs. FC Bayer MÃ¼nchen

Some interesting differences between NBA and Euroleague:
1. Apparently they allow six players on the court (look closely at the photo) ðŸ˜† 
2. Refs donâ€™t call traveling, the euro-step is alive and well
3. No media time outs
4. American players are significantly taller and more athletic 
5. European players pass the ball a lot, scoring distribution is more evenly spread compared to the NBA
