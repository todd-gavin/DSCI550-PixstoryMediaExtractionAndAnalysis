West Ham have signed veteran goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski to a new one-year contract. The former Poland international is 37 years old this month, but he's still going strong as the Hammers aim for another top-six finish.

Fabianski's form has been so good that he has only allowed Alphonse Areola, who is on loan from France, to play in cup events.

“He has been really good,” said Hammers boss David Moyes. “I actually think he has been pushed by Alphonse, who has done really well for us in European games and cup games as well.

Fabianski stated: "I'm happy that it has been sorted, it's done and at the same time I would like to say I'm very thankful for the belief the club has put in me and I want to just continue to do well for the team, for the club and for the fans.

"I'm really pleased and really looking to continue to work hard and put in good performances for the club."

Fabianski has followed in the footsteps of club captain Mark Noble, who signed a new one-year contract on Tuesday and said in an open letter to West Ham fans that next season will be his final season with the club.

Noble, who has played over 500 times for West Ham, has seen his first-team opportunities limited this season, with manager David Moyes preferring to use Declan Rice and Tomas Soucek in midfield.

Noble made his West Ham debut in a 2-0 League Cup victory over Southend United at the Boleyn Ground as a 17-year-old in 2004. He broke into the first squad near the close of the 2006/07 Premier League season, when the club narrowly avoided relegation with a run of seven wins in their final nine games.

Noble stayed at West Ham after the club was relegated from the Premier League in 2011, and helped them gain promotion back to the top tier a year later with a 2-1 play-off final triumph over Blackpool at Wembley.
