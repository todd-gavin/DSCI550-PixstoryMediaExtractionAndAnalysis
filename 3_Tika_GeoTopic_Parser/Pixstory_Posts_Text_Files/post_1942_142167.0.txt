A quote misattributed to the former Soviet Union leader Nikita Khrushchev discussing Communism slowly infiltrating the United States, while not necessarily a quote from him – or any known person – is as true now as ever.The quote in question is a warning – a 9 step process of how Communism can slowly become accepted by the people of the United States, and how it may eventually crumble as a result of it.The quote is lengthy, but broken down, the steps of the process involve making the people poor, powerless, and reliant on government to such an extent that they couldn’t possibly want anything more than to embrace socialism since they need the government to support their everyday lives.Whether or not there is some grand conspiracy to shift the United States to socialism, and then eventually communism, there are many U.S. elected leaders out there who, if given the power, would push the United States to be socialist.What is most troubling about this is that these elected leaders and many uneducated influencers have influenced the younger generation into believing that capitalism is wrong and socialism is the only system that can benefit everyone, despite the fact that is has not only never worked, but is also an inherently unfair system that does not promote progress and innovation.Socialism, and by extension communism, is a true threat lurking in the shadows. It will always be present for as long as there are people on this Earth because it makes leaders even more powerful.
