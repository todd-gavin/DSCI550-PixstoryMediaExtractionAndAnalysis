The term "free will" does not appear in the Bible. We have the ability to make decisions. The biblical ground for free will lies in the fall into sin by Adam and Eve that occurred in their "willfully chosen" disobedience to God. Because the phrases "freedom" and "free will" are frequently used interchangeably, they might be viewed as one. Our will, like the rest of us, is corrupt and sinful, and they, too, require salvation. We simply have ordinary willpower; we lack the ability to choose God or the desire to do well and please Him. We are born enslaved to sin and must be set free by salvation through the truth in Christ. We don't need free will to be saved, but we do need will that has been made free. We are free but not freed. We are either incarcerated or have lost our freedom. As if a person had free will but is incarcerated and unable to escape his jail.

We have a choice to make, how will we exercise our "free will"? Will we use it to be freed, or forever stay caged under the assumption that things are in our hands?
