'We have decided that it's time to give every American quality healthcare,': These were the golden words spoken by our former president that made history for me. 

Replace America's patchwork healthcare system with a single, universal system, a goal that was evaded US presidents for over a century. 

Obama, in a speech said: "We have finally decided to change what is broken about healthcare in America after decades of inactivity. We've concluded that it's past time for every American to have access to high-quality healthcare at a reasonable price." 

And he delivered!

The political firestorm that consumed the United States in the summer of 2009  was over Obama's plan to bring 45 million people without health insurance into the system. 

There were challenges, yes! The Guardian reported that one of the main doctors' groups warned that Obama's plan would lead to an explosion in health insurance costs. The were testimonies from thousands of uninsured people relating horror stories of experiences in trying to obtain medical help but none of this deterred Obama. 

He did so much better than Trump when it came to healthcare. His policies were all high cost and less coverage. 
Now, letâ€™s see what Biden has in store for us!
