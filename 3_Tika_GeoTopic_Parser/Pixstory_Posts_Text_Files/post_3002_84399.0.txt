The U.S. and European powers have announced sweeping sanctions against Russia its invasion of Ukraine. And the effects of sanctions are already showing. For instance, the Russian ruble tanked around 29% against the dollar on Monday hitting its all-time low before recouping its losses. Russian Central Bank swiftly doubled the interest rate to stem the slide.

But the question being asked is, will the ruble continue to slide and how deeply will Russia be affected economically? Russia is not a tiny country. With $1.5-trillion economy, it is one of the largest in the world with record levels of foreign exchange reserves at $650 billion. According to experts, Russia has been keeping the reserves without touching them, anticipating such a storm.

The Treasury Department has announced more measures today, freezing assets of the Russian Central Bank that are held in the United States. It has also imposed the Russian Direct Investment Fund, a state-owned fund. These steps are likely to hobble Russia further. 

Some experts say that these sanctions have come late in the day as it is unlikely to inflict enough pain on Russia to force its president Vladimir Putin to change course. Gary Hufbauer, a sanctions expert and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics has told The Los Angeles Times that sanctions achieve their goals in only a small percentage of cases, and are more likely to succeed when they're targeted at specific economic goals or countries with unstable political regimes. Putin is a strongman and can withstand any negative effects his people may feel. (https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-02-25/russia-ukraine-sanctions-china)

Moreover, the world has been largely silent about the energy exports from Russia which are crucial for much of the world as it is the second-largest producer of oil and a prominent supplier of gas to Europe. Oil and gas account for nearly 60% of Russia's exports and about one-fifth of its economic output. Unless that is targeted, Russia could be justified in feeling that it can weather the sanctions.
