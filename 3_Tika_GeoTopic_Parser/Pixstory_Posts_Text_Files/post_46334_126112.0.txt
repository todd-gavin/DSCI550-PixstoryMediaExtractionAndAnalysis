Morning Sunshine Everyone ❤️☀️ Another Morning another day ☀️

Well i know , It is very difficult for all of us to start the day with a proper morning ritual . I love morning rituals because they make all the healthy behaviors . Habits to stay consistent for a healthy and happy living ! ❤️

Worried about this ?? Worry no more ! As today I'm gonna tell you my 3 main morning rituals . ✅

3 Rituals to boost gut health in the morning ; ✅

1 Chiaseeds Water - Drinking chia seed water in the morning can give a boost to your digestion and improve bowel movement .

2 Soaked Almonds - Soaked Almonds have pre-biotics properties , which helps in strengthening the immune system .

3 Copper is a great filter and by drinking water kept in a copper vessel on an empty stomach in the morning , the toxic substances accumulate in the body are also easily removed . This purifies the blood , detoxifies the body .

Many of you will ask why to have water ? lemme tell you - Overnight , our body has been sleeping for 6-9 hours in a very dehydrated state . So that’s why our first priority in the morning is always to re-hydrate with pure water . I myself do all these 3 Rituals in the morning daily . Trust me , they keep me fresh , hydrated , active and in a good mood for the whole day ! ✅😍☀️

So Start building morning habits . I hope it will help you the way it helped me ! ✅☀️

Have a nice Day everyone ! ☀️❤️
