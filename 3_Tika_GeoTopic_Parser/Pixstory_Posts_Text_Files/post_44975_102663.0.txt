AC Milan star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic will be out injured for up to eight months after having his
knee operated upon.

The Swedish striker was instrumental in leading AC Milan to their first league title in 11 years,
scoring 8 goals and setting up 3 in 23 matches.

Zlatan was also a big presence in the locker
room, bringing a winning mentality and being a mentor for the young faces in the dressing room.

As present as Zlatan has been, having a career that has spanned 23 years it seems like age is
finally catching up to him. Zlatan has spent more time out injured in his Milan career than he has
at any other club. Yet the mercurial striker always finds a way to end up on the score sheet,
scoring 10 goals for Milan in the previous two seasons.

Infact, Zlatanâ€™s stats at Milan this time
are better than his stats in his first stint at the club : higher expected goals (xG) (from 0.48 to
0.50), higher shots taken (3.89 to 4.05) higher aerial wins (4.81 to 4.91). and defensive
pressures (7.77 to 8.51).

Milan said the procedure on his left knee was "a complete success".

The striker, whose contract runs down this summer was hopeful to carry on being an important
figure on and off the pitch for AC Milan, but such a lengthy spell on the sidelines might make
Milan reconsider offering him a new one year deal.
