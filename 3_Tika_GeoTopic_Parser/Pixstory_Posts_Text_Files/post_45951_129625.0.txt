Because there are too many animals entering shelters and not enough people thinking about adoption when seeking for a pet, it is estimated that more than one million adoptable dogs and cats are put down every year in the United States. 

If more people chose to adopt pets rather than buy them, the number of animals put to death might be drastically decreased. Adopting a dog or cat means saving a beloved creature and making room in the shelter for another creature who might be in dire need of it.

Moreover, Pets in good health and happiness are overflowing from animal shelters and rescue organisations and are simply waiting to be adopted. Most pets in shelters ended up there due to a human issue, such as a move or a divorce, rather than something the animals did wrong. Many are accustomed to living with families and are already housetrained.
