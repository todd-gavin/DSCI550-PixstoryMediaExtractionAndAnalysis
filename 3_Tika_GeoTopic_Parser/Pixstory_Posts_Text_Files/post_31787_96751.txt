Milan April The Centrale dell Acqua the company museum of MMspa the engineering company of the Municipality of Milan in the setting of the schedule InCentrale organizes an extraordinary new exhibition These are the ArchiCreatures of Gaia Cairo what she defines as obsessions in watercolor and pen I am extremely fascinated by the variety aesthetics of the natural world every leaf every fish every feather for me a wonderful product of lines, shapes and colors The single subject loses its main essence and turns into a graphic element capable of doubling, multiplying, overlapping and fitting together to recreate infinite decorative combinations The fish it ceases to be a fish and becomes a pure geometric form capable of mixing with other subjects unfamiliar to it Thus compositions are born made of palm trees and fish, octopuses and ferns in which the obsessive search for the perfect fit turns into a guiding principle Even symmetries and reversals give life to new surreal and abstract creatures in which everyone plays to recognize something different The same passion for marine creatures arises from the bizarreness of their aesthetics the different density of the medium in which they move gives rise to a formal language completely unknown compared to the terrestrial one I colors lines and geometries suggest a sort of planet apart from the fascinating and mysterious alien life explains Gaia Cairo Twenty-two plates preparatory sketches travel notebooks prints and tiles drawings on wood a variegated universe of supports for a unique exhibition
