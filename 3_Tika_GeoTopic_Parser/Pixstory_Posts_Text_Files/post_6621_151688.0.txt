Arun Reddy, the social media coordinator of the All India National Congress Committee, tweeted a screengrab taken from the Times Now news channel on September 26. The image features a graphic containing figures for ‘public sentiment’ toward some of the prominent leaders in Indian politics. It contains a comparison of the numbers for key individuals like Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Among them, according to the graphic, Rahul Gandhi leads the pack with 66%. On the other hand, Narendra Modi is seen in the second position with 15%. The image also shows former Times Now anchor Anand Narasimhan as the host of the show. This screenshot is being shared in praise of Rahul Gandhi.
It is worth noting that this picture is being shared in the context of Congress’ ‘Bharat Jodo Yatra‘, which began from Kanyakumari on September 7. As part of this initiative, several Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, will campaign for the party across the country. The yatra will conclude in Jammu and Kashmir’s Srinagar after 150 days. However, the ‘Bharat Jodo Yatra’ has been targeted by the opposition since it was kicked off. Readers can find related reports here.
