After nearly two years of upheaval, the global fashion industry is regaining its footing. Revenues in the fashion industry fell by 20% in 2019â€“20, while earnings before interest, taxes, and amortisation (EBITA) margins fell by 3.4 percentage points to 6.8 percent. As the pandemic progressed, the performance disparities that had become a problem in recent years became more visible than ever. According to the most recent McKinsey Global Fashion Index (MGFI), a record 69 percent of companies were value destroyers in 2020, up from 61 percent in 2019 and just 28 percent in 2011. Approximately 7% of companies exited the market entirely, either due to financial difficulties or acquisition by competitors.
