It was the year 1948 when a tourism traffic committee was first begun in India to promote tourism culture in the nation. In 1958, a tourism department was established under the Ministry of Tourism and Communication in India. For many years the government has been taking steps to help the tourism of the country grow. However, the exact year when the National Tourism Day was first started is not known.


The National tourism day is observed to create awareness amongst the global community so as to attract attention on India's tourist locations as well as its social, financial and cultural worth. As the country's tourism was deeply affected due to the COVID-19 lockdown, the Ministry of Tourism would be organizing seminars on this theme to showcase the diverse culture of our country so as to try and boost up our country's tourism.
