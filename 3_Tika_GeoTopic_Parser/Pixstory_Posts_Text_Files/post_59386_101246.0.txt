TV shows have a way to reach us. They have a way to fix our mood. Those characters living their faux life become a part of your life. 
So, why should we waste our time watching series that add no value to our lives?

Below is a list of 3 top curated TV shows that you should watch in 2022 -
1) Succession
It revolves around a media mogul who has decided to step down and has to choose among his 4 highly competitive children for who will succeed him as the CEO. It involves emotional equations, trauma, challenges and what not.

2) 13 reasons why
It is a show that talks about what a high school student can go through when parents don't even realise what their child could be going through at school. It's about the fact that we have no idea what a person goes through. It is a reminder to be kind and welcoming.

3) How To Become a Tyrant
It is a show that shows the lives and depicts the mindset of the various tyrants that history has witnessed. It is a show vastly different from others and it really changes your perspective in life.
