With one of the coolest names in the entire aviation history, the Night Witches were an all-women Russian bomber troop. They were feared by the Nazis and were an asset to Soviet Union. They used biplanes and took cover in the darkness. They dropped 23,000 ton of bombs on Nazis. They were so feared and hated by the Nazis, that any German airman who downed one was immediately awarded with the most prestigious Iron Cross Medal. The name Night Witches were given to them because their aircrafts made a whooshing sound similar to brooms which was the only indication for their arrival. The 
plans were not detected on radar. 
Creating a troop of woman combaters was not the first choice. Women in Soviet had more work experience and even worked on aviation and making planes, because of necessity. They wanted to join the military but were refused. When Adolf Hitler started Operation Barbossa which was a massive 
invasion of Soviet Union. 
The women all wrote letters to Marina Raskova who then formed the squadron. They would drop bombs and even return fire, making Soviet the first country to allow women to fight. 
But the women were treated as inferiors by their male peers. They were given low quality planes and equipment. Their uniforms were hand-me-downs and shoes were oversized. The aircrafts were made of plywood, so it offered no protection. At night, the women suffered from impossible cold and frostbite. 
These women who flew planes did needlework, patchwork, decorated their planes and even used theirpencils for navigation and double as eyeliner. 
Altogether these daredevil heroines flew more than 30,000 missions or about 800 per pilot. But after six months after world War ended, the squadron was dismissed. My respect for these awesome women 
who proved yet again women can do anything.
