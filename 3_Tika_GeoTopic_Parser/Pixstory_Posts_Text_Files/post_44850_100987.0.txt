During his final game as a Juventus player, Paulo Dybala was given an emotional send-off, and
he couldn't fight back emotions after receiving a standing ovation.

Despite going 2-0 up in the first half with two goals from Dusan Vlahovic and Alvaro Morata, the
Old Lady could only manage a draw against Lazio on Monday night.

After goals from Alex Sandro [own goal] and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, Maurizio Sarri's side
clawed their way back into the game. However, the focus was on Juventus star Paulo Dybala,
who announced his departure after seven years in Turin.

The 28-year-old attacker, who joined Juventus from Palermo in 2015 and has 115 goals in 291
games, declared on social media that the game against Lazio will be his final for the Serie A
giants.

"Finding the appropriate words to greet you is tough because there are so many years and so
many emotions involved," Dybala wrote. " I believed we'd stay together for even longer, but fate
has other plans for us."

No one will be able to take away our 7 years of magic, 12 championships, and 115 goals.

"Thank you for standing by me during these trying times.

Thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout the years, from the first to the last,
from fans to club employees, coaches and teammates, employees and managers."

Wearing this crucial jersey and the captain's armband has been one of my biggest sources of
pride, which I wish to pass down to my children and grandkids "Tomorrow will be my final match
in this shirt, which is difficult to believe, but it will be our final farewell.

It won't be easy, but I'll go into battle with a grin on my face and my head held high, knowing that
I've given my all for you."

After being substituted by Martin Palumbo in the 77th minute, Dybala received a standing
ovation, and captain Giorgio Chiellini hugged the Argentine on the touchline.
