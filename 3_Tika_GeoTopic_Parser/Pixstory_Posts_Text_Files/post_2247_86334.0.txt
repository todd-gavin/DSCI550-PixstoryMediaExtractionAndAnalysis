Initial trends suggest that the BJP is set to retain Uttarakhand, breaking the cycle of repeating incumbent government after every year in the hill state. 

The Congress was confident of regaining the state after the BJP changed three chief ministers in three months but the appointment of Pushkar Singh Dhami, a fresh face, seems to have changed the equations. 

He was pitted against Congress veteran Harish Rawat who had repeatedly claimed that this is going to be his last election. 

The Congress was hit by infighting and allegations of corruption in candidate selection had also surfaced during the elections.
