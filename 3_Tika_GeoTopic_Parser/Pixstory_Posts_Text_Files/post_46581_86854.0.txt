Players who have not been vaccinated against the coronavirus will not be allowed to travel to Toronto to face the Blue Jays and will not be paid for those games. 

A person must have had a second vaccine shot — or one dose of Johnson & Johnson — at least 14 days before entering Canada, according to the ministry. 

"Any player who, as a result of such a governmental regulation, is unable or ineligible to play in a championship season game (or games) due to his vaccination status will be ineligible for placement on the COVID-19 IL, but instead may be placed on the restricted list... without pay or accrual of credited major league service, during such period of unavailability," according to the agreement.

U.S News reported that Toronto opens at home against Texas on April 8. "It's a problem," Tony Clark, the union's president, said on Friday. "I think everyone understands that I appreciate and accept the judgments that are made, especially when it comes to player and community health. But that is a domestic issue that we are addressing, and one that we will have to continue to attempt to work through here as the pandemic progresses."

The agreement protecting unvaccinated players and travel to Canada, according to the letter, will expire at the end of the 2022 season.
