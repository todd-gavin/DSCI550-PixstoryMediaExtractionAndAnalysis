Francesco Acerbi waited for hours before returning to talk about what happened after Milan&#39;s second goal at the Olimpico in Rome in the postponement of Sunday evening The cameras framed him as he laughed and many fans railed against him for this gesture After an initial message on social media Acerbi took pen and paper and wrote a letter to Corriere dello Sport making it clear and firmly reiterating that he does not accept inferences about his own integrity. Unripe I feel a feeling of loneliness that humanly hurts me I cannot accept speculation about my personal and professional integrity about my seriousness and my commitment to defending Lazio&#39;s colors From the Milan goal at the end of the match, the insults began for that sneer taken from the cameras and the scolding of his teammate Laughter who was obviously nervous about the defeat that materialized after the advantage and thanks to a sensational mistake in defense I have read and heard absurd insinuations that I cannot and do not want to accept I would like us all together we could move on at least to end the season in the best possible way with dignity and mutual respect
