Erin Brockovich cannot stand being lied to and being ignored What would be her response if Ed Masry provokes her so Barge into his cabin and make a loud scene and ask him to send her out before his staff for the very reason she doesn t want to beg Out of guilt or empathy the family man Masry employs her as a file clerk at his law firm Her clerk days weren t rosy Senior ladies there give a damn They paid more attention to her necklines and miniskirts Erin had to confront her boss I will wear whatever I like is the softest extract from that talk we can put in public This applies to all situations in Erin s life with zero emotional gravity Including a courtroom bad behaviour and a blow job reference in an important meeting with attorneys on the serious PG E case In Erin s view she is ethical and straightforward Better if you don t meddle with her good intentions Back home Erin a twice divorced mother is sweet and sour with her three children Her single parenting is impressive Erin s lean income is never enough to send her children to good babysitters But the bills force her She was hardly home when she had to devote herself to a case since she knows that was the only resource to prove her competence at work and earn perks She didn t mind leaving her children with a good man and he spending more quality time with them Their break up hit her but she doesn t bend She never drops her mission of saving the Hinkley community from the worst effects of water poisoning in the middle lest losing her children Erin strongly believes they will admire her causes when they grow up To me it sounds like a full caps placard statement for all working mothers Erin Brockovich is a true story Portraying the go getter Erin Julia Roberts won her first Oscar Though I don t consider it as her best performance and still clueless about those necklines and peeping bras in every scene watching the very emotional young diva Julia is a delight
