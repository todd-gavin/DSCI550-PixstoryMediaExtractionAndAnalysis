Misogyny is something that women face daily in their lives. We have say that the case isn’t so in developed countries but is this true? Women are taught to stay quiet and ‘fit in’ especially if they want to safeguard their jobs. Only some, have the courage to call out the perpetrators and pave way for other women to speak up about misogyny, especially in work places. And that is what is happening!

One of Australia's most powerful visual artists has spoken out about the abuse and misogyny she faced while running one of the country's most important cultural institutions. 

The Guardian reported that Elizabeth Ann Macgregor, who was named a Member of the Order of Australia earlier this year for "significant contribution to museums and galleries," resigned as director of Sydney's Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) in October after 22 years in the position. 

The Scottish art historian and curator was gracious in her farewell interviews when discussing the problems she faced during her two decades at the MCA. 

Macgregor, on the other hand, described for the first time in a podcast interview broadcast on Thursday the animosity she received at all levels of politics after migrating to Australia.

“I’ll be quite honest … it was the misogyny,” Macgregor said on the latest episode of the Blenheim Partners’ No Limitations podcast, when asked by interviewer Gregory Robinson what she found most challenging during her early days in Australia.

“And [at the time] I didn’t realise it … because I hadn’t really encountered it before.”
Macgregor said she was “yelled at … many, many times” by men working at all levels of government during her career, saying “it was quite unpleasant to be quite frank”.

“Anyone who’s dealt with certain levels of political discourse will have dealt with this, whether it’s at federal or state level or indeed, at a council level,” she said.
