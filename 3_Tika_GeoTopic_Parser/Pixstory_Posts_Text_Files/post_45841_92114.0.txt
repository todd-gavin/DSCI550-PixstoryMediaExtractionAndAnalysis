The Ukraine Russia was has taken the lives of hundreds and has caused loss of property worth millions. It has been more than a month but the atrocities just won’t stop. It’s heartbreaking to witness that we, in 2022 can’t seem to realise that war only destructs. There is nothing to be gained from it. 

I have repeatedly talked about how proud I am of our scientists to break all boundaries to discover the hidden secrets of space. Science is one of those institutions which I always thought would be untouched by the corruption of the world. After all, it is an institution based on knowledge and wisdom. However, it seems that science will be another casualty of war. And this time the target will be the US Mars Rover. 

It took 15 years to build and cost £840 million to develop. However, fears are growing that the British-built robot rover, which was supposed to fly on Europe's ExoMars mission in September, will never reach Mars. 

The Guardian reported that the craft was supposed to delve deep beneath the Martian surface for samples that could reveal clues of past or present life, but its launch on a massive Russian Proton rocket was postponed last month due to the invasion of Ukraine. 

At best, the rover, which was built in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, and is funded by the European Space Agency, will have to wait another two years until the next opportunity to send a spacecraft to Mars arises. However, some astronomers fear that prospects for the rover, named after the British DNA pioneer Rosalind Franklin, now look grim. If delays continue, it could ultimately be mothballed, scientists have warned.

As a space enthusiast, I sincerely hope that the progression of the knowledge of mankind is not hindered by the senseless act of war. Let’s see what happens ahead!
