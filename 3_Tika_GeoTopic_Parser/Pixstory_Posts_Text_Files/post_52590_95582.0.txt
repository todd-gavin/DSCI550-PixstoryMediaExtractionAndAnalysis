From day 1, I have a love-hate relationship with the mask. I still remember how awkward it felt to suddenly see everyone wearing a mask and oh we've come a long way . Now when I see people not wearing a mask , that feels awkward.

Albeit wearing a mask in this scorching heat just adds to our suffering but somehow I have to agree with the fact that this mask has brought some sense of security and confidence in my life.

Sometimes when I am just not in the mood of getting ready, covering my face so that less people recognise me just feels wonderful. Also, when I'm at a place where I am surrounded by strangers, hiding my face brings a sense of security. 

Above all, it has again become mandatory to wear masks in public places so we aren't left with a choice and personally I'm completely okay with it!
