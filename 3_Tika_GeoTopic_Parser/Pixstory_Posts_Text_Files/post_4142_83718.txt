Haldi wasn t so familiar in Kerala but has been a trend for the last few years It was a small function in premises of bride s house All of our cousins were dolled up in yellow and the bride choose red which made it more colorful We covered them in Haldi and got myself too It s such a fun ceremony Yellow is one happy color Later we all took photos and danced our heart out Haldi is said to detoxify and radiate positive energy and the energy we had says it all We got to dance sing play games and had a great day We played many Malayalam and Hindi songs including London Thumkda Maahi Ve Cutiepie So whats your Haldi Playlist Add your favorite Haldi song in the notes
