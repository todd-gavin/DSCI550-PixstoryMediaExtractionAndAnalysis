Climate change is going to have an impact on the global supply of tomato ketchup. That's an awful news for ketchup lovers. But you know something funny instead? When ketchup was invented in 1834 by Dr John Cook Bennett, it was advertised as a medicine!! Yes you read that right. People actually started spreading rumours that ketchup is actually a wonderful cure for a variety of illnesses, including jaundice, rheumatism and indigestion. 
Next time you try ketchup, remember that people actually consumed pills of ketchup to cure their illnesses! :D
