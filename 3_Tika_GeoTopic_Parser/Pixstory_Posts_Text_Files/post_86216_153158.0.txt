Self-love not loathe
Loving self is the first step to a happy, wondrous and colorful life. It establishes the foundation of the person we are. If we aren't confident in ourselves and the kind of person we have become, others' confidence will start to shake. We must learn to accept ourselves. If we can't be kind to ourselves, are we truly kind?
"True self-care is not bath salts and chocolate cake, it's making the choice to build a life you don't need to escape from.
