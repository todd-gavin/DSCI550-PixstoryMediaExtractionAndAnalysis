A user says, "The fact that she is so successful as a singer, actress, dancer, and entrepreneur makes her a legend in my book. Give me an artist who has her level of fame and influence on all 4 aspects, I'll wait."

Another tweets, "She’s a legend in the fact that whether you f*ck with her or not she is a household name and you can name her creative projects even if you don’t like her."

A user humorously posts, "Legend is... so much? Definitely living. But legend?"

One says, "there is no defining career moment or pop culture influence that J-Lo has to be considered a "legend". She's known for her mediocrity, thieving and ability to two-step. dassit"
