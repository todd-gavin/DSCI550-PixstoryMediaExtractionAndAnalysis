The upkeep of the fingernails and toenails is crucial for both health and aesthetic reasons. 

With proper nail care, you can avoid skin infections on your hands and feet, painful ingrown fingernails and toenails, and nail fungal infections. Taking care of your nails is crucial for the health of your hands and might reveal information about your overall health. Adults should clip their nails once a week because untrimmed nails can harbour bacteria that can lead to infections.

Avoid biting or picking at your cuticles or nails. Nails can be pretty with nothing on them if they are kept up.
