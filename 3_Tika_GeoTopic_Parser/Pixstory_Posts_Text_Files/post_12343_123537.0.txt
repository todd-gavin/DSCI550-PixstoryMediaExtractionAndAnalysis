If you don't feel like yourself, it could be a sign you
need to take care of your mental health. Identifying the
signs your mental health is declining is the first step to

Consistent irritability, isolating yourself from
friends and family, constantly overthinking + overanalyzing, sleep disturbance, loss of joy or motivation, and appetite changes are some of the common signs. What would you add to this list??
