Daughter of Jammu re-launch 
60 feet Bailey bridge in Arunachal Pradesh 


Captain Sania Led The Women Team To De-Launch 60 Feet Bailey Bridge In A Day. Intresting thing is that only women were involved in this project.

Captain Sania belongs to village Bharakh of tehsil Pouni of district Reasin in Jammu region. After studying initial schooling in Reasi area she joined the OTA Chennai in 2018. 

It may be recalled here that she was also instrumental in successful de-launch of 50 ft SSBB at Km 32 last month. The women team again created history by de-launching a 60 ft SSBB at Km 43 on Jan 23 this year .

This women team of 105 RCC is making history time and again and doing wonders which never happened before. Another successful de-launch happened on Jan 23 this year without any mishap or injury. The 60 ft SSBB was constructed on Jan 2,1986 during the period of crisis. A few years back a pmt replacement bridge was constructed and the Bailey bridge was not in use. The women team de-launched 35 years old Bailey Bridge successfully.
