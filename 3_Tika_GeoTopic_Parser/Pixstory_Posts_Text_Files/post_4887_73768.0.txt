Although it's almost been a week since symptoms started to develop, mom hasn't still got her taste back. I don't really have major symptoms but there is a lot of fatigue and ache in my body. 

Two of our close friends sent us lunch and dinner. They were such a blessing during these tough times. 

I feel fortunate to have surpassed Covid twice. Everybody is still recovering, but we're doing fine. 

Situations and incidents like these make you feel more grateful about things you have in life, and how little our problems are, being alive, being healthy and fine, and being able to stay with your loved ones are the greatest treasures of life.
