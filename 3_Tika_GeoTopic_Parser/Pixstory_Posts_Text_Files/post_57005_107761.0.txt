With the increasing diversity and modernity in the American culture, the fear of "other" lingers. The fear intimidates and torments someone to the point that they think of annihilating the "other".
This is where hate rises and becomes violence, which must be punished.

Hate crimes are deplorable and should be published at all costs. It doesn't seem as tiny as it looks; the amount of hate and abhorrence that leads to unprecedented actions is unexplainable. People are killed and traumatised physically and emotionally when they bear the viciousness of hate crimes.

Punishing hate crimes looks like punishing an idea or a thought that arises due to the extreme influence from one's community or maybe the other, but it needs to be given more attention and condemned.
At this time, hate crime laws come to the rescue; the main objective of this law is to punish offenders harshly enough that they never commit a hateful offence in future.

This can be the short-term objective of hate crime law, but as a long-term objective, it aims to annihilate and put an end to the increasing crimes motivated by hate.
Hate crime laws should remain and instead set harsher penalties on the perpetrator.
