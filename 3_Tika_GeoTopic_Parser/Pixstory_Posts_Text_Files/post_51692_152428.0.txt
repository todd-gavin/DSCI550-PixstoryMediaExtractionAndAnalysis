After losing 1-0 to Inter in the Champions League, Barcelona was incensed and felt they should have been given a penalty for what they believed to be a handball by Denzel Dumfries.
The Nerazzurri and Blaugrana's game last night was dramatic, with both teams frustrated by referee Slavko Vincic at various points during the game. However, the Blaugrana were left feeling more betrayed after three specific incidents: Pedri's disallowed goal, Hakan Calhanoglu's potentially dangerous challenge, and Dumfries' apparent handball in the penalty area.
Barcelona was not awarded a penalty because the apparent handball was not clearly seen on the VAR cameras, leaving the authorities in the dark.
There is still debate over whether or not the ball first deflected off the player's head, if it even matters at all. After the game, a clip appeared on Spanish TV from a different angle, where it did appear to clearly strike the Inter full back's hand.
After the game, Barcelona was incensed and is reportedly planning to file a complaint against referee Vincic with UEFA. 
What do you think about this mistake ? Will the court sue referee Vincic ? 
What do you think, Let me know in the notes..
Thankyou âš½
