Porto and Leverkusen will be up against each other on Matchday 03 of the UEFA ChampionsLeague. Porto are on bottom of the points table in Group B of the UEFA Champions League2022-23 while Leverkusen sit at the second spot in the points table.

Porto have had a tough time in this year’s UEFA Champions League campaign and they have certainly failed to live up the expectations of their fans. In the last couple of games playedagainst Club Brugge and Atletico Madrid, Porto have been on the losing end twice.

Bayer Leverkusen, on the other hand, have had a mixed bag so far in the UCL. They lost theiropening encounter against Club Brugge away from home but made a scintillating comeback inthe second game beating Atletico Madrid 2-0 at home.
