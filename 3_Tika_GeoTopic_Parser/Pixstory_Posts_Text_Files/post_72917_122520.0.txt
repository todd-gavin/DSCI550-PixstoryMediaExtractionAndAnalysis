Schezwan Fried Egg Rice: I quite enjoyed the rice as well, it's nicely spiced and makes a good base for the chicken and fish dishes. 

Won China Darsaan: Thick noodles fried to perfection and coated in a sticky honey sauce, topped with sesame seeds and finished with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yes, they delivered the ice cream too! The noodles are fried so well they maintained their crunch for days! 

Chocolate Brownie: The brownie was nice, but I preferred the Won China Darsaan as a dessert. 

Additionally, we ordered spring rolls and honey chilli potatoes. Both these appetizers were delicious, although I do prefer a crunchier spring roll. 

Final verdict: 5 stars! All the dishes were amazing, both on their own and together. The price is also extremely economical, more so when you see the portion sizes! I would definitely recommend ordering from One China. Enjoy!
