Undoubtedly art has the potential to create the unprecedented in the most unprecedented times.

These incredible works of war portray the war with its true artistic power.

Paolo Uccello, The Battle of San Romano, c. 1438–40
In the early Renaissance, warfare was pageantry by other means. Uccello’s three rigorously formal panels commemorate Florence’s victory over Siena and present war not as an enterprise of death but as a festival of political pomp and circumstance. 

Francisco Goya, Third of May 1808, 1814
Goya’s revolutionary and unbearably frank depiction of political martyrdom, commissioned to celebrate Spanish resistance to Napoleon’s army, echoes the tragic, ghastly etchings of his Disasters of War series. It marks a shift from celebratory, heroic military painting to a blunter and more modern idiom that continues to dominate our vision of war. 

Édouard Manet, The Battle of the Kearsarge and the Alabama, 1864
Manet’s churning seascape, the first he ever painted, depicts a naval battle between the Union and Confederacy that took place off the coast of France.

Pablo Picasso, Guernica, 1937
A grieving woman with arms outstretched, a man lying mutilated on the ground, a horse stabbed and writhing: Picasso’s desperate, infuriated commemoration of an atrocity of the Spanish Civil War remains the most powerful antiwar statement of modern times.
