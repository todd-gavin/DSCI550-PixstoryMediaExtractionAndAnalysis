Well I only had Rs 100 , and I was supposed to satisfy my hunger but then a thought popped into my mind , can I try and avoid junk food ? And eat only healthy things 

Here are the options I went for 

Bhel puri - Rs 30
Complete with peanuts , onions,tomatoes,rice puff and chick peas a great source of protein 
Moti bagh market 

Vegetable sandwich -40
Nothing more healthy than that right ?
Bread has fibres with goodness of vegetables.
INA metro station 

Chaaz - Rs 10 
You can buy a hygienic nicely packed chaaz from your nearby mother diary 

2 Banana - Rs 10 
Bananas are good for you 
Basrurkar market 

Bhutta - Rs 10 
Delhi monsoon is incomplete without a bhuna hua bhutta

What do you think are these options healthy enough ?
