In 2018, the Question Research Institute (PRSO) conducted a survey entitled "Survey of Hindus and Sikhs in Afghanistan." According to the survey, 60.7% of Sikh respondents from different provinces said that they would like to emigrate and leave Afghanistan if the conditions were right. While the Sikhs' optimism about the future of Afghanistan has been very low compared to other Afghan citizens. As 82.6% of Sikhs in that poll said that Afghanistan is moving in the wrong direction. According to a survey by the Question Institute, almost all Sikhs and Hindus, 96.8 percent, said they were more or less afraid of their own and their family's immunity. If we compare this statistic with other Afghan citizens, in a survey of Afghan people conducted by the Asia Foundation in 2018, 71.1% of respondents felt fear for their safety and that of their families.
