The desire by people in richer countries for a diverse range of out of season produce imported from overseas is driving up global greenhouse gas emissions our new research has found It reveals how transporting food across and between countries generates almost one fifth of greenhouse gas emissions from the food sector and affluent countries make a disproportionately large contribution to the problem Although carbon emissions associated with food production are well documented this is the most detailed study of its kind We estimated the carbon footprint of the global trade of food tracking a range of food commodities along millions of supply chains Since worldwide agricultural and food trade has more than doubled and internationally traded food provides of calories consumed globally It s never been clearer that eating local produce is a powerful way to take action on climate change A web of food journeys The concept of food miles is used to measure the distance a food item travels from where it s produced to where it s consumed From that we can assess the associated environmental impact or carbon footprint Globally food is responsible for about billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions each year or about of total human produced carbon emissions The sources of food emissions include transport land use change such as cutting down trees and the production process Our study used an accounting framework we devised in an innovative platform called the FoodLab It involved an unprecedented level of detail spanning countries or regions economic sectors four transport modes water rail road and air more than million trade connections journeys of a single food from one place to another Read more
