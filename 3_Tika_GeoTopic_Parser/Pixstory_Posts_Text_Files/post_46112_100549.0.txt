If I ask You all - What is The easiest Way to communicate These days ?? ü§î

Almond Everyone Of You will say - Texting ! ü•±

Texting has become such an integral part of how we communicate , I often don't think twice about the types of messages i send . Whether it's Sending Wishes , or a description of your day  , texting is typically my go-to form of reaching others . ‚ù§Ô∏è‚úÖ

But one thing i learned is - There are number of things one should never say or do over texts ‚ùå ! No matter how convenient or easy it may seem . Texting Saves alot of time i agree but there are still certain conversations worth having in person ! ‚úÖ

Lemme tell you What things I never say on texts ;

1 Insulting someone 
2 Unexpected Big News or Update 
3 Apologies 
4 Breakups 
5 Secrets 
6 Complaints 
7 Sending passwords
8 sending Unsolicited Sexual Photos
9 Saying "I Love You" For The First Time
10 Announcing Death

Earlier i use to say everything over texts but Then i realised Its Wrong‚ùå ! I never take risk of wrong person Seeing my texts ! I save the heavier topics for in person ! You know some things were just meant to be said face-to-face . ‚úÖ

*Remember*
Texting Is easy But Not everytime it's good ! ‚úÖ‚ù§Ô∏è
