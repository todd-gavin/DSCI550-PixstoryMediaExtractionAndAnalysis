Dele Alli's move on loan, away from Tottenham Hotspur in January got people talking again.

The Englishman was relegated to a bench warmer and spent the final years of his time at
Spurs as a quiet, uninvolved figure. As bad as that was, the move away from Spurs ought to
reignite a spark that hadn't been lit since his early days at White Hart Lane.

Under Mauricio Pochettino's authority, he was an unapologetic, unwavering and brave
personality even as a youngster. Alli was one of the truly remarkable footballers people in
England turned out their television sets for.

“I thought if anyone could get the best out of him, it would be Frank Lampard, Lampard
played that position, there were similarities when Dele first broke through, he was a
goalscoring midfielder." Darren Bent told talkSPORT.

“I thought Frank would kind of put his arm around him and go, ‘Let’s get you firing again’ but,
for whatever reason, that just hasn’t happened. Dele, unfortunately, will have to look at
himself. It can’t always be Pochettino at the end of his time at Tottenham, it can’t be
Mourinho, it can’t be Nuno, it can’t be Conte. It can’t be Frank Lampard."

Bent believes Alli is an ambitious footballer, but as Jose Mourinho once famously pointed out
— is a terrible trainer.

“At some stage, he’s got to look at himself and go, ‘Hold on, there’s a big difference here. I
remember talking to a psychologist back in the day and watching old footage of myself and
comparing it to then.

“If Dele is doing that now, he’ll be able to see, himself, he’s night and day away from the
player that he was a couple of years ago.
“He’s miles away from it.”

With some work and a boost in confidence, Dele has the ability to change games and help
Everton stay in the top tier.
