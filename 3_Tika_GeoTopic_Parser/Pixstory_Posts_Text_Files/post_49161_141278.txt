I am very proud of what America has achieved as an independent nation but I strongly believe that we don t have the right to criticize the system the UK has or chooses to follow The institution of the Crown serves as the foundation for all of British culture and history If you took that away the entire nature of the country would change Simply put without the monarchy the United Kingdom would resemble a smaller version of France with inferior heritage The UK produces far more money than it spends thanks to the monarchy Whatever you may think of her Majesty she had dedicated nearly her entire long life to the service of her country The royals are some of the hardest workers in society The monarchy holds a great part of the Britain history and taking that away from them would be a disservice to their nation And I don t see the point of complaining Isn t the British Royal Family everything the left wants the rich and powerful to be They serve their people and are dedicated to improving the world
