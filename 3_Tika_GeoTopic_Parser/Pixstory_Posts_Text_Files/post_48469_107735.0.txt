—Then God said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.” And it was so. The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw it was good. (Genesis 1: 11 – 12)

Now the LORD God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden: and there he put the man he had formed. And the LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground – trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.


—And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying to them, “Speak to the people of Israel, saying, These are the living things that you may eat among all the animals that are on the earth. Whatever parts the hoof and is cloven-footed and chews the cud, among the animals, you may eat. Nevertheless, among those that chew the cud or part the hoof, you shall not eat these: The camel, because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof, is unclean to you. And the rock badger, because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof, is unclean to you. (Leviticus 11:1-47)


—Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. And as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything. (Genesis 9:3)

In Romans 14:1-23, He said that the weak in faith eats only vegetable but must not judge the one who eats meat for Lord has allowed us to choose if we want to eat meat.

We were made to feed on other beings. It's how it is.
