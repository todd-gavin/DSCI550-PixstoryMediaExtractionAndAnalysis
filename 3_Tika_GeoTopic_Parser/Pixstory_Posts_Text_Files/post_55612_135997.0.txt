These days, people have a habit of giving a  fancy name to everything. And this is just another case for that. Like normal human beings, moms work because guess what? It’s their job. And because moms work, there is bound to be some exhaustion which can be fixed with a good sleep. 

Stop calling it burnout. People who go to office everyday to make money get exhausted too. You don’t see them complaining of raising alarms about a “burnout”? These woke liberals make an issue out of everything! 

It’s your job to put your kids first and having kids is a commitment you can’t back out of! 

Therefore, learn to do better task management instead of complaining about your choices!
