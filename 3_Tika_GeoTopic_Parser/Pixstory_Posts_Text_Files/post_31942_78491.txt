Manchester City Grade B Overall it was a rather quiet transfer window for Manchester City as they only made one significant signing and allowed several players to leave on loan or for good However I have handed them such a high mark because they managed to offload Ferran Torres to Barcelona for million Now Torres had a good goalscoring record for City and scored goals in just appearances transfermarkt However considering they managed to sign him for million from Valencia in the summer of they have made a huge amount of money back on the Spanish international It was almost the perfect deal for Pep Guardiola s side who exploited Barca s need for players and bagged themselves a huge profit for a player who only made four Premier League appearances this season In his place City have signed Julian Alvarez from River Plate The year old has been capped at senior level by Argentina and has been described as the best Argentine player at the moment by Daniel Bertoni this year Italy News For the Argentinian giants Alvarez has scored goals in appearances and it seems as if City have signed a player with a huge future ahead of him transfermarkt The fee at million seems reasonable but City fans will have to wait until next season to see Alvarez at the Etihad as he has been loaned back to River Plate until the summer Several other players left City on loan including Taylor Harwood Bellis who moved to Stoke City So though it was a quiet month for City they still managed to pull off some good deals and to sell Torres for million is a stroke of genius The summer should be much busier for Guardiola s side but he can be satisfied with City s work in January
