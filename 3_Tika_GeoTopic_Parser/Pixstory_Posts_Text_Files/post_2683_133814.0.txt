Today is 94th Birth Anniversary of Ustad Vilayat Khan.
In one of his compositions in raag Gaur Malhar, Vilayat Khan vented his anguish, ‘Kya bhasha un sang karenge, jo baat na jaane; humko woh kya jaane, jo koi na pehchaane’ (in what language can one converse with someone who is ignorant; how can someone who nobody recognises assess me). He ends with an emotional ‘aise log humme samajhaaye’ where he goes up to ‘teep’ sa with a beautiful meend, conveying his frustration musically.
Often described as moody and arrogant, Vilayat Khan had another side to him. Long-time friend Lalita Khanna recalls incidents from his days in Simla in the 1960s that showed the humility and generosity of the man. Her father, Raja Padamjit Singh, had a heart problem and was bedridden. When Vilayat Khan came to know about it, he drove up to Khanna’s house and played raag Des and Tilak Kamod on the sitar, sitting on the floor beside her father’s bed. He explained later, “I knew my music would make him feel better.” Two days later, he went again.
Vilayat Khan once said, “I am different as a sitar player only due to my emotions.” For him, unless music had the power to arrest, the power to convey feeling ( taaseer ), it amounted to nothing. In his words, “You have to play assuming no one in the audience knows anything about your music; you have to play for yourself, and slowly you start listening to your playing and enjoying your own music. That’s when your audience connects with the music.”
In an interview, two years before his death in 2004, he had said, “I am not satisfied. Music is like climbing a never-ending mountain, it’s a constant struggle. [But] I want my next life to be linked with music again.”
