According to WebMD, they've been the darlings of social media, and they've been called "America's new favorite fruit." Turns out, avocados are popular for good reason. Not only are they delicious, they're packed with vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that can help keep you healthy.

Our body needs potassium to work normally. For example, the mineral helps keeps your heartbeat steady. Most people think of bananas when they think of this nutrient. But ounce for ounce, avocados have more.

Moreover, avocados have lutein and zeaxanthin, which absorb light waves that can harm your vision. People who eat lots of foods rich in these antioxidants are less likely to have age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in older adults. Most of an avocado's antioxidants are found in the darker green flesh that's closest to the peel.
