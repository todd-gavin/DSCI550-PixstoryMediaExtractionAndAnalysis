Manchester United have announced that Erik ten Hag will be their new manager until June
2025, with the option to extend for an additional year. The Dutchman will leave his position as
Ajax head coach at the end of the season and begin his tenure at Old Trafford.

Ten Hag has been in charge of Ajax for more than four years, winning the Dutch league and cup
double in 2018-19 and 2020-21. His team lost the 2022 cup final to PSV last Sunday, but they
are still on track to win another league title.

Ten Hag's â‚¬2 million release clause has been met, according to reports, and the 52-year-old has
been granted close involvement: the ability to make final transfer decisions alongside the club
administration.

Ten Hag stated, "It is a great honor to be named manager of Manchester United, and I am
enormously delighted by the job ahead." I am fully aware of the club's history and the
supporters' fervor, and I am completely committed to building a team capable of delivering the
victory they so richly deserve.

"Leaving Ajax after these amazing years will be painful, but I can assure our fans of my whole
devotion and attention to finishing this season successfully before I move to Manchester United."

"During his four years at Ajax, Erik has proven himself to be one of Europe's most exciting and
successful managers, known for his team's attractive, aggressive play and dedication to
youngsters," United's football director John Murtough said.

We were very pleased with Erik's long-term vision for bringing Manchester United to the level
where we want to compete, as well as his ambition and commitment to do so,throughout our
meetings with him leading up to this appointment.

"We wish Erik the best of luck as he concentrates on bringing Ajax's season to a victorious
conclusion, and we hope to welcome him to Manchester United this summer."
