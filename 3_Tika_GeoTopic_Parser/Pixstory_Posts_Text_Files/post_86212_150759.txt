So today I ll share with you my personal favorite Anime movies For those who don t know anime are Japanese animation movies or series My must watch list of anime movies include Graveyard of the fireflies It s a tear jerker which will make you bawl your eyes out But at the same time it s one of the most heart touching movies I ve ever seen A silent voice This one too can be a tear jerker but with a certified happy ending This movie will take you through friendship grief bullying love hope and finally a happy ending Spirited Away every anime lover would ve watched this one atleast once It s a fan favourite and also one of the early release movie You don t need to be an anime lover to appreciate the story and the characters Although the end may leave you asking for a bit more of the characters a bit more of the story Your Name Another movie i doubt any anime lover hasn t watched The graphics and the sceneries overtake the plot of the movie but that s what the director was trying to do To show you a movie through the sceneries and the backgrounds where the lifeless objects speak to you A really beautiful movie Some other favourites of mine include Okko s Inn Howl s Moving Castle and The Girl Who Leapt Through Time Ps I m open to recommendations so please feel free to share your favourites with me
