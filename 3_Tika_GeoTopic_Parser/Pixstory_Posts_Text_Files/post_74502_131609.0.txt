Puri Jagannadh’s upcoming film, ‘Liger’ became the latest target of the boycott trend on Twitter after Aamir Khan starrer ‘Laal Singh Chaddha’. Most people are boycotting the film because of the involvement of Karan Johar in the film. 🎞

Just like many recent releases including Laal Singh Chaddha, and Raksha Bandhan, the forthcoming release Liger too became a part of the Cancel Culture. The Boycott Liger hashtag has gained momentum on social media and is currently trending on platforms. 💯💯💯💯
Reacting to the same, the leading man Vijay Deverakonda reacted to this in a true blue fighter style, adding that they have put their heart in the film and they have nothing to fear about. He also asserted that with everyone’s and lord’s blessings, no one will be able to stop them 😶😶😶😳😳😳

Reacting to the ongoing trend, Vijay Deverakonda spoke to ANI saying, “With Liger, we expected a bit of drama...but we'll fight. We've put our heart into making this film. 😱😱And I believe that I am correct. I feel that there is no room for fear, when I had nothing, I didn't fear, and now after having achieved something, I don't think there needs to be any fear even now. Maa ka aashirwaad hai, Logon ka pyaar hai, Bhagwaan ka haath hai, andar aag hai, Kaun rokenge dekh lenge (With mother's blessings, people's love, and God's support, a fire inside us, we will see who will stop us)!" 😱😱💯💯

adding that he’s expecting that people will like his film because they’ve poured in their sweat and blood to make Liger. He then shared how he has struggled and fought for things all his life.💯😇
Elaborating further, the south superstar added that he has no fear because they have put their heart and soul to make the film. Vijay feels that when you are right, there is no need to listen to anybody. According to him, they all are from this country and they know how much they do for their people and country. Vijay also added that they are not from that batch who sit in front of computers and tweet.💯💯💯
