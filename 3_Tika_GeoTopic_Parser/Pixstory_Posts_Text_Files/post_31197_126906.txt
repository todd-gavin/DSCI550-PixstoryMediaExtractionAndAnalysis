UNICEF has launched a new mobile application for Ukrainian preschoolers offering interactive games aimed at developing skills such as logic and creativity The war in Ukraine has had a devastating effect on access to education, especially pre-school The application is part of a larger NUMO project whose idea is to help parents involve their children in educational and developmental activities thus keeping education accessible and providing children with a sense of normalcy during wartime About two-thirds of children are internally displaced in Ukraine or in neighboring countries This means that in addition to war-related trauma and suffering, children have limited access to pre-school education and early learning opportunities and may lose the essential foundation for lifelong learning. NUMO offers a unique opportunity for lifelong learning and game and a great example of cooperation and innovation between countries to reach children with joyful and playful experiences We hope many Ukrainian children enjoy quality interactive games with the help and companionship of adults NUMO is a great example of the use UNICEF makes digital innovations to reach children and their parents in this response Other innovations used are the Learning Passport and the Bebbo app for parents says Philippe Cori, UNICEF Deputy Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia The NUMO Developing Games application also contains exercises drawing and stories for children up to six years The contents are divided into three categories up to years years years years
