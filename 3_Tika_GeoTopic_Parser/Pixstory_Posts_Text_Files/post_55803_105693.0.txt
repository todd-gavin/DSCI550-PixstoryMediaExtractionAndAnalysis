It will be an understatement to say that Mem Fox is a remarkable author and the pride of Australia! 

Fox opted to retrain in language studies while working in play in 1981. "Literacy has become the central focus of my existence â€” it is my passion, my battle, my purpose, and my tiredness," she explained. She's written books about literacy for kids, their parents, teachers, and educators.

As per CT. Possum Magic is bound to come up when you ask any Australian about their favourite childhood books. The classic Australian novel, written by Mem Fox in 1978, tells the story of two possums travelling through Australia and the strange native Australian animals they encounter in the bush. 

Moreover, I'm Australian Too, her most recent book, is a children's book that celebrates Australia's multicultural population. Possum Magic, which was initially published 35 years ago, is still in print in every Australian primary school classroom.

Have you read anything written by her?
