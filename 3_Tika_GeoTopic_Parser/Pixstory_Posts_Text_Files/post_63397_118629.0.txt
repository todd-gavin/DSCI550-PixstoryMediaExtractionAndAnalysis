Targeting the thyroid alone is rarely helpful
longterm when trying to manage hypothyroid. 

That's because many people are experiencing conversion issues (T4 is not converting to T3), auto !immunity, and/or mineral imbalances that are driving their condition.

T4 converts to T3 mainly in the liver (~70%) and the gut (~20%).

So if you've got liver congestion and/or underlying gut infections/dysbiosis/leaky gut and you're only targeting the thyroid/replacing thyroid hormone in the body, you're doing
little to support the bigger picture.

If you have an imbalance between calcium and potassium, replacing thyroid hormone won't do much good.

When potassium is low, thyroid hormone is poorly utilized, and when bio-unavailable calcium is high, thyroid hormone has a hard time actually getting into the cell.

Think of this like a wall of calcium surrounding your cell.

Your blood panel for your thyroid markers may come back â€œnormal", but it doesn't mean anything if you have too much calcium is preventing the use of those thyroid
hormones. 

When we can do a deep dive into intracellular mineral status, we're able to build a solid foundation that translates into more energy, higher libido, better stress response,
quality sleep, better mental health, and improved thyroid activity. No guesswork involved.
