Communicating our needs can be difficult at any stage of life — and it certainly doesn’t get easier after a baby arrives. During this time of uphill battles — some literal (like hauling a stroller up a flight of stairs) and some figurative (like dealing with postpartum anxiety) — it’s not unusual to feel awkward about asking for help.

It’s only human to feel like we’re imposing on others by asking for a hand. But attempting to power through baby care single-handedly can leave you feeling overwhelmed and alone. Parenting your new little one requires extreme amounts of energy and fortitude, and it’s absolutely okay if you’re not able to muster them at the moment.

To help you get what you need during this time, we spoke to moms and communication experts about ways to ask for — and actually receive —meaningful help. Here are 12 of their best strategies for asking family, friends, co-workers, and even your partner to lend a hand.

1. Clarify what you need - 
Real talk: Amidst the stressors of the parenthood transition, we’re not always thinking with perfect clarity. Running on fumes and up to your ears in dirty onesies, you may feel shadowed by a vague cloud of to-dos. In order to get the most useful assistance, first try cutting through the chaos with a simple writing activity.

“A bullet list or journal can be an effective way to suss out what’s really going on in your mind,” says licensed clinical psychologist Dr. Anna Hiatt Nicholaides. “Once you have identified your need, you can think about how to communicate it.” Make a list of everything that feels overwhelming, then sort it into categories of highest to lowest priority.

2. Keep your to-do list handy
Keeping a physical list on hand won’t just help you sort through your thoughts, it’ll give direction for others.
