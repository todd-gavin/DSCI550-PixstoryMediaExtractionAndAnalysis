New Jersey is one of the most loveliest and exciting state of USA. The state is a famous vacation place because of its long and beautiful coastline. Also, fun fact: this state has a penchant for producing musical prodigies. Jon Bon Jovi, Bruce Springsteen, and  Frank Sinatra are from New Jersey.

The Delaware Indians were the first people to live on what is now known as New Jersey. They have lived here for at least 10,000 years. When the first Europeans arrived, the area was home to anything from 8,000 to 20,000 Delaware Indians. "Original people" or "genuine people" is the meaning of their name. They spoke a dialect of Algonquian. 

Despite their status as a single tribe, the Delaware Indians did not behave as a cohesive one. They instead lived in small communities made up primarily of extended family members. During the day, the guys would go hunting or fishing. They might go clamming off the Jersey shore or hunting in the woods, depending on the season. The women were tasked with tending to the gardens. Squash, beans, sweet potatoes, and corn were among the crops they grew. 

When the first explorers came, the Delaware Indians lived in parts of Delaware, New Jersey, and eastern Pennsylvania. Europeans called them the Delaware Indians.

Because of its location at the heart of the thirteen colonies and between New York City and Philadelphia, New Jersey was an important state during the Revolutionary War. As a result, there were more battles in New Jersey than in any other state. Here, the Americans and the British fought a total of 100 fights, both major and little.
