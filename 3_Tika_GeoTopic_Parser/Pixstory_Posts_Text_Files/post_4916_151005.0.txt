Have you been to Delhi's beautiful Agrasen Ki Baoli ? The stepwell right in the heart of Delhi, at a stone's throw away from India Gate. 
If not, now is the right time to go. After several years, the stepwell has good enough water. Thanks much to the bountiful rains that Delhi NCR received. 
Else, for almost two decades, the stepwell has been without water. Even in monsoon times. 
A wonderful piece of architecture, the stepwell is an embodiment of the fact that our ancestors knew engineering, hydrology, geology,Â  architecture, aesthetics, all that many believe is a modern construct.
It is on Haily lane, Hailry Road, off KG Marg near Connaught Place in Delhi.
