In the last few days we&#39;ve had black elders killed in a supermarket in Buffalo Asian worshipers killed in Southern California now we have children killed at school When are we going to do anything I&#39;m tired I&#39;m so tired to get up from here and extend condolences to the devastated families out there I&#39;m tired of the moments of silence Enough Kerr whose military father was killed in Lebanon later sharply accused US senators who defend the gun lobby There are senators right now who they refuse to vote on the background check rule that the House passed a couple of years ago there for two years There is one reason why they wont vote on it to hold power I ask you Mitch McConnell to all you senators who refuse to do anything for the violence the school shootings in the supermarkets I ask you put your lust for power before the lives of our children and our elders Because that&#39;s how it seems I&#39;m sick of it I&#39;ve had enough
