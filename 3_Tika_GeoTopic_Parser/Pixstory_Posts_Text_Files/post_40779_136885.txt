The western turkey shooting draws old and young some lean on their rifles some sit on logs Out from the crowd steps the marksman takes his position levels his piece The groups of newly come immigrants cover the wharf or levee As the woolly pates hoe in the sugar field the overseer views them from his saddle The bugle calls in the ball room the gentlemen run for their partners the dancers bow to each other The youth lies awake in the cedar roof d garret and harks to the musical rain The Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the Huron The squaw wrapt in her yellow hemm d cloth is offering moccasins and bead bags for sale The connoisseur peers along the exhibition gallery with half shut eyes bent sideways As the deck hands make fast the steamboat the plank is thrown for the shore going passengers The young sister holds out the skein while the elder sister winds it off in a ball and stops now and then for the knots The one year wife is recovering and happy having a week ago borne her first child The clean hair d Yankee girl works with her sewing machine or in the factory or mill The paving man leans on his two handed rammer the reporter s lead flies swiftly over the note book the sign painter is lettering with blue and gold The canal boy trots on the tow path the book keeper counts at his desk the shoemaker waxes his thread Walt Whitman
