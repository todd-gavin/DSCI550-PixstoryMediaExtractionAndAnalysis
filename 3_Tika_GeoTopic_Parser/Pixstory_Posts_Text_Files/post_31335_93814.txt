I returned last week from a mission to Ukraine In my years as an aid worker I have rarely seen so much damage done in such a short time In Ukraine, children, families and communities are under attack Of the millions of children estimated to have remained in their homes almost half may be at risk of not getting enough food Attacks on water system infrastructure and power outages have left an estimated million people without access to water in Ukraine Millions more have only limited access The situation is even worse in the city such as Mariupol and Kherson where children and their families have been left for weeks without running water and sanitation regular supply of food and medical care They take refuge in their homes and underground waiting for the bombings and violence to subside On April OHCHR verified children killed and injured We know these numbers are likely to be much higher many of them caused by crossfire or the use of explosive weapons in populated areas All the systems that help children survive are also under attack Hostilities have damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes residential buildings Attacks on hospitals, health facilities and medical equipment and the killing and injury of health personnel are making it even more difficult to access emergency care, basic health care and medicines Hundreds of schools and educational facilities have been attacked or used for military purposes Others serve as civilian shelters Closing schools across the nation is impacting the learning and future of millions of school-age children and millions of students in higher education In the Donbas region An entire generation of children has already seen their lives and education disrupted during the past eight years of conflict Statement by Manuel Fontaine UNICEF Director of Programs
