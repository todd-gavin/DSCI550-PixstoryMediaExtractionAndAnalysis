Jujutsu kaisen showed us that Gojo is the most powerful sorcerer in this series. He can kill thousands of demon without breaking any sweat.

He have infinite times cursed energy make him super powerful. Other than that his speed, durability, curse and energy manipulation.

His 'limitless' ability which come from his family. it gives him the access of space and time. he can create and manipulate it on atomic level own style.

He has 5 things in limitless ability
1. infinity
2. cursed technique lapse:
blue
3. cursed technic reveresal:
red
4. purple
5. hollow

In Infinity he create a unbreakable shield around him all time and he combined cursed blue and red power & create limitless, it looks like purple and we saw it on anime episode 20.

It destroys everything and it has the power to destroy any cursed energy that crazy strong it is. I think sukuna will try to avoid that attack.

Gojo have one more incredible power Six eyes. This eyes gives him the power of instant teleportation, sense the arround, curse energy level check and instant heal.

Now he uses that ability and create his own domain expansion technique. Nobody can escape from his domain expansion.
