Koreans love their alcohol, so much so that they’ve beaten out every other Asian nation in the drinking scene. Based on a 2017 study conducted by the World Health Organization, South Koreans over the age of 15 drink an average of 10.9 litres of alcohol in a year. They celebrate almost every holiday with soju, which is their local fermented rice drink that has 19% alcohol content. 

Sometimes though, they enjoy it a little too much.  Luckily, Korean restaurants are well prepared for overindulgent drinkers and offer what Koreans call haejangguk — a special soup that helps beat the hangover!
