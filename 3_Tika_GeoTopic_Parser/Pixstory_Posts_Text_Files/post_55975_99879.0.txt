‌As part of the investigation on lockdown breaches by British gov officials. Dozens of fines have been issued. After reviewing several parties during lockdown the number has become ver 100. Already 50 fines were given to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, his wife, Carrie, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak. Johnson, who paid the fine, is the first British premier found to have broken the law while in office.

Identities of those fined were not released by police. The partygate has been a trouble for the British government as it affected the local elections too. Police are continuing to investigate other gatherings too. 

Meanwhile, some politicians have said that they would resign and pointed out that Boris Johnson, the PM is chill. Johnson rebuffed calls to resign after he was fined for attending a birthday party in his honour at Downing Street, allegedly organized by his wife.

In an interview last week, Johnson said that he was an “honest” politician who had “inadvertently” misled Parliament when he said that “the guidance and the rules” on parties at Downing Street “were followed at all times.”

As an individual, I think if the citizens could obey all the protocols of the pandemic then why are politicians gathering and breaching them. Isn't this misusing the privilege and power they are entitled to. Hence fines and punishments should be given to each and everyone who breached the laws.
