In the second Test match against Australia in Galle, Dinesh Chandimal batted with finesse and bravery to enable Sri Lanka reach a massive total of 554.

 The middle-order player continued to bat undefeated at 206 and therefore made history by being the first Sri Lankan player to make a double century in a Test match against Australia. In a Test in Hobart in November 2007, Lankan legend Kumar Sangakkara set the previous record with 192 runs. He surpassed it.


Sri Lanka now has a chance to win the second Test match and tie the two-match series 1-1 thanks to Chandimal's heroics. The bowlers have also handed the hosts a strong start in the Australian second innings, returning players like David Warner, Usman Khawaja, and Steve Smith with fewer than 80 runs on the scoreboard, giving the hosts a commanding 190-run lead.
