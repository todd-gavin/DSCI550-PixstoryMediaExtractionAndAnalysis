Just finished watching the FIFA World Cup 2022 final draw and after watching the draw, one thing is sure that there are few groups in which football fans can expect fireworks and in other groups there are teams who will qualify in Round of 16 very easily until and unless an underdog team upset the stronger team.

In total, there are eight groups of four teams and each team will play one match with remaining three teams and top two teams will qualify for round of 16.

So letâ€™s discuss about all the groups in brief:-

Group A - This group includes Qatar, Netherlands, Senegal, and Ecuador. In this group, Netherlands will top the group and fight for the second place will be very tight.

Group B - This group includes England, USA, Iran, and winner of European play off which will be decided in June when Scotland will play against Ukraine then winner of this match will play against Wales.

Group C - This group includes Argentina, Mexico, Poland, and Saudi Arabia. In this group team which will fight for top 2 spots are Argentina, Poland and Mexico.

Group D - This group includes France, Denmark, Tunisia, and winner of IC playoff 1 which will be decided in June when Australia will play against UAE and winner of this match will play against Peru.

Group E - This group includes Spain, Germany, Japan, and winner of IC playoff 2 which will be decided when New Zealand will play against Costa Rica in June.

Group F - This group includes Belgium, Croatia, Morocco, and Canada. I think in this group Brazil and Croatia will qualify very easily.

Group G - This group includes Brazil, Switzerland, Serbia and Cameroon. Brazil are clear cut winner of this group. Fight for second sport will be very tight.

Group H - This group includes Portugal, Uruguay, Korean Republic, and Ghana. Top two team in this group will be Portugal and Uruguay until and unless other two teams do the upset.

Lastly, I hope may the best team wins the tournament.
