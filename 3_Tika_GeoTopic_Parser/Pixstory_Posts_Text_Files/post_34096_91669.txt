A few months after the last time, the president of Paris Saint Germain Nasser Al Khela fi returned to talk about Superlega We received the invitation to join the project as one of the founding clubs but as soon as I refused they started saying that PSG was not never been considered for the Superleague The problem of founding clubs that are not financially stable They don&#39;t have a long-term vision They keep talking about legal contracts when in reality they forget that football is a social contract Now it&#39;s only the clubs that continue talking about Superleague but they know there is no chance of success People are continuing to die in Ukraine they have no place to sleep and we are fighting for Superleague Florentino P rez asked me to speak during the round of 16 against Real Madrid We need to find a way to discuss just you and me I&#39;d be happy to listen to him but I don&#39;t care if he&#39;s going to keep doing things behind my back
