Phone Bhoot’ have already been teasing the audience with new posters and glimpses of the film. 💯The  makers have unveiled the trailer of ‘Phone Booth’ and it looks like a whacky horror-comedy. Katrina Kaif, Siddhant Chaturvedi, and Ishaan have also been keeping their fans hooked with their quirkiness and unlimited fun in the trailer 🔥💯Be it Katrina Kaif playing the role of a ghost for the first time in the film or the fact that it's a horror comedy  is on a mission to get along with Ishaan Khatter and Siddhant Chaturvedi, who seem to be the desi version of Ghostbusters. 🔥Katrina wants the two to take down Jackie Shroff or ‘Aatma Ram’ as he’s called, and the trailer depicts how the trio plans to do so. From slapstick comedy, item songs, and a female ghost to some foot-tapping music and a dig at poor Hindi, the film looks super interesting.Kaif shared a video on her Instagram account with the comment “Hey. Where do you think you are going? @ishaankhattar @siddhantchaturvedi. Still 3 days to go for #PhoneBhootTrailer.”🔥
