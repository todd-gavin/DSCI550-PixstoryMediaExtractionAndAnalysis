Swipe to see some really pretty pictures I love all things art and all things nature This artistic cafe tucked away in a quiet green corner in Koramangala is walking distance from Christ University The Dyu Art Cafe is quite popular because of its ambience and the delicious food that they offer The place is almost always crowded sometimes even on the weekdays and you ll wait for awhile to get a table The wait is worth it and I don t mind waiting at the waiting lounge which doubles as a gallery for beautiful paintings The cafe itself is built in a Kerala Portugese style architecture with an open house setting nestled between shady green trees The cafe s vision is to make art meet food and it serves as a great place for gatherings with friends family and colleagues If you just want to unwind from your daily routine and the city life for a short time this place would be perfect for you There are many such cafes and restaurants around Bangalore But this cafe is not quite far from my university so I tend to frequent this place once a month or so with friends and family What s your go to place near your university and why
