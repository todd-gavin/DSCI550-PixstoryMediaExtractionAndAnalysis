Let’s meet the man who took the initiative to start a club that aims to shape the future of hundreds of children.

Muthok Khongmawloh hails from a little green village called PungWeikyian, situated in Meghalaya, which is in the North East part of India. Mr Muthok started young as a football player and took coaching in fourth grade when he carefully observed the game and its techniques. However, he could not sustain the practice due to a lack of proper support in the sports field. According to him, you need to be a professional with appropriate guidance to get into a club. There was no one to guide him when he was a child.

Mr Muthok realised that there was a lack of opportunities for the people in his village and took the initiative to start something that would support young children of all ages and genders to engage in sports actively. He started small with a few players and taught them whatever he had learned in the past.

Mr Muthok had to pause his efforts for a while and handed over the leadership to trusted club members while travelling to other places to explore. He is grateful to the founder of Swaraj University, Rajasthan, whose words about football initiating unity inspired him to expand his community efforts through football. He started realising that he could transform his village for the better by interacting with its youngest members. He continues to diligently dedicate time and effort toward Pyrshang Da Lade Alternative Learning Centre and the Little Star football club.

“I experienced the lack of a guide when I was young. So, as a mentor, I want to be there for the children now and give them the opportunities I never got. I want them to become independent, so they can follow their dreams of becoming professional football players and possibly make a livelihood from what they are most passionate about.”
