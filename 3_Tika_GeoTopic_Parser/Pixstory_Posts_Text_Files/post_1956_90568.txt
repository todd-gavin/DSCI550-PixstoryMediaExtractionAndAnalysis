As the glitterati gasp over a Smith Rock slap in the face the real world and the real America needs to remember that Pres Biden last week called for the effective removal and regime change of Russia s president That was historic And a clear foreign policy gaffe of the highest order No amount of White House spin can ameliorate such a high level and high stakes blunder Personally I think Putin should go The world would be a better place But the US can do nothing about such wishful thinking So why should it s leader say such silly things I m more worried about the thinking inside his circle If we want to end the war in Ukraine diplomats need to find a solution and that involves Putin whether we like it or not
