Are You A Liar For the Finals we had a viva in every department In ophthalmology we had to face the redoubtable Head Dr L P Agarwal a highly respected teacher renowned for planning the world s first ever blindness control program He also enjoyed tormenting his students Dressed nattily you were called a dandy If you looked shabby you were a crypto communist He had authored the recommended ophthalmology textbook you were obliged to buy If you bought one from him you d be rewarded with a personally signed copy Occasionally he would walk the classroom and flip the pages of the copy on your desk to check if it was his signed version or one you may have bought in a Daryaganj shop You see the personally signed one also came at an enhanced price For the ophthalmology Finals we set out to examine patients lined up for us Dr Agarwal and the external examiner would then question us on our diagnosis and prognosis playing to a gallery of ophthalmology faculty who stood in attendance whenever Dr Agarwal held sway He asked a couple of related questions to each student and sent them packing with a jibe or a nod When my turn came he sized me up and down and shot out Are you a liar or an honest person I was thrown off and mumbled I don t know The spectators bristled sensing a kill He again asked the same thing and I again responded as before This went on back and forth a number of times to my growing irritation and perplexity When he saw me digging in my heels and not rising to the bait he changed course and asked What do you want to specialize in Without missing a beat I shot back Not ophthalmology I got through that exam but till today wonder what triggered that mind game Folks told me later you should ve said you ve not yet decided why say something like that I guess that day a trait came to the fore push me to the edge and I boomerang with no filters As told to Priya Sarkar wife
