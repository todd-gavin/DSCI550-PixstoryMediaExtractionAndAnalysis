5. Ole gunnar Solskjaer
Solskjaer was a goal-scoring legend for Manchester United, and if you gave him space in the box, he would punish you with his quick feet, earning him the moniker "baby-faced assassin" in front of goal. Except for a few games, he was present in every game and made over 30 appearances for United.
The former United manager was the life blood of the forward line, and his ability to finish from tight angles set him apart from other players. In 366 games for Manchester United, Solskjaer assisted on 126 goals.
4. Dimitar Berbatov
He was a sumptuous player for the club as a goal scoring perfectionist with a finesse for best goal-scoring. With his sensational finishing and pure arrogance on the field, he made scoring goals look easy. Berbatov was not always clinical in front of goal, but his presence on the field provided United with hope and determination to overcome vulnerability.
However, he consistently scored in the double digits, forged a great relationship with Ronaldo and Rooney in the forward line, and they had great chemistry. Dimitar Berbatov scored 56 goals in 149 appearances.
3. Ruud Van Nistelrooy
His willingness to score goals distinguished him as a prestigious member of United's squad and the most ferocious striker United ever had. His nose for goal is unrivalled, and his goals speak volumes about the Dutchman. United didn't have to worry about goals because Nisterlrooy was the club's most reputable striker, having won every major trophy with the club before leaving in search of the Champions League. Van Nisterlrooy played 219 games, scored 150 goals, and won the Premier League.
