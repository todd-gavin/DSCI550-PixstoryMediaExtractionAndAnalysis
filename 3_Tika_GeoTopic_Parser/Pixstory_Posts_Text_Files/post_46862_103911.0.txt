Jeannette Rankin is the first woman member of the U.S. Congress. She was a feminist as well as a pacifist. 

She was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican from Montana in 1916, and again in 1940.

As a lifelong pacifist, she was one of 50 House members who rejected the declaration of war on Germany in 1917.

 In 1941, she was the only member of Congress to vote against the declaration of war on Japan following the attack on Pearl Harbor.

While in Congress, she initiated legislation that ultimately became the 19th Constitutional Amendment, granting unrestricted voting rights to women nationwide.

She linked the suffrage movement to pacifism. She believed, as did many suffragists of the period, that the corruption and dysfunction of the United States government arose from the lack of women's participation. 

At a disarmament conference during the interwar period, she said, "The peace problem is a woman's problem.

Later in her life, Rankin travelled the world, frequently visiting India, where she studied the pacifist teachings of Mahatma Gandhi. 

Although her legacy rests almost completely on her pacifism, Rankin told the Montana Constitutional Convention in 1972 that she would have preferred otherwise. "If I am remembered for no other act", she said, "I want to be remembered as the only woman who ever voted to give women the right to vote."

Yes and many say have come so far but let me remind you as of 2022, Rankin is still the only woman ever elected to Congress from Montana!
