What a game of cricket this one was, just brilliant. It was end to end stuff. Punjab Kings were batting first, Mayank Agarwal fell for 5 runs, Dhawan managed to score 35 runs. It was Liam Livingstone's 64 runs that gave their innings a stong back bone, he hit 7 fours and 4 sixes. Sharma, Chahar and Shahrukh chipped in to take the total to 189. Only Rashid Khan of Gujrat Titans bowled well, he took 3 wickets giving away only 22 runs.

Wade fell too early, but it was Shubman Gill's night, he played a magnificent knock of 90 from 59 balls, he hit 11 boundaries and 1 six. He played the cut and pull shots superbly as always, he slowed down towards the end and fell to a slower by Rabada. Sudarshan also played a handy knock. Even Pandya chipped in a few runs. A collapse during the end of the innings saw the game almost go away from Gujarat. 12 runs were required from the last 2 balls and Rahul Tewatia did it again, he hit two sixes and gave GT the win. This was IPL at its best.
