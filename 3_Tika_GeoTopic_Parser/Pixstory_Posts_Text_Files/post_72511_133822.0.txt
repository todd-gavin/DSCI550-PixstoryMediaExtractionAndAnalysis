Noida: Supertech twin towers ahead of their demolition with explosives in compliance with a Supreme Court order, in Noida, Saturday, Aug. 27, 2022. Over 3,700 kg explosives will be used to raze down the nearly 100-metre-tall structures on Aug. 28. 

The Supertech Twin Towers in Noida, also deemed as the India's tallest building Noida Twin Towers, will be demolished on 28 August, Sunday following a directive from the Supreme Court of India. 

The start
Noida-based Developmental company Supterch Limited launched the construction of the project known as Emerald Court.  The project was started in the mid 2000s. The project included the building of 3, 4 and 5 BHK flats. 
The project was located off the expresssway that connects the twin cities of Noida and Greater Noida. 

Change of plans
The probems started after Supertech changed the plans, which by 2012, was a complex of 15 buildings instead of 14. Each building was now supposed to have 11 stories instead of nine. The changed plan also included two more towers that would rise to 40 floors above the ground. The latter two became the heart of the decade long legal battle between the residents and Supertech. 

But After much back and forth on both ends, the Supreme Court of India in 2021, ordered the demolition of the Noida Twin Towers citing the fact that the towers were constructed illegally. 

The demolition 
It will take place today,  The company will employ a technique called implosion. More than 3,700 kgs of explosives will be placed inside holes drilled in specific parts of the building structure that supports Ceyane and Apex. The detonation will take place from the ground up .

The demolition of the Emerald Court project in Noida is leading to a loss of about Rs 1,000 crore to developer Supertech. The twin towers (namely Apex and Ceyane) are located at Sector 93A in Noida. One of the buildings has an altitude of 103 metres, while another is around 97-metre tall.
