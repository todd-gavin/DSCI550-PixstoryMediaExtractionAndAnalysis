Afghans that fled to the West during this period were middle-class urban educated Afghans that felt themselves forced to flee because of the alien and repressive Taliban measures that posed security concerns, as well as the lack of livelihood and education opportunities. A number of them had been employed by international NGOs. In addition, ethnic and religious minorities, particularly Shiite Hazara and Ismaelis, persecuted by the Taleban sought their way out of Afghanistan. The latter were assisted by their richer co-religionists in Pakistan and by organisations of their wealthy religious leader, the Aga Khan.
