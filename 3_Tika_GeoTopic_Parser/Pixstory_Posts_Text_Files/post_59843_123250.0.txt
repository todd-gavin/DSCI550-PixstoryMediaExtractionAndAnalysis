With RCP Singh's apparent closeness to the BJP serving as the final straw, JDU has charged that the BJP is attempting to split the party.

Nitish Kumar, the chief minister of Bihar, has called a conference of all Janata Dal (United) MLAs and MPs for Tuesday, fueling rumours that his growing hatred toward the BJP may reach a boiling point.

Nitish, according to sources close to him, is unhappy with the manner the Bihar BJP leadership attacked him while the national party leadership did nothing.

RCP Singh was allegedly refused a position in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet last year after Kumar's party denied him another Rajya Sabha seat. Following inquiries from the party on properties connected to his family, Kumar and Singh left.

The Janata Dal (United) is set to shortly declare its break with alliance partner Bharatiya Janata Party, putting the coalition government in Bihar in danger of dissolving. According to sources, the JDU is preparing to establish a different government.

Along with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), the Left Front, and the Congress, the Nitish Kumar-led JDU plans to form an alternative administration.

Due to the lack of support for midterm elections among most MLAs, an alternative alliance is being put together.

The former Indian Administrative Service officer and former JD national president Singh said that there was a plot against him since he was about to become an union minister . When he was leaving the JDU yesterday, he said, "I'll just say that there's no solution to jealousy." He referred to the JDU as a sinking ship and asserted, "Nitish Kumar would not become Prime Minister in any of his seven lives."
