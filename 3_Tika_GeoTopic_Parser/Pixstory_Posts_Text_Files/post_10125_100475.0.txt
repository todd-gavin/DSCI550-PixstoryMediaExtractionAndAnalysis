"There is really something about empty highways, and twenty-four hours convenience stores that always make me wonderâ€” could it really be possible to stay empty until something or someone comes into our lives without even knocking and yet still have the temerity to leave us afterward, without a damn single word except for left behind footprints, perfume that stayed for a couple of seconds, and a short memory of them staying for a while.

Or could it really be possible to stay empty and be loaded with feelings just to be emptied again?"
