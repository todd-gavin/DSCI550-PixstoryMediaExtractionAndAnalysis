A number of Afghans gathered in front of the Oxford Association to protest Hamdullah Mohib's speech

A number of Afghan and non-Afghan protesters gathered in front of the Oxford Association and chanted slogans against former national security adviser Ashraf Ghani.

Criticizing the association, they said the former official, who overthrew the Afghan government, should not be given a chance to speak.

After the Oxford Association announced that Hamadullah Moheb would deliver a speech there on May 11, more than 11,000 people signed an online petition calling on the association's officials to cancel the speech.

They said Mohib, along with other Afghan officials, including the former president, "fled Afghanistan in shame and paved the way for the return of a ruthless and well-known terrorist group to power."

In response to the protests, Oxford Association officials said they would not cancel the meeting on the basis of freedom of expression and would give anyone a chance to express their views.

The Oxford Debate Association is a well-known intellectual and academic association in Oxford, UK, which invites dignitaries and dignitaries to speak and participate in the forum.

The list of speakers includes prominent figures such as Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, former US presidents.
