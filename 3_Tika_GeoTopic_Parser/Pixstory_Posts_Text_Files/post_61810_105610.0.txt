Golden State Warriors have been very consistent this season. They have had an incredible setting. 

Warriors have equalled the score in the 7 game series of the NBA championship. They made some mistakes in Game 1, which cost them dearly towards the dying minutes of the game, as Celtics tore them apart in the last quarter. 

But Warriors pulled it back in the second game with technical masterclass as they executed their plans perfectly, made sure that the team was not slacking in the defence and did not let the opposition create any opportunities from where they could've dominated the control. 

Warriors are definitely the favorites to win the championship, because they have the skills and talent with them. Not only that, they also have the difference makers, the players who will go the extra mile to secure victory for their team. Something that Celtics solely lacks. 

Warriors' Curry leads from the front as he has dominated the matches with his scoring!! He has consistently scored in both the games and he has achieved all of this more. 

Curry is firing on all cylinders, sadly the same cannot be said for Celtics, as there match winners are not willing for put in the effort or the drive that a championship games need
