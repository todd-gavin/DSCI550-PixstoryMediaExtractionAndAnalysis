Who doesn’t love a mean Aussie burger which has the “lot”. I don’t know about you but I firmly believe that Australia has the best burgers all over the world! It is not boring like the burgers of USA but have an unique edge and taste to it! But what makes a Aussie burger what is it?

Well, according to Gourmet Traveler, first comes the bun. The traditional bun of choice is white, soft and mushy, and maybe slightly crusty. It will always become stained with the vibrant juice from beets. You might substitute a brioche bun, as seen above, to elevate the burger. 

Second ingredient is the soul: meat patty. It is straightforward: minced beef may be mixed with sliced onion and bound with an egg. Even if it's a little bit dry, well-done is the key; this is where the sauce, beetroot, and pineapple come into play. 

Don’t forget the cheese as a pre-cut slice of cheddar that has been melted over the burger while it is still on the grill is required. 

Then comes the sauces! The great Australian debate is between barbecue and tomatoes. Here, barbecue is more popular because it is sweeter, yet tomato sauce is also a good choice. 

And finally the uniqueness which you cannot find anywhere else in the world! A burger must have beetroot, an egg, pineapple, and bacon to be considered to have "the lot." The beets and pineapple should be eaten right from the tin, and the egg should be fried and runny. Red onion, iceberg lettuce, and tomatoes could be used, but they aren't necessarily necessary.
