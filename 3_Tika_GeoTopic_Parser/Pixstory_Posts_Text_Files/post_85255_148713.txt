Nottingham Forest achieved promotion into the Premier League by winning the playoffs last season in the Championship and has made a slow start to life in the Premier League They currently sit in the th position and have lost five games out of seven It is of course still early days and Forest will hope they can turn around their form and accumulate enough points to stay in the league They are one of the favorites to go down this season as they did not necessarily dominate last season in the Championship as they were promoted via the playoffs routes This cannot be discredited however and they deserve praise for their sensational run in the playoffs We will look at the SWOT of their squad in this article Strengths Forest must be given credit for their ambitious approach in the transfer window this summer as they acquired notable names to improve their squad The likes of Dean Henderson Jesse Lingard Emmanuel Dennis and Lodis dos Santos are established players who add massive quality to the side Henderson has been a big positive to the side and has impressed with his performances The goalkeeper is on a mission to prove his critics wrong especially his parent club Manchester United and this will only benefit Forest s quest in the league Lingardadds an element of quality higher up in the pitch and with Dennis running in behind Forest can be a massive threat on the counterattack in games This must be an approach that the team should look to implement as they possess the quality to cause problems for other teams Weaknesses While we have praised the club s ambitious approach to the transfer window this summer it must also be said that it will take time for these players to gel and perform consistently as a team This happens naturally when a team makes multiple signings in the summer but Forrest requires these players to have an instant impact and it seems that this was the expectation
