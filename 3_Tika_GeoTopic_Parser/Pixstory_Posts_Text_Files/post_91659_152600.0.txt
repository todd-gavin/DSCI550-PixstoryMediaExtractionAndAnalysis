It is fascinating when we look at how KPI = Key Performance Indicators are actually becoming counter productive in a longer run as the leaders are on a race to show their own performance and on the way stepping on someone and everyone's emotions and dreams without helping them on the way.  
Instead I believe that KPI should be measured on how these leaders have:
Kept their team Inspired ( Keep people Inspired)
Kept their team Informed ( Keep people Informed)
Kept their team involved  ( Keep people Involved)
Kept their team Interested ( Keep people Interested)
Human Resources Management is an integral part of any company, HR leaders need to be more strategic but unfortunately you can only find very few HR leaders who looks at KPI as the later which I have indicated. 
I would rather urge the company leadership that they should choose their HR leader wisely so that these leaders can value inclusiveness and empathy. Inclusion is the result of a culture that has empathy as the foundation and they both are invisible. Human resource  management can have a significant impact on emplyee performance, increased level of stress and the growth of counterproductive behaviours. You will agree with me that the behavior of the organization is not considered seperate from the behaviour of the employees and these behavior can threaten the social status and social responsibilties of the organization. 
So you decide which KPI you would like your company to follow.
