As Western nations look for ways to reduce their reliance on Russian oil and gas another aspect of the Ukraine crisis has received less attention Most of the countries that use nuclear power rely on Russia for some part of their nuclear fuel supply chain Nuclear power is a critical part of many national electricity grids European countries especially rely on nuclear power including France where it produces of the nation s electricity supply Ukraine Hungary Finland and Sweden In the U S nuclear reactors generate of the nation s power Many of these countries originally embraced nuclear power to minimize dependence on imported fossil fuels and more recently to reduce carbon emissions and improve air quality Economic fallout from the war in Ukraine could disrupt access to fuel for the nuclear power industry We believe that countering Russia s influence will require concerted efforts that balance energy security climate mitigation and a commitment to international law A global industry Around the world countries operate about commercial nuclear power reactors that generate of the world s electricity supply The U S has the most operating reactors followed by France and China Many nations export nuclear fuel materials and services The leading international suppliers are the U S Russia Europe and China Several other countries play important roles including Canada and South Korea Producing nuclear fuel involves five steps Raw uranium ore which usually contains less then uranium is mined from the ground The ore is milled to separate the uranium from other materials yielding a powder called yellowcake Yellowcake is chemically converted to gaseous uranium hexafluoride Uranium hexafluoride is processed to increase its concentration of uranium which can be split in reactors to produce large quantities of energy U only makes up of natural uranium enrichment for commercial reactor fuel increases its concentration usually up to Enriched uranium is fabricated into fuel rods for reactors Full story at The Conversation Image courtesy
