Sun exposure, dirt and pollution around can adversely affect your skin, leading to an array of issues like acne, sunburn, tanning and more. While you must unfailingly add an effective sunscreen to your summer skincare regime, you can also resort to homemade facemasks for that added pampering to your skin.

Here are 4 face-masks you can make at home to get that glowing skin this summer:

1.HONEY, CURD AND ROSEWATER
Mix one spoon of honey, water and rose water in a bowl. Apply evenly on your face and leave it on for around 15 minutes. Finally, wash it off with water. You’ll see an instant glow on your face. It is best suited for dry skin. People with oily skin, however, can avoid or use a little less amount of honey while making this face pack.

2.TOMATO, CURD AND LEMON
Grate a tomato and add a bit of curd and a few lemon drops to it. Mix it all and apply on your face. Massage in a circular motion for a minute or two. Leave the mask on your face for another 10 minutes, and then wash with water. It is one of the best and utterly rejuvenating face masks during summers.

3.OATS AND ALMONDS
Soak around 10 almonds overnight and grind them into a paste. Mix it with one spoon of oats and a bit of curd. Add half a spoon of honey or rose water as per your skin type (honey for dry skin and rose water for oily skin), and give all the ingredients a good mix. Apply the pack to your face and massage gently in a circular motion. Finally, wash it off with water after 10 minutes.

4.CUCUMBER AND HONEY
You just need to grate a cucumber and then add some honey to it. Apply on your face and wash it after 10 minutes. That’s it
