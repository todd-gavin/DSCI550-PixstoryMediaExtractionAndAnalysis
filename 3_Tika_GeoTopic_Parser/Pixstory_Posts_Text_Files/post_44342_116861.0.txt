Malian midfielder Cheick Doucoure, who was recently signed by Premier League side Crystal Palace has been subject to a lot of controversies lately. His lawyer has come out in public to announce that he and his client are being blackmailed by a group of people regarding the events of his transfer to the Eagles. 

Crystal Palace completed the signing of the 22-year-old midfielder from Lens for €22.5 Million (plus a €5 Million bonus) just a few days ago. His lawyer Alexis Rutman has claimed that he and his client are being blackmailed by the ‘middlemen’ involved in the transfer to recover a huge amount of money. 

Rutman has claimed that the middlemen are saying that they would present false evidence proving Doucoure’s alleged dual nationality of their ransom demands are not met. 

In a statement released by the lawyer, he said that they are "victims of blackmail and an attempt to extort funds from several individuals acting in concert (a player's agent and a photographer, supported by a journalist), obviously baited by the profits supposedly generated by this transaction". Both Malian Football Federation and Crystal Palace are supporting Doucoure and his entourage. 

“(They) demand the payment of a sum of money in return for their silence. Several Whatsapp messages to this effect, accompanied by false documents, have been sent to my client and his entourage over the past few days. This situation is very serious and obviously unacceptable," the statement further read. 

Alexis Rutman confirmed that they will indeed be taking all the necessary legal actions on criminal and civil levels. 

Cheick Doucoure played 34 matches for Lens in Ligue 1 last season and he was one of their key players. He scored 1 goal and provided 4 assists.
