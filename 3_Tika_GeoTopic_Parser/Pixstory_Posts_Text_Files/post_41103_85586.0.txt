More than 100 Fairfield University students demonstrated earlier this week when the administration ordered a Black Lives Matter banner to be displayed inside the university's counselling centre. 

The flag was pulled down, according to the administration, since it broke the building code by not being approved by administration first and because the university has an official neutrality policy. Students who protested believe the institution would not take an official position on whether or not it supports the Black Lives Matter movement.

The demonstration occurred during a university event intended to highlight the university's commitment to diversity and inclusive excellence. 

Aliyah Seenauth, a sophomore and the student association's associate director of diversity and inclusion, was in the front row of the rally, holding the original Black Lives Matter flag that had been pulled down. Its removal, she said, was a "complete slap in the face." 

"I was expecting something along the lines of the flag obstructing the window. The glass of the window is frosted. "I was offended," she added, noting that the decision to remove it came during Black History Month and only weeks before a school diversity event.

CT Insider reported that Fairfield University Vice President of Marketing and Communications Jennifer Anderson stated in a statement that the university encourages students to voice their viewpoints and fully supports their right to free speech.
