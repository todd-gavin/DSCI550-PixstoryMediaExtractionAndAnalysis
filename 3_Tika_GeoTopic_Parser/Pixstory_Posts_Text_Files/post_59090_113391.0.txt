Every movie should go down with some regulations. James Cameron the director needed to get Underwater CGI Right.

The main reason behind the 13-year holdup for the Avatar sequels is their long pre-production state, a result of Cameron's commitment to the special effects that set Avatar apart from other films of its time, to start up with.

The much-delayed Avatar 2 will ultimately hit theatres this December 16, 2022. 

Jake Sully and Neytiri have formed a family and are doing everything to stay together. However, they must leave their home and explore the regions of Pandora. When an ancient threat resurfaces, Jake must fight a difficult war against the humans.
