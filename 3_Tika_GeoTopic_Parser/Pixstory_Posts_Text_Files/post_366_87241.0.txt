Conservative dominated US Supreme Court has shown real inclination to curtail the hostoric Roe vs Wade judgement of 1973.

The US Supreme Court is likely to rule in June on a law enatcted by Mississippi that bans abortions to 15 weeks while Roe vs Wade allowed abortions upto 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy. Now many Republican ruled states are considering to frame a law or have already enacted that ban abortions after 15 weeks. Florida too joined the bandwagon on March 3 when its senate passed a bill banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. State's Republican governor Ron DeSantis is pro-life and will definitely sign it to a law. 

Signs were clear in December when during oral arguments on the Mississippi law, six conservative justices in their comments indicated that they might reverse Roe vs Wade. 

Doctors are fearing if Roe vs Wade falls, there will be a rise in unsafe abortions compromising health of women and also reversing the 1973 law will hit the disadvantaged communities more. 

Donald Trump can now be rest assured of a his place in the US judicial history as three of the conservative judges appointed by him will be part of dismantling a law what gave hope to millions of women in the country.
