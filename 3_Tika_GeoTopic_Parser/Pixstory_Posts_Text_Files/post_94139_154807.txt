 Contributing to the mental health field was something which I always wanted to do I was looking for organizations that work for mental health and ended up getting an internship with YWP It was a wonderful experience working with the team I was able to learn many new things related to mental health I was struggling mentally from a very young age I was not properly educated regarding mental health which made it even worse As we moved forward to the internet era I was able to learn more and heal myself slowly There is no one in my close circle that has really understood the importance of mental health I am trying my best to educate them about mental health but it is really a long way to go I was selected as the Design intern for YWP Working with YWP has helped me improve my design skills while contributing to mental health I am really grateful for the opportunity and I am really hoping to work with them in the near future as well Aishwarya years Design Intern YWP
