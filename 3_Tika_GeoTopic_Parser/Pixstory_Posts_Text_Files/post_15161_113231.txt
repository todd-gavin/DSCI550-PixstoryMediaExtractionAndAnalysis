We are ordinary women women that no one dwells on we are invisible From the pen of four exceptional crime writers the criminal world from the point of view of women You will think you are alone in a dark street in a northern suburb on a film set after shooting or even in the open sea But they see you even if you don&#39;t look at them They are borderline creatures relegated to the margins of society and forgotten by everyone They know that life can be cruel and it is precisely then that one becomes crueler than her The protagonists of these stories they are women They are mothers, daughters, murderers driven by uncontrollable passions or girls who have chosen that life of crime Aspiring rock stars subjugated by slimy producers actresses who happen to be scammers who landed from Eastern Europe in the deepest Southern Italy But also ordinary people who, when they return home in the evening, find a domineering mother waiting for them in front of the TV They were victims and then perpetrators in love and then disillusioned dreamers whose dreams they stole One thing they have in common for some time they stopped pretending And they came to terms with unmentionable feelings Because when things appear to you a flash as they are you really can&#39;t go back Prey to an unjust and oppressive system they have made crime the only way out They are the invisible ones They are the new face of crime
