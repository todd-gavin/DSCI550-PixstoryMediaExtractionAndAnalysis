Team India has reached Australia and the practice matches are underway.
India lost the practice match against Western Australia XI today despite Kl Rahul's brilliant 74 of just 55 deliveries. 
However we need not worry because they are just getting used to Australian conditions and with Kl Rahul getting in top form Team India will leave no stone unturned to win this world cup at all costs.
