Summer is the peak time for outdoor activities , family vacations , and long days in the sun . But during the summer months when the temperature is high and you’re sweating more than usual , keeping your body hydrated is very important . ✅
Let me share with you the best ways to stay hydrated with my hydration-boosting tips : 💦✅
1 Don’t wait till you’re thirsty to drink ; 
By the time you feel thirsty , you’re already slightly dehydrated . Sip water steadily throughout the day and drink more fluids than usual when the weather is hot , especially if you’re active ! 
2 Flavor your water ; 
If plain water tastes boring to you , you can add flavor with fresh fruits or a splash of fruit juice . You can also consume clear broths , ice pops or sports drinks (especially if you're doing intense exercise) . Just make sure to limit caffeine and alcohol .
3 Eat water-rich fruits and vegetables ; 
Certain fruits and vegetables contain plenty of water in addition to healthful nutrients . Watermelon ,  strawberries , cantaloupe , peaches and pineapples are fruits with high-water content . Water-rich vegetables include cucumbers , leafy greens , radishes , celery , zucchini and tomatoes !
Be sure to actively drink plenty of water to avoid becoming dehydrated ! ❤️💦
