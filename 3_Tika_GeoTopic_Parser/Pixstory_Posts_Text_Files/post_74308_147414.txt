In search of peace Wrote this almost three years ago What is this happening Somebody is killing someone is getting killed and people like us are coping up with our fears Our fear has become a stubborn foe which is consistently defying our existence Why don t they directly kill us all together How much more And for how long We are normal people unlike any kind of extreme idea hanging on the fringe All we need is peace love and food Our hungriness for love will not kill us but it will definitely make them indestructible at last again we will be left alive but in a fragile mode We need peace to breath Yes The moment is rough but the answer is peace The fear is overtaking our very new obscure strength Is there any scope for a single hope People like us don t believe in an omnipotent factor unlike others Unlike others we don t believe that all the on going disaster is for a purposeful goodwill although we do carry a moderate conviction which states that being in a disastrous journey is a sort of circumstance and we have to analyze and rectify the disastrous things How long we have been asking for freedom Freedom from self compulsion freedom to study where ever we want freedom to step out freedom from the goons who are waiting for us at the door frame of our house Uttermost freedom is the most accurate key to unlock the pathway of peace After all love and peace is all we need Now unfortunately using the term Freedom only states that how unscrupulous we are as a citizen Once a legend said The sword of revolution is sharpened on the whetting stone of ideas Now sadly he doesn t know that our hands are shuddering the pen has slithered down from our weak feeble hands and the paper has burst from our heavy tears I am writing this along with my frustration you are reading this along with your frustration and then our frustration will be left out as a laughing stock for them In search of peace
