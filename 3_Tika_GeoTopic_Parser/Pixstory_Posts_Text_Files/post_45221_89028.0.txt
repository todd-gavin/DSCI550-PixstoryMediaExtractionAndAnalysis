AC Milan star Zlatan Ibrahimovic was seen at Ferrari's Fiorano testing track. With the F1 season officially on the Sweden star player took a detour from his usual schedule at San Siro. 

Zlatanera is also working on a special venture by Ferrari with the likes of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz. It was exciting to watch the trio in the teaser clip, where Ibrahimovic was seen wearing a helmet and driving the new mid-rear-engined coupe and Sainz watching him.

While driving the Swede said, "When you buy Ibrahimovic, you buy a Ferrari,”. The star player was seen comparing his skills with the Ferrari he was driving. He was later seen claiming, “They call me a Ferrari on the pitch.” 

When you observe Zlatan’s style of play, it is apt to compare the great to a Ferrari. His agility and goal-scoring ability made him such a huge asset. 

Zlantera has had an injury driven 2021-22 season so far but in the 22 outings, the legendary player has managed to score eight goals and two assists. The Swede star has managed to help AC Milan reach the top of the table in Serie A and is going to be available for selection while playing against Bologna at San Siro after the International break.
