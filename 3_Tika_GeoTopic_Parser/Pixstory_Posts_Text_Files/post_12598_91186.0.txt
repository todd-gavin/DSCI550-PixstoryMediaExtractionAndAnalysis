We know that exercises help us in general. But little did we know that ir would subside the symptoms of depression, stated Jacob Meyer, PhD, a professor of kinesiology at Iowa State University. 

Meyer told Healthline that, “We conducted these studies to gain a better understanding of the short-term effects of exercise and how we might be able to best capitalize on them for adults with depression." 

Experts analyzed the association between depression and exercise. 

For the research, the team appointed 30 adults who have been undergoing depression episodes. 

The participants practiced intense cycling for 30 minutes and after which they filled out few electric surveys.  

By the end of all other sessions, the participants filled out a survey by the end of the entire session that's used to measure depression symptoms. 

The improvement with the exercise can be seen within 75 minutes post workout. The survey info's shows changes in three major characteristics of major depressive disorder like depressed mood state, difficulty experiencing pleasure from activities previously enjoyed (anhedonia), and decreased cognitive function.
