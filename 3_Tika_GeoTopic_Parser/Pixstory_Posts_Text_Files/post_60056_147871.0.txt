The Pakistani prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, came under fire from the government on Saturday for his anti-India tirade at the UNGA's 77th session.
Shehbaz Sharif's assertions regarding the Kashmir issue were deemed incorrect by the first secretary of the Indian Mission to the UN, Mijito Vinito, who also charged Islamabad with engaging in "cross-border terrorism."
"It is sad that the Pakistani Prime Minister picked this august assembly's podium to level unfounded accusations against India. He has done so to cover up wrongdoings in his own nation and to defend acts taken against India that are viewed as unacceptable by the international community "said Mr. Vinito.
He made a promise that the country would never offer refuge to those guilty for the 1993 Mumbai attacks, which appears to be a reference to terrorist Dawood Ibrahim.
According to Mr. Vinito, such a country wouldn't make illegitimate or unjustifiable territorial claims on its neighbours.
"In my opinion, it's time for India to hear loud and clear that both countries are well-armed. War is not necessary. No other option exists. Only by peaceful dialogue can these issues be resolved, resulting in a future world with more peace " he added
