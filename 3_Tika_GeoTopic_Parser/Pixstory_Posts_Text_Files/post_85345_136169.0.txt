Cuttputtli Review : Akshay Kumar as a real cop is refreshing in a predictable story. 
A South film remake with Akshay playing a cop, a serial killer on the prowl abducting teenage school girls and brutally murdering them, a creepy doll face with Abrasions on the face and hair ripped left in a gift box before each murder, a perverted maths teacher in school becoming the obvious suspect. A female SHO leading the case but never explained why is the way she is with her male counterparts. 
CuttputtliÂ  is set in a small hill station of Kasauli where cases of missing girls are on the rise . Police is clueless about finding any trace of these kidnapping . And right at the point Akshay Kumar who is obsessed with stories of Serial killer . Akshay Kumar is instantly drawn to this case of missing students when it reaches the police station . Here we are introduced to sargun mehta who doesn't believe in Akshay's conspiracies theories initially, but eventually gives him when he actually leads them to finding the truth. 
Cuttputtli story is quite predictable and it's the screenplay and the way the narrative unfolds that makes for an interesting watch. At places it does lose focus on and disgress to not so great subplots. But it came back on track on time.
