Although many people now don t find it ignominious to talk about menstruation but portraying it in movies and destigmatising it onscreen is rare But some movies and tv shows made it possible by depicting it not in an aberrant way but rather uniquely which is empowering In a episode of the tv show The Cosby Show when the youngest in the Huxtable family gets her first period her mom Claire decides to celebrate it as Women s Day which is a tradition of her family to celebrate family member s first period Back in those days it was very rare to bring up such an idea to impart a lesson that menstruation is not something disgraceful or louche but it should celebrate womanhood and make women feel more empowered Other movies like Blossom My Girl and Bracefree also portrayed the periods in a way that would enlighten women and make others aware of it The most recent example would be the movie Turning Red this Pixar creation undoubtedly managed to depict a period in a very subtle yet unique way when a thirteen years old character in the film Mie is hiding in the washroom and her mother Ming assumes her reluctance to leave the washroom is her first period Ming runs to bring vitamins a hot water bottle and pads and tells her daughter not to hesitate to speak about it Later she found that menstruation is not inflicting her but rather her turning into a red panda The way movie embraces menstruation and brings it into the light for children s films is unprecedented
