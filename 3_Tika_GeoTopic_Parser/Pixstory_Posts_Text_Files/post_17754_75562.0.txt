Ridley Scott next movie which he'll produce in collaboration with Apple TV+ has a title change. The movie was named 'Kitbag' at first but now it'll just be called 'Napoleon'
The name itself suggests what the movie is about. It'll chronicle the life Napoleon Bonaparte. 2021 was great for Ridley Scott as he brought two real life stories onto the screen. The Last Duel and House of Gucci. The movies gained huge critical acclaim and might win some big awards as well this award season. 

Napoleon will be about the rise of the French leader and won't only show his political and military campaign but will also show his personal life.
Oscar Winner Joaquin Phoenix will play Napoleon and Vanessa Kirby will star as Empress Josephine.
