Bandai Namco has announced that Dragon Ball: The Breakers will launch on October 13 in Japan and 14 worldwide for PC, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One. The game will be backward compatible with PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. 

Dragon Ball: The Breakers is an asymmetrical multiplayer action game, which will see one player step into the shoes of a Raider (such as Frieza or Cell), while seven others will be running around as unassuming humans as they try to escape their imprisonment. 

Three different versions of the game can now be pre ordered, including a digital-only standard edition, a Deluxe Edition that includes extra in-game items, and a Bandai Namco Store-exclusive Limited Edition bundle that adds more in-game items, as well as a 9 cm tall figurine of Cell's hatched shell. 

Bandai Namco will also be running a closed network test on August 6 and 7 on all platforms. During this session, Cell and the newly announced Frieza will be playable Raiders. Survivors can swap skins between various Dragon Ball characters, and the network test will include the player’s avatar, Oolong, and Bulma.
