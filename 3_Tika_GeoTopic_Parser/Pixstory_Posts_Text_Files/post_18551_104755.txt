Tomorrow afternoon Nadal will play in his thirtieth Grand Slam final and will try to win his th Roland Garros trophy A result that has no equal in history now, let alone if he were to win tomorrow too But the news just a few hours before the final against Ruud not this but his non-participation in Wimbledon To give the news Marca according to which Nadal after the efforts of these first few months and a foot certainly not in the best way is resting a bit to get back on his feet in view of the last Grand Slam of the year D on the other hand, grass is one of the worst terrains for his bad foot. It is no coincidence that just a few days ago he said that he doesn&#39;t know how much longer he will be able to play and above all that the quarter-final of Roland Garros could have been the last match on red clay against Djokovic Being in the final of Roland Garros incredible means a lot Nadal&#39;s words after the semifinal with Zverev I haven&#39;t trained for three months to resist the various ailments I have done everything to give myself the opportunity to be where I am to be in the final once again at Roland Garros a dream come true and worth all the sacrifices Winning for once what would it mean I&#39;d rather lose the final but have a new foot that allows me to be happier in my everyday life Winning is beautiful and fills you with joy momentary But life goes on and the most important thing I have a life ahead of me and I would like to play sports with friends when I finish my career but right now I don&#39;t know if I will be able to do it
