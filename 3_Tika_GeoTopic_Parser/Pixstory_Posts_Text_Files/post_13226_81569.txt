I remember when I was taught to pray but I still did not know how to wear a tent I have to wear hijab during prayers I was five years old when I did not wear a chador and I prayed without a chador Even my clothes were sometimes without sleeves I only prayed as I wished My family is not traditional They did not have much to do with hijab and forced covering They wanted to include me in my school I wore new clothes and combed my hair but without the chador only my body covering was complete I was going to school in a chador until the hijab became mandatory in the third grade My teacher stood in front of me and told me not to wear blouse pants anymore and not to enter the classroom without a chador He beat me with a stick and beat me My hands turned blue But I did not accept it until in the fourth grade they took off the hijab again at school using violence and we went to Kabul for my midwife s wedding Even though I was small I had a strange fear I was in the alley when I saw a girl Someone said Wow what a dress what a colorful chador but one with a black hijab They took Skip the long story Today hijab is a mandatory thing and if you wear it short it is a chat and if you wear it long it is still These days wearing hijab is just the abuse of this damn hijab that has made us students stay at home Using the name of hijab women should not work They should do housework Contented By zohal Rahimi
