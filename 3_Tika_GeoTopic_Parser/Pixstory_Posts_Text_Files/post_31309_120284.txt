The circular economy to overcome the crisis that is affecting agriculture in the face of a lack of fertilizer with a consequent exponential increase in prices comes the response of the Greenway Group Greenfirm of Pordenone has long since made concrete the principles of that ecological transition which has now become a development guideline How Starting a true circular economy with a territorial character explains the president Marco Tam at the helm of the group together with Gabriele Gardisan From the cultivation of the fields to the production of biogas up to to obtain the digestate a residue from the fermentation of agricultural vegetable biomasses which has a very high agronomic value and is used in the fields in place of bedbug fertilizers. Through its plants in Bertiolo and San Daniele del Friuli, the Greenway Group manages to reach a production of about thousand tons of digestate per year which allows us to almost entirely replace the use of chemical fertilizers for the cultivation of almost hectares of land continues Tam This allows us today not to be dependent on fertilizers and the necessary raw materials such as nitrogen for the fertilizers that come from Eastern Europe and whose costs due to the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian conflict and international tensions have increased exponentially in recent months, opening a heavy crisis on the agricultural front The Greenway Group&#39;s circular supply chain starts from the fields to energy crops for the production of biomass and for the remainder to crops for human and animal use mainly soy, rapeseed and sunflower continues the president of the Greenway Group Other hectares are destined for the cultivation of vines From these grapes we obtain wine which is marketed through the Greenfirm with our brand Filare Italia All crops benefit from that digestate, an organic fertilizer with a liquid part and a solid and completely odorless fraction obtained in biogas plants. And it is from these plants that electricity is produced which makes it possible to satisfy the need for about people
