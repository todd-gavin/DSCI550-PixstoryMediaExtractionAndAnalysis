Thinking About Workout / Exercise , Sit - ups and Squats are the 2 exercises which comes in my mind ! ðŸ’ª

Earlier when I was a Kid , I thought that these 2 exercises are same ! But Noo ! I was totally Wrong ! As soon as I grew up i got to know the difference between 2 ! ðŸ¤”

I want to share with you all the difference i got to know ! ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­

Sit-ups and Squats are two different types of exercises . Their primary function it work out the muscles to make them lean and strong . The forms of the two exercises differ significantly .ðŸ’ª

âœ… Sit-ups : I start them By lying on the floor , keeping my knees bent , and the arms across the chest or hands behind the head . Without moving the hips or legs , attempt to sit up , and then lie back down . Repeat . The Sit - ups are primarily used for abdominal endurance training , as they strengthen core and abdominal muscles !

âœ… Squats : I Start them by standing upright , legs spaced out , with or without weights . The arms can be kept on the sides , raised in front of the body , or behind the head . Now , I slowly dip down to the floor and Slowly rise back up and repeat . Squats primarily trains the muscles of thigh , hips and Hamstrings ! It also Helps in Strengthen bones and ligaments ! 

Well , among the 2 Squats are My fav ! As Squats Target almost my entire Lower back ! It depends upon you body ! There is no magic Number , you can do it as much as You want ! ðŸ’ªâœ…
