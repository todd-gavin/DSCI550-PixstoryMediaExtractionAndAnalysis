He said he'd be excited if they would retell it in a different sense otherwise it would bd just plain hypocrisy.
Disney heard about Dinklage's reaction and issued a statement in response, they said that they are infact taking a different approach to the concept of the Seven Dwarfs in the story. Disney said that they are  consulting the memebers of the dwarfism community and will retell the story. They added that they were reimagining the dwarf characters from the earliest stages of development.
The Disney statement is as below:
“To avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film, we are taking a different approach with these seven characters and have been consulting with members of the dwarfism community. We look forward to sharing more as the film heads into production after a lengthy development period.”
