Birmingham City Football Club have decided to revert to their original name of Small Heath Alliance for one match to commemorate the premiere of last season of Peaky Blinders T.V. series coming out on Sunday. 
The staff is set to wear flat caps and players will walk out to 'Red Right Hand' as the Peaky Blinders belonged to Birmingham.
