Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide.

In addition to lifestyle factors like engaging in regular exercise and not smoking, diet is one of the best ways to protect your heart. That’s because inflammation, blood pressure, cholesterol, and other heart disease risk factors are affected by what you eat.

1. The Mediterranean diet 🍤

In general, the diet emphasizes whole, minimally processed foods, including whole grains, nuts, seeds, fruits, vegetables, legumes, fish, and extra virgin olive oil. It also includes moderate amounts of poultry, eggs, low fat dairy, and red wine 

2. The DASH Diet 🍽

DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension and was designed to help prevent and treat hypertension, or high blood pressure. In turn, it reduces your risk of heart disease.

3. Vegan and vegetarian diets 🥒🌱🥦🥗

Vegan and vegetarian diets are eating patterns that eliminate all meat, including poultry, red meat, and fish.

While some vegetarians include other sources of animal products, such as eggs and dairy, vegans strictly avoid all animal-derived ingredients, including dairy, eggs, bee pollen, honey, and gelatin.

4. The Flexitarian Diet 🍴

Created by dietitian Dawn Jackson Blatner, the Flexitarian Diet is an eating pattern that focuses on plant foods but allows moderate amounts of meat, fish, dairy, and other animal products. It encourages you to get most of your protein from plant foods. 

5. The TLC diet 🍴

The Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet was developed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to help reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.

It includes dietary and lifestyle recommendations to promote optimal cholesterol levels and a healthy weight.

6. Low carb diets ❌🍰

Low carb diets not only restrict your carb intake but are also typically higher in protein and/or fat than the typical Western diet. They tend to limit foods like breads, grains, pasta, potatoes, and sugary snacks and beverages.

Depending on the specific diet, carbs may be restricted to 10–40% of calories per day.
