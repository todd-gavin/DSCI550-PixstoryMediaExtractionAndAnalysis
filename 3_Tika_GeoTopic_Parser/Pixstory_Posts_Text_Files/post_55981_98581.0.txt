Meghan Markle since becoming the Duchess of Sussex had mixed opinions. She did step out from the royal duties. She had previously badly dealt with the pressures of being a royal family member and hence would not be trusted in handling politics. 

Meghan Markle did show her political ambitions from the beginning although was only a member of the monarchy for some days, she did have a voice and the power to articulate her opinions. Yet her interview with Oprah Last year has further brought down her chances in politics. Her personal problems would definitely under weigh her as politics is a dirty game and every scandal comes out to tarnish their name. During the interview, Meghan and Harry accused a member of family-not the queen or Duke of Edinburgh - of making a racist comment about their son Archie. The revelations in the interview also included Harry's admission he had become estranged from his father, the Prince of Wales, saying "I feel let down", but added that he would make it one of his priorities "to try and heal that relationship". 

At one end these could be used to point out grounded they are but politics isn't that easy they would be answerable and should be able to reveal the names and unanswered questions in the interview. They will be held answerable and hence unleashing chaos in the monarchy. Who wants utter chaos! None of the party does! Hence Meghan Markle's role in politics exists as a question mark.
