Evolutionary theories of phobias suggest that people are predisposed to fear certain things that might be dangerous. In this instance, falling from a height threatens survival. For this reason, evolutionary theorists believe that the fear of heights may be innate.
Behaviourist theories relating to phobias suggest that people develop fear through interactions with their environment. For instance:
Observation: A child who observes their parents or caregivers experiencing fear around heights may develop the same fear.
Trauma: A person who has had or witnessed someone else have a bad experience with heights may develop acrophobia.
Classical Conditioning: If a person has a bad experience, such as falling out of a tree, they may associate this experience with heights. The person then learns to associate heights with falling, making them feel scared the next time they face a similar situation.
