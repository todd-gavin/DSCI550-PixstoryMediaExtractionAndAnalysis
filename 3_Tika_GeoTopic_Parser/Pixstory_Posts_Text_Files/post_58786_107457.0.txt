During the current spike, the daily incidence jumped from 500 to over 1,000 in just seven days. In April, when the instances climbed a little after mask restrictions were repealed, it took only three days for a comparable reversal.

The number of Covid-19 instances in the city has increased dramatically in the last two days, with 1,375 cases being reported on Wednesday. According to the government's health bulletin, the positivity rate – the proportion of samples tested that returned positive, indicating the spread of the infection in the community – was 7.01 percent.

During the current spike, the daily incidence jumped from 500 to over 1,000 in just seven days. In April, when the instances climbed a little after mask restrictions were repealed, it took only three days for a comparable reversal. When the omicron variant-driven third wave hit Delhi in January, it took the same three days. Although the numbers have decreased since the April peak, they have not yet returned to the levels recorded after the third wave.

In Delhi, mask mandates are currently in effect.

The positivity rate peaked at 7.64 percent in April, when it was at its greatest. During the January spike, it was at 30.6 percent, which meant that one out of every three people tested positive for the infection. Experts believe that the current positivity percentage does not reflect the true picture because many people are now testing for the illness at home with home kits.

Along with the increase in the number of cases, the number of hospitalizations has also increased slightly, with 160 people presently being admitted, according to the bulletin. The symptoms this time are identical to those reported during the January wave, according to city doctors, with individuals taken to hospitals needing treatment for illnesses other than the viral infection.
