The BA virus a subvariant of the Omicron coronavirus variant isn t just spreading faster than its distant cousin it may also cause more severe disease and appears capable of thwarting some of the key weapons we have against Covid new research suggests New lab experiments from Japan show that BA may have features that make it as capable of causing serious illness as older variants of Covid including Delta And like Omicron it appears to largely escape the immunity created by vaccines A booster shot restores protection making illness after infection about less likely BA is also resistant to some treatments including sotrovimab the monoclonal antibody that s currently being used against Omicron The findings were posted Wednesday as a preprint study on the bioRxiv server before peer review Normally before a study is published in medical journal it is scrutinized by independent experts Preprints allow research to be shared more quickly but they are posted before that additional layer of review It might be from a human s perspective a worse virus than BA and might be able to transmit better and cause worse disease says Dr Daniel Rhoads section head of microbiology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio Rhoads reviewed the study but was not involved in the research The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is keeping a close eye on BA said its director Dr Rochelle Walensky There is no evidence that the BA lineage is more severe than the BA lineage CDC continues to monitor variants that are circulating both domestically and internationally she said Friday We will continue to monitor emerging data on disease severity in humans and findings from papers like this conducted in laboratory settings BA is highly mutated compared with the original Covid causing virus that emerged in Wuhan China It also has dozens of gene changes that are different from the original Omicron strain making it as distinct from the most recent pandemic virus as the Alpha Beta Gamma and Delta variants were from each other Read more
