Also the National Institute of Oceanography and Experimental Geophysics OGS among the organizations that participated in the compilation of the new version of the International Bathymetric Chart of the Southern Ocean IBCSO a digital database containing information on the depth of the Southern Ocean The Southern Ocean is the portion of the sea that surrounds Antarctica is a key region for many climatic and oceanographic processes and is characterized by a high biodiversity global oceanic circulation The bathymetry of the seabed also determines the areas in which mixing between cold Antarctic water and warm oceanic water occurs more easily. Knowing the bathymetry of the seabed therefore allows us to understand the mechanisms that regulate the global climate. international initiatives and projects for the collection and sharing of bathymetric data for the compilation of ever more detailed and complete charts The last in importance Seabed which sets itself the objective of mapping the seabed on a global scale within with a resolution of meters The first IBCSO map v released in represented the most comprehensive collection of bathymetric data from the Southern Ocean south of latitude S Recently the IBCSO project has joined its efforts with the Nippon Foundation and the GEBCO Seabed project releasing version v The newly published version of IBCSO has been developed thanks also to the data collected with the OGS Explora ship and includes the bathymetry of the seabed south of S, covering almost double the area of the previous IBCSO version explains Michele Rebesco, OGS researcher The new version therefore shows some transit areas in greater detail of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the areas of major ocean fronts where the different water masses meet This significantly improves the overall representation of the Southern Ocean seabed and the processes involved The IBCSO is the most authoritative and comprehensive seabed map in the area south of S specifies Rebesco
