As per The Daily Mail, Real Madrid's vice-captain Karim Benzema is concerned about the arrival of Erling Haaland. Hence the Frenchman wants to know the roadmap of the club. 

Erling Haaland is certainly a special talent. The Norwegian has proven his worth for Borussia Dortmund. Haaland has scored 80 goals in 79 appearances for the Bundesliga club hence making all the major clubs aware of his talent. 

Real Madrid are set to have taken note of this as well. Los Merengues are gearing up for a mega summer transfer window with Kylian Mbappe being one of their sought-after signings. 

Eden Hazard, Gareth Bale, Isco, and Marcelo are expected to leave the club in the summer. Hence the Spanish giants will clear up a huge chunk of their salary bill. Hence, Florentino Perez believes that they will be able to sign Haaland in the summer as well. 

But this news has not gone down well with Karim Benzema as per the report. The Frenchman feels that his place would be in threat if Real Madrid complete the signing of Erling Haaland.

Hence Benzema has asked for a meeting with the club's president Florentino Perez. As per reports, the two parties are set to meet in March to clarify Karim Benzema's position at the club. 


Could Benzema leave the Spanish giants? 


Karim Benzema joined Real Madrid in 2009. Since then, the Frenchman has scored 303 goals in 587 appearances for the Spanish giants. Benzema has been on song this season, scoring 24 goals in 28 games for Carlo Ancelotti's side. 

The 34-year was rumoured to be on Pep Guardiola's wishlist. Hence it is possible that Benzema could decide to move to the Premier League if Real Madrid sign Erling Haaland in the summer. It has to be seen what the Frenchman decides if the transfer goes through.
