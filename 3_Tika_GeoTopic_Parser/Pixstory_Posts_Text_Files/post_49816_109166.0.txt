The Local Mayor have decided that the elementary school in Texas where a gunman killed 19 children and two adults will be demolished.

Don McLaughlin told a council meeting in Uvalde on Tuesday that it was his “understanding” that Robb elementary school would be destroyed and a new school built for its nearly 600 pupils.

“My understanding – and I had this discussion with the [school district] superintendent – is that school will be demolished. You can never ask a child to go back, or teacher to go back, in that school ever,” McLaughlin said. He didn't mention the date. 

This decision isn't new in America as we have seen, The school in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, where 26 people were killed in a mass shooting in 2012, was razed and a new school built on the site.

The mayor’s comments came amid ascending public anger about the police response to the shooting on 25 May and how heavily armed officers waited for 70 minutes after arriving at the school before they raged the classroom.
