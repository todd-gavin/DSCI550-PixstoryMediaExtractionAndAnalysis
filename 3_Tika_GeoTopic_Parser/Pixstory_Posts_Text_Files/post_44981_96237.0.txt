During his stint at the club, the Ivorian scored 177 goals and helped the Blues win several
championships.

Didier Drogba, a Chelsea great, has described his entry into the Premier League Hall of Fame
as "a genuine honor."

In two stints at Chelsea, the former Ivory Coast captain spent nine years guiding the club to
multiple major titles. His first stint was from 2004 to 2012, and his second was from 2014 to
2015.

He was inducted into the Hall of Fame recently, joining former colleague Frank Lampard as the
only two Blues players on the list.

Induction into the Premier League Hall of Fame is a tremendous honor. Thank you to everyone
who voted, as well as Chelsea FC,the managers, coaches, players, and supporters who made
my time in the [Premier League] so memorable, "Drogba expressed his gratitude in a tweet.

In the 2004/05 season, Jose Mourinho, then Chelsea coach, lured the 44-year-old former striker
to Stamford Bridge from Olympique Marseille in the 2004/05 season.

After eight years at Stamford Bridge, he moved to China to play for Shanghai Shenhua for a
short time before joining Galatasaray in Turkey.

Chelsea requested his services again in the
2014/15 season, before he moved to the Montreal Impact and then Phoenix Rising.

Meanwhile, Alan Shearer of Newcastle United feels Drogba is the finest African player to ever
play in the Premier League.

Some of the players who have flourished in the English top-flight include Yaya Toure,Nwankwo
Kanu, Emmanuel Adebayor, Jay-Jay Okocha, and most recently, the Liverpool combination of
Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane, but the ex-England international says none compares to the
Ivorian.

According to the London World, Shearer said, "For me, it's Drogba simply because he's won
four Premier League championships, four FA Cups, nine goals in nine cup finals, one
Champions League trophy, and 177 goals for Chelsea," Shearer said, according to the London
World.
