While there are thousands of wonderful books regarding religion's positive aspects, there are just a few good works about religion's negative aspects. And the vast majority of them are atheist in nature, rendering the concept of God meaningless. Eloy Rodrigo Colombo's book, Evil Religions Unmasked, is a rare example of someone putting in as much research and effort to illustrate the dark side of religion as he has. His second work in this genre begins by outlining a significant portion of Egyptian civilization's polytheistic approach. The three major Abrahamic religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, are then discussed.

He begins by revealing the religion's wrongs one by one, beginning with the allegation that the majority of the holy writings were borrowed from Egyptian wisdom. Then he talks about how bloodthirsty their drive for global control has been, referencing historical events and facts. This book was a real eye-opener. As naive children, we are driven into believing whatever we read or hear about religion, but we rarely examine it as thoroughly as the author has. If you're interested in religion, this book will help you to see things from a different perspective.

The quest for religious world domination was bloody, gory and all kinds of merciless. Innocent people, especially women and even children fell victim to it. This book forces you to think.
