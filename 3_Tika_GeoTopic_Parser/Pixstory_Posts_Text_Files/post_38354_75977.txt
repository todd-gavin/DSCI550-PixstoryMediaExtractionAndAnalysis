Why does it always have to be the prince who travels the world to meet his princess Why can t it be the princess be the one who initiates their meeting The Royal Treatment revolves around a New York Hairdresser Isabella who gets the opportunity to work at the palace for the crowned prince s wedding The movie follows typical rom com plot where most of the story was quite predictable With that being said there were also many part in the movie that were swoon worthy Laura Marano and Mena Massoud shaped themselves well to fit in their characters and the entire feel of the royalty with a hint of free spiritedness was portrayed Overall the movie had a refreshing trope and it is a must watch for all the rom com lovers
