On February 26th, BTS's V posted his pictures on Instagram making the hearts of ARMYs flutter all over the world. 

After joining Instagram with their personal accounts on December 6th, 2021, it took the members only a few hours to cross millions of followers. However, it was V who broke two world records with his followers.

After that V also became the most followed male Korean Artist on Instagram now with 35.5 Million followers, crossing Lee Min Ho who currently has 28.4 Million followers.

V, the social butterfly, has been fluttering the heart of ARMYs since then with his posts and stories. Recently on Weverse app (an app to get in touch with your idols), V commented on Jin's post that he also wishes to click "boyfriend material" pictures. Even though he deleted the comment later, ARMYs were quick to respond and have been waiting for the day to come since then. 

Yesterday, V posted his pictures which have been trending on Instagram as well as on Twitter. Fans commented:
