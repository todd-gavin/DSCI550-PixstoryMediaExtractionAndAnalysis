New research shows survivors of transient attacks may be living with hidden disabilities, like vision problems, depression.
On the surface, victims of mild strokes or transient ischemic attacks appear unaffected. Symptoms, which usually disappear within an hour, are sometimes so imperceptible that victims may not even seek medical attention. Still, about a third of those who live through a brief stroke go on to have a more debilitating one. So, just how innocuous are these so-called mini strokes?
New treatment guidelines, including greater access to counseling and rehabilitation services, will ensure more people get the care they require and return to their usual activities, the study authors say in a news release.
