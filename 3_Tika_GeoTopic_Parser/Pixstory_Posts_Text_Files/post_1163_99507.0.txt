Cornflakes are now marketed as a popular and healthy breakfast option for Indians. But do you know its American inventor John Harvey Kellogg’s had a much sinister idea when he started the brand in the 19th century?

A medical doctor and ‘sex-educator’ by profession, Kellogg’s was quite proud of telling people that he never had sex with his wife in the four decades of their marriage. Cornflakes, he believed, could bring about the same impact on his customers too.

Like a sadist, he also came up with blood-curdling punishments to stop children from masturbating.

In this video, I examine how Kellogg’s mission was so successful
that many educational institutions, around the world, including India, continues to subscribe to his sex-phobic ideology, instilling the fear of sex in the minds of people, from a very young age, even today.
