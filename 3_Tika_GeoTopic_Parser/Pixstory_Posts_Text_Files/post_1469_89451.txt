Ragi s post got me thinking Every day for the last few months I have walked to the same places in Cambridge and clicked the same photos reflecting trees of Logan s meadows the road to fen ditton the cemetery of St andrews shadow play of the trees in ditton meadows My postcards from Cambridge are fascimiles lookalikes of the same place at the same time Perhaps the clouds arrange themselves differently at times the sun plays peekaboo sometimes there are dogs or cows or swans or robins and magpies Do I meet the same swan or robin every day Maybe by the scandal in Cambridge a houseboat Or by the railway line at the start of the chisholm trail Or the thicket at the end of the line of houseboats on the river cam I walk to the same places every day and take the same photos because I realised this is how I meditate Some people chant names over and over some write again and again I photograph Each time I memorialise the meadow river cam or the robin and the magpie i think I meditate drawing in draughts of new air wearing contentment on my brow and mud on my shoes
