A wonderful Atalanta overturns Bayer Leverkusen in the first leg of the round of 16 of the Europa League. After going down after a few minutes of play, the Bergamo players raise their heads and with a quick one-two by Malinovskyi and Muriel they change the face of the match In the second half another goal by colombian will bring on the nerazzurri who in the final concede the goal that closes the gap to Diaby Intense challenge between the two teammates who will now have to play it all in a week in Germany Without the rule of double away goals no longer valid from this year Atalanta find themselves in the lead and with morale skyrocketing after a great performance and a show of strength in the European arena
