The Supreme Court today strongly stated, "Demolitions must be in conformity with law, they cannot be retaliatory," in response to charges that Uttar Pradesh used bulldozers to target those who protested the controversial comments about Prophet Muhammad by members of the ruling BJP.
The Uttar Pradesh administration, as well as the cities of Prayagraj and Kanpur, have been given until Tuesday to respond to a Supreme Court order about demolitions. "Everything should appear to be in order...we anticipate the authorities acting exclusively in accordance with the law. Ascertain safety so that nothing untoward occurs "The judges agreed.

On petitioners' request that the court impose a halt to ""We can't stop demolitions," the justices stated of the "illegal demolitions" in UP. We can say that you should follow the law."

The Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind had addressed the Supreme Court, requesting that it take action against officials involved for what they deemed "illegal" house demolitions.

According to the petitions, the court should order the UP government to guarantee that no demolitions were carried out in contravention of the law.

Bulldozers demolish homes of individuals arrested or recognised as demonstrators in Kanpur, Saharanpur, and Prayagraj, prompting accusations that the UP government is targeting a certain population in the wake of the Prophet's words.

During riots in Jharkhand over comments made by BJP politician Nupur Sharma, who has since been suspended, two people were killed and hundreds were jailed. For his social media post, another BJP politician was removed.
