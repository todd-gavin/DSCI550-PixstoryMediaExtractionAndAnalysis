I once read somewhere, 'if someone asked you who you are, would you know anything other than your name?' It was both a beautiful and sad at the same time. Most of us are still trying to find ourselves, our idea of 'self', our identity. Because only then can you even understand or accept yourself and then eventually come to love yourself. So here i am. I'll introduce myself. I'm a confused person still on the journey of understanding and finding myself. I love to write because I'm avle to express myself better that way. Music, books and movies are three things I'm passionate about. They make my world beautiful. And of course, there are a handful of people in my life that i honestly can't imagine never having met. We were just at the right place at the right time. And that made all the difference. They made me the person i am today. 
So that's most of the things about me! Now let's turn the tables shall we? What would you tell other than your name, if someone asked, "who are you?". I wish you luck on your journey towards finding, understanding, accepting, and loving yourself. Sure, the climb mught not be an easy one. It'll be hard. But remember, the view will be breathtaking once you get there finally. So don't give in! You've got this!
