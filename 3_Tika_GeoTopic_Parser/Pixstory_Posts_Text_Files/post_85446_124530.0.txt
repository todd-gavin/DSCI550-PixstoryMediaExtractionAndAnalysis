Beaches are boring and very limited in terms of options for entertainment!

As lifestyle writer Joanna says, you'll have twice as many exciting memories if you visit the mountains as you would the beach. Active vacations are always that way. 

It is scientifically proven that spending a few active days in the mountains will leave your body in top condition and boost your mood since outdoor physical activity releases a lot of endorphins. 

In the highlands, the air is cleaner. While mountains are green and inaccessible for traffic, beaches are frequently found close to roadways. Additionally, the levels of smog in cities are not very high. 

In comparison to the beach, the likelihood of developing wrinkles from the sun's rays is substantially lower in the highlands. Everyone has agreed that getting a suntan is unhealthy! 

So team beaches all the way!
