Their goal is to make machines that mimic human behaviour such as thinking and making decisions on their own. That level of intellect, however, has yet to be attained. Modern artificial intelligence can interpret data and make real-time judgements with amazing branches like data services, machine learning, robotics etc.

Industries were absorbed by this artificial intelligence at a quicker pace. AI is now playing a critical role in assisting and supporting decision making in all aspects of life.
