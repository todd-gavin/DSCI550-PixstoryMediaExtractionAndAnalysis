There are a few ingredients that are known to be effective against acne, and they're typically found in skincare products.
One ingredient that's often used is benzoyl peroxide. This compound kills the bacteria responsible for causing acne, and it usually works best when combined with other anti-acne ingredients like salicylic acid or sulfur.
Another ingredient that's commonly used is tea tree oil. This oil helps to soothe and clear the skin, while also fighting against infection. It can be found in many beauty products because it has been proven to be effective at treating both acne and other skin conditions like eczema.
