Anxiety is a normal emotion which is common among the people. It is a fear that the brain expresses through various stress or towards a potential danger that are being dealt in our daily lives. 

Occasionally feeling anxious about certain things seems fine. But anxiety disorders are way more different. They cause constant and overwhelming anxiety and fear. 
Excessive anxiety can make you avoid work, school, family get-togethers, and other social situations that might trigger or worsen your symptoms.  

Many people are able to cope with anxiety by seeking the help of treatments that are widely available and accessible to anyone. 

The following are various types of anxiety 

• Generalized anxiety disorder. You feel excessive, unrealistic worry and tension with little or no reason. 
• Panic disorder. You feel sudden, intense fear that brings on a panic attack. During a panic attack you may break out in a sweat, have chest pain, and have a pounding heartbeat (palpitations).
• Social anxiety disorder. Also called social phobia, this is when you feel overwhelming worry and self-consciousness about everyday social situations.
• Specific phobias. You feel intense fear of a specific object or situation, such as heights or flying. The fear goes beyond what’s appropriate and may cause you to avoid ordinary situations. 
• Agoraphobia.You have an intense fear of being in a place where it seems hard to escape or get help if an emergency occurs. For example, you may panic or feel anxious when on an airplane, public transportation, or standing in line with a crowd.   
• Separation anxiety. Little kids aren’t the only ones who feel scared or anxious when a loved one leaves. Anyone can get separation anxiety disorder. If you do, you’ll feel very anxious or fearful when a person you’re close with leaves your sight. You’ll always worry that something bad may happen to your loved one.  
• Selective mutism. This is a type of social anxiety in which young kids who talk normally with their family don’t speak in public, like at school. 
• Medication-induced anxiety disorder. Use of certain medications or illegal drugs, or withdrawal from certain drugs, can trigger some symptoms of anxiety disorder.
