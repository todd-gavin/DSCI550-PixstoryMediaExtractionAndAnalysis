On Sunday, NASA of the United States of America photographed the precise moment the Sun sent a strong blast of energy into space. As per DNA, the Solar Dynamic Observatory, which continually monitors the Sun, was able to snap a shot of the incident, which NASA shared on Instagram to tell the public that a "strong solar flare" erupted from the Sun on October 2. "Solar flares are intense bursts of radiation coming from the release of magnetic energy on the Sunâ€™s surface. In this image, they are noticeable as the brightest areas of the Sun and can last from minutes to hours," the caption of the post read."In this image, they (solar flares) are noticeable as the brightest areas of the Sun and can last from minutes to hours," NASA wrote in the caption. News reports say that additionally, NASA classified the solar flare on October 2 as an "X1 Flare". "An X-class denotes the most intense flares, while the number, which reaches a maximum of nine, provides more information about its strength," NASA explained. However, this is not the first time that such powerful energy bursts from the Sun have been observed. In April, NASA was able to capture a photo of a solar flare using the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The Centre of Excellence for Space Sciences (India), also known as CESSI, discovered a solar flare that may have caused harm to satellite communications and GPS systems that same month.
