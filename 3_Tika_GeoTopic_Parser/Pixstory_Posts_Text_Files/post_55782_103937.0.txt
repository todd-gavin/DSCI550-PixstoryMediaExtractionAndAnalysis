The Anzac Biscuit's origins are a matter of debate. While they are unmistakably linked to WW1 and the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), there appear to be two different origin stories: either they were sent to the soldiers because the ingredients didn't spoil easily, or they were baked by women at home for bake sales to raise money for the war effort. 

Regardless, Anzac cookies are a serious business, with a number of biscuit baking competitions held throughout the year, particularly around and on war memorial days. 

Rolled oats, golden syrup, and shredded coconut are the main ingredients. When it comes to how they should turn out, there are two camps: rock firm and crispy or soft and chewy. They're best served with a cup in either case.
