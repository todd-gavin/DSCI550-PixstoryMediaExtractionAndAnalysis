On April 10, at 6 pm, Meera Chitrakoot will be in conversation with S Anand, publisher of Navayana. Meera Chitrakoot is a Navayana Dalit History Fellow and she is writing an intersectional autobiography of her journey with feminist spaces in Bundelkhand, along with the journeys of many Dalit and Muslim women who have been her companions in their struggle against a casteist-patriarchal society. 

Come listen to this amazing feminist-journalist talk about breaking multiple glass ceiling, going forth where no Dalit woman has ever gone before !
