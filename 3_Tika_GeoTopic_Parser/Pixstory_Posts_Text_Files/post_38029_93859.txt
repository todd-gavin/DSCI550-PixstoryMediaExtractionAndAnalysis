 Newcastle United A new challenge Newcastle United have reportedly been linked with Gareth Bale in recent months Hence the Welsh international could choose to return to the Premier League with the Magpies The new Saudi based owners are looking to invest heavily in the Tyneside club Hence a big money signing of Gareth Bale is certainly on the cards Bale s experience could be very vital for a club aiming to play in European competitions Hence Newcastle United could certainly use the year old winger s expertise and precision in their setup A return to Tottenham Hotspur The Welshman was loaned to Tottenham Hotspur in the season Though Bale showed glimpses of brilliance he was not able to cement a position in the starting XI Nevertheless he did score goals in appearances for the club Antonio Conte is currently on the lookout for a winger to add to his squad Hence Gareth Bale could certainly fit the Italian manager s profile The Spurs are on the cusp of Champions League qualification Hence recruiting Bale would become even more fruitful Antonio Conte has revived the careers of many players over the years Hence he could possibly do the same with Bale A move to the Middle east or the MLS Gareth Bale may also have an option to move out of Europe at the end of the season Salary could play a key role for the Real Madrid star and hence a move to Qatar Saudi Arabia or the United States could be on the cards The year old is yet to attract an offer from a club outside of Europe as of now Will the Welshman retire Rumours have been suggesting that Bale could retire at the end of the season But we certainly hope that these are not true Nevertheless this could depend on the Welsh National Team Wales are one step away from qualifying for the FIFA World Cup The Dragons will face either Scotland or Ukraine in the European play off final to determine who goes through Hence it is certain that Gareth Bale would play on if Wales qualify for the World Cup in Qatar later this year
