The sour taste of missing out on NBA Finals in LeBron’s mouth may just have been compensated. 

According to Forbes, the Lakers star has amassed an estimated net worth of $1 billion, making him the first active NBA player in the history to achieve this feat. 

Michael Jordan is the only other NBA player who is a billionaire, fortunately for LeBron he didn't reach that mark until 2014, years after the stopped playing in the NBA, which just happens to put another feather in the cap of James. 

During his NBA career, James has earned over $385 million in salary from his time with the 
Cleveland Cavaliers, Miami Heat and Lakers. He earned $170 million in 11 season with the Cavaliers, $153 million in his four seasons with the Lakers and $64 million in his four seasons with the Heat. 

Being the league's highest-paid active player and also the fact that he makes an estimated $900 million in income via endorsement deals and businesses has certainly helped the cause. 

A big reason the Lakers star has gotten to this point is that he's been smart about spending his money. 

James has a minority stake in Liverpool FC of the Premier League. In addition, James also owns an estimated one percent of Fenway Sports Group, which owns the Boston Red Sox, Fenway Park and Liverpool. 

It's not all sports for James, though. He has also made an estimated $80 million in real estate, as he owns three properties that are worth that amount. In addition, James has also made $30 million in Blaze Pizza, a pizza chain that was founded in 2012 and has more than 300 locations throughout the United States and Canada. 

James also told ESPN in an interview in 2017, that he is admittedly the cheapest player in the NBA, as he doesn’t like to pay for things, even going as far as to claim that he doesn’t buy any apps, and does not even turn on his data roaming if there is no wifi available.
