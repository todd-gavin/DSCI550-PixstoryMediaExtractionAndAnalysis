You know about Black History Month, but do you know about Dalit History Month? 

One of the most beautiful things about BHM is the fact that it commemorates so many of the great Black thinkers, activists and revolutionaries. What America did to Black people will forever be a stain on it, and the first part of reparations must necessarily be to remember the wrong. 

Sadly, America is hardly alone in its history of oppression. India, too, is a country with a shameful past - to say nothing of its present! We live in a country where countless atrocities are perpetuated day after day on marginalized-caste people - atrocities that we handwave and ignore, much like our sitting government does. 

With that in mind, we should all (especially privileged-castes) be aware that the month of April is Dalit History Month. Chosen because Ambedkar was born in April, and Ambedkar "remains the most important symbol for Dalit people in the struggle against untouchability and caste." https://www.roundtableindia.co.in/dalit-history-month/ 

ThePrint has done an interesting series on Dalit History Month, but sadly, this does not receive near enough attention from most news portals or journals. https://theprint.in/tag/dalit-history-month-2021/
