As the fight to end Manchester City's Premier League dominance continues, Liverpool has
confirmed the £8 million acquisition of Fulham's talented teenager, Fábio Carvalho.

The arrival of Carvalho at Anfield on July 1 is no surprise. On January transfer deadline day,
Liverpool and the 19-year-old agreed to terms.

They were unable to finish the paperwork in time
to declare him a Liverpool player at the time, but talks persisted and the Anfield club has now
finalized the procedures.

Carvalho will join Liverpool for an initial fee of £5 million, adding to the forward line that has
developed during the season.

Salah, Mane, and Firmino are all out of contract at the same time in 2023. Carvalho, who is
versatile enough to play in attack or a deeper midfield role, arrives with Liverpool with an eye on
the long-term as much as next season's title bid, and the club needed more offensive options
following Divock Origi's imminent departure on a free transfer.

Aside from Carvalho, Liverpool say discussions about the make-up of the squad for 2022-23 are
on hold until after next weekend's showdown with Real Madrid. Although it is a relief to the
player and the club that the injury is not too serious, it is still going to require a swift recovery for
him to be available to face Real Madrid in Paris. At half-time of Liverpool's 3-1 win over
Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday, Thiago had to be subbed at half-time.

Liverpool will obviously give their playmaker every chance because it will be a significant
setback if he can not feature. Fabinho will rejoin training later this week for the first significant
fitness test.

Manager Jurgen Klopp's midfield options are further complicated by Fabinho's hamstring injury.

That means if he takes a chance on Thiago and Fabinho, he can at least make an immediate
change if it backfires. He too is undergoing intensive treatment ahead of the final.
