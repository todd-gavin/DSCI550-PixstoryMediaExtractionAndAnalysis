The AAP has alleged that BJP was luring party MLAs to topple the Arvind Kejriwal government by unfair means. The letter by Delhi Assembly joint secretary said that the Deputy Speaker has directed the convening of the session on August 26. 

Amid allegations that the “BJP is poaching the Aam Aadmi Party MLAs” and trying to break the party, the Arvind Kejriwal government has called a special session of the Delhi Assembly on Friday August 26. The special session of the Delhi assembly has been convened after a political slugfest over the CBI raid on Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia in the excise policy case began between the BJP and the ruling Aam Aadmi Party.

A meeting of the AAP’s Political Affairs Committee of the party was held at Kejriwal`s residence on Wednesday, which condemned the BJP's efforts to "poach" its MLAs and asked the saffron party to tell the nation from where it has accumulated money to offer crores to legislators of other parties.
