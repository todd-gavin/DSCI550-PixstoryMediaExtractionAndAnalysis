Though through our results, we expect Manchester City to edge Liverpool to clinch the Premier League title, there are few games whose results can entirely change the results. Liverpool will play Manchester United and if Manchester United take all three points home by inflicting a defeat, Manchester City will steer clear in the title race. On the other hand, if Liverpool take home all three points against Manchester United, the Cityzens will be in trouble. 
On the other hand, Manchester City will face West Ham United in the final games of the campaign. With the Hammers in the race to find a spot in Europe, they can be really tough opposition. The results can swing the league title for both Manchester City and Liverpool. 

We are all set for an exciting Premier League title race finish. Can Liverpool edge Manchester City or will Manchester City clinch the title again? The potential results of UEFA Champions League KO will also have an implication on the results of the title race.
