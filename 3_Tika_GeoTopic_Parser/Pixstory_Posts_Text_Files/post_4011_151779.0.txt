It is a reality! 
Our gut feeling sometimes comes true with the friendships we make at. Probably this gut feeling started showing up after the warnings we have got from our dear mothers. 
But when we enter into our adulthood period, I'm sure most of us have had that feeling of oh yes this friendship would last long, but soon the realisation comes we are no longer in 8th grade to tag our friends as best friends and not all friendships do last long. 
Friendships are great but when the cracks become wider, when disagreements come in and when it starts to bother ourself as a whole, it's better to stay away from it for your own wellbeing. 
You can say it's prioritising yourself before anything and at the end of the day that's what needs to come first, because those friendships which are meant to last will find some way back to you.
