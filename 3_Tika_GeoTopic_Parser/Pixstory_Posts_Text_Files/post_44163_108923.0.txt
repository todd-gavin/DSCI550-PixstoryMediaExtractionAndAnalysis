On the 20th of June, Indian National Football Team coach, Igor Stimac took a dig at the Indian Premier League and broadcasters. In the press conference, the manager talked about what needs to be done to make Indian football great again. The Sleeping Giants of Asia have struggled to qualify for the Asian Cup in the past but were able to book their tickets for AFC Asian Cup 2023 with three comprehensive wins. 

With the wins, Igor Stimac has found his lost voice back. The manager was criticized for not getting results but was able to turn the tables around. In the presser, he said: 

Things need to be sorted out about the football calendar, which is still being adjusted with regards to IPL and broadcasting… This needs to stop if we want to make football great in India. Football calendar should not depend on other things

The above statement leads us to the question: Should Indian football be independent of broadcasters' influence? And here is our opinion:

According to one of the reports, India is home to 13+ crore sports fans. However, the glaring statistic is that 9 out of 10 fans watch cricket and constitute close to 11.2 crores. On the other hand, 2.3+ crore people watch football in India. This includes the national team football, Indian Super League, La Liga, English Premier League, Bundesliga, etc. If we go by these numbers, there are close to 1.5+ crore football fans in the country.
