According to space agencies across the globe, the Sun is about to strike the Earth with a massive solar geomagnetic storm as soon as tomorrow. With the activity of the Sun significantly ramped up, there are projections that this geomagnetic storm can be dangerous.

A solar geomagnetic storm basically means that the Sun is about to discharge significant amounts of Coronal Mass Ejection with high-intensity energy toward the Earth, and some of the other planets on the internal solar system, on Thursday.

NASA and NOAA have been tracking the emission of CME by the Sun and have predicted that the storm can hit our planet on April 14. NASA has further predicted that after the mega-storm hits Earth, it is likely to intensify due to the very fast solar wind stream.
