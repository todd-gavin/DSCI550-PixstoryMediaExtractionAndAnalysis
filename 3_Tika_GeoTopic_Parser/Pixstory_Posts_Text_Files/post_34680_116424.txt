In January it will be years but he has no intention of quitting Gigi Buffon spoke to the Parma fans at Pejo&#39;s training camp I could retire at the age of 10 I played ten years in Parma in my first life then twenty years at Juve one in Paris and now I&#39;m closing the circle back in Emilia And I&#39;m not years old Every year for several years at the end of the season Buffon has been asked whether to hang up his boots or rather his gloves. For ten years I&#39;ve been thinking about when I&#39;ll stop but then I always keep going I&#39;ve had important experiences that have allowed me to get to know football but I&#39;m not sure where I&#39;ll stay in this world Maybe I&#39;ll experiment with something else
