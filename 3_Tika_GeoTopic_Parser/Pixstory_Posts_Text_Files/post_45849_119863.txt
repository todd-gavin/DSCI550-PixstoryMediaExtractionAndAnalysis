As NASA TV says on a July evening in Jennifer Trosper drove home from work at NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory holding a picture of the Martian surface to her steering wheel Earlier that day the agency s Pathfinder mission had landed on Mars encased in protective air bags and taken the image of the red rubbly landscape that transfixed her As I was on the freeway I had that image on my steering wheel and kept looking at it Trosper said reminiscing I probably should have been looking more closely at the road Given that Trosper was the mission s flight director her excitement was understandable Not only had Pathfinder landed on Mars a feat all its own but it had done so at a fraction of the cost and time required of previous Mars missions And the next day the team was set to change the course of Mars exploration forever They had sent instructions to Pathfinder to extend a ramp so that history s first Mars rover Sojourner could roll down onto the planet s surface Named after the fiery American abolitionist and women s rights activist Sojourner Truth the rover weighed just pounds kilograms and was no larger than a microwave oven But after touching down and spending days traveling the surface the tiny spacecraft proved that exploring Mars with a rover was possible It also led Trosper to work on a series of ever larger more complex rovers Spirit and Opportunity Curiosity and NASA s most advanced Mars rover to date Perseverance on which she served as project manager until recently
