Strong social ties are linked to a longer life. In contrast, loneliness and social isolation are linked to poorer health, depression, and an increased risk of early death. Studies have found that having various social relationships may help reduce stress and heart-related risks.

Mental and physical health are interconnected. Social isolationâ€™s adverse health consequences range from sleeplessness to reduced immune function. Loneliness is associated with higher anxiety, depression, and suicide rates. Isolation and loneliness are also linked to poor cardiovascular health and cognitive function:

A study led by an epidemiologist at Newcastle University concluded that deficiencies in social relationships are associated with a higher risk for coronary heart disease and stroke.

Another study published in The Journals of Gerontology concluded that loneliness was associated with a 40 per cent increase in the risk of dementia.
