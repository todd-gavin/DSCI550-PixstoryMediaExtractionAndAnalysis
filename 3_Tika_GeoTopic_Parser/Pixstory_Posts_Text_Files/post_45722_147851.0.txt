With its first image of Neptune, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope displays its capabilities closer to home. In addition to providing the best glimpse of the planet's rings in more than 30 years, Webb's cameras also shed new insight on the ice giant. The clarity of the planet's rings, some of which have not been seen since NASA's Voyager 2 became the first spacecraft to examine Neptune during its approach in 1989, is what stands out most in Webb's latest photograph. The Webb image vividly displays Neptune's fainter dust bands in addition to many brilliant, narrow rings.“It has been three decades since we last saw these faint, dusty rings, and this is the first time we’ve seen them in the infrared,” notes Heidi Hammel, a Neptune system expert and interdisciplinary scientist for Webb. Webb’s extremely stable and precise image quality permits these very faint rings to be detected so close to Neptune.Source: NASA TV
