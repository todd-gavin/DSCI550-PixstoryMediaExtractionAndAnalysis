The name of Kurkihar seems to be derived from Kukkuta Pada Vihara. Buddhist documents talk of one Kukkuta-pada-vihara which was an important monastery located near Kukkuta-pada-giri or the Cock’s foot hills. Cunningham has identified Kurkihar to be the same as the legendary Kukkuta-pada-vihara and has mentioned in his first report as follows :-

                   “The true name of Kurkihar is said to be Kurak-Vihar, which I believe to be only a contracted form of Kukkuta-pada Vihara or “temple of the cock’s foot”, which must have connected with the Kukkuta-pada-giri or Cock’s foot hill which is described by both Fa-Hian and Hwen Thsang. The Sanskrit Kukkuta is the same as the Hindi Kukkar or Kurak, a cock, so that Kurak-Vihar is clearly the same appellation as Kukkuta-pada Vihara. There was a monastery also of the same name, but this was close to Pataliputra or Patna. The Kukkuta-pada-giri was a three peaked hill, which was celebrated as the abode of the great Kasyapa, as well as the scene of his death. On this account it was also called Guru-pada-parvata, or Teacher’s foot hill. The situation of Kurkihar corresponds exactly with Fa-Hian’s account, excepting that there is no three-peaked hill in its neighbourhood. There are, however, three bare and rugged hills which rise boldly out of the plain about half a mile to the north of the village. As these three hills touch one another at their bases, I think that they may farely be identified with the three-peaked hill of Hwen Thsang.”
