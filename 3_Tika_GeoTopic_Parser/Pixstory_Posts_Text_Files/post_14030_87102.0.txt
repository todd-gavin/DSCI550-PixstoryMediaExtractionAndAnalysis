This season has been full of ups and down for Manchester United. After Ole being sacked things haven't improved much in terms of results. The team is still out of the top 4 and it'll go down to the wire. In these times the defence hasn't done them any good. Many fans and panelists had been calling out Cristiano Ronaldo but like he always does he proved his doubters wrong by scoring a magnificent match winning hattrick against Tottenham. With this hattrick he became the highest goal scorer ever to play football according to FIFA with 807 goals, he overtook Josef Bican.

If this is any sign its that Ronaldo isn't the problem at United. With him being back in form its going to be an exciting season ahead. Manchester United will have to play with character and responsibility. Their next match is with Atletico de Madrid, its a must win watch for them to qualify further in the Champions League with Bruno Fernandes ruled out, the onus is on Ronaldo to lead the team through. Can Ronaldo become the hope for his team like he has done so many times in the past? Only time will tell.
