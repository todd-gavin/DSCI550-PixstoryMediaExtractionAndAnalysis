Dalbir Kaur, the sister of Sarabjit Singh, passed away on June 26 after suffering from a heart attack. She had fought the system in order to rescue her brother, who was an Indian national sentenced to death for allegedly spying on a Pakistan court after he mistakenly crossed the border. 

Randeep Hooda who played the role of Sarabjit Singh in the biopic Sarbjit fulfilled the promise he made to Dalbir Kaur - to perform her last rites. 

After learning of Dalbir’s demise, Randeep Hooda left Mumbai to be present for her last rites. In a way, Kaur saw her late brother Sarabjit in Hooda, as she’d stated in 2017, "I would like to tell Randeep that I have truly seen Sarabjit in him.”

Earlier, Dalbir had expressed her wish for Randeep to give her ‘kandha’ after her death. "I have a wish and I would like to take a promise from him that when I die, he should definitely give me 'kandha' (shoulder). My soul will receive peace that Sarabjit gave me 'kandha'", she said.


OM SHANTI!🙏🏻🙏🏻
