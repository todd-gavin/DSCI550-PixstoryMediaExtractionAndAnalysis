We all know that the fourth instalment movie of “Thor” is all set to release in theatres on 8th July 2022.

The name of the fourth instalment of Marvel’s Thor is Thor - Love and Thunder.

Today I’ll discuss the second part of the same franchise and the name of the movie is “Thor - The Dark World” and this movie was released way back in 2013.

Thor - The Dark World is a story about the character named Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his journey to defeat Malekith. Malekith is the leader of Dark elves and he wants to fulfil his desire which is to destroy all nine realms and to fulfil the desire Malekith puts Thor’s father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and Thor’s girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman)  in trouble.

Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who is the brother of Thor helped him to beat Malekith and even get died at the end of the movie. 

Things I liked about the movie is its action because the movie got released way back in 2013 and according to that use of VFX is very good.

Things I didn’t like about the movie is its antagonist. As a viewer, I never got a sense of fear after watching him in the movie. 

If you are a Marvel and Thor fan and you are planning to watch Thor - Love and Thunder in near future then you should the trilogy of Thor as soon as possible.
