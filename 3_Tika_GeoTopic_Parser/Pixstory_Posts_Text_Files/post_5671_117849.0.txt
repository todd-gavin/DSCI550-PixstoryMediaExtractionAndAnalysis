Vote count of the Presidential elections are going on. The competition is between ruling NDA candidate Droupadi Murmu & opposition candidate Yashwant Sinha. 

Murmu has emerged victorious in the count of MPs with 540 votes whereas Sinha has only got 208 votes. 

Many have predicted Murmu's victory as Sinha's chances from the beginning looked bleak. So, for many of us that's not news. 

But the revelation of the hour is the invalidation of 15 votes. There are total 780 MPs who were eligible to choose the 15th president of the country, out of those 748 practiced their right. In those 748, 15 votes were deemed invalid. 

It raises the question, that in the world's biggest democracy, how come  the parliamentarians, who make laws, could not follow the proper voting procedure.

Were they not given proper training for voting in such elections.

We have seen it happening in the Rajya Sabha and legislative council elections too. 

Well, there is a conspiracy thoery too. It is alleged that some deliberately invalidate their votes to ensure the defeat of their party candidates. The reason is best known to them only but there are insinuations that money, muscle power and other allurements are involved.

There is no way we can prove such allegations but certainly the invalidation of votes of lawmakers do result in people casting aspersions on their motive.

In this technologically advanced era, such mistakes are unacceptable and force the people to think if they had made a wrong choice.
