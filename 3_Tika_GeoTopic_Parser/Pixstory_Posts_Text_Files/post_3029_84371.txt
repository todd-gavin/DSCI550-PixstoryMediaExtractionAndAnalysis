Launching the Ukraine invasion Putin had made a veiled reference to Russia s nuclear arsenal Now he has put the nuclear forces on alert The country has the biggest n stockpile in the world and it has never directly threatened its use since the Russian Federation was established in All of a sudden for the first time in a long while a nuclear war has become a real possibility even if all efforts to avoid it can be expected Even minus the nukes a World War III could be in the offing As the Russian military action began in opposition to the NATO expansion threat the US and allies remain part of the equation even if they are not yet participating in armed action To bring more pressure on Russia the West decided during the weekend to cut off Russian financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication SWIFT a messaging system that runs international finance Quite a drastic move the French finance minister described it as a financial nuclear weapon To understand SWIFT and the implications of cutting Russia out read on In response Putin turned his attention to actual nuclear weapons putting them on high alert Putin s speech of Thursday announcing the invasion too had referred to Russia s nuclear capability This is too swift a turn when the world had come to think of n weapons as relics of the World War Putin and Biden too had said in their joint statement after the Geneva summit less than a year ago that Nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought Experts however wondered about Putin s instructions to put n forces in a special regime of combat duty because like the American arsenal they are expected to be always so The Biden administration has chosen not to join in by matching Putin s escalatory move but officials are scrambling to respond to the situation The Ukraine Russia talks that began Monday are the first opportunity to defuse the crisis Otherwise as some of Ukraine s neighbors are part of the NATO the offensive can spill over and trigger into a World War
