The year has been very special for Alia Bhatt❤️🤌, and it’s not just because of the super success of her film, Gangubai Kathiawadi🌼. 2022 is the year she married her boyfriend, Ranbir Kapoor😻. She is also going to become a mother this year🤰❤️.
 “There was not even a friendship😅,” revealed Alia Bhatt❤️.
Alia then opened up about the eureka moment when she felt there was a chance of dating Ranbir. It happened when both were flying to Tel Aviv, Israel, for Brahmastra’s prep ⚡. It was a time when both were single and not dating anybody.
She said, “Both of us were like, ‘Oh my God🥺, what were we doing all these years?’ ‘Why aren’t we together 🥺💘?’ It was a question he kinda asked me. I was like, ‘I don’t know😂!’ So that’s what I was talking about. You cannot plan something like this.”
And the rest is history 🤌♾️.
