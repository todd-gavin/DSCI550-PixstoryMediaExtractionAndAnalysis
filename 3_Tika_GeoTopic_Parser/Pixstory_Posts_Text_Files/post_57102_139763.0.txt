There's this ingrained habit in most people to term their mere issues as OCD.
Like having a habit of organising things and cleaning too much, it's their little OCD.
No one who wouldn't have trivialised a severe disorder like OCD is left.
This happens because many are unaware of the intensity and harm this can actually do to a person.
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is not a trivial problem; it is a serious condition that can grow up to the heights of causing great distress in someone.
It isÂ  a "mental and behavioural disorder in which an individual has intrusive thoughts and feels the need to perform certain routines repeatedly to the extent where it induces distress or impairs general function."
It contains obsessions and compulsions; obsessions are constantly occurring unwanted thoughts, mental images, or urges that can evoke feelings of disgust, anxiety or discomfort.
Most common obsessions include fear of contamination, "obsession with symmetry, and intrusive thoughts about religion, sex, and harm."
On the other hand, compulsions are the response to obsessions. When people react to obsessions, they are compelled to do things like excessive hand washing, cleaning, arranging, counting, checking, or even taking assurance. It can lead to many such repeated actions that can make people feel exhausted.
People should understand it clearly to see the difference between actual OCD and mere habits.
