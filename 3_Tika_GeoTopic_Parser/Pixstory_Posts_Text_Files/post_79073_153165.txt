Last night we extended our excellent start to the season with a comfortable win in the Europa League at the Emirates Stadium Let s take a look at some player ratings from the game Turner Made some nice saves in the second half but wasn t tested too much Tierney Getting back to his best Great shot to create Eddie s goal Gabriel Thought he made some excellent tackles after his mistake on Saturday Holding Scored a nice goal The Europa League Van Dijk Tomiyasu Very solid at both right and left back Lokonga Decent on the ball and wasn t too threatened defensively Solid Xhaka Solid performance from the captain That yellow card was classic Granit Vieira MOTM Scored and got an assist but he could and probably should have had a few more goals Had a couple of really nice chances Exciting player nonetheless Martinelli Fairly quiet but understandable He s had to play Premier League and Europa League this season Nketiah Another good display for Eddie but like Vieira he probably could have scored a few Unlucky that Jesus is so good because Nketiah could start for loads of Premier League sides Marquinhos Quiet Didn t seem to quite click today Subs Jesus Unbelievable assist for the third goal degaard Saka Didn t do a whole lot but way too good for Europa League football White Didn t have much timeNelson Looked good when he came on Hope he can offer us something this season
