When I was a kid how much I loved everyone directly depended on how far I could open my arms When Daddy asked How much do you love Daddy I would open my arms as much as possible and say I love you so much Dad My hands were still open as Dad hugged me and kissed me and I realized with the same childish weakness how saying I love you made people happy As I got older I gradually learned not to kiss my uncles in public because it might be misunderstood by people according to our parent to people who did not know he was my uncle I do not kiss Uncle John I do not even kiss my father Little by little I forgot to kiss My hands were so big that I could love anyone a hundred times more than I did when I was a child but I regretted it The more my hands became capable of loving the more my limitations became I got younger and my dad got older He no longer asked me how much I loved him and I did not tell him how much I loved him Saying I Love You was harder for me than defusing the bomb Now that many years have passed since those difficult days I want to go to sea go to all the people I loved open my arms and say I love you so much But alas some of the people I loved so much are no more Some of them may not matter much to me whether I like them or not Everything must happen in its own time Some events lose the sweetness of the original time when they occur before or after the appointed time I wish we could learn to say to the main people of our lives at the right time without embarrassment I love you Because we may never get a chance to say I love you later
