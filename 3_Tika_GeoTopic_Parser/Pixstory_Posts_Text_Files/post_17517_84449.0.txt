In a season full of disappointing lows, the Los Angeles Lakers may have once again hit a new one in Sunday night’s loss to the New Orleans Pelicans. Frank Vogel’s team trailed by as many as 32 points and was completely embarrassed by a much hungrier New Orleans squad.

The Lakers shot just 41.7% from the field and 20.4% from 3-point land. They also had 23 turnovers on the night, which surely played a factor in the 26 transition points the Pelicans had as well. Quite simply there were no positives on this night for the Lakers and Vogel said as much after the contest in explaining what went wrong.

“Well, we didn’t play well,” Vogel said. “We’re not shooting the ball well from the perimeter and the paint is clogged and we’re trying to force inside with the pass, with the bounce. It’s leading to a lot of turnovers and we’re not moving that well defensively, but we weren’t really good on either end tonight.”

Coming out of the All-Star break the Lakers still had a chance to potentially turn things around and salvage this season. But after a close loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, it looked as if the team wasn’t even trying against the Pelicans.

The biggest issue was undoubtedly the turnovers with many of them being a product of just laziness on the part of the Lakers and Vogel didn’t sugarcoat the impact that had.

“It was huge. With 23 turnovers, you are not going to win. So it was a huge part of it,” Vogel added. “Like I said, some of it is carelessness. I’ll have to look at all the turnovers, but some of it is carelessness and some it is we’re ice-cold from the perimeter right now. We’re trying to attack the paint and there’s five guys in there, so we’re trying to execute through that, but we definitely got to be better.”
