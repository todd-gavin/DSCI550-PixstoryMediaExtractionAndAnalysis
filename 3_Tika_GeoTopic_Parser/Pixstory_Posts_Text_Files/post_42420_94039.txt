Although I am a Marvel fan I haven t watched all the Marvel movies yet because I became a fan of Marvel after Spider Man Homecoming and the next films I watched by Marvel are Avengers Infinity War and Endgame After that I became a Marvel fan and of course I started watching old movies made by Marvel Studio but till yesterday I haven t watched any Thor movies But as you all know Thor Love and Thunder will be released on the th of July and I thought why not start watching the Thor trilogy today then I watched the first movie named Thor and yeah I liked it Thor is a story where Odin the king of Asgard initially crowned his son Thor as a king but later he realized that Thor is not ready to become a king because of his behavior So Odin exiled his son and the Mjolnir famously known as Hammer to the Earth where Thor got surrounded by a group of Scientists On the other hand Mjolnir is captured by Agents of Shield and they started discovering that What is this because they were unable to pick that Hammer And talking about Villains there are mainly two villains which are frost giants and Loki Brother of Thor and they are not so impactful but take the story forward for sure The remaining movie is all about that how Thor will go back to Asgard and will he be able to meet his father again and how will he find his hammer and Will he be crowned as king again So yeah if you haven t watched it yet please watch it because it will help you to understand the upcoming Thor movie
