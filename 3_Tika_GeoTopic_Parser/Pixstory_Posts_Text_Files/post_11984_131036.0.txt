Your period is a gift.

A menstruating woman is given a gift every month- her period. This gift allows physical and emotional detoxification. Unfortunately, instead of viewing this time of the month as a gift, it is seen as a chore and nuisance. 

This is probably due to the fact that most women also suffer from symptoms like migraines, nausea, body aches, cramps, and emotional imbalance. Those symptoms
are common, but it does not mean they are normal.

How can we view our periods as gifts? 

Through shifting our perspective with physical and emotional habits.

Physically: when the body is detoxing, you need to rest more, not go against the flow and do things like overwork, over exercise, go out and party, and even take on emotional burdens.

According to ancient Chinese medicine texts, it states, “During a menstrual cycle, one should avoid spicy and fried foods as these food may cause heatiness" or emotional or physical reactions associated with temper and excess.

Emotionally: meditate, practice self-care, express your emotions gracefully! Talk to someone, write in a journal.

Let’s normalize the beauty of menstruation, it’s not easy but we are built in a way to go through the worse and still embrace it all with a smile.
