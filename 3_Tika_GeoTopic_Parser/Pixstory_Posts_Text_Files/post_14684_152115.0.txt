Most people don't have much trouble with allergy shots. But they contain the substances that cause your allergies â€” so reactions are possible, and can include:
ðŸ‘‰Local reactions- This can involve redness, swelling or irritation at the injection site. These common reactions typically begin within a few hours of the injection and clear up soon after.
Systemic reactions-Â  These are less common but potentially more serious. You may develop sneezing, nasal congestion or hives.
More severe reactions may include throat swelling, wheezing or chest tightness.
ðŸ‘‰Anaphylaxis- It is a rare life-threatening reaction to allergy shots. It can cause low blood pressure and trouble breathing. Anaphylaxis often begins within 30 minutes of the injection, but sometimes starts later than that.
