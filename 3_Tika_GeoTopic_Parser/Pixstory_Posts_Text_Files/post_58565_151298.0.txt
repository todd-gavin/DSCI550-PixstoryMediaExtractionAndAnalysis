Former Minister of Uttat Pradesh and five term MLA , Mr Ajay Rai has been appointed as the president of Prayagraj region of Congress party organization in Uttar Pradesh to rejunevate the party. Mr Rai has also contested on Congress ticket against the PM, Narendra Modi from Varanasi Lok Sabha Parliamentary constituency. This region will consist of 10 to 12 didtricts of East UP including Varanasi under him to strenthen the party organization. He was elected MLA from Kolasla legislative assembly, now Pindra, five times .
The Indian National Congress (INC) has appointed Brijlal Khabri, a former Lok Sabha member, as the president of its Uttar Pradesh State unit. Mr. Khabri will replace Ajay Kumar Lallu, who had resigned in March 2022 after the party’s disastrous performance in the State Assembly election.

Mr. Khabri, a Dalit, who was elected to the Lok Sabha from Jalaun in Bundelkhand region in the 1999 polls on a BSP ticket, joined the INC in 2016 alleging sale of tickets in the BSP.

Along with the State president, the Grand Old Party has also appointed six regional presidents under a new formula to keep caste and regional balance in the politically crucial State that has 80 Lok Sabha seats, where it has been out of power for 33 years. This shows in the appointment of Nasimuddin Siddiqui, Nakul Dubey, Anil Yadav, Ajai Rai, Virendra Chaudhary and Yogesh Dixit as regional heads, as all of them are from influential caste or religious groups in their respective regions.
