Another day in New York City another robbery This time though the act was more heinous than your average heist In this instance a man stole a purse from an year old woman who offered to give him money seemingly believing he was homeless In the video posted online after the incident the year old can be seen staggering The perpetrator remains at large The most striking aspect of this crime is how devious it is This culprit did not take from a person capable of defending themselves instead he chose an easy victim an elderly woman in a highly vulnerable state to make matters worse she was attempting to give the man charity but was robbed instead This act of petty thievery is the most wicked one can commit It demonstrates this person s lack of morality and is likely representative of the numerous criminals who prowl the streets of New York City It is an absolute disgrace that these crimes are occurring in one of the world s most important cities These criminals have evidently failed at every turn are rarely educated and lack any obvious skills outside their capacity to defraud and assault people Guliani accomplished the goal of cleaning up the streets of New York City with tremendous success but it now appears that the city cares less about victims and more about criminals allowing the cesspool of crime to fill up once again
