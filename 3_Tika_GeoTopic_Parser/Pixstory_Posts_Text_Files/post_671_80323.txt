We might pray that Omicron is the last variant of covid which has again almost shut the world Hoping the next variation will not be as deadly WHO experts global agency is tracking four different versions of the variant across the world Describing the new COVID variants as the wild card a top World Health Organization COVID Technical Lead Maria Van Kerkhove has warned that the Omicron will not be the last one and the possibility of other new variants emerging can be very high During a question and answer session live streamed on WHO s social media platforms We know a lot about this virus but we don t know everything And quite frankly the variants are the wild card So we are tracking this virus in real time as it mutates as it changes But this virus has a lot of room to move she said Omicron is the latest variant of concern It will not be the last variant of concern that WHO will speak about The next one you know that will come hopefully it will take some time to get there But with the level of intensity of spread the possibility that we will have other variants is really high she said The big question is whether or not the future variants will be more or less severe WHO say we have to increase vaccination coverage but we also take measures to reduce the spread The key experts say that with right intervention the circulation will be low There however would be flare up among the unvaccinated people who are not protected by the vaccine or those with waning immunity WHAT DO OUR EXPERTS SAY Dr Neeraj Nischal Additional Professor of Medicine at AIIMS As long as the virus is multiplying and replicating there will always be a possibility of a new variant The next variant may be more infectious but will remain mild and not be as damaging as delta variant That s what we hope
