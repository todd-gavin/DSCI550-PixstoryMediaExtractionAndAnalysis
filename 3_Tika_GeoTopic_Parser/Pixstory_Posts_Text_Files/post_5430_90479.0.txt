Kristen Stewart, true to form, did not follow the rules when she arrived at the 2022 Academy Awards on Sunday night. In fact, the 31-year-old actress, who is up for Best Actress for her performance as Lady Diana in Pablo Larran's Spencer, created history by being the first person to walk the red carpet in formal short shorts. K-Stew finished the ensemble with a matching silky black blazer and a white shirt held together by a single button. (As shocking as it may appear, we wouldn't be surprised if she didn't wear a shirt at all.) Chanel, as usual—though she has admittedly ventured out to new houses and labels in recent months—provided the look. She donned stilettos as well, but there's a high possibility she'll ditch them for sneakers as soon as she exits the red carpet.

While Stewart's are definitely more daring, she isn't the only one who attends the Oscars in shorts. Although his were merely knee-length, Pharrell Williams made headlines in 2014 when he donned a similar suit to the Academy Awards. Demi Moore put him to shame 25 years ago when she arrived at the 1989 edition of the ceremony wearing bike shorts designed by... Demi Moore.
