Speakers of Shura councils and national assemblies of the Co-operation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) confirmed their support for the efforts of Qatar in organising and hosting the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022.
In this context, they praised the projects completed by Qatar and the measures it has taken to host this tournament, such as obtaining a Hayya card which has become an entry visa to a number of brotherly countries in the region; stressing that this event not only represents Qatar, but it is an event that all Gulf and Arab countries and the countries of the region are proud of it.
This was stated in the final statement of the 16th periodic meeting of GCC speakers of Shura councils and national assemblies, which was held in Muscat, Oman. The GCC speakers of Shura councils and national assemblies also praised the success of the experience of the first elected Shura Council in Qatar, under the wise leadership of His Highness the Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani.
The final statement also included affirmation and keenness to support the GCC’s march of co-operation and co-ordination among member states, in an effort to achieve the desired goals and objectives in support of joint Gulf action.
A number of decisions were also taken on the topics on the agenda, including reviewing the measures and steps taken to strengthen relations with parliaments and regional and international parliamentary federations, where the Supreme Council presidency was tasked with co-ordinating with the GCC General Secretariat to ensure the continuation of mutual visits with the European Parliament, and co-ordinating to hold a meeting between the councils of member states and the European Parliament. The final statement also included the selection of the theme of the role of the Gulf legislative councils in consolidating intra-investment and supporting the national economy to be the common Gulf theme for 2023, which will be discussed in the framework of the councils’ work.
