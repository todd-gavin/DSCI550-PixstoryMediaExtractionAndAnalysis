Skills vs experience 
A candidate’s skills often receive most of the attention. Indeed, they are showcased in their section on a resume. The well-qualified candidate possesses specialized knowledge and mastery of specific techniques, such as languages, software programs, technical procedures, and familiarity with various hobbies. 
Unlike skills, experience—more specifically, can not be taught by one person to another. Experience is acquired over time. Particularly for positions involving leadership and management, work (and life) experience are critical factors in developing the maturity to remain goal-focused without being emotionally attached to outcomes.
In my opinion, skills comes first and with practice of skills there is experience.
So conclude - keep learning, keep growing
