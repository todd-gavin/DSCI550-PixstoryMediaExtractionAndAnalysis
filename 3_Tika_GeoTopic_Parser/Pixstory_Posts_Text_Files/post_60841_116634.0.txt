This little patch of green mound serves as a stage for students and faculty for open mic days. It's quiet and empty in this picture but that's surprising because there's some or the other activity always happening here.

This place serves as space for artistic and academic expression and it's fun to attend the lively events that happen here. It attracts a lot of crowd during the lunch and activity hours we have so that class hours are not disturbed.

I usually sit in the undergraduate library adjacent to this place and eventhough I get distracted sometimes, it feels really great to indulge in the campus culture with students singing, beatboxing, dancing, participating in flash mobs etc. It's even better when the faculty joins in to spread the cheer. I love the camaraderie and how strangers come together most of the times to put up spectacular performances.

Do you have impromptu events happening on your campus? What do you enjoy the most?
