Novak Djokovic has just passed the second round that the post-match journalists&#39; questions are already projecting him to the next US Open where, given current American laws, he could not participate not being vaccinated. The Serbian tennis player did not withdraw and also responded with irony. unvaccinated person can enter US I had heard unofficially that someone got away with some person who is not famous but I would never try to go to US unless allowed The conclusion if they tell me I can&#39;t go I won&#39;t go I would never put myself in such a situation. Even if I went in, they&#39;d see me playing on TV and they&#39;d come and get me, he concluded laughing
