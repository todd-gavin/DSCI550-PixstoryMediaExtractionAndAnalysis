The popular touristy thing to do is to go to the dunes at Hundar and take a ride on a Bactrian camel which looks quite pitiful while molting Turtuk sounds inviting The name as much as the place I just love the name but I keep confusing it with Tobruk which is just a continent away Anyhow we headed in the opposite direction the next morning As with all worthwhile places the journey is as alluring as the destination The road runs initially in a seemingly straight line in the valley Suddenly it all curves to one side and the road ceases to be one It is not only that there is not a soul in sight but one can feel the isolation We make a picnic breakfast halt by the river and we spy this low small cloud at some distance in the valley and it seems to be raining in that teensy patch It is a clear day otherwise We keep a wary eye out ready to make a dash back to the car Other than the odd boulder there is no shelter After some time on the move again the path gives up any pretensions of being one sort of saying figure out your way At one place we navigate over a fresh mudslide rocks silt and all Slipping and sliding bumping over the half buried boulders I can say that we did figure out our own way In the warmer months this route along the Shyok becomes impassable with landslides and higher water levels I have been craning my neck and looking all over the mountain sides trying to catch a glimpse of some wildlife and finally I am rewarded with a fat Chukar partridge right on the road So much for making all that effort Suddenly we swerved off the main road Yes it magically appeared again into this gully and reach Tangsey in a bit I try to imagine the Shyok s journey upstream between those lofty peaks heading towards Daulat Beg Oldie Now that is again a name which sounds inviting Concluded
