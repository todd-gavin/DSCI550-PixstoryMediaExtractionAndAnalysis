If a child is socialized without understanding what gender is they will struggle to find their identity when they go to school and interact with other children What are your children going to say when they see other children behaving and talking a certain way And let s just say you raise them gender neutral what happens when they do want to be defined as a boy or a girl They re gonna have to change their entire life to fit in then And let s not forget that kids can be mean Other kids will make it harder for yours to survive through school They ll go through bullying and what not Ruining your child s life because of your fascination with genders is not fair
