Former Hollywood actress Marsha Hunt has died at age 104, according to The Hollywood Reporter.Parade reported that Hunt, who was famously blacklisted in Hollywood over her political activism in the 1940s and 50s, died of natural causes on Wednesday, Sept. 7, at her home in Sherman Oaks, CA. Hunt appeared in over 50 movies between 1935 and 1949, according to The New York Times, including roles in The Glamour Girls (1939), Pride and Prejudice (1940), and The Human Comedy (1943). She also landed multiple TV roles, including characters on Matlock, Murder, She Wrote and Star Trek: The Next Generation. The budding starlet appeared to be on the track to stardom when her career was derailed by the Hollywood blacklist after she protested the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), which was "seeking to flush communists out of the entertainment industry," per The Hollywood Reporter.
