IRAN

None of these arguments actually make much sense unless contextualised in terms of the upheavals in Iran over the 1941-1952 period, where the Soviet menace was much clearer. Iran had been occupied by the British and Soviet forces in 1941. Though a neutral country, this invasion was justified on the basis of securing the Lend-Lease agreement of western material to the Soviet Army. Iran was, however, not declared hostile, but rather an ally, with both countries pledging to respect the sovereignty and territory of Iran once the war was over.

However, come 1946, the Soviets refused to withdraw first demanding oil concessions in occupied Iran and then proceeding to create two nominally independent states—the Azerbaijan People’s Government based in Iranian Azerbaijan with its capital in Tabriz and Kurdish State called the Republic of Mahabad with its capital in Mahabad. In a cable sent on 6 July 1945 by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the local Soviet commander in northern Azerbaijan was instructed to “begin preparatory work to form a national autonomous Azerbaijan district with broad powers within the Iranian state and simultaneously develop separatist movements in the provinces of Gilan, Mazandaran, Gorgan, and Khorasan.” 

Consequently intense diplomatic pressure built up and UN resolutions 2, 3 and 5 passed in January, April and May of 1946 respectively reaffirming the territorial integrity of Iran. Having won the diplomatic battle, Iran proceeded to use military force to regain control of these northern republics. However, the fear of communism remained and the US had no compunctions believing Iran’s contention that it was in the front line in the fight against communism.
