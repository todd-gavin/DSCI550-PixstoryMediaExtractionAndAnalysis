Today s morning was full of Stranger Things I woke up to it from a dream where I attempted to switch off my realtime alarm The alarm had been ringing for eight minutes Does that mean that my dream self was trying to hit snooze for eight straight minutes As someone who loves to extract existential metaphors out of insignificance this was a perfect opportunity to contemplate competing realities But the truth is I ve spent too much time trying to catch up with the sci fi show Stranger Things and no matter how much I cover my eyes or fast forward the gory scenes the mild horror has seeped into my subconscious I am both glad and terrified to witness this elevated blending attempt carried out by my alternative universes
