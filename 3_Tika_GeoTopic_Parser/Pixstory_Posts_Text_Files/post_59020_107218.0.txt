The day was created to put forward global awareness of the need for blood products for transfusion, highlighting the critical contribution voluntary, unpaid blood donors make to national health systems and supporting national blood transfusion benefits in expanding their voluntary blood donor programmes.

Do you wonder why it is celebrated on this particular day which is ‚ÄúJune  14‚Äù  ??? 
It is celebrated on the birthday anniversary of Karl Landsteiner on June 14, 1868. Landsteiner was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the ABO blood group system.

Coming to talk about my experience with blood donation, I donated blood at my college during a blood donation camp. It was too scary for me because the one thing that I m terrified of is needles üíâ. But I did it because it would help some person who is in need. 
Or for a selfish reason that one day someone will help or donate for me when I m in need.
