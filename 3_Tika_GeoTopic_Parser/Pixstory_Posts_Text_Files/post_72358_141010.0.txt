Brahmastra has secured an impressive opening at the box office. But to meet the expectations of a demanding and fickle audience, the trilogy needs to live up to the scale of its ambition.

With a worldwide box-office collection of Rs 75-crore on its opening day, Brahmastra Part One: Shiva has heightened the Hindi film industry’s hope of ending the dry spell at the box office. The road to its theatrical release has been bumpy, notwithstanding the promise of a grand spectacle — with a cocktail of mythology, superpowers, technical marvels and star-studded cast — as boycott calls rang out loud. The first instalment of the ambitious trilogy, written and directed by Ayan Mukerji, seems to have deflected the barbs for now. The hectic multi-city promotion, which included temple visits, led by Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt, and bookings opening six days before the film’s release, have done the trick.
