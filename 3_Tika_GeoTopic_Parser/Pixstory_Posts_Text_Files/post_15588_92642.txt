If by now we are not surprised that natural products can be used to reduce cholesterol or triglyceride levels, the fact that plant extracts can contribute to the control of allergies is certainly a novelty. The addition of nutraceutical preparations could in fact allow for savings on drugs We have carried out some clinical studies on the subject, explains Gianluigi MARSEGLIA, Director of the Pediatric Clinic of the University of Pavia Policlinico San Matteo and President of the Congress together with Michele MIRAGLIA DEL GIUDICE of the Vanvitelli University of Naples who demonstrated how thanks to the use of neutraceuticals in children with allergic rhinitis it is possible to reduce the use of nasal steroid and antihistamine Quercetin and Vitamin D alongside normal anti-allergy therapy In the second group the standard therapy was combined with a placebo The number of days in which the children had to take antihistamine therapy was significantly fewer than those in the second group respectively and days These are natural antihistamines with a therapeutic activity similar to drugs but without particular side effects such as drowsiness and which can be used in an integrated way in the treatment of diseases such as allergic rhinitis concludes MARSEGLIA allowing savings on standard drugs such as nasal steroids and antihistamines Also the fact to dedicate space to this topic represents a particular aspect of the congress which, alongside the novelties from biological and molecular research, proposes useful indications in everyday medicine
