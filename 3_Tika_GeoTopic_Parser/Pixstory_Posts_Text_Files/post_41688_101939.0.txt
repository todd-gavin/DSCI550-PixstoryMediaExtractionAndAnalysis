At the Australian swimming championships, Olympic gold medallist Ariarne Titmus broke the women's 400-meter freestyle world record. 

US News reported that Titmus beat Katie Ledecky's previous record of 3:56.46 established at the 2016 Rio Olympics after finishing in 3 minutes, 56.40 seconds in the final at the South Australian Aquatic Centre on Sunday night. 

“It’s kind of nice now that I am not going to be asked when I am going to break the world record,” Titmus said. “I am the happiest I have ever been outside of swimming, I am the happiest I have ever been in my life in swimming. It’s definitely showing in the pool.”

Titmus won Olympic gold in the 400 and 200 metres before finishing second in the 800-meter freestyle final in Tokyo last year.

“I am definitely not putting the pressure on myself that I used to but it’s still a healthy amount,” the 21-year-old Titmus said. “That has been the trick to me swimming well. Just going out there completely fearless, swimming what I used to feel like when I was 16 and first cracked on to the national team and just going there and surprising myself.”
