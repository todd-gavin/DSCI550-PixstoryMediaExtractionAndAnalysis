Rahul Gandhi doesn't have a political person for guidance and his coterie largely includes foreign educated MBA graduates who have no connect with the people or the ground realities. 

Even at Sunday's CWC, a member pointed out how the workers from different states go back disappointed without meeting anyone in the party headquarters in Delhi as no office bearer sits there during his or her stay in the national capital. The member mentioned how in the past when there were only four general secretaries all of them would spend a considerable time in the party headquarters interacting with cross section of the people. Now, when there are nine general secretaries and 17 in-charges of states, no one is available to meet the workers who visit Delhi with the hope that they would be heard by the leadership. 

For the revival of the country's oldest political party, it is imperative to revive that communication link as also the top down approach and empower the leaders with ear to the ground.
