When the Australian Bureau of Statistics releases the March quarter consumer price inflation numbers on Wednesday, food costs will be prominent. Guardian reported that the so-called headline rate is expected to be about 4.5 percent, not far off the 5% rate last seen in 2008. 

According to the Commonwealth Bank, food prices alone will have nearly doubled their rate of increase in the first three months of 2022, compared to the 1.3 percent increase in the December quarter. Petrol prices, which skyrocketed in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, climbed about 10% in the quarter and are still high, despite a temporary drop in the fuel excise of 22.1 cents per litre.

Another effect of growing prices is that the Reserve Bank is running out of justifications for keeping the official cash rate at its record low of 0.1 percent. 

Other central banks, such as those in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, have already responded, and Australia's first rate hike in more than a decade isn't far away unless the CPI comes in unexpectedly low.
