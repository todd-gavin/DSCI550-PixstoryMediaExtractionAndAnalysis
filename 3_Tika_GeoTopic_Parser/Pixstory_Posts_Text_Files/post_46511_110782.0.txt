Before Saying Or starting with anything I simply wanna say - if you love Momos , Then This Is A Must try place for you ! 🥟❤️

Dolma Restaurant ! Loved their authentic Chinese food , especially the momos were soo much good ! What I found most interesting about this restaurant in the Tibetan colony was it appears to have the largest selection of Momos on its menu of all the restaurants . I being a momo lover went there and i was not disappointed . I was lucky enough to get both Bhutanese and Nepali momos . The difference was they were served with their traditional sauce/curry and just made the experience all the better . They did take a little time to be served , but it's all Ohky ! I Just love the whole environment of this colony and will definitely try to visit more often . I was extremely happy that i dined at Dolma House , a cool , fuss free food experience at Majnu ka Tilla . The momos were quite up to the mark ! Amazing food with authentic taste and is pocket friendly too ! Loved it ! ❤️🥟🤤

Momos are prepared deliciously with suitable mix vegetables . Apart from momos , you can try new dishes , and also get the help from the waiter if you are not sure about the taste of the food . The price for the food excludes taxes . The ambience created by the new faces of people from different places is another thing i enjoyed here . ❤️🥟🤤

Will try other dishes on my next visit . By the way every Wednesday they only serve vegetarian meals . 😍
