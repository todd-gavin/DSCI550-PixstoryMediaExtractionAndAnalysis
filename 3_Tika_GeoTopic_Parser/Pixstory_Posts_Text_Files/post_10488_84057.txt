It is hard to believe that this old dilapidated building in Delhi s Chandni Chowk once housed big international movie production houses such as Warner Bros Disney Sony Yashraj and Fox Known as Kamal Cinema Complex within the walled city the building also accommodated major multiplex chains such as PVR One of the reasons why these big film production houses had opted for this place is that all the major cinemas were at one point of time located in the walled city only The multiplexes started coming up across Delhi much later A few years ago the top floor of the building collapsed forcing the closure of the complex And with it all these big studios shifted to other places Some former employees of these studios have interesting tales to narrate from how they would maneuver narrow stairs to reach their offices to using unhygienic restrooms But they had fun too Now the entire complex is used as a warehouse for many businesses If you visit this place you will see people loading stuff going up and down At the back entrance there is a pan shop crowded with smokers Kamal complex is situated adjacent to the Moti Cinema movie theatre The walls on the first floor still have a few movie posters But that s all that remains of this place s rich artistic history This complex is yet another reminder of the forever changing Delhi a city that is loosing its heritage as time moves forward Do check the slides Olddelhidiaries by Hamza Khaleel
