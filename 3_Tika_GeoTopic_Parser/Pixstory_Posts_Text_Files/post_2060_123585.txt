The FBI today demonstrated that it is an arm of the Democratic Party and not a protector of the people This is unprecedented heinous conduct by the Department of Justice in concert with the Democratic Party They have exposed their true nature Donald Trump undoubtedly had his flaws but he cooperated with all of the investigations involving him and repeatedly demonstrated his innocence despite all of the claims brought against him Today is a terrible day for our nation It signifies the loss of civility dependability and confidence in our institutions Today they raided the home of a man whose sole offense was being a Democrat foe No matter how the WH nor the DOJ spins this federal agents raiding the home of a former president is as ugly as it is unprecedented All public trust of our institutions is threatened with this brazen and very visible act What did the Biden WH think would happen here We don t even know why but I doubt half of this country will care Lots more will be said about this in the coming days But let s just leave it that American trust of federal law enforcement suffered a major blow today
