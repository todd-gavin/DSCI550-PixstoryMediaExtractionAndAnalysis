Most artists put their pain in their work of art letting the people and audiences relate to it and feel cathartic Adele s music has the power to do it In her divorce album she portrayed and expressed her feelings and tried to heal from the emotions of separation from her partner When the album was released in November it gave the audience an art to relate to and feel the pain and emotions engraved in her music When we speak of music as part of catharsis we can t forget Taylor Swift and her strong lyrics that narrate a story giving the audiences a chance to heal and relate Channelling their emotions into creativity doesn t only provide the audience with cathartic art but also helps the artist learn about themselves and their feelings during the process That is how the whole process seems interesting Rod Thomas known musically as Bright Light Bright Light says channelling difficult or trying emotional states into his music has helped him find balance while bringing him to a more positive and healthy place I used my last album Fun City as a way to express troubles facing the LGBTQ community as well as celebrating some of our love and achievements says Thomas The idea of knowing what you re expressing in your art is not confined to music and even poems are a way of expressing one s emotions It could be an elegy mourning the loss of a friend or even something portraying a deep rooted feeling of dismay or anger The way art offers catharsis and healing is ineffable and the best way to heal is to connect with art or artist
