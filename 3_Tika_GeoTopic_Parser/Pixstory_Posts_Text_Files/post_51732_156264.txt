Update on Diogo Jota s injury from Jurgen Klopp Liverpool is anxious to learn the full extent of Diogo Jota s latest injury because they are concerned that the forward may have to miss more time Deep into the extra period of Sunday s Premier League victory over Manchester City at Anfield Jota lost consciousness while gripping his right leg and later left the field on a stretcher The Portugal international missed the opening six weeks of the season due to a hamstring injury that returned in July The year old is already a significant doubt for Wednesday s visit from West Ham United and will now undergo scans to determine the severity of the issue Klopp said Diogo I wish I didn t have to talk about it I saw it on the sideline on the screen the witness said I saw that he went down and there wasn t much contact Jurgen Klopp may have discovered it in the most direct way imaginable in his tireless hunt to try to change Liverpool s season Any victory over Manchester City can never be considered to be completely comfortable but the goal that completed the victory at Anfield was shockingly simple It might very well be the turning point in a season that has so far been hopelessly injury plagued low on confidence and miserable What do you think about his future after the injury Let me know in the notes ThankYou
