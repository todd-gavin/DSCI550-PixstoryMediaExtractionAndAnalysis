With the Multiverse Saga introducing a whole new era of heroes and villains to the MCU, Hollywood talent is constantly signing on for major Marvel roles. Phase 4 has already brought plenty of A-list talent into the fold, including several actors from Disney's next biggest franchise, Star Wars, such as Oscar Isaac, Alden Ehrenreich, and Richard E. Grant.

Now, fans have begun speculating which other Star Wars actors may be up for Marvel roles, with Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Adam Driver all having had their names thrown around. Over the years there have been various rumors pointing to each of these stars joining the MCU such as Ridley for Spider-Woman or Driver in an unknown role, but Boyega is the latest name to enter the fold.

Recently, reports circulated to suggest the sequel trilogy's Finn actor had filmed scenes for a Marvel project in secret, but sadly, Boyega has put those rumors to rest.

In a recent interview with Men's Health, Star Wars' Finn actor John Boyega responded to a report from Giant Freakin' Robot claiming he filmed scenes for an upcoming Marvel Studios project in secret.

Boyega told the fitness outlet that a Marvel role is "not in the vision for [him] now" as he instead wants to "do nuanced things" that offer "fresh ideas"
