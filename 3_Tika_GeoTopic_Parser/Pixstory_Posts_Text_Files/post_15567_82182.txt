The results of a study conducted at the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research IRCCS were published in the authoritative journal Cancer Research The data showed that some ovarian tumors have high levels of two proteins that regulate the activity of the mitochondria, the energy center of cells This peculiarity makes them sensitive to a new class of drugs, thus opening up new therapeutic scenarios. This is an important result for the development of new therapeutic strategies for a type of tumor which is among the most difficult to cure. In fact, the survival rate for women with ovarian cancer still very low and aggravated by a silent development that often leads to a late diagnosis when the disease is in an advanced stage and has already given rise to metastases In recent years, explain Carmen Ghilardi first author of the article and MariaRosa Bani head of the Tumor Metastasis Therapy laboratory it is understood that mitochondria can be a potential therapeutic target so much so that numerous inhibitors are under development Mitochondria are the organelles involved in cellular respiration and in particular in the process called OXPHOS which is fundamental for the production of energy The study conducted in cultured cells and laboratory animals with ovarian tumors has shown that the inhibition of OXPHOS is not equally effective on all tumors. In fact, tumors whose progression is delayed by treatment are above all those characterized by high levels of PGC and PGC proteins which have precisely the function of regulating the activity of the mitochondria Dwelling on the numbers concludes Raffaella Giavazzi coordinator of the study the research has shown that in the sample analyzed there are about 1 patients affected by ovarian cancer with high levels of PGC and PGC proteins Now it is necessary to confirm that the results obtained in our preclinical models are transferable to patients in fact for some of these patients the possibility would open up of benefiting from treatment with OXPHOS inhibitors and being able to count on an additional weapon to counteract tumor growth The study was mainly supported by the AIRC Foundation for Research on the Cancer
