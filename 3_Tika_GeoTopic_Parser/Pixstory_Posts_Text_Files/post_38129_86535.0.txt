Real Madrid fans created a heavenly atmosphere at the Santiago Bernabeu!

The Madridistas created an unforgettable atmosphere inside the stsdium. From welcoming the team bus to chanting for the entire 90 minutes, the Madrid fans gave their all!

Their efforts finally paid off as Los Blancos pulled off a historic win at the end of the 90 minutes.



Karim Benzema played a special game for Real Madrid!


The Frenchman came into his own in the second half when his team needed him the most. Karim Benzema scored a hattrick in seventeen minutes as the Paris Saint-Germain side did not understand what hit them. 

This special performance proved how important the Frenchman has become in the past couple of seasons for Los Blancos 


Kylian Mbappe was Paris Saint-Germain's best player….by far! 


With all the talk of Lionel Messi and Neymar's partnership before the start of the season, Mbappe's contribution was somewhere forgotten. But the Frenchman has proved in both the legs why he is the best player at the club currently.


The Frenchman's performance was really exciting to watch in both the legs of the fixture. Hence, the Real Madrid fans would be licking their lips in anticipation as they hope to see Mbappe wear their jersey next season! 


Paris Saint-Germain's summer signing's fail!


PSG signed Lionel Messi, Georginio Wijnaldum, Sergio Ramos, Achraf Hakimi, and Gianluigi Donarumma in the summer. Out of these, only Hakimi looks to have been a worthy signing for the Parisians. 


Sergio Ramos didn't play both the legs against his former team owing to a calf injury while Lionel Messi was a shell of his former self against Real Madrid. Whereas Gianluigi Donarumma and Georginio have not been utilized to the fullest by the PSG manager throughout the season.
