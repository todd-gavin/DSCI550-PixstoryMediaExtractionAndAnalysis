The Taliban have prevented the departure of dozens of female American university students from Afghanistan. These students were on their way to Kazakhstan and Qatar. It is said that the Taliban allowed the boys to fly, but prevented the girls from leaving and told them that girls do not have the right to travel without Muharram.
Witnesses say that these girls returned to their homes with anger and tears.
This performance of the Taliban shows the full equality of women in every supply in Afghanistan
