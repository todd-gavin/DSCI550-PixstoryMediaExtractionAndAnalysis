Juventus have announced the signing of Poland striker Arkadiusz Milik on a one-year loan from Ligue 1 side Olympique Marseille. 

The Polish international agreed a deal with  Juventus on an initial loan deal worth €2 million and a buy option can be activated the following season for a fee in the region of €7 million.

In a statement published by Juventus on Friday, the club confirmed the signature of the 28-year-old saying; “Milik is a striker, who, in addition to having extraordinary physical strength, is skilled in aerial play and is above all very dangerous in the penalty area.”

Barcelona’s Memphis Depay has been the Serie A giant’s primary transfer target in the attack but upon several days of deadlock negotiations, they switched interest to the pursuit of the Ex-Napoli forward. 

The Bianconeri have been looking for a back-up striker to Dusan Vlahovic in the transfer market, and they have settled on the Polish player.

Arkadiusz Milik has netted 30 times  and provided three assists in 55 appearances for Marseille.
 
He also returns to the Serie A where he made more than 120 appearances in all competitions and scored nearly 60 goals during an almost five-year spell at Napoli.
