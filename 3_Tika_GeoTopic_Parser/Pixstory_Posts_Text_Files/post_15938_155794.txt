Abstract Background Maximum willingness to pay WTP for a health benefit is connected to perceived value This two center study aims to analyse diabetic patients WTP for obtaining a specific preventive treatment package to reduce severe diabetic complications and determine the factors that impact this value Methods This cross sectional research included diabetics from two cities in Iran The WTP for a preventative package minimising major diabetes complications cardiovascular renal ocular and diabetic foot by and was tested using eight scenarios The Diabetes Attitude Scoring Questionnaire DAS was used to examine patient attitudes toward diabetes To determine WTP a two stage hurdle method was used The level of significance was fixed to Results Around of people interviewed mean age stated they wanted to pay for a diabetes prevention package This package s WTP varied from to depending on the complication and degree of risk reduction The largest value diabetic patients willing to pay for preventative packages that reduce the chance of blindness was reported while the lowest cost was stated for the diabetic foot WTP is influenced by wealth location of study marital status and attitude toward special training but not by the type of diabetes inpatient or outpatient setting or the complications diabetes patients are impacted by Patients diabetes attitudes were mainly negative The score of the attitude of patients towards diabetes was generally suboptimal Conclusion Most diabetic patients were willing to pay for a preventive package and this value was not affected by the type of diabetes and its severity Our research found that diabetic individuals are willing to pay the most for a preventative package that reduces the chance of blindness and the least for diabetic foot care WTP can help health officials allocate resources and manage budgets The attitude of diabetic patients toward diabetes still needs further interventional research however Sources
