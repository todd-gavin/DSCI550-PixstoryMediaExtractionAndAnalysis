Dreams that we have while sleeping is not that Dream I'm talking about.
Dreams that don't let you sleep is what I'm Talking about.

Inside our head we all have a dream to follow to reach that destination. 
If we don't have any dream I will end up now where, we'll just lost in our thoughts & in the real worlds.

Someone said, If you don't try to make your dream come true then anyone else will hire you to make their dream come true.
