My mother's food is heavenly, be it a recipe-followed made dish or one she made off her own talents. But, my absolute favorite of them all would have to be her Chinese cuisine dishes: Honey Chilli Potato, Momos and Noodles. Oh, how healthily delicious and finger-licking these delicacies made by her hand are! Everytime she makes them, I have a good day and a happy stomach. Not only is the cuisine so appetising and flavoursome in ways that are good for our gut, but the way mom makes them, with her added love and dedication, it makes them the best plates of food in this world.‚ù§
