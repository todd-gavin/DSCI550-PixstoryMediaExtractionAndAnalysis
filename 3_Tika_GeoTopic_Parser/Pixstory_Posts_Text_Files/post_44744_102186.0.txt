Red Coral—The Gemstone of Mars/
the God of War continues....

Red Coral for Pisces Ascendant

In this ascendant ruled by the planet of good fortune and knowledge—Jupiter, Mars becomes a potent and a significant planet. It becomes a key planet for this ascendant because it is the lord of the 2nd house of wealth and the 9th trine house of fate and fortune. Those individuals in whose horoscope Mars is posited in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 9th, 10th or 11th house should wear a red coral for life. The red coral blesses with wealth, accumulation of assets, divine grace and dawn of fate and fortune.

When to Wear Red Coral gemstone

One should always consecrate a gemstone ring or pendant and wear it in the most potent time frame selected according to electional astrology. The red coral gemstone should be set in gold or silver and be worn in the ring finger. It should be worn on a Tuesday in the nakshatras of Mrigshira, Chitra, Anuradha or 
Dhanistha. If these nakshatras do not occur at the time required and it is 
important to wear the red coral then wear it on any Shukla Paksha (waxing 
moon period) Tuesday in the Hora of Mars. Alternatively one should consult 
an astrologer who would take out an auspicious time for wearing the Red 
Coral as per the horoscope.

Metal and finger to wear Red Coral for astrological benefits

The metal in which the gemstone is set is an important factor to get good results for the gemstone. This seat is like the throne of the planetary lord whose gemstone is being worn.

The red coral gemstone should be worn in gold or silver in the ring finger or the ring after prana pratishtha (consecration).

The red coral can also be worn in the neck as pendant touching the thymus gland area (just above the first rib bone). The chain of the pendant can be of gold or silver. Adjust the chain as per your height so that the gemstone 
touches the thymus gland area.
