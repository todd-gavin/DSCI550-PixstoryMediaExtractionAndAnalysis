Meet year old Jagaraniya and year old Chunni They are the guardians of mango orchards in their village in Chitrakoot district This sounds like a job that would belong in a listicle of dream jobs But no it is anything but that The most dangerous jobs in the world perhaps yes The lowest paid jobs in the world certainly yes Jobs with the longest working hours yes yes yes In this video we follow Jagaraniya and Chunni s life at work their workday is hours long they are on the job round the clock The pay is not in wages but in kind a third of the mango yield of the farm There are zero office perks in this job There are no leaves or breaks Only elderly women who are unable to engage in wage labour due to their age are eligible Without training or equipment women have to be on their feet x and deal with human and other wilder miscreants Any damage to the mango crop will have to be borne by the women In case of a bad year such as this one is because of an early summer and unseasonal hailstorms Jagaraniya and Chunni will get no mangoes at all despite all their work Jagaraniya and Chunni are also de facto heads of their households as the men in their families have migrated to other cities for better jobs Since that money trickles in slow intervals this the caretaking of mango orchards is the job that pays their bills helps run their households and feeds them womenatwork auratonkakaam leaningin butatwhatcost primaryearners mango mukhiya
