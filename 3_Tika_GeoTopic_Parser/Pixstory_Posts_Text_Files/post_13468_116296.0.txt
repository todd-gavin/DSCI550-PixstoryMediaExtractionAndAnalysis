The name of Afghanistan has always been linked to war, blood and violence, and when most people hear the name of Afghanistan, they are reminded of war and violence.
But Afghanistan is still a land of beauty and attractions, most of its natural beauty has remained untouched. A country where every corner has its own climate and beautiful natural charm.
