"The situation should have been rectified long ago as apex pay scale continues to be granted in a rather adhoc manner and in many cases officers had to approach courts but the situation hasn't improved a bit,‚Äù said a retired director general rank officer who wished to remain anonymous as his case for apex pay scale is pending too. He got an order from the Central Administrative Tribunal in his favour but the government still continues to deny him the apex pay scale.

Another curious case is of the post of secretary. security, who is administrative head of Special Protection Group, the force that guards the Prime Minister.

Normally, an Indian Police Service Officer is given charge as the secretary, security. But sometimes Indian Administrative Service Officer too have held the post.

"Now the post of secretary, security too has been added in the list of top 11 IPS at the centre to be given the apex scale. Interestingly, in case if an IAS officer is given charge as secretary, security, he or she gets apex scale but not an IPS officer if he or she is not among top 11 IPS officers at the centre ," said IPS officer who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
