The allegation surrounding the backdoor appointments in various wings of the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir is slowly snowballing into a controversy that is threatening to expose the skeletons in the closet of the J&K High Court. Taking cognisance of the seriousness of the issue, the Supreme Court on September 2 issued notices to the Jammu and Kashmir High Court. 
The Probe spoke to several affected individuals who claim they have lost out because of such illegal appointments. The petitioner who approached the Supreme Court in the matter is the Srinagar-based NGO, the Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Forum. 
“Since the last ten years, we have filed nearly twenty Public Interest Litigations to highlight the grievances of the public. This is an extremely serious case. Judiciary is the last resort of the common man. It is shocking that this kind of corruption is happening in our judiciary. We were completely taken aback when we came to realise that these backdoor appointments were going on for several years,” says M.M Shuja, Secretary General of Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Forum.
On September 2, while hearing the case, the Supreme Court bench comprising Justice D.Y Chandrachud and Justice Hima Kohli stated: “The petitioner has levelled serious allegations about backdoor entries while appointing persons to the administrative staff of the establishment of the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, the District Judiciary, the State Judicial Academy and Legal Services Authority. Specific averments have been made in paragraph 10 of the writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution to the effect that relatives of existing members of the staff as well as of present and former Judges of the High Court have been appointed without following a due process for selection.”
