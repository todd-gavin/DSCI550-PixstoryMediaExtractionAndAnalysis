During lockdown the only vehicle that made ‘noise’ was cycle . In gated societies, even if one had to run errands or God forbid incase of emergencies when no car was allowed. The good old cycle came handy. 
As Kashmiris we knew the value of this grandpa time vehicle during unrests. When petrol pumps were running out of petrol and no cars were allowed out, cycle was the saviour . 
After a while people just took to cycling .
Some rode to their work. 
There was a police officer who would be seen riding a bike early mornings and making friends with fellow bikers. A journalist colleague would do so. 
I always wished I could do the same. But let me tell you a secret I am one of those rare exhibits who can neither ride a bicycle nor drive a car. I rode pillion many times. 
Anyways 
Wish I could do that,  weight lost would have been better and it’s best for not only your health but also for the health of the planet. 

So all you people who can ride. Let’s bring the cycle back . 
As an addition
