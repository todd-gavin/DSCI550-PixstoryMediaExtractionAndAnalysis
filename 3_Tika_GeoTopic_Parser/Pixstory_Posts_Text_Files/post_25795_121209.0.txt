One thing is important, no parent can come up to us and say we want milk, the request has to come from the hospital/neonatal ICU. The donors are mothers who may be making more milk-most mothers make enough milk for two babies so they can donate milk. Some donor mothers are those who may have lost their pregnancy or premature babies and this donation makes them feel good about saving lives.
I am sharing pictures to explain the process.

We just need to remember. This liquid gold or superfood that can save a life is now being made available through Delhi-NCR’s first human Milk-“Amaara”.

Say yes to Amaara, say yes to life!
