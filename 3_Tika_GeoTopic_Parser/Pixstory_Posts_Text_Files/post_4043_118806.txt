Tea have always been a perfect one when it is accompanied with fritters Especially during a rainy day they are just pure bliss Tea alone also is a mood shifter When we are distressed happy sad a company that we can always rely upon A goodbye to the headaches could be through a tea This is totally my cup of tea
