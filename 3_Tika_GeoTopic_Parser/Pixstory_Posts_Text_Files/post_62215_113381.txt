A number of studies have suggested that meditation can reduce the symptoms of PTSD particularly in war veterans These studies show that meditation reduces stress hormones by calming the sympathetic nervous system which is responsible for our fight or flight responses to danger The first and foremost thing is to find a therapist who can guide you through your trauma Next is find the time and the place to meditate You should only meditate at a time when you re comfortable and only in places where you re comfortable Meditation helps us disassociate our identity with those events and makes us see us as more than just survivors
