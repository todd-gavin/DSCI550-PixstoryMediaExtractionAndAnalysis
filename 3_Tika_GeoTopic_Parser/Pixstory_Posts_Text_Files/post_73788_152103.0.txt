Do you remember this song ? 
Ek baar to suna hi hoga (you must have heard it atleast once ) well if not you can listen to it now ! 
Ichak dana bichak dana from the film shree 420 . The song is delight to lisyen to and the picturization is just as pretty.
It describes the playful nature of yhe male lead and establishes the firm , strict nature of the female lead . 
Sung by Mukesh , lata Mangeshkar, music by Shankar Jaikishan and lyrics by Hasrat Jaipuri.
