A research was conducted in which Scientists follow a junk diet in which they gave six men a diet of pizza and burgers and within days they were more than 7lb heavier and showing the early warning signs for diabetes.
It took just two days for their bodies to go haywire and show signs of serious disease.
At the start, three of the men were a normal weight, three were overweight and none were obese or unhealthy .
They were all on bed rest throughout the study.
In a week, they had gained an average of 3.5kg (7.7 lb) and showed signs of insulin resistance, the forerunner of diabetes. Half of the population are suffering from diabetes or are pre-diabetic. And the vast majority don't know.
Boden (one of the scientists) states "In that time, the men gained an average of 3.5 kg and showed signs of insulin resistance as well as oxidative stress,â€œ the team wrote in a science journal. By day two, all had a rapid and continuous rise in both blood insulin and insulin-resistance levels. It is truly a wake-up call for us all that all of them suffered severe systemic and adipose tissue insulin resistance in such a short span of time."
