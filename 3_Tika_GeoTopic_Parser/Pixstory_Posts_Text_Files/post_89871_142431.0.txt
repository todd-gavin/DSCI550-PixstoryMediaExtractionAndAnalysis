Hills can heal you⛰️
People who reside in the mountains are often happier and healthier because there are a ton of benefits that come from life among the clouds.

Nature, Nature, Nature
We’ve been going on and on about nature, but that’s because it’s such an important aspect of living in the hills or mountains. It’s great to be close to it because it’s in our DNA, and seeing life helps you remember to live it. Constantly encountering different sounds, smells, and noises trigger the brain different than city sounds, and it all acts to sooth your nerves.
Clean, Fresh Air
Not only are mountain towns usually located right in the middle of vast expanses of nature, but there aren’t many cars or industrial areas to add any nasty gasses into the air. This gives your lungs the opportunity to breath in oxygen in the form that your body craves, and you don’t have any nasty additives flowing through your body.
If that isn’t enough, there’s also scientific evidence suggesting that life at high altitudes can lead to healthier hearts. Everyone knows that a healthier heart provides many benefits, and one of the most noteworthy is a longer life. Who wouldn’t want more years to experience beautiful views on a daily basis?
Active Lifestyle
Living in the mountains gives an almost unlimited amount of opportunities to experience the great outdoors. This is important because being out in nature helps in many different ways
 It relieves the stress we feel every day, it builds up our happiness, it boosts our energy, and it gives us a more positive outlook on life. City dwellers tend to spend a lot of cash joining gyms or paying transportation costs to get to exercise areas, but mountain life can give you the world right out of your front door. Literally.
