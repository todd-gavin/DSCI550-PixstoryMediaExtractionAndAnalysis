I guess I might have puked in my mouth a little.

Lol, kidding! (Or not?) But I'm so impressed by this marketing campaign! I'm a big enthusiast of all 'out of the box' marketing ideas and this does qualify, even though it's a little gross.

At the Cannes Lions Festival this year, Oumph! won the Silver Brand Experience and Activation Lion for its "disruptive" Plant-based Human Meat campaign developed by LOLA MullenLowe for Halloween 2021.

Oumph! was one of 1,919 entries in the category, and according to reports, it was the only plant-based brand to win an award for creative brand development through customer engagement and experience. It was also one of AdWeek's top 5 plant-based campaigns of 2021.

Oumph! invited the public in Stockholm to try the first plant-based burger that resembled human meat as part of a publicity stunt. The Oumph! plant-based Human Meat burger, which was developed to show that it is possible to create plant-based products that taste like any meat, was primarily made of soy, mushrooms, and wheat protein.

So...would you try that? ðŸ‘€
