Happy yoga day from all three of us. 

Celebrated on June 21, International Yoga Day celebrates the physical and spiritual prowess that yoga has brought to the world stage. 

My Favourite Yoga Aasana -  Dhanurasana, or bow pose, has been named after the shape the body takes while performing this asana, which is that of a bow.

Dhanu’ means bow and ‘asana’ means posture or pose. Just as a well-strung bow is an asset to a warrior, a well-stretched body helps keep you flexible with good posture. It is that determination and consistency that you will explore within yourself as you smoothly move into Dhanurasana.”
 
Dhanurasana mainly focuses on the spinal column, and, when it’s done with full intent, it strengthens your back and abdominal muscles.
