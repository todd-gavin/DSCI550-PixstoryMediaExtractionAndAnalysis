For any production business, the career of a six-time NBA champion and five-time regular season MVP is always interesting. Idris Elba, who has starred in shows such as 'The Wire' and 'Luther,' is one of Michael Jordan's biggest fans. On Complex's 'Sneaker Shopping' episode, he detailed how and why the former athlete declined his offer. 

According to Marca, during his interview, Elba revealed that he met Michael Jordan on multiple times and attempted to make an offer to him:

â€œWe met and I told him: 'I want to play you,'" Elba detailed. It is a proposal that always finds the same response from the former Chicago Bulls player.

"Hmm, I'm not ready yet,'" Jordan declared. "That's what he said: 'I'm not ready yet'.... But I was very serious," Elba explained.

Since his departure from the NBA, Michael Jordan has been able to move on. His current net worth is believed to be at 2.46 billion euros, with only 6% of that coming from his NBA contracts with the Chicago Bulls and Washington Wizards.
