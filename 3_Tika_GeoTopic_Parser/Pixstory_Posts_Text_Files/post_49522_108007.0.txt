As the Amazon Prime original The Boys' third season dropped, fans couldn't be more thrilled. It isn't anything out of ordinary for the series to be trending once it's out, every season. However, the new addition to the show has been turning a lot of old and new heads. Soldier Boy â€“ the Captain America parody of the show. Jensen Ackles, who plays that character, has been getting a lot of appreciation from the audience since the beginning. And when I say, a lot of appreciation, I mean, a LOT of appreciation. Episode 4 of this season which aired on June 10 for most people featured Ackles naked and that apparently crashed Prime Video. A lot of people were having trouble with the platform.

Not a lot has been revealed about Soldier Boy yet and he's piquing people's interest. Apparently, the audience can't "get enough of him" and honestly, I can see why. He's been phenomenal in what we've seen of him so far. There's no trace of Dean Winchester in this role, which is expected but is also a pleasant surprise considering we've been seeing him playing the same character for 15 years whole.
