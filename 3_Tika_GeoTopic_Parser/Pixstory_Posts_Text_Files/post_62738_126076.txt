You re right about the part where you said culture influences kids That s the whole thing These games are a part of the American culture just like anything else I think it ll be ignorant to say that video games don t influence a youngster s personality especially after stats prove how many violent teens have been playing video games that are based on violence The difference between a violent movie which I also believe plays a significant part in influencing a culture and a violent game is that you re the one in control in games You re not watching someone else s story You re the main character who is using violence for whatever reasons Now I m not saying all games do that or it happens to all players I m not even advocating for banning them I m just saying it would be a pretty tone deaf take to say video games that romanticize violence do not contribute to violence
