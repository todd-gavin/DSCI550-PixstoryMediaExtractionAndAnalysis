My Heart Leaps Up
By William Wordsworth

My heart leaps up when I behold
A rainbow in the sky:
So was it when my life began;
So is it now I am a man;
So be it when I shall grow old,
Or let me die!
The Child is father of the Man;
And I could wish my days to be
Bound each to each by natural piety.
– William Wordsworth
Wordsworth is known for her verbose language and here he had decided to be kind to the readers. Wordsworth,s wonder about the rainbow is the same when he is old which makes him realize that much hasn’t changed growing up. We are defined by our childhood what we see and experience is the core of our personality simplified in the words the child is the father of the man. The rainbow is nothing other than a bridge that connects poets to the spiritual self. He wishes never to lose touch with nature even if he grows old. The theme of childhood is another important aspect of this piece.  We are unconditionally bounded by our past.
