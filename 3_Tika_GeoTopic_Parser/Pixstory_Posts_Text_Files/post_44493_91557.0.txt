In Group B, England is matched with the former Brighton midfielder's country, the United States, and one of Scotland,
 Ukraine, or Wales, with England and Iran meeting in the tournament's second game.

 Jahanbakhsh, who played three seasons at Amex Stadium before joining Feyenoord last summer, agrees the group will be "tough," but believes Iran will be well prepared for the event.

When asked whether he wanted to be paired with Gareth Southgate's side, he told Sky Sports News: "Not really, to be honest! England was the last team I would have picked, but it happened!

"England could easily have three top teams in the World Cup right now, they're really well organised with the manager. They've worked together for a long time now and they know their strategy.

Iran is ranked 21st in the world, having won both Asian qualification groups for the last two World Cups. They have never played England before and,according to Jahanbakhsh, individuals who are used to warm winter weather will be more suited to the conditions in Qatar,with the 28-year-old predicting some unexpected results at the event.

Iran qualified for the World Cup by scoring 25 out of a possible 30 points in qualification, finishing ahead of tournament regulars South Korea, which boasts world-class talent like as Heung-Min Son.

"I would say collectively we are a very good team," he said. "We have some good individuals as well but over the last three or four years, we've been on top in Asia so we're well respected there.

"We've got one of the best generations of players in our country ever so I think this team can do our country proud and put us in the history books.
