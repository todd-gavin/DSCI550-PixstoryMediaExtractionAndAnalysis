Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav addressed investors on Aug. 4. He confirmed that the corporation had "restructured" to form a team with a "10-year strategy focusing just on DC". A lack of specifics, as well as some mixed signals, has created an atmosphere of confusion. DC Comics' "Batgirl" has been cancelled, but a sequel is still in the works.

The film was supposed to be watched on television, not a wide screen, so it lacked the kind of massive set pieces that may have boosted its score. The idea of launching straight-to-streaming DC-branded pictures looks to have been abandoned or at least jeopardised. Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav cited Marvel Studios as a blueprint for DC's future in an earnings call. Greg Berlanti has been mentioned as a possible candidate for the role.

The integrated film and TV storytelling style of Marvel Studios would be difficult to achieve at Warner Bros. Zaslav Zaslav remains committed to his vision of a single DC vertical led by an executive reporting directly to him. Until that post is filled, Hamada will oversee DC Film under Abdy and De Luca, the latter of whom has impressed executives with his understanding of comic book arcana.
The decision to discontinue "Batgirl" appears to have been the final straw, prompting Hamada to consider resigning. De Luca and Abdy persuaded him to stay at the studio at least until the October release of "Black Adam". The decision to keep Hamada appears to be totally up to the administration. Zaslav intends to turn DC's film and TV initiatives into a singular, MCU-style creative venture. This affects plans for a slew of TV shows, including one centred on Colin Farrell's Penguin.

Live-action DC shows "Titans" and "Doom Patrol" will be renewed after new seasons premiere later this year. J.J. Abrams' ambitions for a Justice League Dark series, which would be an Avengers-style programme starring DC characters from the titular team, are still in the works.
