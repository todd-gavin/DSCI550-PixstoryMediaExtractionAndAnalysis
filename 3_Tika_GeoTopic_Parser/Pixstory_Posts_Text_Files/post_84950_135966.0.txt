AC Milan have completed the signing of Sergino Dest on a season-long deal from Barcelona. An option to buy the right back is also included in the agreement. Alessandro Florenzi suffered an injury in AC Milan’s midweek draw against Sassuolo. This seems to have played a huge factor in the club pursuing a move for the Dutchman.
Dest came through the ranks at Ajax and played his part in winning the Dutch Supercup with the Eredivise side. The 21-year-old moved to Barcelona in 2020 and made 72 appearances for the side and helped the Catalan club win the Spanish Supercup. Dest was heavily linked with Manchester United in the last couple of weeks and a reunion with former manager Erik Ten Hag was on the cards until United announced Aaron Wan Bissaka would remain at Old Trafford this season. This led to United not pursuing a deal for Dest.
The youngster was also linked to Villareal but AC Milan completed the deal with Barcelona for the right back. Given Florenzi’s injury, Dest is expected to come into the team and start for AC Milan in Serie A. This transfer further highlights Barcellona’s financial woes as Dest becomes another player to be offloaded by the Catalan club. 
The club’s president Joan Laporta has resorted to activating a number of ‘economic levers’ to help the club register new signings this summer. Hector Bellerin is set to join Barcelona after the club agreed on a deal with Arsenal after the Spaniard is set to be Xavi’s preferred choice at right back. This means game-time would have proven to be difficult for Dest at Barcelona therefore a loan deal to AC Milan makes sense for all parties.
AC Milan will have an option to sign Sergino Dest on a permanent deal next summer for 20 million euros.
