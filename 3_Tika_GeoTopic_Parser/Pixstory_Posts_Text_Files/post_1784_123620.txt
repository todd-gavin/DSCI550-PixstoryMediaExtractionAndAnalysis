The ancient Greek philosopher Zeno proposed a set of philosophical problems he called paradoxes One of the most famous is the Race Course Paradox Suppose Atalanta wants to walk to the end of a path Before she can get to the end she must get half way to the end And before she can get to the end from the half way point she must first get half way to the end from there And so on infinitely According to this reasoning Zeno said it would be impossible for Atalanta to ever get to the end of the path No matter how close she got to the end she would still have to first go half way Over the centuries there have been many proposed solutions to the paradox The solution proposed by the philosopher Democritus involved his most famous contribution to western thought atomism Democritus argued that the universe was composed of tiny indivisible particles called atoms He proposed that once Atalanta reached a distance that was only one atom from the end of the path then the distance could no longer be divided in half and voil the paradox was solved Democritus s proposed solution to the Race Course Paradox hasn t been particularly well received but his atomic theory of the universe has It corresponds more closely to modern science than any other such theory of the ancient world Democritus died around the year B C Because of his propensity for laughing so much due it was said both to the fact that he highly valued cheerfulness and because he saw the absurdity of human folly in everything in his day Democritus came to be known as the Laughing Philosopher The image is the Dutch painter Hendrick ter Brugghen s painting Democritus done in
