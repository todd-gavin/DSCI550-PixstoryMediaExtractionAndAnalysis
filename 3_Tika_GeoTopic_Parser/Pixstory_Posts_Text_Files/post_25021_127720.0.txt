Two players who tested positive for prohibited substances during the World Cup qualifying process received four-year doping bans from FIFA.

In a statement released by FIFA on Monday, FIFA noted that Sabri Ali Mohamed of Djibouti tested positive for testosterone after a 4-0 loss to Algeria on November 12 and striker Erick Alejandro Rivera of El Salvador tested positive for clostebol after a 3-0 loss to Canada on September 8. Both Djibouti and El Salvador were unable to earn a spot in this year's tournament in Qatar.

El Salvador ended up 7th in a group of 8 in the Qualifiers amidst the controversies. They ended up winning just 2 out of their 14 matches and lost 8. Canada, Mexico, the USA and Costa Rica were the qualifying teams from the group. On the other hand, Djibouti competed in the African Qualifiers alongside Algeria, Burkina Faso and Niger in a group of 4. The team neither won nor drew a single match, they lost all their 6 games and came last. It was Algeria that qualified from the group undefeated, with 4 wins and 2 draws. 

Both players had been provisionally suspended after the reported incidents respectively. According to FIFA, they have not challenged the decisions and are ready to face the consequences. FIFA said Rivera is banned from all matches until October 5, 2025, while Mohamed is suspended until January 11, 2026.
