After sealing the Â£20 million deal of midfielder Joao Palhinha from Sporting Lisbon, Fulham has made their first summer acquisition. With a five-year contract and a club option for an extra year, the 26-year-old Portugal international will remain at Craven Cottage at least through the summer of 2027.

Palhinha, who apparently caught Wolves' attention, made 33 appearances and scored three goals for Sporting last season across all competitions.

Palhinha on joining Fulham: "I'm very glad to be here. It's a big opportunity for me, for my career, to play in what is - in my opinion - the best league in the world.

"I've signed with a great club. The club wanted me, and I chose the club, so I promise the fans that I will do my best, and I hope we can win so many things in this season."

On August 6, Fulham plays Liverpool at Craven Cottage to celebrate their return to the Premier League. The west London club may face Fabio Carvalho, a former player. The 19-year-old completed his transfer from Fulham on Sunday after it had been announced in May that he would be joining Liverpool.

The Portuguese forward will report for the first day of preseason practise on Monday after agreeing to a five-year deal with Anfield. For Jurgen Klopp's team, Carvalho, who was born in Lisbon before migrating to England as a child with his family, will wear the number 28 jersey. He will join fellow summer newcomers Darwin Nunez and Calvin Ramsay at Anfield.

As a player who injects personality into his performances as well as being self-assured and daring with the ball to create opportunities, Klopp praised him as a wonderful talent.
