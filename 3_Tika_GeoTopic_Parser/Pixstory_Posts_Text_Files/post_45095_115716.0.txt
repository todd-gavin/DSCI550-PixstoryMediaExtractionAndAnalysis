The 21-year-old attacker transfers to us from Hull City in the Sky Bet Championship for an undisclosed sum. A club option for an additional year is included in the six-year contract that he
has signed.

Keane finished his physical late on Monday, July 11, and he will soon join the group in Germany
for a preseason training camp.

Following the acquisition of Aaron Hickey from Bologna this
summer, Keane is the second addition to our First Team roster.

The England Under-21 international has made a name for himself in the starting lineup over the
past 2.5 years after rising through Hull's development ranks. He was only 18 when he made his
FA Cup debut in the early months of 2019 and spent the 2018–19 season on loan at Bradford
Park Avenue. He joined the Hull squad in late 2019 and has played in nearly all of their games
since.

The 2019–20 Championship season saw Keane make his first appearances for Hull, most frequently as a substitute. He contributed significantly to Hull's League One championship the
following season, scoring 15 goals in all competitions. In that successful Hull squad, Keane
played all over the front line and scored 13 League One goals, winning the EFL Young Player of
the Month award for September 2020.

Keane maintained his excellent form in the Championship and was a mainstay for Hull in the
second division last year, playing all but one minute of the team's league campaign. He scored
one in a Carabao Cup loss to Wigan Athletic and 12 goals in the Championship.

Keane gained four caps for England's Under-21 team after advancing through the ranks. When
England qualified for the UEFA European Under-21 Championships, which will take place in the
summer of 2019, he scored once for the team.
