Why is it relevant in the US? The nation continues to experience drug-related deaths increasing day by day. According to the latest interim data published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 106,854 people died due to drug overdoses in the 12 months ending November 2021.

President Joe Biden's first National Drug Control Strategy was put forward by the White House. The strategy has mainly two motives: addressing untreated addiction and drug trafficking. It is said to prioritize harm reduction, access to substance use disorder treatment and the disruption of drug trafficking organizations and will ensure maximum data collection related to drug policy.
According to The director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, Dr Rahul Gupta, "The most important action we can take to save lives right now is to have naloxone in the hands of everyone who needs it without fear or judgment, especially today when 3 out of every 4 overdose deaths are happening from opioids". 

Opioids are a major cause of drug overdose deaths in the United States. While deaths involving heroin have declined in recent months, deaths involving synthetic opioids have nearly creased over the past two years. We know the harm drug abuse can cause in the country and this strict regulation is most necessary at the moment in the US. Hope Congress will show a green card.
