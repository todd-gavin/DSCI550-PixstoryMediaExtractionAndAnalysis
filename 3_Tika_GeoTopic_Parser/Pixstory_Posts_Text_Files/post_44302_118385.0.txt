Bukayo Saka has reportedly been given a lucrative deal by Arsenal in exchange for committing his future to the team. The 20-year-present old's contract with the North London juggernauts is set to expire in the summer of 2024, and over the past six months, there has been much conjecture about his future.

The attacker, who is largely anticipated to be a member of the England team that travels to the 2022 World Cup, is claimed to have fans in Manchester City and Liverpool.

Gunners head coach Mikel Arteta recently stated that it was just "a matter of time" before an agreement was made over a new term, indicating that Arsenal has been trying to persuade the teenager to stay at the Emirates Stadium.

The attacker has reportedly been given a long-term deal by Arsenal, making him one of the highest-paid players at the team, according to the Daily Mail and Saka's pay under the new proposed agreement would increase to about £140,000 per week, and Arsenal are optimistic about the future of the Englishman.

The attacker's desire to play in the Champions League has caused problems for Arsenal during initial negotiations. Arteta's team finished fifth in the Premier League last season, which will cause them to compete in the 2022–23 Europa League. Man City is thought to view Saka as the ideal Raheem Sterling replacement.

Saka was in excellent form for Arsenal during the 2021–22 season, making 43 appearances across all competitions while tallying 12 goals and seven assists.

In 38 Premier League games, the young player scored 11 goals and contributed seven assists. He has now played 131 games for the Gunners across all competitions, making 131 appearances and tallying 23 goals and 29 assists.
