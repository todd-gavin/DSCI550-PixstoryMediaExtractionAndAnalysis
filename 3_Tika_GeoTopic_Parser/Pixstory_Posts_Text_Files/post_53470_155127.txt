On September after a nine month journey through the Solar System NASA s Double Asteroid Redirection Test DART mission impacted an asteroid called Dimorphos NASA scored a bullseye with DART roughly the size of a vending machine hitting Dimorphos within of the metre asteroid s centre The hit changed the orbit of Dimorphos around its bigger companion asteroid Didymos by more than minutes far exceeding the original goal This is the first time humans have deliberately changed the motion of a significant Solar System object The test shows it s plausible to protect Earth from asteroid impacts using similar future missions if needed An astonishing featThe successful mission is an astonishing feat of science and engineering In the final phases of approach before impact DART autonomously steered itself to the impact site processing images onboard the spacecraft and adjusting its trajectory without the intervention of humans Many telescopes on Earth and an Italian spacecraft that tagged along with DART were able to obtain amazing images of the impact Even small telescopes captured spectacular views showing an enormous plume of debris from the impact that developed into a trail now following the asteroid through space The DART mission was the first test of planetary defence the use of a spacecraft to change the trajectory of an asteroid In the future such a technique could protect Earth from asteroid impact if we detect an asteroid on a collision course with us By changing the direction of an asteroid when it is far from Earth a collision could be avoided Read more
