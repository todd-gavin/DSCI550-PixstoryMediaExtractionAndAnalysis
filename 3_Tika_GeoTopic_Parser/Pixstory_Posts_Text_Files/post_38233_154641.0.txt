Erling Haaland has been on fire in the Premier League this season. The Man City forward has scored an astounding 15 goals in just 9 PL games this season. He is the outright leader in terms of the PL golden boot, but can anyone stop him? 
Mohamed Salah, Hueng Min Son, Harry Kane, and Cristiano Ronaldo come up as the best options to outscore the Norwegian. However, none of these players have been able to match up to Haaland. 
Ronaldo has just 1 PL goal this season as the United forward has hardly been utilized by Ten Hag. Liverpool's Salah has also had a slow start, scoring just 2 whereas Hueng Min Son's only accomplishment has been the hattrick that he scored against Leicester City last month. 
Harry Kane is the only player that has had a somewhat decent start as the forward has scored a respectable 8 PL goals in 9 games to kick off the 22/23 campaign. Kane is currently second in the race for the golden boot. But given Haaland's form, it looks unlikely that he will catch up with the Norwegian anytime soon. 
Other honorable mentions go out to Foden, Mitrovic, Firmino, and Toney who have scored 6 goals each in this campaign. Can any of these forwards catch up to Haaland at the end of the campaign?
