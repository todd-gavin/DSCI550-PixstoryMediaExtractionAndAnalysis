The effects of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v Wade might be equally disastrous for those attempting to conceive through assisted reproductive technologies such as IVF In Vitro Fertilization in addition to being catastrophic for women seeking abortions across most of the country The notion that life begins at fertilization and that the embryo must be protected at all costs is the foundation of many arguments against abortion Multiple sperms and eggs are mixed in cell culture during IVF in order to facilitate fertilisation before being delivered to a uterus Not all of the embryos are utilised So yeah if you as a male think Roe v Wade does not or cannot affect you think again Not only can it give you an unwanted child but also take away your opportunity to become a parent It s all of our fight
