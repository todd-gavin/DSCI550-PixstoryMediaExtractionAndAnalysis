Animal agriculture weakens and depletes fertile soils by being one of the main causes of worldwide deforestation.

Meanwhile, planting and raising a variety of plants and trees can reverse the effects of nutrient depletion, nourishing and cleaning the soil for more sustainable agriculture.

Science shows also that there is less B12 in our soil than ever before, meaning even non-vegans should be considering a B12 supplement.
