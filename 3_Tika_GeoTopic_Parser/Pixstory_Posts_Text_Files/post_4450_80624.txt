Among the seven days of the week Friday is the day when Allah s Special mercies are granted It is a day of gathering for the Muslims and rewards are increased Many great events took place on this day and yet to take place Allah has blessed us a complete surah about Jummah Surah Al Jummah Surah Al Jummah or Surah Kaif should be recited on that day after or before the Zohar prayer as its written in QURAN that by reading this surah we will be protected from all the sins throughout the week On the day of Jumu ah is an hour during which Allah gives to a Muslim servant standing in prayer whatever he asks for Al Bukhaari and Muslim The Messenger of Allaah said The best day the sun rises over is Friday on it Allah created Aadam On it he was made to enter paradise on it he was expelled from it and the Last Hour will take place on no other day than Friday The charity given in this day is more virtuous than the other days of a week The Messenger said Charity given during the day of Jummah is greater in reward than any other day It is a day on which sins are forgiven as narrated by Salmaan Ra who narrated that the Prophet said Any man who performs Ghusl on Friday perfumes himself if he has perfume wears the best of his clothes then goes to the mosque and offers as many prayers as he wishes while not harming anybody then listens quietly while the Imaam speaks until he offers the prayer will have all his sins between that Friday and the next forgiven Al Bukhaari Any Muslim who dies during the day or night of Friday will be protected by Allah from the trial of the grave At Tirmithi and Ahmad JUMMAH MUBARAK
