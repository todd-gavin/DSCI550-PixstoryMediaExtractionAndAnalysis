Everton signed midfielder James Garner after Manchester United accepted their offer.
After missing Eric ten Hag's first-team plans this summer and being sold earlier this month, the Toffees have won a battle to sign the 21-year-old just before the transfer window closed on Thursday. Garner is set to finalize his move to Goodison Park and Manchester United have reportedly accepted a deal worth as much as £15 million.Everton are said to have made an forthcoming payment of £8million, with United It incorporates the sales policy for the England under-21s.
Garner stated to Everton TV: "I am prepared to sign for Merseyside. This is a big step in my career and I want to help the team get better as I progress as a player. Everton is the autocratic place for that. I think you can get started right away."
Garner began his career at Manchester United's academy at U8 level and gradually progressed. He made his first-team debut at the age of 17 against Crystal Palace. He was loaned out to Watford in September 2020, but was recalled in January 2021 after falling out of favor with new manager Cisco Munoz, who will be back for the second version of his season in 2020–21. 

Ten Hag joined Garner in United's pre-season trip, but the midfielder picked up an injury after the first training session and played just 23 minutes in the final of four matches in Thailand and Australia. The £60million signing of Casemiro has intensified even in United's midfield after being told he could leave the side in mid-August.

Garner has made just seven first-team appearances for United, and has come on as a total of nine minutes in two Premier League games. He made 41 appearances last season to help Forest escape the Championship, but another loan spell at the City Ground was made impossible when United decided to call up Dean Henderson at short notice.
