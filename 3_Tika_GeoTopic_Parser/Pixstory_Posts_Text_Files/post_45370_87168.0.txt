Cole, regarded as one of the best left-backs in Premier League history, came through Arsenal's youth system and made his first-team debut at the age of 18.
Cole was upset with Arsenal's offer of a new contract after helping the Gunners win two Premier League titles and three FA Cup wins, which opened the way for his move to Chelsea.
Arsenal had requested £25 million for Cole, but the defender ended up joining Chelsea for £5 million, with William Gallas joining the Gunners in the reverse direction.
Arsenal should have done more to keep Cole at the club, according to Wenger.
'Well, I would say personally, most of the time, the players gave us seven, eight, nine years and then left,' Wenger said when asked to pick one player he would have loved to have re-signed during his time at Arsenal.
‘The younger generation like [Cesc] Fabregas we lost early and would not have loved to lose him.
‘The player I think we, internally, it was a mistake to lose was Ashley Cole.
‘Because he was playing at nine, 10 years old for the club. I knew with Fabregas that taking him away from Barcelona, at some stage he’d want to go back to Barcelona.
‘But Ashley Cole came out of the club. I think it was a misunderstanding over a few thousand pounds.
‘At the time, we spoke about [Roman] Abramovich when he came into the game, Ashley Cole is one of the few players who developed even more and continued to develop when he left.’
Cole is the player who put his life on the line to join Chelsea. He placed his reputation on the line in order to win trophies and further his profession. It's been a huge success.
Roman Abramovich's name comes to mind when we ponder how Chelsea has ascended to become English football's most successful club since 2005. The same may be said for Mourinho's.
