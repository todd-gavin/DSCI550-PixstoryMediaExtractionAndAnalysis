Polish parliamentarians passed a resolution calling on countries around the world, especially European institutions, to support Afghan women who have lost their rights. At the same time, a number of women protested the presence of a Taliban delegation in Switzerland, chanting "Women and girls are not safe in Afghanistan."

According to First News in Warsaw, a resolution passed by a majority vote in the Polish parliament states that "with the usurpation of power by the Taliban, women are at risk of losing fundamental rights such as education, employment, health and "Personal freedoms are at stake."

This week, the Taliban delegation began its second European trip to Switzerland, where, according to the Foreign Ministry, it will discuss human rights and humanitarian assistance with Swiss Foreign Ministry officials and non-governmental organizations.

The delegation's trip was followed by protests from some women and the Afghan political representation in Geneva. Mursal Ali, one of the protesting women, posted her photos on Facebook in front of the Royal Hotel in Geneva, where the Taliban's residence is located.

In a slogan, Mursal called on Switzerland and other countries not to recognize the Taliban government; This is an issue that the Polish parliamentarians also agree with
Protesting women, as well as reputable international organizations, say the Taliban have systematically isolated women and forcibly deprived them of their rights since taking control of Afghanistan in August 2021.
