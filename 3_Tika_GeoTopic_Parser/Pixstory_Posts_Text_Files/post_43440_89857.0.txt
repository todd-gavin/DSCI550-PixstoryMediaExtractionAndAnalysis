Doja Cat said that she is quitting her music career on March 24 in a series of tweets in which the hit singer expressed her frustration, going so far as to change her Twitter handle to the pointed “I Quit.”

“It’s gone and i don’t give a f–k anymore i f–kin quit i can’t wait to f–king disappear and i don’t need you to believe in me anymore,” Doja then wrote in the early morning hours of Friday. “Everything is dead to me, music is dead, and i’m a f–king fool for ever thinking i was made for this this is a f–king nightmare unfollow me.”

For context, Doja was supposed to play on the opening day of Asunciónico Festival in Paraguay — but it ended up being canceled because of flooding due to a major storm. Some people subsequently appeared annoyed that Doja didn't interact with fans outside her hotel while she was in Paraguay or post about the canceled festival online. And from there everything escalated.

We don't know whether it's temporary or permanent. We'll have to wait and see to find out what is going to happen.
