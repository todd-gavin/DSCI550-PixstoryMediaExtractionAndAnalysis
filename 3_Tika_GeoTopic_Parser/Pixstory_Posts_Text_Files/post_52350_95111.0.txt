This iconic, low-cost Australian food was once a staple of road workers and bushrangers. Initially, it was the most basic of recipes. The soda bread is made with wheat flour, water, and a pinch of salt, then baked over a campfire and served with a swig of rum or billy tea. It can now be a little fancier, with milk and self-raising flour.
