It s no secret that binge drinking can lead to a variety of health issues ranging from liver damage to an increased chance of cancer However most people would not consider a nightcap every evening to be a significant health risk New study reveals that even one drink per day might cause noticeable alterations in the brain while it s unclear if the alcohol is to blame A single daily drink on the other hand complies to the US Department of Health and Human Services national dietary standards which recommend two standard drinks for males and one drink for women per day A regular drink consists of ounces of beer ounces of wine or ounces of liquor Is it possible however that even this small amount of alcohol has an effect on our brains Researchers looked at functional MRI brain scans from healthy adults in the United Kingdom ages to and compared the results to the participants weekly alcohol consumption accounting for differences in age sex height socioeconomic status and country of residence among other things They did find however that they could distinguish between brain scans of persons who never drank alcohol and those who just drank or drinks per day The authors write in Nature Communications that consuming merely one alcoholic drink daily or two units of alcohol could be related with changes in gray matter and white matter volume in the brain Going from one to two units of alcohol roughly a pint of beer was associated to brain changes that resembled two years of age Apart from comparing the changes to aging it s unclear what the findings signify until the scientists undertake more research which will include looking at the genomes of study participants Nonetheless the findings raise the question of whether national standards should be reconsidered and whether it s preferable to limit your evening drink to a half glass of wine
