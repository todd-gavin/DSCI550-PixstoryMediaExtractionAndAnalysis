The newly released fourth season has grabbed tremendous attention from the audience; people call it the darkest season with the most hidden secrets revealed this time.
"There are a sense Stranger Things is building toward its endgame, mining the biggest evils yet from the depths of the Upside Down to push its young, nerdy heroes. Season 4 is an ambitious feast that runs the risk of being overstuffed. Yet ultimately, it hits the sweet spot of '80s nostalgia, the most charismatic cast you could ask for, difficult moments rooted in real-life suffering and the Stephen King-influenced CGI machinations," reported by a media website.

To enjoy and even comprehend the goings-on of this mammoth season, one has to be a legit fan of all the upside-down madness that has made historic strides since its Netflix debut back in 2016. It had all started with the disappearance of a young boy in a small town that had unleashed a terrifying reign of supernatural forces and introduced them to a strange little girl, who came to be known as Jane Hopper, aka Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown).

Ultimately, it all counts down to the volume 1 finale when all the high-tension horror reaches a fever pitch, leaving us looking forward to what's next. While the jury is out on how much is too much, there's no such thing as too long for the fans of this strange franchise.
