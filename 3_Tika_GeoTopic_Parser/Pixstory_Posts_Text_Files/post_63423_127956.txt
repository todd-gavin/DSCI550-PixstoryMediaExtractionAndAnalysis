The Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Elon Musk has said on Tuesday that he wish to purchase was buying Manchester United football club The billionaire made it known via his Twitter handle in the following words I m buying Manchester United ur welcome Albeit Elon Musk is used to making jest via his Twitter page a concrete evidence buttressing his tweet is yet to be seen But considering the timing of the message when Manchester United are in a dilapidated and deplorable state where every aspect of the club has capsized and needs a rapt resurgence an element of truth can be inferred from the wordings of Elon Musk
