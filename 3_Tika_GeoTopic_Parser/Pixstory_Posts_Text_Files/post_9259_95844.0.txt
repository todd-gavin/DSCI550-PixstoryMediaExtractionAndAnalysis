Greetings to all on the 400th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Teg bahadur Ji.

Do you know?
It is said that as the news of the birth of Teg Bahadur spread, Guru Hargobind, the 6th guru, himself went to see the child and as soon as he saw him, he predicted "Of my five sons, he shall take the of five of Guru. He shall protect the weak and relieve their distress. This shall be his principal mark."
