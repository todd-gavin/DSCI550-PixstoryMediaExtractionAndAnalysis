Australia cricket legend Shane Warne has died at the age of just 52 after suffering a suspected heart attack, his management has confirmed.

In a statement, Warne's management said: "Shane was found unresponsive in his villa and despite the best efforts of medical staff, he could not be revived.

"The family requests privacy at this time and will provide further details in due course."

Warne is the greatest leg-spinner of all time, having taken 708 Test match wickets, a figure only surpassed by Sri Lanka's Muttiah Muralitharan.

He also took 293 One-Day International wickets and made more than 300 appearances for Australia across all formats.

Affectionately known as ‘Warnie’ and adored by millions across the globe, Warne is considered by many as the greatest bowler to ever play the game.

A huge loss for the cricketing world.

May his soul rest in peace!.
