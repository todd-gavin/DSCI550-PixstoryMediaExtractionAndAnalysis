Nothing lasts forever including the stars in our night sky One of the brighter and more notable stars in our sky is Betelgeuse the bright red supergiant in the shoulder of Orion In late astronomers around the world grew giddy with excitement because we saw this giant star get fainter than we ve ever seen it before Since Betelgeuse is at the end stages of its life there was some speculation this might be a death rattle before the end But the cause of the great dimming wasn t entirely clear until now New preprint research awaiting peer review led by Andrea Dupree from Harvard Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics has used the Hubble Space Telescope to help uncover one of the biggest astronomical mysteries this century the cause of Betelgeuse s sudden strange behaviour A star on the brink of death From this latest research it was discovered that in Betelgeuse likely underwent an enormous surface mass ejection SME An SME happens when a star expels large amounts of plasma and magnetic flux into the surrounding space We don t fully understand what caused this SME but if they have similar progenitors to the coronal mass ejections we ve seen on our own Sun they might be caused by the destabilisation of large scale magnetic structures in the star s corona Four panels of artistic drawing of Betelgeuse First panel a small burst on the surface of the star is seen On the nd the material has begun to leave the star the rd shows the material dark as it cools It is suspected that Betelgeuse lost a large part of its surface material in this remarkable event In fact the amount of material ejected is the single largest SME event we ve ever seen on a star in modern astronomy What is truly remarkable is that Betelgeuse ejected billion times more mass than a typical event on other stars This is multiple times the mass of the Moon pushed out at incredible speeds Read more
