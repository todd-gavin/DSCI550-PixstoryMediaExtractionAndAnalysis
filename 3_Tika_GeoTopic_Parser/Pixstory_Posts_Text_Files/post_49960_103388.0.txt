‌The Mental Health of American teens is very confusing at the moment. The teens are confused about whether to protect themselves using guns or to fight against guns. With the trends of America- more affinity to teens will be towards guns-promoting more violence in the name of self-protection. 
‌
‌The recent events wherein some students even saw the death of their classmates or acquaintances. Can we even guess the mental health of the students at this point? They would be having an impending fear of death or else will have developed a vigorous attitude as a defence mechanism.
‌
‌Teens in America with the contestant threat and fear of guns at a very small age to overcome it thinks to get arm-enhancing the dangerous chances to repeat this toxic cycle of violence. Guns are never good for a society-especially in a modern society where children get influenced by arms and technology. Guns never fail to provide both. Even parents are in an attitude to arm their children so that they can save themselves-recent events clearly have shown the attitude of the police which wrecked the trust parents had in them. 
‌
‌Before handing over guns to stop guns-realise nothing has been good and satisfying with violence-it always pays a price and in this case, it will be the death of many more innocent lives. Hence gun is not what we need at this moment. Raise your children and make them sensible to use guns least as possible only at the time of self-defence. 
‌
‌Teens should also be given proper care for mental health as we don't need citizens who wish to pay back for the violence but who wish to eliminate it.
