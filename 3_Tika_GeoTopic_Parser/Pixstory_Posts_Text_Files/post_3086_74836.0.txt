An uplifting picture of Mustafa El Nezzel, the limbless Syrian child with his father Munzir who had to amputate his leg because of the civil war, went viral and stirred emotions worldwide.

In fact, the picture taken in January 2021 by Turkish photographer Mehmet Aslan was declared the photo of the year at Siena awards last year. (https://www.ansa.it/english/news/general_news/2022/01/21/limbless-syrian-boy-mustafa-arrives-in-italy_54e4cdba-a11b-4e54-b3d5-3ef0ca6d8bf7.html)

The photo was taken in April 2021 in the Turkish province of Hatay, where the Nezzel family stayed. (https://www.italy24news.com/News/348450.html)

After an effort by the photographers of Siena, the Nezzel family is in Italy and the family will have a new life in the country.  Mustafa, 6, was born limbless because of an aerial bombardment with chemical weapons in Syria.

Both father and son will soon get prosthetics in Bologna. It all began in 2016, when Munzir and his wife Zeynep, at that time pregnant with Mustafa, were at a market in Idlib, in Syria when he lost his limb in an air raid by the government forces. The dropped chemical weapon meant that Mustafa was born, suffering from tetra-amelia , a rare syndrome that results in the absence of limbs.

Soon after the photo won the award, the Siena Awards Festival started a crowdfunder online fundraiser, raising about 100 thousand Euros. According to a story of New York Times, the organizers of the event contacted the diplomats, hospitals, rehabilitation centers and the Catholic diocese of Siena to organize the trip to the city.

Now the family will have a shot at life away from the war-torn country.
