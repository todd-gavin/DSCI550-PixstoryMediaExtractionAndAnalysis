Table Mountain, Afrikaans Tafelber, is a flat-topped mountain in southwestern South Africa, overlooking Cape Town and Table Bay and dominating the northern end of the high, rocky Cape Peninsula. Its tabular shape results from nearly horizontal layers of sandstone exposed by vigorous wind and water erosion. The distinctive-looking mountain is one of Cape Town’s most recognized landmarks and is a popular tourist attraction that offers hiking, camping, and other activities.
