The impostor is a pretender who tries to deceive others, but the impostor would never consider himself a fraud, even if they're involved in fraudulent activities.
But what if you're not an impostor but still feel like a fraud?
This condition is called impostor syndrome.
It is an internal experience in which an individual doubts their "skills, talents or accomplishments and has a constant internalised fear of being exposed as a fraud".
Despite being able to achieve their goals and success, these people would relentlessly think that they don't deserve it as they're not competent.
They even think what they're portraying to others is a complete fraud, deceiving them.
The term was first used in 1978 when the psychologist Pauline R. Clance and Suzanne A. Imes in their article.
When it was first introduced, the research was conducted among women and was thought to be expected in high-achieving females. But later, it was found that the syndrome occurs in both males and females.
