But you have your most vivid dreams during a phase called REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, when your brain is most active. There are many theories about why we dream, but no one knows for sure. Some researchers say dreams have no purpose or meaning. Others say we need dreams for our mental, emotional, and physical health.
