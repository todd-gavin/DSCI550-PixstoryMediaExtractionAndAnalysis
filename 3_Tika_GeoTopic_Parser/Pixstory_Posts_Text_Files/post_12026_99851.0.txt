North Korea have reported its first Covid case and a strict national lockdown have been imposed. 

The state media reported an Omicron outbreak in the capital, Pyongyang, but the number of cases haven't been stated yet. 

When North Korea was offered with many kinds of vaccine programme, it rejected the supply of vaccine by other countries. 

It sealed the borders and didn't record a case but experts believe that the virus has been long present in the country. 

The 25 million population is prone to the virus as they lack the Covid 19 vaccine programme and there are great concerns about the impoverished healthcare system of the country. 

New covid rules have been laid down through a meeting. 

Sealing the foreign borders, the country was one among the firsts to do so during January 2020. This led to stopping the essentials to be supplied which led to food shortages and a faltering economy. 

"Maximum emergency" are the orders from Mr. Kim. For virus controlling localised lockdowns and gathering restrictions in workplaces are some methods to be followed in the coming days. 

The North Korea news outlet have added that the first case of Omicron variant was detected in the capital four days ago. 

According to NK News, a Seoul-based monitoring site,Â  the residents in the capital have been under lockdown for two days before the current announcement
