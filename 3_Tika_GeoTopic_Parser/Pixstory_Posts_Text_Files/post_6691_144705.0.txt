A video of a cleric molesting a woman in the garb of performing a ritual has been shared widely on social media. The video captures an elderly man, allegedly a cleric, on camera drugging the woman and molesting her while she is unconscious. Later in the video, the woman claims to have been referred to the cleric by a neighbor for treatment of infertility. The men behind the camera whisper concerns over the elderly man’s actions before confronting him. The video has been posted by verified Twitter handles of news portals and journalists.
