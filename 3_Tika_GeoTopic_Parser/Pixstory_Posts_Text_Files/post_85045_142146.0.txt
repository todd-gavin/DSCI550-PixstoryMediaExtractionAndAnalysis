There is one crucial yet undermined aspect of how nations can promote sustainability, that is, using behavioural economics. This field of study is pervasive in scope and vast in potential.With the use of right nudges, incentives, creative feedback mechanisms and marketing strategies that can be aligned with effective institutional policies, we can produce a much-needed lifestyle change.
