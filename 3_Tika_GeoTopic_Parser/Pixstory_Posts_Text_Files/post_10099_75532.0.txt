As Biden’s first year in office comes to an end, he’s seeing his lowest approval rating yet in POLITICO/Morning Consult’s weekly polling: 40% approval, compared to 56% disapproval. That’s worse than Trump’s 44% approval in early January 2018, roughly a year into his tenure.

Only 2% of those surveyed did not have an opinion on Biden’s first year grade. The poll of 2,005 registered voters was conducted Jan. 15-16, with an overall margin of error of 2 percentage points.

One area where Biden got the worst marks was also one on which he campaigned most heavily: restoring a sense of unity within the country. 4 out of 10 survey respondents gave Biden an "F” thus far.

However, Biden did get the biggest proportion of "A” grades (18%) for his handling of Covid-19 in 2021. Yet, that subject also showed a large partisan divide as rising case rates ravage the nation. About 37% of Democrats gave Biden the top mark for his pandemic response, compared to just 3% of Republicans — with independents falling squarely in between.
