I handle a team called Soccer N Me, which consists of males, I coach them for free. Every year the players keep on changing as some players get married, or take on jobs, the younger ones remain in the team. I give the players who are above the age of 21, a clear cut picture of whether they can take on football as a career or not. Some of them go on to become referees some of them coaches if they're passionate to be a part of the sport. Even when I was in Pune I was coaching 20 underprivileged girls I was pretty clear with them as well about taking up football as a career,  some girls of that team play in the IWL now, some have become D - Licence coaches and even referees. So, they've made up their careers in other avenues related to football.

It is really necessary for a coach to be a guide for the players and show them the path that fits their capabilities. It was a difficult journey for me to reach where I am now because of not getting proper guidance earlier on and that's why I try to help my players find their calling. I am always honest to my players about whether they can make it as a professional football player or not and if that's not the case I tell them.
