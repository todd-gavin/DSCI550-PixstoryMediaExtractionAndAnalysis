Super sub Gundogan !!!


It was his day like Aguero in 2012. De Bruyne proved why he was selected as Player of the Season, with a brilliant assist in the critical moment of the game. Gundogan came on as a substitute at 68th minute. The German was waiting at the far post when Sterling’s floated cross flew down and headed in. Rodri made it 2-2 with an inside placing shot for a cross from Zinchenko. Gundogan scored his second goal from a cross by De Bruyne. That ensured their 4th title in 5 years. 



Thiago’s touch


What a great touch it was, that made Mane through to the goal, and made it 1-1 !!! Thiago was receiving the ball, marked in the opposite direction, he used the ball’s speed to touch the ball with the inside of his foot and beat the marking player.




First ever home win for Crystal palace vs Manchester United in Premier league era 


Shame went on till the last day for Manchester United. They were beaten by Crystal Palace, making it the lowest ever points gathered by the Red Devils (58). Cavani started and super player Ronaldo didnt play the match. Thanks to De Gea, otherwise the score would have been 3-0 for Palace. 


Son 2, Salah 1


The Korean Son started the match with 21 goals and Mohamed Salah with 22. Son scored the last two goals of the Spurs when they thrashed Norwich for 5-0. Salah, who got a bit slow in the race towards the finish, scored one and both shared the golden boot award. 



Relegation Escape for Leeds !!!


Sergi Canos celebrated his equalizer for Brentford by taking off his shirt, against Leeds United, which became vital in the fate of Leeds. Canos got the first yellow for this.

This was their first win in the last 5 matches and 8th goal scored after 90 minute. Leeds narrowly survived, finishing 17th, Burnley, Watford and Norwich City got relegated.
