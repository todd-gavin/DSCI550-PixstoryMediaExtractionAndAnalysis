What a day it was today. I met the best people—met someone truly special and inspirational to me. Went to a conference organised by Newslaundry and I met my icon Abhinandan Sekhri. He really is the reason why the media in this country still has its last strand of credibility intact.

It was humbling to meet him—though brief—but man, was it some dream come true. I normally am not someone fanboying or going gaga over famous personalities. My career involves dealing with famous personalities. 

But this was different. It was Abhinandan Sekhri after all. It was a long-time desire of mine. He’s one of the best people and because of his mind, I really look up to him as a mentor though he may not know that. 

2022 has been kind to me as I have been able to meet two people who I am in complete awe of in the world of media and the press. The first being Barkha Dutt and second being, the man mentioned above. The third being the legendary Bob Woodward.

The list is endless, believe me! But man, what a way to go to London. I was hoping to catch Mr Sekhri before leaving India and boy, I did it.

The conference was amazing and insightful. But more importantly, a major tick mark on the list as I met a person who continues to inspire me to stay on in this profession. There’s hope. And maybe the media scene is not as f***ed up as it is as long as there are people that say no to the toxic, hate-spewing BS in the name of news.

I guess enough fanboying for now!
