On an unfortunate day, a camp of hunters had let a campfire turn into a forest fire and while navigating through this circumstance, Bambi is separated from Faline only to find her surrounded by the hunters dogs. He is able to ward them off and is shot but survives. We see how he is able to act despite the past tragedy with his mother and save the lives of the people who mean most to him. We see here how we can recover and move on from the worst tragedies if we have the determination, the right people, the right motivations and perspective. Let's help ourselves and each other whoever we feel down, when something happens to send us off balance, to tear us down and live for ourselves and others who may become a great part of us.
