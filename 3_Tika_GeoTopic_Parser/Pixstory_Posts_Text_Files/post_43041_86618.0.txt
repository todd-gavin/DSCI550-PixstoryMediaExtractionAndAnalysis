McDonald's arrival in Moscow was about more than just Big Macs and fries, noted Darra Goldstein, Willcox B. and Harriet M. Adsit professor of Russian, emerita, at Williams College. It was the most prominent example of glasnost in action, Soviet Union President Mikhail Gorbechev's attempt to open up his crumbling country to international relations.

Opening McDonald's up in Russia wasn't easy.

George Cohon, who oversaw McDonald's business in Canada from the early 1970s and into the 1990s, led the campaign to bring McDonald's to life in Moscow. It took 14 years to make that happen.

In his book, To Russia With Fries (with an introduction by none other thanÂ Gorbachev) Cohon detailed the difficult process of opening up that first location.

"On the Soviet side, there was very little real understanding of what was involved in establishing or operating a chain of McDonald's restaurants," he wrote. "For our part, we had to identify suitable sites (the Soviets' instincts seemed to be to put us behind the elevator shafts in hotels or somewhere in the outskirts of Moscow; our instincts, naturally, were pretty much the reverse)."
