Hello,

So today we had our 1st exam for semester 4 and I was not prepared at all. 
I have gone through some youtube videos about the subject & that's all. 

There were hardly 7 topics to cover & so I had decided to study 14 days before the exam date. But failed!

I procrastinated from the start, and I was like abhi toh 10 din baaki hai
4 days to exam that's enough for revision
3 days to exam, ok I will do it tomorrow 
2 days to exam, ab kya hi padhlenge
1 days to exam, thoda toh padh lete hain

So I procrastinated till last.

But the strange thing is I was confident without being prepared for the exam.

I was always told that Confidence comes with Preparation.

And what's happening to me is just the opposite.

Because I believe that Confidence is not something that you feel before doing something, it's after you've done that thing.

Don't panic if the paper didn't go well, because a piece of paper cannot decide your life. 
But, there is a catch in this also - A peace of paper will decide your life only if you let it to do so.

So it always depends on you, how you perceive things.

Thanks!
Stay khush!
