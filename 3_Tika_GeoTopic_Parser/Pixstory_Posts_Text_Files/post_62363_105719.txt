Home is a place where my heart feels comfortable relaxed and at ease Where i feel more welcomed and warm and such a feeling cannot be contained within four walls and buildings or lands For me my home is the Earth everywhere wherever i go is my home Might it be the wilderness or forests or deep dark woods This is my home For some their home is where they can dwell in luxury where they are more than comfortable where they can do whatever they want where there is freedom but for me home is where im not alone
