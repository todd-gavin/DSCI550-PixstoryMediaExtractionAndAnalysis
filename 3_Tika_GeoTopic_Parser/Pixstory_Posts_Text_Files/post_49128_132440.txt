There are a number of reasons why forgiving student loans is not a good idea For one it will increase the cost of college The bulk of student loan forgiveness programs in place would only allow borrowers to have their debt cancelled in total or in part which essentially means that the government is reimbursing them for the money they already paid towards their loans This reimbursement comes at the expense of taxpayers who are now on the hook for an additional expense Additionally student loan forgiveness programs tend to be very selective only certain types of loans are eligible for cancellation This means that those with more expensive loans ones that are typically financed through private lenders are less likely to qualify for forgiveness In fact studies show that almost half of all borrowers who applied for student loan forgiveness were rejected outright All in all there s a good reason why forgiving student loans is generally not a good idea it costs more money and benefits only a select few
