Mikel Arteta  is possibly one of the most renowned names in the current footballing world. The 40 year old has undergone a lot of improvement as a manager and coach with Arsenal in the last few years.The man who is known for his brilliance as a manager for Arsenal was also a part of several teams' line ups quite some time ago. 
Despite his enormous success in his managerial career overshadowing his time as a player, let's not forget his impacts during his time on the pitch. Born in 1982, Mikel Arteta  began his senior career in 1999 with Barcelona. However the 17 year old wasn't given much game time in the club and this saw him make a loaned move to French club , Paris Saint Germain a couple years later. Things did not fit in as per plans at Paris too as Arteta  signed for Rangers thereon. 
His first season at rangers was a fine one as he got to lift two trophies with the team and also became their regular starter for the major occasions. Arteta  himself referred to his two years stay at the club as "significant". He admitted that it helped him grow as a player a lot. His move to Real Sociedad in 2004 proved to be a failure since he couldn't fit into the team's gameplan and system. After having played less than 200 minutes for the entire la liga season in 2004-05, he made a move to Everton. 
Arteta  joined Everton through the January transfer window in 2005. Arteta  played a crucial role in Everton's success that year as he helped the team finish fourth in the Premier League and thus qualify for the Champions league. Impressed by his valuable contributions, the club offered him a contract which resulted in his signing a permanent five year deal with the club.
