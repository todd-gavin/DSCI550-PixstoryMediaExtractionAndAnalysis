Apparently It is a shame Every woman is entitled to the best care for her and reproductive health care is an essential part of it But unfortunately since the news to strike down Roe v Wade is creating chaos some horrifying stories are coming to light In one of the articles online I was appalled to read how a woman went to choose sterilisation to prevent pregnancy against her will She was just when this decision changed her life Living in Indiana she knew how the lawmakers have tormented women for their reproductive health She also shared how in the GOP controlled state House and Senate and Mike Pence who was the governor of Indiana at the time faced national scrutiny for the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act which is still in effect today It was modelled after federal legislation cited in the Supreme Court decision that allowed Hobby Lobby and other corporations with religious objections to refuse insurance coverage for certain contraceptives This is not just one example many other shows how critical is the situation for women Imposing the concepts like abstinence only which educate students on how contraception is nefarious and the only way to prevent pregnancy is to avoid any sexual contact until they get married These programs don t help and instead of educating teenage girls they intimidate them into choosing what is suitable for their reproductive health With this dread women renounce pregnancy by choosing sterilisation or other prevention methods These laws would continue to inflict on women and lawmakers would choose to decide who could give birth or who could not for the greed of exerting influence over poor people black people and other subjugated people of the society This time it is about overturning Roe v Wade years later it could be something else that would again bind women in shackles that she tried to break for years
