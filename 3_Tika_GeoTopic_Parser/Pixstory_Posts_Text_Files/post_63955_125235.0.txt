 Fortnite has a long history of crossovers, such as with Naruto, Uncharted, Cobra Kai, DC, John Wick, Stranger Things, Star Wars and Marvel. Dragon Ball is the newest anime to come to Fortinite, marking its way into this long list of crossovers. Epic Games revealing an August 16 release date. 
While not saying it outright, the announcement showcased a dragon shrouded in golden light with the tagline saying "Speak. Name your wish." For those unversed with Dragon Ball the creature is Shenron the wish granting Dragon Ball who can be called upon by anyone who gathers the seven dragon balls and says “Eternal dragon I summon you. Arise Shenron!”Upon being summoned these are the words Shenron says to his summoner.
 Epic Games has teased a bunch of clues with the news, one of them is a bunch of in-game furniture that looks like Master Roshi’s outdoor lounge area featuring a Capsule Corp capsule. The other is a wallpaper featuring Master Roshi’s iconic deserted island. It is a safe bet to say that Goku and Vegeta will be making an appearance, and with the release of Dragon Ball: Super Hero it is likely that Gohan and Piccolo will also be making an appearance.
