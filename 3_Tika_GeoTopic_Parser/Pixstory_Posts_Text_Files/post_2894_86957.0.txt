US Intelligence officials claim a $700 million superyacht currently docked in Italy for repair, could belong to the Russian President Vladimir Putin. Scheherazade, the 459ft luxury yacht, the officials say they had noticed making frequent trips to Putin’s holiday mansion in Sochi, by the Black Sea, where Putin spent most of his days during the Covid-19 pandemic. The ownership of the ship, however, will not be easy to establish because Putin’s personal wealth is usually held by oligarchs close to him.    

Officially, Putin claims to earn only an annual salary of $140,000 and among his assets include only an 800-square foot apartment and just three cars. But according to some experts, who trace hidden wealth of some of the richest people, he may be the wealthiest man in the world who owns assets worth $200 billion.   

According to their estimate, among his luxury mansions the prettiest one sits on the top of a cliff by the Black Sea in Italy. The largest private residence in the country – called Putin’s Country Cottage – is worth at least $1.4 billion which needs around $2 million for annual maintenance of just the landscaping. The Russian government denies Putin’s ownership, but they have failed to explain why the mansion has a no-fly zone over it and it’s guarded by Russia’s secret security FSB.

Putin’s strongest political opponent Alexei Navalny and his Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) made a documentary film – called Putin’s Palace: History of World’s Largest Bribe – detailing a $1.35 bn corruption scheme for building another palace in southern Russia. Apart from these mansions, the master of all Russian oligarchs has 19 other houses, 700 cars, 58 aircrafts and helicopters, including a $716mn dollar plane.

How did Putin amass so much wealth? Financer Bill Browder told the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017 that Putin had struck a deal with most oligarchs in 2004: half of their wealth would be owned by him. Simply put, he gained it through blackmail, yet he owns nothing in his name, said Browder.
