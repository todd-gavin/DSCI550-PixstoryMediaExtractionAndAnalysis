By NewsDrum Desk Guwahati: Rohit Sharma admitted that T20 contests are pretty much settled during the death overs and India skipper wants a better execution of plans from his team mates, though he is not overly worried about his team's consistent struggle at that crucial stage of the match.Invited to bat, India posted a mammoth 237 for 3 in the second T20 on Sunday but the Proteas took the game deep before eventually falling short by 16 runs as the hosts claimed their first series-win over South African at home."The team wants to play and bowl in a certain way and we want to give them that confidence. Yes, we have not bowled well at the death in the last five or six games. We are doing the same to the opposition as well," Rohit said during the post-match presentation ceremony."To bowl and bat at the death is very tough. That is where the game is decided. It is not concerning, but we need to pick ourselves and get our act together." India's top four batters once again came up with splendid effort and Rohit said they would look to continue their ultra-aggressive approach."It is something that all of came together and said was what we wanted to do as a team. It might not come across at times, but we want to stick to it," he said.Read more: https://www.newsdrum.in/sports/to-bowl-and-bat-in-death-overs-is-very-tough-but-we-need-to-get-our-act-together-rohit-97455.html
