Thursday's torrential rains in Ramban district caused landslides at multiple locations, closing the Jammu-Srinagar national highway to traffic, according to officials. 

They claimed that almost 1,000 vehicles, including a convoy transporting Amarnath pilgrims, are stuck at various spots along the roadway. Shooting stones and landslides shut the 270-km highway, the only all-weather route connecting Kashmir with the rest of the nation, at four different locations in Ramban district. 

Since Wednesday night because of stone-throwing, the highway has been closed at the Moore Cafeteria in Ramban. According to officials, the convoy bringing Amarnath pilgrims to Kashmir has temporarily stopped in Chanderkoot and Nashri. The restoration process is ongoing.
