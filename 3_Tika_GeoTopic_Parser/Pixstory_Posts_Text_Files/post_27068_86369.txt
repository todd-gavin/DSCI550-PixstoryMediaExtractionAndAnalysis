 Oscars Will Denzel Javier Benedict and Andrew Oscars have had a hot race everytime for the Best Actor category and some major satisfactory wins while also having some major snubs This year no matter who wins a whole artistic community is going to come and say that the other actor was criminally snubbed I ll tell you my opinion After watching all performances i will give my personal opinion now spoiler alert it is highly offensive to your pick For me Denzel Washington Javier Bardem are already out of the race them winning would be an unbelievable mistake on the part of Oscars so probably we should expect it to happen While both of them were outstanding their performances just weren t Best Actor worthy So Javier comes in fifth in my list while Denzel makes the fourth place Next in line is Benedict Cumberbatch anyone who knows Benedict s performances knows that his performance in Power of the dog was far from his best he was sensational as always but we know the brilliance of Benedict from the likes of Sherlock Patrick Melrose and others so Benedict ends up third in my list Now here is where things get weird there are two performances Will Smith in King Richard and Andrew Garfield in Tick Tick Boom for me both should win as they are absolutely unbelievable in their performances but there can only be one winner It may be my artist bias but Andrew s dedication was shown every time he appeared on screen he went full into preparation of the role he learnt to sing for a full year he did broadway and he played the part of Jonathon Larson to absolute perfection so for me Will ends up Second and I go with Andrew for the win It will be interesting to see who wins but according to me it must be Andrew
