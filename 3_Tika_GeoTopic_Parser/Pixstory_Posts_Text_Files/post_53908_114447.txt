 Beauty is an iron mine once remarked the Australian mining magnate Gina Reinhart She was talking about a precious resource but iron is also profoundly important to living organisms from bacteria and fungi to mammals like us Iron acts as a key to numerous metabolic functions within our bodies But iron deficiency remains as one of the top global health risks recognised by the World Health Organization WHO Iron deficiency has become the most prevalent micronutrient disorder worldwide and COVID may be worsening the problem Iron is hard to get The type of iron we mine is different from the free form iron that can be used biologically Free form iron has a propensity to jump between two chemical states allowing it to bind to various molecules and participate in all sorts of essential reactions within our bodies But we see a different story again during food digestion Inside our upper small intestine where iron is most effectively absorbed free form iron tends to bind to oxygen other minerals and food components This often results in rock like insoluble clumps which are like the ones we mine These are too big to pass through or between our cells This means that even when we consume enough iron typically only of it is absorbed It also means iron availability can be improved or inhibited depending on how we eat it or what we eat it with For example heme iron from animal flesh has a cage like structure which carries the iron in a soluble form that prevents it from clumping during absorption In many Western countries heme iron only accounts for of the iron eaten but two thirds of the total iron absorbed Read more
