Jake Gyllenhaal, 41, speaks about Taylor Swift, 32, for the first time since 2010. Three months after Taylor published the 10-minute version of "All Too Well," one of the songs about her brief relationship with Jake that fans have speculated for years, the actor is giving his reaction to Taylor's music. 
 
Hollywood Life reported “It has nothing to do with me. It’s about her relationship with her fans,” he told Esquire. “It is her expression. Artists tap into personal experiences for inspiration, and I don’t begrudge anyone that.”

Taylor has never confirmed who “All Too Well” is about. She doesn’t name names when it comes to the inspiration for her music. Upon Red’s re-release and the debut of the “All Too Well” short film, Jake’s name became a worldwide trending topic on Twitter and TikTok. Many of the posts were not written in his favor. In the midst of the intense fan reaction, Jake turned off the comments on his Instagram.

When asked if that meant that the “All Too Well” situation was affecting his life, Jake said, “At some point, I think it’s important when supporters get unruly that we feel a responsibility to have them be civil and not allow for cyberbullying in one’s name,” he says. He falls silent, then pensive. “That begs for a deeper philosophical question. Not about any individual, per se, but a conversation that allows us to examine how we can—or should, even—take responsibility for what we put into the world, our contributions into the world. How do we provoke a conversation? We see that in politics. There’s anger and divisiveness, and it’s literally life-threatening in the extreme.” He was quick to add that his life has not been threatened.
