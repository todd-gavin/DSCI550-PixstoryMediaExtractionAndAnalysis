 Instagram is a very famous social media platform allowing users to indulge in the media deeply However the content is limited to photo video sharing and captions the app has become a platform to showcase life An increasing number of influencers makes the platform less credible The influencers work as an advertising and PR agents and promote brands hence ingenuity what people need is almost a question mark Many people from the young generation are becoming addicted to this platform like they are living a life just to put stories on social media People put forward fake life and lifestyle on Instagram Being famous overnight is possible through Instagram so people tend to do anything to gain several followers This created a craving in everyone s heart to become famous So many people tend to create a fake life which they share on Instagram to get famous This need for validation and fame is highly toxic and teenagers are the ones most affected by it How about the comment and content regulations Still Instagram is letting misogynistic content fly all over it and numerous fake account rules the comment section of women Even though they could limit the comments that aren t the ideal solution Moreover it is easy to take over pictures from an account and post it on another and fool people Many online businesses thrive on Instagram along with many fake businesses that cheat people and their money Is a good debate going on on Instagram No people post their opinion as some share that Comments have mixed opinions and hence lack clarity There is no way to challenge a post and even difficult to take down a fake account It is easy to spread toxicity through the profiles as it is spreading progressive ideas This mix of ideas and incoherence has more cons than pros
