After experiencing an exterior windshield break mid-flight, a SpiceJet plane departing from Kandla in Gujarat made a priority landing in Mumbai, according to the company. This is the second incident involving a SpiceJet aircraft today.
According to officials, the outer pane of the windshield fractured when the SpiceJet flight from Kandla to Mumbai was at a height of 23,000 feet.

According to a statement from the airline, all passengers and staff members are secure.

The P2 side windscreen outer pane fractured while the ship was reaching FL230. Actions from the associated non-standard checklist were completed. It was noted that pressurisation was typical. The aeroplane safely landed at BOM after a priority landing (Bombay)

Recent fleet-wide safety audits of SpiceJet aircraft were performed by the aviation regulator, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), who also continues to conduct inspections on a case-by-case basis.

A SpiceJet flight earlier today that was headed from Delhi to Dubai had to make a diversion to Karachi because of a broken indicator light.
