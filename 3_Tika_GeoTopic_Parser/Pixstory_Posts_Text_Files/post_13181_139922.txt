When we listen to music we don t think about the past or the future but we focus on the present This shop reminded me of Kharabad Street in nbsp Afghanistn The place where music grew and reached the peak of prosperity where it trained many musicians when we went to Kharabat street the sound of local and traditional music could be heard Afghan musical instruments can be seen everywhere almost like this shop But unfortunately Since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan these songs have been muted in Kabul s historic musicians neighborhood Other instruments that used to fill the ruins of shop windows in the small alleys have disappeared Their owners collected them and left putting the centuries old musical heritage of Afghanistan in danger of disappearing Many of them are driven out due to the drying up of work both due to the economic collapse of the country and due to the fear of the Taliban The Taliban took to the streets and said that music is not allowed and should be banned The income of most of the residents was from playing at weddings concerts and parties destroyed Classical music traditions have been passed down for generations dating back to the s when Sher Ali Khan the emperor of Afghanistan invited Indian masters to grace the royal court in Kabul The convergence of two musical cultures has given Afghanistan a unique fusion Indian classical music structures are mixed with traditional Afghan folk songs Like India Afghan music is an oral tradition
