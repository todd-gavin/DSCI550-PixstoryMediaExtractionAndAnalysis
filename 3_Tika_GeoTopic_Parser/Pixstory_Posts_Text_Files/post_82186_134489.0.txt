When I think of Regency era, I immediately remember Jane Austen. Jane Austen is primarily known for her six major works. She was born Steventon Hampshire and spent a greater part of her life there along with Bath. These places inspired her novels. 
Her novels interpret and critique life of British gentry. The stories take place in manors and estates, boasting of balls and card parties and bonnets, lace and muslin. Time and again, we are drawn in by the 
characters who offer a breath of fresh air with their modern outlook. We love Elizabeth’s confidence and vivacity in ‘Pride and Prejudice’. We sympathise over Anne Elliot’s pain in ‘Persuasion’ and laugh over Emma’s follies. 
But do we really know Austen? Do we know her thoughts and views? It is known that Austen led a quiet life. She was described as content woman who was kind and happy. Whatever we gather on Austen are 
from few letters that remain. The majority of the letters were burnt or destroyed by her sister Cassandra. By doing this she meant to safeguard her family’s reputation. But she also removed any 
information on family illnesses and unhappiness. 
Social class was always focused on in her novels. These class differences are conquered by the characters. Like Mr.Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet in ‘Pride and Prejudice’. But she doesn’t really shed light on other social issues. Moreover her father’s income had been really modest. George Austen was a rector at Anglican Parishes in Steventon and he earned livelihood by farming and teaching. So did Austen really write from experience or are the stories based in a world she wanted to be a part of but could only watch? 
All in all, we see glimpses of her humour and and wit in her works. Her works have withstand time and delight every audience. As in 'The Eye of the Story' Eudora Welty wrote Austen’s work withstand time because “they pertain not to the outside world but to the interior, to what goes on perpetually the heart and mind.”
