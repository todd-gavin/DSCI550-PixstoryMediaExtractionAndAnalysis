Europe’s energy crisis turned worse this winter, in the wake of Russia’s intensifying threat of Ukraine invasion. Meanwhile, many French power plants faced severe outages and Germany closed down three nuclear power plants. On the top of it, Nord Stream 2, the newly built Russian gas pipeline to Germany couldn’t start working due to regulation hurdles and opposition from a section of German politicians and activists.

Despite Europe’s gradual switch towards renewable energy sources to fight the climate crisis, natural gas still remains the main source of power in the continent. Algeria, Azerbaijan and Norway, feature among the suppliers, but Russia is the key one. Apprehending a huge winter surge of power demand, Putin started cutting down the supply through the vital Gazprom line, owned majorly by the Russian government. By the end of 2021, the gas export dwindled by 25% compared to what flowed a year back. This led to a record-breaking rise in energy price in Europe that not only hit industrial production, but heating and cooking at homes. Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency squarely blamed Russia for orchestrating the energy shortage in Europe, which was promptly countered by Russian PM Alexander Novak.

But, a closer look at the situation indicates Putin used this opportunity to push Nord Stream 2 which runs under the Baltic Sea circumventing Ukraine and will deprive the country of a transit fee. Experts believe military pressure on Ukraine is actually Putin’s counter-strategy to ward off economic sanctions on a faltering Russian economy. Rising import bills and stashed wealth of oligarchs—some are Putin’s cronies—have hit the rouble hard. The energy crisis in Europe offers him an opportunity to shrug off further threats on the Russian economy and arm-twist European nations.
