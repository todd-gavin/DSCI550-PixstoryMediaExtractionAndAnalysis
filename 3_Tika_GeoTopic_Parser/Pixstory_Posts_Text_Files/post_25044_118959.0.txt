Erling Haaland made his big money move to Manchester City this summer. The Norwegian striker became a talismanic striker for Borussia Dortmund during his stay at the German club. 

The daunting striker attracted attention from plenty of European clubs, but Manchester City came out on top once again. Jude Bellingham, who is often regarded as a prodigy spoke about his time with former teammate Erling Haaland.

The duo spent two seasons at the German club, and had forged a really good connection among themselves. Jude Bellingham revealed that he is certainly going to miss the City-bound striker, and termed him as a brilliant striker.

He also believes that Manchester City are very lucky to have a player of his quality and talent. The reigning Premier League champions will look to continue to chase UCL glory next season, with Erling Haaland being an addition to the powerful attacking lineup.

"He’s a brilliant player, a brilliant guy. That’s what I’m going to miss the most. "He’s a really good character. I think Manchester City  are very lucky to get such a player," said Jude Bellingham.

"I obviously loved our old number nine, still love him, will always love him," the English international told the BVB Podcast.

Erling Haaland scored 86 goals for Dortmund in just 89 appearances, almost averaging a goal per game. In the last two league campaigns, the Norwegian has scored more than 20 goals. He will look to emulate his goal-scoring prowess at Manchester City in the upcoming season.
