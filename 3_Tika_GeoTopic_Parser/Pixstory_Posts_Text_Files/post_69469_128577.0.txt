The Rajouri District's Dehra ki Gali is located in the midst of towering mountain ranges and thick woods. The location, which is 6600 feet above sea level and located in the Pir Panjal Range, is the state's first ecotourism project. 
Tourists love the network of high-altitude lakes at Dehra ki Gali. The valley is very charming, with its lush green cover, the green shrubs with flowers and berries and small wooden huts scattered here and there. Tourists would find a one-room apartment that had been constructed as part of Project Beacon when they reach the top of the hill. Visitors who want to go to the site should avoid going during the winter because of the region's frequent snowfall.
