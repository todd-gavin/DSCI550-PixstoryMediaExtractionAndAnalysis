The main cause of the gender gap or the thought that women aren’t willing to come into work in politics and political offices is that every voice isn’t heard and still it is difficult for a woman to access the political arena. 

Women are less encouraged to run for office than men. Moreover, before asking or knowing her opinion of her there are prejudices that women might not be interested in politics. Women’s willingness to advance in their political careers can also be influenced by family and relational considerations. Due to the gender stereotypes for a woman to follow her dreams, is difficult and might need to abandon her family and their restrictive opinions to enter politics. 

Politics is often deemed an unsafe place for women. No one addresses the question that who makes it unsafe for women. Voter bias is another issue. Votes for women are lower in municipalities with more traditional gender-role attitudes. They interpret this pattern as evidence of voters’ discrimination and conclude that voters’ bias matters quantitatively in explaining women’s under-representation among politicians.

 Where does this prejudice come from? Isn’t it because of the same underrepresentation as people believe women are less and hence tend to believe they aren't responsible? Try and provide equal representation ad women-friendly quotas so that a woman in politics wouldn’t be a norm. still even after almost 26 per cent of representation in America. People have a feeling that women have been given rather than the result of their fight and struggle for so many years. This attitude has to change for equal representation of women.
