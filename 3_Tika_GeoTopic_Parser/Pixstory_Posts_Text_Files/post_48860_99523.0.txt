With Kim K losing weight by starving herself for the Marilyn Monroe's dress that she wore to MET, a debate about promoting disordered eating for beauty standards has stirred.

What is diet culture, exactly? It's a pervasive style of thinking about body size that gives moral goodness to specific sorts of bodies (mainly thinner and smaller) and food types but not others.

Diet culture is a widespread mindset. The most obvious explanation is that persuading individuals that their bodies need to be altered is a multibillion-dollar business. That much money has clout Because diet culture is pervasive and begins to shape our thinking at an early age.

People are reduced to "fixable" physical parts rather than entire, attractive individuals. It stigmatises eating habits that don't conform to its "health" aesthetic and instils an obsession with food and body size, especially among those who don't fit the diet culture model. Food is reduced to a collection of calories to be avoided as much as possible. And, rather than being something enjoyable or powerful, exercise becomes a technique for attempting to acquire an often impossible body type.
