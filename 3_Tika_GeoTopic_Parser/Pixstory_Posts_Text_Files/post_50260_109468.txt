The local informers wanted us to go in two groups so as to cover at least two directions in which they could have fled But it was already about pm so I decided to keep the group intact and to walk to Bagaha They told me that Bagaha was quite far but I was quite enthusiastic on that day No one knew how distant Bagaha was from there but they made different types of guesses Our tiring foot journey had begun We left some local officers there for planning ambush parties in the night time When we reached the other side of the diara we had walked for almost kilometers in very difficult terrain We had to cross minor streams at least times The time was pm when we reached Bagaha side of the river We sat in the vehicles to reach Bagaha and almost everyone had bruises and had been very tired I told the STF commander to be prepared for another raid the next morning which I later cancelled on phone in the night They were very happy to know about the cancellation which they told me later Even though the massive raid was not successful in its motive it had a great impact on the psyche of the dacoit gangs We later realized this when one of the kidnapped persons returned back home and informed us that he had seen us in that operation from a distance of just about meters All the dacoits were hiding in a sugarcane field while we were moving towards Bagaha He had then been warned not to make noise and so had kept silent The gangs saw the scale and determination of the police and were not to be seen in the diara for moths to come It also sent a strong message to the residents of the diara who seldom had seen an SP walking on foot in the diara and chasing criminals To be continued
