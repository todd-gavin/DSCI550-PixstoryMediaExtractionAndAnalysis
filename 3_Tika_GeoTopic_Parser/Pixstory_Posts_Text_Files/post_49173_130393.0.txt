Autotune is a technology that has caused a lot of damage to the music industry over the past few years. It's been used by singers to make their voices sound more similar to those of pop stars like Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande.

This artificial enhancement has had a devastating effect on the careers of real singers who rely on their natural talent and voice to get them noticed. Instead, they are now often relegated to obscurity, as people prefer to listen to pop stars that have been autotuned rather than celebs who have true talent.

Autotune has also made it difficult for aspiring singers to find work in the music industry, as most companies now prefer celebs who have been completely done in by autotune. This means that aspiring singers who use autotune risk being banned from working with reputable producers and studios, which can effectively end their careers before they even start.
