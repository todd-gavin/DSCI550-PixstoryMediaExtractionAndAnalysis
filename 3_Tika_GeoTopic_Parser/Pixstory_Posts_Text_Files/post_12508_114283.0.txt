The pandemic developed much of our skills and opened the doors of hobbies for us where we learned and loved to practice many of them. Similarly gardening was one of the most common hobbies some people involved in. 

Gardening in general have been proven to be relieving stress and studies have shown that community garden are efficient and affordable methods of promoting physical and mental well being. 

Researchers have proved that community gardeners have better outcomes when checked with those neighbours who don't part take in gardening activities. 

A small study conducted in Spain proves that urban rooftop gardening was linked with a greater sense of purpose and social inclusion, emotional and physical well being and a general quality of life for individuals who have been living with intellectual disabilities or mental health disorders. 

So through community gardening you not only get the nature's goodness through its produces but also a better socialising life and a better well being.
