I'm certain that simply attending has no value. You come all the way in to hear three or four hymns, hear the message, and then return home. You could almost do everything yourself in a far more convenient manner.

The church used to be a social, cultural, and missional powerhouse for generations. People loved going to church for a variety of reasons, including the fact that it was one of just a few options available in a community and the primary means to connect with God. There are now a hundred various ways to accomplish this. The internet is the most easy and accessible choice, and it will take care of everything you said.

Pardon my ignorance, but is there some real reason to attend the church? When you can connect with other Christians through so many different ways unlike the older times where they had to come together on a Sunday to share their thoughts. So in modern times, going to church as a compulsion just doesn't make sense.
