The LeBron James-led LA Lakers are fighting to salvage something from what's been a disappointing season. They have played seven games since returning from the All-Star break and have managed only one win.

Pointing fingers at this stage will not do any good as they are stuck with their current roster. While many believe they could have had a better run with Anthony Davis healthy, he did not dominate in the 37 games he played.

Even as the Lakers (28-37) are woeful defensively, surrendering 113.2 points per game, their offense has been worse. The bulk of the heavy lifting has been left to 37-year-old LeBron James. While he is doing an outstanding job individually, the team is still suffering.

The Lakers will try to get back to winning Friday night as they take on the Washington Wizards, who are 11th in the East. Fans know their best chance of winning is with LeBron, which is why his availability is a source of concern.
