On Saturday, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann highlighted the importance of tackling the drug war as "team India," while his counterpart from Haryana, Manohar Lal Khattar, sought to do the same.

At a national conference on drug trafficking and national security held at the Raj Bhawan in this capital, they were addressing the gathering.

Amit Shah, the Union Home Minister, gave the event's keynote address. Banwarilal Purohit, the governor of Punjab, Manoj Sinha, the lieutenant governor of Jammu and Kashmir, Ajay Bhalla, the home secretary of Haryana, and S. N. Pradhan was also in attendance.

Talking about his government's efforts to combat drug smuggling, Mr. Mann noted that 6,809 smugglers had been caught in recent campaigns, and 4,903 FIRs had been filed.

Despite being a border state with a significant threat of drug smuggling from across the barbed wire, Mann claimed Punjab did not have such a laboratory. In order to help the Center establish a forensic laboratory in the state, Mr. Mann also provided his support and collaboration. The war against narcotics, terrorism, and gangsters will require "team India" cooperation, he said.

Manohar Lal Khattar, the chief minister of Haryana, said: "We need to fight together to remove this network." He claimed that if a state's law enforcement used force against the peddlers, they would escape to nearby states. He claimed that law enforcement organisations from several states are fighting hard against drug trafficking. He stated that the issue may be resolved if the law enforcement authorities cooperate and work together.

Every month, Haryana records more than 200 drug-related cases. According to him, 253 drug traffickers were held responsible for the recovery of about 32 crore, and the process to seize their property, worth 13 crore, is currently under progress. According to him, 2,661 accused people were arrested in 1,913 cases that the state had registered up until June 30.

Mr. Mann stated in regards to the shooting death of musician Sidhu Moosewala that the shooters were not paid by their employers. Bringing the mastermind from Canada, according to the Punjab Chief Minister, is being pursued.
