Will Robert Lewandowski leave Bayern Munich? 

As per the Daily Mail, Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski is considering options outside the Bundesliga giants. Owing to this, Barcelona are looking to sign the goalscorer in the summer. 

The Polish striker has just over a year left in his deal. Though talks have been held, nothing has been finalized about a new contract as of yet. Owing to this, rumours are on the rise about a summer exit for Lewandowski. 

The 33-year old striker joined Bayern Munich from Borussia Dortmund in 2014. Since then Robert Lewandowski has scored an impressive 339 goals in 366 appearances for the Bavarians. 

The 2021 FIFA Men's Best Player of the Year has 31 goals in 27 Bundesliga appearances this season. To add to this, Lewandowski has 12 goals in 8 Champions League appearances so far in the 2021/22 season.





Can the Blaugrana sign the 33-year old striker?

Barcelona have reportedly turned their attention to Robert Lewandowski as per the report. The Spanish giants are willing to spend as much as €60 million to secure the striker's services.

Robert Lewandowski's agent Pini Zahavi is reportedly a close friend of Juan Laporta. Owing to this the Barcelona president believes that a deal between the player and the club can be met.

Following the departure of Lionel Messi, Barcelona are looking for a new "Mr. Dependable". Owing to this they have also been linked with Erling Haaland. But the Norwegian has a better chance of joining Manchester City or Real Madrid as per the report.

Despite their financial woes, Barcelona firmly believe that they can pay the transfer fee if the striker decides to join. Hence, it has to be seen what decision Robert Lewandowski decides to take in the summer.
