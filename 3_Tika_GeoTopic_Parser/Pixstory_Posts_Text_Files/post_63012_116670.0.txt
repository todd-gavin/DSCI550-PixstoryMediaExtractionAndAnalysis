This is one debate I've seen way too many times happen around me, both on the internet and in real life. Cat owners always seem to fight amongst themselves whether or not they should let their cats outside and I've always thought the answer to it is as simple as it gets.

I don't think cats should be let outside. Especially indoor cats. Never let your cat outside if you intend for it to be an indoor pet. It can get many kinds of parasites and diseases â€” and that's something you don't want. Another thing it can get is some undesirable habits, let's not act like we like when they bring dead mice or birds home. They love to hunt small animals and bring them home, most of the times sneakily. It's not something you want at home, especially if you have kids around. They can cause all kinds of dangerous diseases, and your cat itself could develop a liking towards it. It can get into conflicts, and occasionally lose ears, eyes, and other body parts in the uncontrolled outdoor environment. 

Likewise, if it's an outdoor cat, I believe you shouldn't ever let it inside because it could infect you, your kids, or your other animals with its parasites and diseases.

Your pet is your family, and you're supposed to protect it. That being said, your own health comes first.
