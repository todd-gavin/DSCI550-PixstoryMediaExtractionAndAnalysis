My name is Palak Gera, and I am from the state of Madhya Pradesh. I am an outgoing, confident, and inquisitive person. Dancing is one of my main interests; I am very passionate about it and am a trained classical bharatnatyam dancer. I've been doing this since I was eight years old.
I am also a voracious reader. Reading allows me to immerse myself in my own imagination while also allowing me to learn a great deal. Fiction, classics, and mysteries are among my favourite genres. My favourite books are Pride and Prejudice and The Da Vince Code.
I have immense love for animals. Coco, my four-year-old golden retriever, is one of my pets.
My favourite escapes are music, coffee and italian food.
