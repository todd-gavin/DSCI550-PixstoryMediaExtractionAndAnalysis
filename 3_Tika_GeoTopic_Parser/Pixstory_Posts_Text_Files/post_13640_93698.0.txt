We as Afghans are mostly failed and helpless people, failure means not being humiliated and lost.
Because we and those like us who have to put all our strength on the front lines of daily life to protect ourselves and provide at least food and life security, there is no power left for us behind the front lines. We do not have the strength for planning, foresight and strategic goals, because we can hardly keep the front line active. Sometimes the line breaks and we suffer heavy losses.
Security is threatened, now whether it is the security of life, livelihood, identity, etc., it occupies and engages all the vital force of human beings in such a way that it leaves no room for contemplation, no room for spiritual and intellectual maturity. From here, we stay calm and, better yet, reach the brink of death one day.
