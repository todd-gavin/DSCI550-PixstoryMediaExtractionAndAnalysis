National Cinema Day was a success, thanks to Top Gun!

According to figures released by Paramount on Sunday, Top Gun 2 made an estimated $5.5 million in its first three days and $7 million in its first four. That's enough to help the Tom Cruise movie, which has made more than $1.4 billion in worldwide box office receipts, surpass the $700 million domestic milestone in its 15th weekend of release. 

HR said that because of the $3 Saturday, normal modelling for the entire holiday weekend is unreliable, which means the order of the movie can alter once the final weekend numbers are calculated. 

A largely positive summer season for exhibitors and Hollywood studios as they recover from the pandemic was finished off with the huge Labor Day sale. And Top Gun played a major role in it!

This just tells us that it doesn’t matter how much time passes, Top Gun will always remain a classic, etched into people’s mind!
