By Sangeeth Sebastian No that s not the crucifix of Jesus you are looking at It s a long forgotten Egyptian son of god worshipped by Pharaohs some years before Christ Scholars who came across this extraordinary find written in hieroglyphics on ancient Egyptian temples only in modern times were too stunned by what they saw and the striking similarity it shared with the life death and resurrection story of Jesus right from his virgin birth on December to the miracles he performed and from the doctrine of love to the number of disciples he had and to his untimely death by crucifixion that they had no option but to come to the conclusion that the story of Jesus was nothing but a myth based on perennial pagan stories By now I can bet a good number of Christians reading this will either be offended or find this hurting their sentiments which is quite understandable given the fact that most Christians have been brought up in a culture that portrayed Christianity and paganism as two entirely antagonistic religious perspectives For the last years the West has been dominated by the idea that Christianity is scared and unique while paganism is primitive and the work of the devil despite the fact that there is incontrovertible evidence to show that the church presided over one of the largest and bloodiest cover ups in history The challenge now is not so much the cover up but the willingness of scholars and academicians in the West to liberate themselves from centuries of Christian conditioning and thinking that has now become a part of their culture This is why even today there are very few scholars who are willing to dig into Christianity s obscure origins Because doing so like studying sex is taboo and requires a radical break from the way they see and look at the world from a Christian perspective What has all this got to do with Ranveer Singh s bum Continues The writer is the founder of VVOX a platform with a mission to eradicate sexual shame
