At Cpower5 we believe that sustainable lifestyle practices are the solution to tackle manmade climate problems.
We believe that every individual can make a change, if we change our habits -our shopping habits, food habits. If we can change smalthings in our daily life/daily routine, we can have a big impact in reducing our carbon footprint. So as this year's theme is 'Invest in our planet ', its how we can reduce our impact on the planet by reducing our footprint. So if planet is considered as our second home than we should start at all homes only. We have been giving the same message throughout our campaigns. As not everyone can afford to be an activist or start NGO get involved with climate activism and domains. So as an individual, I suppose, we can start at our houses. We can start changing our lifestyle habits even by changing our food habit, or eating or our shopping habit, or even traveling and using public transport. There are many videos online. We also conduct campaigns. So as an individual, whatever you can do to reduce your footprint here on this planet, so that we can reduce the burden on the planet. 
This kind of consciousness should be there within the public, especially among the youngsters. Donâ€™t wait for the government or policymakers to change the existing policies. If you're part of that kind of advocacy, that's great. But as you know, we all have a family to take care of. We all have our own things on a daily basis. We don't have the time..
So as an individual, what can you do is start from your home, start from something as basic as a smartphone. the clothes you wear.
