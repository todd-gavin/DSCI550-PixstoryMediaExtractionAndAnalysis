INGREDIENTS
500 g kacha aam (green mangoes)
10 g mustard oil
1 pc dried red chilli
½ tsp mustard seeds
10 g salt
¼ tsp turmeric
130 g sugar
500 g water
METHOD
Peel mangoes and cut them in 5-cm chunks. In small mangoes, remove the pit. Soak the mangoes in water for 30 minutes to reduce the astringent taste. Strain and set aside.
Heat 10 g mustard oil in a pan. Temper it with dried red chilli and mustard seeds.
Add mangoes and fry them on medium-high heat for 3 minutes. Add salt and cook for another minute before adding 500 g water.
Add turmeric and sugar. Since tartness of mangoes can vary widely, you may need a little more or a little less sugar than we’ve mentioned.
Bubble on medium heat until the mangoes are cooked. This should take about 5 minutes. Be careful not to overcook or the mangoes will disintegrate and turn mushy.
Remove from heat. Once cool you can store this in the fridge for about 2 weeks. Serve chilled.
