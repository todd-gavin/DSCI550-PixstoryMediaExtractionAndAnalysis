Wayne Rooney wants to see a younger and hungrier squad. Owing to this, he wants the club to let go of Paul Pogba and Cristiano Ronaldo in the summer transfer window.

In a recent interview with Sky Sports, Wayne Rooney was asked about what Manchester United needs to return to the pinnacle of English football. To this, the Derby County manager replied saying the club needed young hungrier players. 

Owing to this, Wayne Rooney stated that Manchester United should let Cristiano Ronaldo leave in the summer. The Englishman also wanted Paul Pogba out as he felt that Pogba does not have the same influence at United as he has for France.

Talking about Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney said "Ronaldo has scored a few important goals! But I think if you look to the future of the club you would have to go with younger, hungry players to do the best to lift Manchester United over these next two, three years."

The Derby County manager added that Cristiano Ronaldo does not have the same hunger and desire as a youngster. Rooney admitted that Ronaldo was a goal threat, but the Englishman felt that United should give youngsters a chance. 

Wayne Rooney concluded by saying that Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho should be given more important roles. To add to this, he also felt that Jesse Lingard and Scott McTominay could help the club in the long run.


Would the duo already be leaving?


Paul Pogba's contract ends at the end of the 2021/22 season. Owing to this, the Frenchman would become a free agent. Hence it is expected that Pogba would be leaving Manchester United for free at the end of the season.


Cristiano Ronaldo on the other hand has not been very happy since his return as per reports. To add to this, Manchester United are in danger of missing out on Champions League football for next season. Hence this could be the final straw that forces Ronaldo to leave United in the summer as well.
