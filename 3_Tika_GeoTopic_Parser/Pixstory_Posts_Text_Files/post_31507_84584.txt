Luigi Ciotti, national president of Libera, comments arguing that with great timeliness and undoubted strategic foresight, the mafias have been able to seize the opportunities of globalization of the world expansion of the free market. Thus they have become entrepreneurial mafias capable of mastering the mechanisms of finance to predict and influence with the weight of their assets the Stock Exchanges to ensure the services of professionals and technicians The modern vision of the manager is implanted in the archaic head of the boss So if blood crimes today seem to be decreasing because the mafia variant has increasingly taken on the appearance of a more generic criminal variant who kills less bodies and more hopes by acting like a social parasite that steals the common good and rights by polluting the economy and undermining the foundations of democracy Luigi Ciotti affirms that the contagion of the criminal variant has reached the highest historical levels by taking advantage of the political, economic and society determined by the virus Everyone hopes to leave the pandemic behind us but starting again with the criminal variant still widespread in the social body will transform the restart into a relapse from which it will be difficult to get up again
