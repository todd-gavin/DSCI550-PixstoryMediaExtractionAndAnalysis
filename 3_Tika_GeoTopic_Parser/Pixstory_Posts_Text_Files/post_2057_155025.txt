Federal appeals court judges Elizabeth Branch of the the th district and James Ho of the th district recently announced that they would refuse to hire any new law clerks from Yale University over its culture of canceling others I m a statement made to National Review Branch said Like Judge Ho I am gravely concerned that the stifling of debate is not only antithetical to this country s founding principles but also stunts intellectual growth Accordingly I accept Judge Ho s invitation to join him in declining to consider students from Yale Law School for clerkships with me with an exception for past and current students Following this boycott other anonymous judges stated that they would conduct a hiring freeze from Yale This is an absolutely deserved move for an institution of higher learning that like most others has become infected with far left ideology and cancel culture students are no ling willing to hear other perspectives so why should they be entrusted to be impartial
