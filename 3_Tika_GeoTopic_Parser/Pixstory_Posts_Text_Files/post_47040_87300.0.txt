If you are older and you are noticing that it is getting harder to manage your weight, know that it isn't all in your head, as data shows that certain changes occur in the body that makes it harder to lose weight as we age.

And when it comes to belly fat, older adults are unfortunately at a disadvantage when compared to younger people, as people who age do not appear to burn the energy stored in fat cells as efficiently as younger adults. This lack of ability to use fat cells efficiently can play a role in accumulating belly fat, and it can make it harder to lose belly fat too.
