Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Treasurer Arun Dhumal shared his thoughts on the reports about rifts between two of the most prominent India batters Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, stating that the team management is not bothered by such reports.

It is a well-known fact that Virat Kohli and Captain Rohit Sharma are two of the greatest cricketers of the modern era and their contributions to Indian cricket speak for themselves.

While Kohli, who was once known as the ‘run machine’, has numerous of records to his name, Rohit has been a run-scorer across formats and stamped his authority in the game of cricket with his consistent performances and even with his captaincy.

Notably, the duo enjoys a massive fan following on social media. But, the fans of Kohli and Rohit are not always in a friendly mode as they are often witnessed debating over who is better amongst the two.

Moreover, there have been multiple reports claiming rift between the two India batters, which adds fuel to the flames.

Meanwhile, the BCCI treasurer Arun Dhumal has made it clear that such debates and chatter doesn't hold much substance for Team India management.

“We never think about it. It is the passion of fans that drives them and this debate. When you are attached to an emotion, then you tend to say all that. And social media is a platform where you can talk about anything. They speak their heart out because there are no restrictions. That is why people think it persists,” Dhumal told veteran journalist Vimal Kumar on his YouTube channel.

“We saw the same with Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev, or later between Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar. On social media, matters amplify to an extent that people believe all this is true,” he added.
