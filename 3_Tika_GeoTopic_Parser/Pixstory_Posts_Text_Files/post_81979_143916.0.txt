As we know, white color gets dirty too soon so we avoid it very often😂.
But we can't deny to the fact that white can create magic 🪄✨ which no other color can👀🌸.
I tried this matte White nailpaint from Lakme and it worked very well with my black top🖇️❣️.
Majority of the people complimented on my nailpaint more than they complimented on my outfit✨✨.
I tried it once and was very satisfied with the results🥹🫶.
You can try it too and let me know in the notes section.
