28 Sikh citizens of Afghanistan left Kabul for Delhi on Wednesday. These numbers have been transferred to Delhi with the help of a Sikh religious organization and the cooperation of the Indian government. According to Indian Express, with the completion of the administrative process, more Sikhs will go to India from Afghanistan.

Concerns about the security of Sikhs in Afghanistan have increased after ISIS attacked the religious minority's place of worship in Kabul. Two people were killed in this attack.
Recently, about 65 to 70 Sikh citizens of Afghanistan have been evacuated to India. They add that more will be brought to India as the visa application process is completed.

Recently, in its annual report, the US State Department identified Afghanistan as a violator of religious freedom. According to this report, at the end of 2021, approximately 150 members of the Sikh and Hindu communities remained in the country. While the number of Hindus and Sikhs in Afghanistan was around 400 at the beginning of the mentioned year and 1300 in 2017. Hindus and Sikhs said that before the Taliban took over, they could perform their religious ceremonies in public. But since the Taliban took control of Kabul, Hindu and Sikh groups have expressed concern about their physical security.

Some Sikhs and Hindus reported not going to their places of worship. In October, Sikhs reported that armed Taliban had harassed them at their central temple in Kabul.

Sikh leaders cited a lack of job opportunities as the main reason for Sikh migration at the time, but after the Taliban took over, many now say they believe violent persecution by the Taliban was the cause of the migration.
