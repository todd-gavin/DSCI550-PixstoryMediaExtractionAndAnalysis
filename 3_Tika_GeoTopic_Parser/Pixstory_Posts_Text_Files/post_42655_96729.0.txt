Syed Ali Shah Geelani was one of the most courteous patients that I have ever had. He was one of the kindest and nicest people that you could talk to. He had a lot of etiquette. He was fragile in his behaviour. 

His religious philosophy didn't bother me. Why should anybody's religious philosophy bother me? I am bothered about my own religion.

Let me tell you something. One morning, I went to meet Ahad Bab who used to live outside Sopore. It was not safe to drive to such areas in those days. People would advise me to go on such trips early in the morning only. I would go seven in the morning and be back by 9-10 am just before the traffic jams and the rush on the roads.

Somebody had seen me and he had complained to Syed Ali Shah Geelani telling him that Dr Sameer Kaul is a Sufi, and he goes to meet Ahad Bab. So, he asked me if I go there? I said: Yes, of course. He called it ‘Zehani Pasmandgi (under development of your mind)’.

He didn't care two hoots about the kind of Islam followed by Ahad Bab. And he had a different variety of it. But that was his business. And I told him very clearly that I never tell you who you are and what philosophy is. I come to you as a doctor, and we are friends. But I never advise you on what you should do regarding your religion, or in your politics. You should respect that. 

After that, he never asked me any other questions. He understood that I am my own man in some areas, and he was willing to respect it and he never ever strayed into that area. I didn't stray into his. Despite that, we had a relationship that spanned over 30-40 years.
