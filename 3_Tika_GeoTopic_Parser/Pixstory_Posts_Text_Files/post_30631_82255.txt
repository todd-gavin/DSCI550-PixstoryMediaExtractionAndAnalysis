Sixteenth medal for Italy at the Beijing Winter Olympics Federica Brignone won the bronze in the women&#39;s combined alpine skiing, conquering the second podium after the silver in the giant slalom The race saw Switzerland complete a double with Michelle Gisin who preceded Wendy Holdener by seconds while Brignone finished second Another disappointment for Mikaela Shiffrin who fell in the slalom The exit of the American made life easier for Brignone who commented at the end of the race Surely there weren&#39;t many athletes today but the two Swiss skied very well in the slalom Not I had no chance against them I was lucky that Shiffrin came out This is skiing this is the sport I just tried to ski at my best without taking too many risks
