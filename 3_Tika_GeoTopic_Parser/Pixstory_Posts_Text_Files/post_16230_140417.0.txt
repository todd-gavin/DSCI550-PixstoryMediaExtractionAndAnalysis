The audience review is finally out as fans, who were eagerly waiting to watch Brahmastra on the big screens, have been sharing their reactions on social media.

Overall, Brahmastra has been receiving a good to mixed response with netizens liking the whole vibe and visual effects. Besides the performances, social media users are also loving the cameo of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan. However, a section isn’t really impressed with the love story part.

After watching Brahmastra, a social media user tweeted, “Do yourself a favour.. go and watch this extraordinary movie from #Bollywood.. #Brahmastra ..epic of epic proportions... Massive #VFX.. literally action sequences are Goosebumps… #SRK and #Nagarjuna cameos are superb..”

Another Twitter user wrote, “Unrealistic love story is the only flaw in the first half apart from that this movie will run from Kashmir to Kanyakumari. Jo log boycott brahmastra bad VFX bolra na unko VFX ka full form bhi nahi pata Hoga lol.”

Praising SRK’s cameo, a third post read, “What a dhamakedaar cameo. Goosebumps n tears as well seeing him onscreen after so long. Acting, voice n looks. #ShahRukhKhan
