After nearly a decade of conservative rule, Australian voters rejected the ruling coalition, opting instead for those who advocated for stronger climate action, gender equality, and political honesty. 

CNN reported that on Monday, Anthony Albanese, the new Labor Prime Minister, was sworn in before flying to Japan for his first meeting with allies, including US President Joe Biden. 

For most of its history, Australia's politics has been dominated by two major parties: the center-right Liberals and the center-left Labor Party. However, this election flung all the balls in the air, tossing a number of them to minor parties and independents who were fed up with the two-party system.

The election results revealed a considerable preference for Independents who ran on environmental issues. 

The candidates, many of whom were new to politics, sought carbon reductions of up to 60%, more than twice what the government conservative coalition had promised (26-28%) and more than Labor had proposed (43 percent ). Teal candidates, as they were known, targeted typically blue Liberal districts with greener ideas.

â€œMillions of Australians have put climate first. Now, it's time for a radical reset on how this great nation of ours acts upon the climate challenge," said Amanda McKenzie, CEO of the research group the Climate Council, on Saturday's election result.
