There's no need for diversity in America's music industry. Our music is good as it is. We don't need to add outsiders' music to it.

Adding more variety to the music we listen to will only lead to confusion and chaos. America's current musical landscape is perfect the way it is, and that there's no need for anything else. Different styles of music don't mix well together, and that this leads to a cluttered and chaotic soundscape.

And honestly, there's something inherently wrong with our current order of how everything is going. It's one thing to bring diversity but completely other to impose it on others. It needs to be changed in order for American music to truly stand out from the competition. We have to not copy but create our own. Nothing black, latino, indian, asian. Just something that represents our country and our country alone. By include certain styles of music into the current system, we're doing a disservice not just to those genres, but also to the artists who create them.
