“When bombs fall on your cities, when soldiers rape women in the occupied cities – and we have numerous cases of, unfortunately, when Russian soldiers rape women in Ukrainian cities – it’s difficult of course to speak about the efficiency of the international law," said Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba. 

His claim that Ukrainian women are being raped has not been independently verified, as per Yahoo News. 

But whatever the complex realities on-ground may be, it is certainly undeniable that women are a huge casualty of war.  “That’s why it’s called ‘rape as a weapon of war’; because this type of war is fought through the women's bodies and has enormous consequences for the survival of their communities.”- says Urteaga Villanueva, NORCAP expert. 

Rape is used not merely as a means of sexual gratification, but as a means of subjugation, of silencing women and exerting power and control over the enemy population (as represented by their women). It is both concrete and symbolic, both general and individual. 

Villanueva recounts the stories of rape she heard in Darfur in 2005-2006: 

“The women who had been raped were told by the perpetrators that they should be happy, for now they would have the privilege of having a child with a different ethnic background. Or they would tell her that she could go home and tell her husband that he was not man enough to look after her….This type of messages sent by the perpetrators of the rape, who are armed actors, to the community through the woman or girl who has been raped by them, is a special war tactic that is used to destroy the social tissue of communities, their ability to resist the violence and survive the conflict.”
