Real Madrid star Karim Benzema has been crowned the winner of the 2022 Balon D'Or title. The Frenchman beat Sadio Mane and Kevin De Bruyne to win the individual award for the first time in his career. 
Karim Benzema had a stellar 2021/22 season for club and country as he scored 50 goals and provided 16 assists in just 56 games in all competitions. The Frenchman helped his Real Madrid side win the LaLiga, Supercopa, and Champions League titles last season. To add to this, Benzema also helped France to win the 2021 Nations League title as well. 
After helping Real Madrid win their 14th Champions League title, Karim Benzema had already registered his name as the faviourite to win the title this season. However, Benzema did face competition from Sadio Mane, Robert Lewandowski, Mohamed Salah, andÂ  Kevin De Bruyne for the award. 
Following the win, Karim Benzema addressed the media. The Frenchman said, "The prize in front of me makes me proud. It's truly an honour. It was a childhood dream. I never gave up. When I was a kid, I had the motivation [to achieve it] and I had two role models in my life, Zidane and Ronaldo."
Can Benzema add another Balon d'Or to his trophy haul? A decent performance in the FIFA World Cup would be the best possible way for the Frenchman to add to his prize next season.
