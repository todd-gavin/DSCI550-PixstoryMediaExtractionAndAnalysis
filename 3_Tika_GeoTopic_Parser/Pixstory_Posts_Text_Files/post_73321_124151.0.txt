Childhood is truly a time of wonders. Many take years before they figure out what their true calling is. In my case, that process began when I was six years old. I casually started playing football with no knowledge of what the future holds for me. Soon, it transitioned from a hobby to something that I could look at professionally.

I was 10 years old when I joined my first coaching centre near Guwahati Nehru Stadium. From there, my life has been quite fast-paced.
I went from practicing there to getting selected in under 13, under 14, under 19, and finally under 23 teams. I got sponsored by Nike and went to the US for 2 years where I played in the Dallas Club. Iâ€™ve travelled to Uzbekistan and Qatar. I also had the fortune to play with Sunil Chhetri in the AFC Asian cup as a part of the senior national team. 

Football fascinated me a lot and Cristiano Ronaldo had a big role to play in that! Seeing him perform so effortlessly gave me the hope and the desire to work just as hard and make my country proud! Pressure comes and goes but the "will" stays. I do not get as worried when I am off the field. However, I do get nervous before going to the ground. Nevertheless, I do not let that affect my performance in any way! 

Things might be difficult but it all gets better with time. Trust the process!
