Nine years ago the then new chairman of the Football Association Greg Dyke spoke of his aims for England s men s football team I want to set the whole of English football two targets he said The first is for the England team to at least reach the semi finals of the Euro Championship in and the second is for us to win the World Cup in So far better than expected then but one big step to come win the blood soaked tainted World Cup in Qatar It always seemed a ridiculous target on which to base any long term success of the FA get a dodgy decision in the semi final and decades old plans turn to dust It s a quote that s followed Dyke around for years and to be fair to him it was part of a plan to focus the minds of everyone in the game about the paucity of English talent playing in the top flight Of course trying to win the World Cup seems like a really good idea In practice history tells us that it s slightly trickier There are other countries in the world where football is quite popular who also would like to win the World Cup with teams who have excellent players who again would also like to win the World Cup But however glaringly obvious that is there are still those perhaps blinded by the quality of the Premier League without noticing the nationalities of most of the best players who expect so much of England each time around It s this kind of madness that prompts people to write in capital letters when you try to point out that Gareth Southgate is the second most successful manager in the side s history YOU CALL LOSING A FINAL SUCCESS THAT IS THIS COUNTRY S PROBLEM ALL OVER As with previous England managers it feels as if there is no middle ground you either back him or think he should be sacked immediately and replaced with Thomas Tuchel If Tuchel isn t interested force him to do it against his will with no games and just a week of training before we play Iran in November
