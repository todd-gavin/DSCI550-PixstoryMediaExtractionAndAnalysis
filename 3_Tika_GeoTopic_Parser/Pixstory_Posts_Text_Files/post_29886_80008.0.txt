It is clear that the lives of students and their learning patterns have changed a lot after the emergence of Covid-19 pandemic. For those who have the access to conventional resources, online learning can act as a boon for them. 

According to a research, a student can grasp more than 60% of knowledge while learning online, unlike 8-10% in a classroom. This variation is found because of many reasons including faster learning, access to free learning sources, one can learn at their own pace, to name a few. 


As every coin has two faces, in the same way, every person has their own perspective. Some worry that the sudden shift from offline to online era might hinder their mental health and learning capacity whereas some have already accepted this "new normal" culture after noticing the perks of e-learning.
