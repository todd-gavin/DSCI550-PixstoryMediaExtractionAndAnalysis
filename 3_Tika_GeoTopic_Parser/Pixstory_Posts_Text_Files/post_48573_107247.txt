A disclaimer before I start this is that I believe in the Church the traditional Church and have full faith in it This is just my view on Home Churches which I ve been hearing about a lot lately For many people attending church at home symbolises a restoration to the early church In other words the development of the church as a recognised institution with structures liturgies regulations and so on took a long period Early Christians who were frequently persecuted for their beliefs worshipped privately in their homes or other public places God can and should be celebrated anywhere in my opinion Where two or three are gathered in my name there am I among them Christ says Mat In other words the Holy Spirit resides wherever believers meet to exalt the name of Jesus That is not a monopoly held by the established church
