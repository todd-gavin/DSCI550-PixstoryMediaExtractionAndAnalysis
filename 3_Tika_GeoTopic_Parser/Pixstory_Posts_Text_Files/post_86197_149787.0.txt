Here are my favourite lyrics from a song that i heard ages ago, but somehow these lyrics stayed in my brain— 
🎶🎶 You were red and you liked me 'cause I was blue, But you touched me and suddenly I was a lilac sky, And you decided purple just wasn't for you 🎶🎶                                   ~ Colors by Halsey
