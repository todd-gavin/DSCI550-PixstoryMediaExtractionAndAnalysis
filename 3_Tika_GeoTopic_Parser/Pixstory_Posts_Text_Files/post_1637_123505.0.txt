With 50 million copies sold, not only is Bing Crosby's "White Christmas" the best-selling Christmas song of all time, it's also the best-selling single ever, according to Guinness World Records.

It first aired during the Kraft Music Hall radio show (yes, sponsored by the food company) on December 25, 1941. Then-host, Bing Crosby, crooned the carol, which is soulful, longing, and sad anyway, but especially so at the time. Pearl Harbor had been attacked just a few weeks before.

It turns out, the song has a sad back story too. It was written by Irving Berlin (the same composer behind "Cheek to Cheek," "God Bless America," and many more classics), a Russian-born immigrant who, interestingly enough, did not celebrate Christmas, as he was Jewish.

But more the so as Berlin's three-week-old son had died on Christmas day in 1928. So every year on December 25, he and his wife visited their baby's grave. 

The kind of deep secret of the song may be that it was Berlin responding in some way to his melancholy about the death of his son. 

The 1942 American movie 'Holiday Inn', starring Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire, was an iconic film, that got more fame for its hit song "White Christmas".
