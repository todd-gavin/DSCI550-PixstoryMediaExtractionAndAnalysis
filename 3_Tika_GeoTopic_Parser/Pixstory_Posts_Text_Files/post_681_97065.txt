Totally confused about what to wear for a wedding or a formal function in India Banarasi silk Varanasi was called Banaras apparels are always a choice which never goes wrong The attire made of this intricately crafted silk always stands out be it a sari or a salwar suit Even men don the silks with grace Varanasi city is a festival of these silk and weaves What is amazing that the weavers of the world famous saris are Muslims A little google search will tell you all about it This is what the internet says Weaving is typically done within the household and most weavers in Varanasi are Momin Ansari Muslims Many of Varanasi s Muslims belong to a weaver community that known by the name of Ansari which means helper in Arabic For generations they have passed on their craft from father to son hand weaving silk on room sized foot powered looms They are fashioned into Sarees worn only for special occasions many Indian girls dream of wearing Varanasi silk Saree for their wedding day Varanasi saris are adorned with intricate designs and zari embellishments making it popular during traditional functions and weddings Earlier the embroidery on sarees were often done with threads of pure gold In weaver associations and cooperatives together secured Geographical Indication GI rights for Banaras Brocades and Sarees This silk is used in large part for the production of Banarasi saris which are a regional type of sari made from silk However now the trade is dwindling As of there are roughly weavers in Varanasi down from Some attribute the decline to lower demand of Saris or higher number of imported Saris Others suggest that power looms played a role What ever be the reasons this beautiful craft needs to stay and alive It is not only a mirror of the diversity that India has been so proud of but also an art form which needs to be preserved On a lighter note I will be seen wearing a Banarasi attire on a wedding I am attending this week
