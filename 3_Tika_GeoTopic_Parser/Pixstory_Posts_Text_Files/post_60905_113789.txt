Plastic Free July is a global movement that empowers people to be part of the solution to plastic pollution The concept is simple Participants are challenged to reduce their reliance on single use plastics by eliminating one or more single use items from their daily lives In an effort to stay healthy it can be tempting to assume that single use plastics are more hygienic than their reusable counterparts The fact is that reusable items cups bags containers pose no health risks As long as you keep your reusable items clean they are just as clean if not cleaner than single use products
