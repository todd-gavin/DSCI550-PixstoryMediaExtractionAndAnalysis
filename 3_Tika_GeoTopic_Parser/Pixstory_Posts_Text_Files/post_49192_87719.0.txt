'Capitalism creates inequality.'

Well, inequality is sometimes portrayed by anti-capitalists as an absolute evil, an aspect of capitalism that renders the system utterly unjust. However, we must question, why is inequality a negative thing in the first place? The wealthy may have considerably more than they require, but what is unethical about some individuals just having more if it is achieved in a fair manner? According to the Pareto principle, 20% of the causes are responsible for 80% of the results. Inequality is just a natural phenomenon, a reality, and a law of nature based on this alone. Inequality is just a natural phenomenon, a reality, and a law of nature based on this alone. 
Besides that, if one wishes to live in a free society where people are free to pursue their own goals and reach their full potential, inequality will inevitably arise, as a minority will always achieve far more than the majority, and a few people in each field will do much more than the vast majority of others combined. It's true that government policies like regulations and bailouts can exacerbate inequality by favoring those in power. 
These, on the other hand, would not exist in a really free market. As a result, while it is not true that where there is disparity, there is freedom (as in the Soviet Union), there is inequality where there is freedom. Just look at Scandinavia, which, despite its erroneous reputation as a brilliant example of democratic socialism, has both high levels of inequality and great life quality.
