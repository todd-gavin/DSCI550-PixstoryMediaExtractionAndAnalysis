‌To Americans Margret Chase Smith needs no introduction. She was the first woman to serve in both houses of the Congress, and the first woman to represent Maine in either. She was amongst the first to criticise Joseph McCarthy and his witchhunt of communist 
‌
‌Smith was a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in the 1964 election; she was the first woman to be placed in nomination for the presidency at a major party's convention.
‌
‌During her term in the House, Smith developed a strong concern for issues concerning the military and national security. After being appointed to the House Naval Affairs Committee in 1943, she was appointed to the investigation of destroyer production and made a 25,000-mile tour of bases in the South Pacific during the winter of 1944. She also became the first and only civilian woman to sail on a U.S. Navy ship during World War II.
‌
‌She was a strong supporter of women in the military, she did not write the legislation that established the special female military units during World War II. She did champion the legislation that gave women permanent status in the military following the war. She quickly defined herself as a bold legislator of high integrity and significant influence.
‌
‌Among the several honours, Smith obtained were several citations as the woman of the year, the Newsweek magazine press poll rating as Most Valuable Senator for 1960, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1989.
