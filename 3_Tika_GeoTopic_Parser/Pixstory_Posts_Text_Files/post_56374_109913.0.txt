Saw a meme today that if men needed an abortion, abortion would have been available in an atm. (I am excluding trans-men and gender non-conforming persons from this.) 

We have guns that practically kill somebody in front of you being used in the name of self-protection and when women have a choice, the methods are banned. It's like women are supposed to bear children and that's a compulsory act for women as per the supreme court. Why does anyone want to force something upon themselves and when somebody forces themselves upon us(rape) are they been forced vasectomy? No! 

America will face victim suffering in the coming days where we see rape victims struggling with their mental and physical health and we will see many mentally traumatized mothers and children instead of a healthy generation.
