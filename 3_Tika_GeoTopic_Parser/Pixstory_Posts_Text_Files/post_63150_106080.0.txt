In the defamation case, Depp received USD 10.35 million, while Heard received USD 2 million after the court concluded that Depp's former lawyer had defamed her. 

In a 2018 piece published in the Washington Post, Depp sued the actress for USD 50 million for purportedly hinting that he assaulted her. In response, the 'Aquaman' actress filed a counterclaim for USD 100 million.
