The Striker is the main player responsible for the conversion of all the attacks Finding Space and Finishing the ball into the net comes in the checklist of Strikers You may have seen a lot of professional players scoring exceptional goals like being very calm and composed It is all about the timing of making runs behind the opponent defenders as soon as your player have supplied you a pass Scoring goals is an art and it needs a lot of intelligence and timing to fool the opponents and get in a free space to shoot the ball inside the net All you have to do is to save your energy in the game when the opponent defenders are making possession Don t just dive in them in search of getting the ball Just press them with doing slow jog this will put pressure on the opposite team as well as it will save your energy After your defense wins the ball as being a striker you will have a lot of energy to run faster and loger than others Just move randomly side to side on the field to confuse the opponent defenders As you will move to the right the right center back and right back will try to mark you and same in the case when you will move to the left This will confuse the defenders like which player should mark you As the attack starts to get mature wait for the right time and communicate with you midfielders to supply you a through ball between the defense line Instead of running directly towards the goal try doing a curve run which will delay you to get past defense line before the ball is released Hence it can never be a offside Just run past defenders with full speed and take a deceive touch on the ball then place it at the best suitable area on the top of the box Clinically just finish the ball into the net always choose placement of the ball into the net rather than just blasting it away with power Score goals and celebrate with joy Thankyou
