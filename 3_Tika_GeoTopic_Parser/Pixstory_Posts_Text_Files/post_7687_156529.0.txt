Spain have qualified for the knockout stages and they've done so in empathic fashion. Even though the score was just 1 -0, Spain U-17 completely annihilated China U-17. Spain kept possession of the ball all throughout the game. China kept on fouling the Spanish players but they couldn't build any attacks as they weren't able to string together some passes. The Spanish players were intercepting everything whenever China tried to play through the middle. Spain just couldn't finish their chances otherwise the scoreline could have been much worse. 
Morena gave Spain the lead at the 61st minute as Spain finally managed to put one in the net after many chances. China's Hongpin received a red card at the 85th minute that just showed how frustrated the team had become. In the end it was good game of football and Spain deseved the win.
