Carlos Alcaraz Garfia capped off a historic US Open Championships by winning the men’s singles tournament defeating Casper Ruud, 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (1), 6-3. By winning the title he became the youngest man to win a Grand Slam since Rafael Nadal at the French Open in 2005 and also the youngest player to be ranked no.1 in the world since the ATP started the ranking system in 1973.
The Spaniard was quick off the blocks, winning the first set in ten games. Ruud came back strongly in the second half, breaking the 19-year old twice to take the second set to take it 6-2. The 5th seed continued his comeback as he led 6-5 in the third set. Garfia had to save two crucial set points that could have altered the match’s result. He then went on to dominate the tie break losing just one point. The Norwegian tried hard to force a decider but one break of serve in the fourth set was enough to allow Carlos Alcaraz Garfia to take home his first major.
Alcaraz’s long but hard fought tournament in brief
Alcaraz had a tough last few rounds to reach the Final. He had to play three five-setter matches to get there and most experts had expected him to be tired playing the showdown clash. On the contrary the youngster showed no signs of fatigue and was full of energy, sometimes even rallying the crowd to get behind him.
The new Slam champion played a total of 23 hours and 40 minutes of tennis throughout the tournament. In the fourth round, he overcame 2014 champion Marin Cilic. In the quarterfinals, the 3rd seed downed Jannik Sinner in a match that ended at 2.50 am on the clock at Flushing Meadows. Finally in the semi finals, Alcaraz saved a match point and upset the New York crowd by defeating homeboy Francis Tiafoe in five.
This marks the first time a teenager has won the US Open Championship since Pete Sampras in 1990 and Carlos will only look to improve from here.
