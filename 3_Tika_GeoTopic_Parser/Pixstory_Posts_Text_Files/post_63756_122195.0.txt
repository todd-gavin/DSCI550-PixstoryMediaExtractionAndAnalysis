Rock operas and concept albums are pretty common in rock music, but some feature such interesting ideas that a cinematic depiction of them would be really good in feature films would really do them justice, with the band’s music further adding to that concept. 

Concept albums require a lot of patience and dedication to listen. Song and poetry, even though concise in form, are perhaps the most powerful medium to tell a story or convey deeper emotions. Their lyrical qualities combined with music, add a new level of feeling , immersion and layer to narratives.


A concept album, therefore, develops its storyline with each song. In a way, a concept album is like a mini-series where each song is an episode, providing us with the opportunity to binge-listen to our heart’s content. However, a concept album doesn’t always need a character to hold its narration together. It can be unified by a common theme on which all the songs are based. Neither does the content of the album need to be strictly lyrical, it can be instrumental or compositional as well.
