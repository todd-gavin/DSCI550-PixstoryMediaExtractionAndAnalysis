Paris Saint Germain are certainly a force to be reckoned with in Europe once again The Parisians enjoy a fierce attack that consists of Messi Neymar and Mbappe But who among the three would stand out at the end of the season Kylian Mbappe easily managed to stand out over his South American teammates last season Owing to his great form the PSG board offered the Frenchman a record breaking deal in order to keep him at the club But even though Mbappe enjoyed a great season on a personal level the club failed to live up to their expectations under Pochettino leading to the manager being sacked In the first few games of the season Neymar has arguably been the pick of the PSG forwards The Brazilian has scored goals and provided assists in just Ligue games this season Lionel Messi has also joined the party scoring goals and providing assists in the league This has helped PSG maintain an unbeaten run collecting wins in their first Ligue games Kylian Mbappe has also matched his teammates with goals in Ligue games The Frenchman has also scored goals in the Champions League this season hence becoming the current highest scorer of the club However I feel that Neymar would be the pick of the forwards this season The Brazilian has overcome his niggles and I certainly hope that he maintains it going into the World Cup As a bonus to Neymar If the Brazilian national team and Paris Saint Germain manage to have a good year the winger could even see himself picking a Ballon d Or in Only time will tell how and where Neymar finishes the season in late May
