It appears that to be a Manchester United fan is the toughest thing in the world they play one game as a whole team where they look like they are playing football on other days it just feels like guys are hoping that their forward Ronaldo or their keeper De Gea save them As a Man United fan going fifth consecutive year with any silverware is something that just cannot be digested In short and simple words Manchester United are awful Absolutely awful and a team like this world class players going in to play a game with their shoulders down and out is not the way to play Even as a fan who cannot match their fitness levels I know for a fact that at the moment I would be running more than Aaron Van Bissaka I would be more aware than Harry Maguire in what he calls defencing Manchester United have a problem it is not just with the management it is also the players And for me it is primarily the players Manchester United have been a problem a problem to which they cannot find a solution they tried to find a solution in Ralf Ragnick but they could not find one and their recent champions league defeat is a prime example of that As stated earlier Manchester United have now gone five years without any trophy and the blame should not go on Ole If anything Ole was actually the solution to Man United s problems as he proved to be their most pivotal hope in making to the top four of the premier league Ralph redneck has been nothing but a disappointment as he has managed a Man United team With a fully fit Varane and in form Sancho Ralf Ragnick has still been unable to turn Man United s foes Ali had a clear reason as he led a half fit And up and coming United squad but Ralph has no explanations at all His tenure as a United manager is a huge worry In short Man United do not seem anywhere near to their way back
