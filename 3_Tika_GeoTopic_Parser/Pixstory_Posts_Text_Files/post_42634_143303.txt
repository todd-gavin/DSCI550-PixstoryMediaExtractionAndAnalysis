After beating RB Leipzig by a scoreline of Real Madrid C F registered their second victory in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League where Fede Valverde scored the first goal of the match in the th minute and Marco Asensio sealed the victory for Real Madrid in st minute when he scored the screamer Before the match many football pundits predicted an easy victory for Real Madrid against RB Leipzig but the German team didn t make it easy for Real Madrid The reason why Real Madrid struggled for the majority of the match was the new setup organised by Carlo Ancelotti because for the first time Rodrygo played in a False or deep lying playmaker position and in the flanks there Vinicius Jr and Valverde and these three players took some to click On the other hand RB Leipzig made some decent chances in the first half but their clinicality in front of the goal and great performance by Madrid s goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois made Leipzig players life hard to score a goal As a fan of Real Madrid I want to say that Real Madrid didn t win the match by dominating RB Leipzig but they won the match because of teamwork and their never say die attitude is still the key to scoring a goal with all due respect to the immense talent this team have For me Marco Asensio is the star performer of the match because throwing a bottle in the previous match for not getting the playtime and scoring the banger in the next match shows how mentally strong he is Hala Madrid
