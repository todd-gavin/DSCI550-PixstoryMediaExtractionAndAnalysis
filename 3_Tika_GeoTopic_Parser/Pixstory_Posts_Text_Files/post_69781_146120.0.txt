Avatar is coming back! And don't miss it.
The well-renowned synonym for 3d movies: Avatar is all set to come back to theatres this Friday. The film will run for a short period of 2 weeks all over the world. People who missed it in theatres in 2010, this is your chance to experience this epic piece of work. Along with the thought of re-release, the master brilliance behind it, James Cameron has decided to enhance his work on all levels before taking it back to cinemas.
I mean, it's been, you know, 12 years since the release, and so basically if you're kind of under 22 or 23 years of age, it's very, very unlikely that you've seen the film in a movie theatre. Which in a way kinda means you haven't seen the film - says the maker. The new version of Avatar comes in 4K HDR with 9.1 enabled sounding. A true remaster in all senses. HDR version to any movie gives out excellent visuals and promises a treat to the audience. In general, dynamic range is categorised into two: SDR (STANDARD DYNAMIC RANGE) & HDR (HIGH DYNAMIC RANGE). SDR gives out a luminance level of 100 nits, just like seeing a hill through a moderate amount of Fogg in the atmosphere. Can be seen but not the way it was meant to be. Whereas, HDR can produce a luminance of 1,000 - 10,000 nits. It gives well-defined colour profiles and details to the subject. Basically in HDR, you see black as true black and all other colours in their true form. When HDR (depth of the image) joins hands with 4k (resolution) and Digital Stereoscope (3d) the experience turns out to be out of the box! Regarding sound, it is mastered in Dolby 9.1, which is capable of giving sound in depth from the top and sides at the correct and apt time. Again, the experience becomes a total worth with the atmos effect.
So don't miss this opportunity and experience this grand thing in theatres. If the story fails to amaze you, just look upon the theatre experience it puts forward.
