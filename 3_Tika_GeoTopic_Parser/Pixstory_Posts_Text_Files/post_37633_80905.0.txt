Skipper Mithali Raj’s well-crafted half-century went in vain as Indian batting flopped once again with the visitors losing the first WODI against New Zealand by 62 runs here on Saturday. Opting to bowl, New Zealand rode on Suzie Bates century (106 off 111 balls) to score a challenging 275 and India were all-out in the last over for 213 in 49.4 overs and never for once looked like being in the chase.
The 39-year-old Mithali, playing her 221st ODI, continued her dream form in the format — seven fifties in the last 11 innings in ODIs — to keep India in the hunt with a 73-ball 59 (6×4). Indian women’s team in their last ODI recorded their highest ever run chase of 265 set by Australia women in September last year, a win that had ended their rivals 26-match winning streak.

Mithali also joined Charlotte Edwards in making 1,000 runs against four different teams — Australia, England, Sri Lanka and New Zealand — in ODI cricket. She also became the first Indian to reach 1000 women’s ODI runs against New Zealand.

Mithali got a fine support from left-hander Yastika Bhatia, who dropped down to her usual No 3 spot, to stroke a 63-ball 41 as the duo added 88 runs in their recovery act. But she got out to a short ball from Hayley Jensen (2/36), something that triggered the Indian collapse before Jess Kerr sealed the issue for the hosts with a matchwinning 4/35 as India collapsed for 213 in 49.4 overs to trail the five-match ODI series 0-1.

Harmanpreet Kaur, India's explosive batter who was also named Player of the tournament in the Big Bash League continued her poor from as she got out for just 10 runs in 22 balls. She last notched a fifty in March 2021 against South Africa as her last five innings scores read a poor 10, 16, 19, 1, 30 not out, painting a sorry picture for India ahead of the World Cup starting soon.
