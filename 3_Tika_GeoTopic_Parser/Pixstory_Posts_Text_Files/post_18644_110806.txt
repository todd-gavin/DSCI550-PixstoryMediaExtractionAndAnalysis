Nick Kyrgios during the match won in sets against the English Paul Jubb at Wimbledon made himself the protagonist of a deplorable gesture and under the watchful eyes of the cameras The Australian in a fit of rage first threw a ball off the court and then even worse spat at the grandstand addressed to someone in particular The mystery was revealed in the post match conference and he said it himself almost justifying himself Yes it was intentional Someone from the audience insulted me he told me I was a normal but No I don&#39;t understand why this always happens I have to what dealing with hate and negativity for a long time so I don&#39;t feel I owe that person anything literally came to the game not to support anyone just to elicit disrespect That&#39;s fine but if I give it back to you that&#39;s how it goes I&#39;m not new to over the top behavior During the tournament in Stuttgart Kyrgios said he received racist insults This time it was different offenses and he pointed it out himself No not today But a lot of disrespect came from the crowd I&#39;m just starting to think it&#39;s normal when it&#39;s actually not I haven&#39;t said nothing to viewers until they initiated it
