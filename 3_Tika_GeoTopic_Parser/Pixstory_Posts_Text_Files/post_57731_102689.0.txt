In "The Lion King", we see how an evil, disgruntled uncle, murders his brother just to rule over a piece of land, leaving his nephew, Simba, to flee from his home, away from his only living parent, his loving mother and others behind in fear for his safety. Simba, is seen to stumble upon two kind strangers who take him in and keep him happy and healthy for many years, during which he lives a life without caring about his past. His old best friend one day comes to him to make him come back and save his people, as the heir, from his uncle's cruelty and misdemeanor. Simba is disinclined as he no longer associates to that place with safety and love, only pain and fear. But once he sees his father's advisor, he makes the decision to go back and help his family, his people. In this story, we see how grief and loss of a loved one can cause us to act differently, do things to cope and heal that are not always the best considering other duties and responsibilities that we have while living. Sometimes, it takes a good amount of time for us to grow out of such things and move on differently, more responsibly, taking charge of our situation. During these times we act out in ways that hurt others, but perhaps that shouldn't be put against us since we too are learning to deal and help with the pain. In these tines having someone stand by you irrevocably is the best thing to have, they can help ground you before you act out or show you simply how you were wrong and how you should be with others, without causing any sense of invalidation or betrayal. Emotions are a complicated field, one which however much traversed, continues to defy and upend logic due to its dynamism and irregularity. We must respect these facets and then understand our emotions and their causes. It helps, just as watching such adaptations does for us to learn about them.
