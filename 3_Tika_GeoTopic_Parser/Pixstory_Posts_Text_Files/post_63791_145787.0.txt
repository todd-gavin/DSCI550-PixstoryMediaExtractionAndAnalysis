During IGN's Tokyo Game Show stream, NetEase Games and Legendary Star Studio unveiled Ashfall, an upcoming adventure shooter MMORPG set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
 
Nuclear war has destroyed the Earth in an attack after artificial intelligence rebelled against humankind and tried to destroy its creators. After the destruction, only a few pockets of civilization remain, and the last survivors fight for the survival in a scorched and dangerous country.
 
The game tasks player to leave their Vault in the aftermath of a nuclear war to search for the mysterious Core of Creation, which may prove to be the last chance for the survival of the human race against both a powerful enemy and all out all extinction.
 
Ashfall is set to be released on iOS, and Android in 2023 as well as on PC where it will be released via Steam, with the creators posting new screenshots as well as system requirements.
