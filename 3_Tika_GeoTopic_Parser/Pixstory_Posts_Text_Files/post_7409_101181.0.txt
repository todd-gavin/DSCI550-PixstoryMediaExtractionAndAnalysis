Who can argue with the Pope?

Francis has a bad knee. And for that he's got a team of doctors, a wheelchair and a cane. He does physical therapy.

But the thing that's really worked? Tequila.

Thats what he told his followers in St Peter's Square, riding his popemobile.

Dude's 85. Supreme Pontiff. And, as we have all suspected, knows life is better with some alcohol.

Cheers ðŸ¥ƒ
