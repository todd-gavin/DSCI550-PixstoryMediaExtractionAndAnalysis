Arsenal are looking at potential midfield signings this summer and one of their prospects is 22 year old Ligue 1 midfielder, Cheick Doucoure. Signing one or two midfielders is on the top of Mikel Arteta’s priority list with the Gunners looking to break into the top 4 this season while challenging for the Europa League. 

Doucoure mostly would be signed as a backup to midfielder Thomas Partey, with Doucoure happy to play in the hole between defense and midfield, tidying up possession and breaking plays. The player is reportedly unhappy at Lens, given that his move to Tottenham 12 months ago was blocked by the French club. The player has enjoyed another strong season at the club and might consider it time to move onto bigger and better things. 

Doucoure has shone throughout this season, with teammate Seko Fofana even commenting that he is one of the ‘the best’ he has ever shared a football pitch with. He further had to add, “Cheick knows how to do everything on the pitch. He works in the shadows and, for me, he is very important. He is incredibly complete. He’s one of the best players I’ve played with. He knows how to shoot from distance, how to pass, break the lines, dribble and defend.”

Arsenal would face stern competition for the signing of Cheick Doucoure with Wolves, Everton, Brighton and Crystal Palace all vying for the Malian midfielder. Arsenal would like to bring to their squad to add much needed depth to their squad, after extending Mo Elneny’s deal for one more season. Arsenal are also considering signing Leicester midfielder Tielemans.
