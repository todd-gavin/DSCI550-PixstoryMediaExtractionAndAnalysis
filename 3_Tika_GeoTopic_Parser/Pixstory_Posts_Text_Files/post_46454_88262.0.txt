Mental health refers to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional well-being. It is all about how people think, feel, and behave. People sometimes use the term ‚Äúmental health‚Äù to mean the absence of a mental disorder.
Mental health can affect daily living, relationships, and physical health.
Factors in people‚Äôs lives, interpersonal connections, and physical factors can all contribute to mental health disruptions.
Looking after mental health can preserve a person‚Äôs ability to enjoy life. Doing this involves reaching a balance between life activities, responsibilities, and efforts to achieve psychological resilience.
Conditions such as stress, depression, and anxiety can all affect mental health and disrupt a person‚Äôs routine.
Although the term mental health is in common use, many conditions that doctors recognize as psychological disorders have physical roots.
A person coping with mental health difficulties will usually need to make changes to their lifestyle to facilitate wellness.
Such changes might include reducing alcohol intake, sleeping more, and eating a balanced, nutritious diet. People may need to take time away from work or resolve issues with personal relationships that may be causing damage to their mental health.

People with conditions such as an anxiety or depressive disorder may benefit from relaxation techniques, which include deep breathing, meditation, and mindfulness.

Having a support network, whether via self-help groups or close friends and family, can also be essential to recovery from mental illness.‚ù§Ô∏èüí™
