This provides a unique “window of opportunity” early in life to improve health in adulthood. Improving early life environment offers a new and exciting interventional strategy to control of the epidemic of obesity, diabetes and related disorders.
In the Indian context, where under-nutrition and over-nutrition co-exist, integrated policies and programmes need to be designed with focus on maternal and child health. In other words, public health policies need to address the lifecycle rather than only concentrate on the end stages.
Key messages:
•€Children who are undernourished in the first 2 years of life and who put on weight rapidly later in childhood and adolescence are at high risk of chronic diseases related to nutrition.
•€The prevention of maternal and child nutrition is a long-term investment that will benefit the present generation and their children.
