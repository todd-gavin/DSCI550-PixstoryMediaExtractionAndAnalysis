Relationship anxiety and relationship OCD👩‍❤️‍👨
People with relationship anxiety usually worry about their relationship, even when it's going well
This can create a lot of distress, with people often dwelling on even the most insignificant concerns about their relationship 😿
People with relationship OCD (ROCD) may have similar worries, but they often lead to intrusive thoughts and compulsive actions
Common ROCD thoughs:
"What is don't truly love my partner?" 
"What if they are not the one?"
"What if I am not good enough for them?"
"What if I am not attracted to my partner?"
While it is normal to have these thoughts occasionally, people with OCD generally have a much harder time moving past them 
There can also be an obsessional fixation on a SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTIC of their partner.🕺
Common fixations include elements of their partner's personally and physical appearance.🧑💫
If you suspect it is ROCD, try to rule in and out with an OCD specialist before embarking upon relationship counseling or try OCD specialist therapy before making big decisions such as ending or changing the relationship.👩‍⚕️🏥
If you have been diagnosed with ROCD, try not to discuss the relationship at length with friends or family as this will be a compulsion.🫂
