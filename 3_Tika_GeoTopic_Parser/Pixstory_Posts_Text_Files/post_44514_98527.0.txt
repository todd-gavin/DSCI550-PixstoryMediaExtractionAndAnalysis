Tuesday night's sequence of events sent Liverpool to this year's Champions League final in Paris. Real Madrid will join the Merseyside club, who seek revenge of the events of 2018's 
final in Kiev. The Merengues went through on the end of a dramatic two legged tie against 
Manchester City while Liverpool were rather comfortable in their triumph.

Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher believes Mohammed Salah will be keen to play the final 
at the end of the month. "Mo Salah will want revenge, 100%. It was a massive blow for Salah 
himself. For him, he’d just come alive that season and everyone knew what he was about.

He got over 40 goals and that was going to be his moment. Ramos definitely knew what he was doing. You talk about the dark arts of football and there’s probably nobody as bad.

It’s part of football but he pushes it to the limit." Carragher told CBS sports.

The Egyptian has had another brilliant season, like his first at Liverpool. Ramos' pull inflicted 
a blow to Salah's shoulder four years ago, which eventually forced a substitution.

"Ramos won’t be involved but Mo Salah will be desperate to put that final to bed. To be honest, a lot of that team – I’m thinking of the midfield, I’m sure that night it was [Luka] Modric, [Toni] Kroos and Casemiro – I think that will be the midfield again," Carragher continued.

Some new faces, same old stakes.

"So even from Liverpool’s point of view there’s still a lot of players from that team – virtually 
the whole back four really, obviously not the goalkeeper. But Salah, [Sadio] Mane, Firmino 
will all be involved, [Jordan] Henderson and [James] Milner too. There’s a lot of players from that Liverpool team still there."

This is a third Champions League final in five seasons for Liverpool, but only Madrid's first 
since Kiev.
