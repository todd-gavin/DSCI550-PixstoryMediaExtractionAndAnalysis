Brahmastra is a fantasy film directed by Ayan Mukerji This movie has been quite the talk of the town After watching shamshera failed miserably at box office people are gossiping about whether brahmastra will be hit or flop Well according to me it will not be that good as we all know Bollywood basically sucks at the Fantasy genre There is a great possibility that it cannot recover the budget as they are still shooting and reshooting which is obviously increasing the budget Even though Alia is in the movie the weight of the movie will be on Ranbir s shoulder At this point with such a budget it might end up having the same fate as the Thugs of Hindostan I hope Ayan Mukharji s Script is great and the Vfx is up to the mark then there is a possibility that the movie will be a hit However being his huge fan i will keep that hope alive
