When Denmark play at the men’s Fifa World Cup in Qatar this winter, their shirts will mask the name and logo of their sponsor, the sportswear brand Hummel. One of the strips is all black, which Hummel described as the “colour of mourning”.The company explained the unusual design by directly referencing migrant construction worker deaths in Qatar, as well as the state’s much questioned human rights record. A social media post said: “We don’t wish to be visible during a tournament that has cost thousands of people their lives.”It added: “We support the Danish national team all the way, but that isn’t the same as supporting Qatar as a host nation.”Hummel’s criticism of Qatar was not the first, and as the tournament gets closer, there will be more to come. Former Manchester United star Eric Cantona has said he won’t be watching the competition, and some French cities have banned screenings of matches in their public spaces.But the response from Qatar to Hummel’s view seemed to demonstrate a change in tactics. In the past, the Qataris have often been slow in reacting to such criticisms. Yet within hours of Hummel voicing their concerns, the organisation responsible for organising the event had issued a robust statement.In it, the country’s Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy claimed that Qatar had implemented significant labour market reforms, adding that all countries, Denmark included, should focus on promoting human rights.Such a strident response was noteworthy, appearing to mark a development in the nature, tone and speed of communications coming out of Qatar. Officials have clearly been readying themselves for an intense period of scrutiny and activism at one of the most controversial World Cups in football’s history.They have also been preparing for the possibility of the event being disrupted, buying in everything from Moroccan police officers and American surveillance equipment.Read more: https://theconversation.com/world-cup-2022-qatars-frantic-countdown-to-a-football-tournament-full-of-controversy-191918
