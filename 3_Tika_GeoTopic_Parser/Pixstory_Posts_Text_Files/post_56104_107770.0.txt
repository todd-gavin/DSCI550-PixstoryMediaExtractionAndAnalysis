“Love After Love” by Derek Walcott

The time will come
when, with elation
you will greet yourself arriving
at your own door, in your own mirror
and each will smile at the other’s welcome,
and say, sit here. Eat.
You will love again the stranger who was your self.
Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart
to itself, to the stranger who has loved you
all your life, whom you ignored
for another, who knows you by heart.
Take down the love letters from the bookshelf,
the photographs, the desperate notes,
peel your own image from the mirror.
Sit. Feast on your life.


Love After Love is a different love poem which focuses on loving the self, the inner self, following the breakdown of a relationship. Its main theme is that of evolving whole again through self-recognition, a kind of recovery that works by self-conscious invitation.

Being in a loving relationship can be a wonderfully exhilarating experience. Learning to love another person can lead to an unusual fulfilment but when things don't turn out for the good when love dies, some people can be ravaged when the relationship ends, for whatever reason.

Love After Love gives the reader a direct message: Do not worry, you will be able to love yourself again. Having put so much of yourself into the relationship, doing things for the other person, conveying selfless love, it's only natural you feel incapable. But persevere, love for you will return.
