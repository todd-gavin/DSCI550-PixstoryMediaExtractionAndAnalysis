BTS's J-Hope recently shocked fans when he appeared on the YouTube series IU's Palette, which is hosted by K-Pop soloist IU. The promotions for his new album Jack In The Box haven't been as much as BTS, but he chose to appear on IU's show, and netizens couldn't get enough.
During the episode, the duo touched upon different topics like their albums, J-Hope's newest songs, and IU even performed with the BTS singer. For many, it was a collaboration that netizens didn't realize they needed so much until now.

In particular, J-Hope revealed that although he seems extroverted and confident, the idol doesn't have many 'Musician' friends aside from the other members of BTS.
