A lot of people fall in love with low-carb diets because of the quick weight loss in the first few days itself! But do you know the reason behind this "lovely" phenomenon? 

Each gram of carbohydrates retains approximately 2.4g.
3g of water weight-that's an approximate 3-to-1 ratio. Therefore, when you consume a diet rich in carbs, water is retained in the body more easily.
Similarly, decreasing your carbohydrates intake reduces the water retained by your muscles, resulting in a decrease in the overall body weight (at the beginning of your diet) and making you feel like you've lost fat. But in fact, that's just the 'water weight' lost once the body does not receive carbs.

Bottom line: When trying to lose weight through these two different dieting strategies (carbs vs no carbs), the initial loss in numbers might seem different but the actual fat loss will be the same.
Remember, the best diet is the one you can stick to in the longer run, and which varies for each individual. So, if you love your carbs, go ahead and include them in your meal plan and don't simply restrict them. Quantification and
moderation are key!
