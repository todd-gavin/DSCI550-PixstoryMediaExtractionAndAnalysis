One of the best opportunities of the year to see Saturn will exist in the days preceding and including Sunday, August 14. It would, at the very least, if the Full Moon weren't so close by. On that day, at midnight local time, Saturn will be directly across from the Sun in our night sky, with Capricornus in the background. 

DNA reported that Saturn will ascend above the southeast horizon as the night goes on and hang high in the southern sky the rest of the way. At its perigee, when it is closest to Earth, Saturn will be at its largest and brightest. 

However, as was already indicated, amateur astronomers will struggle to observe the Moon's full phase on August 11 and 12.b

Saturn will be visible throughout the night this year due to its opposition, according to Caleb Fassett, a planetary scientist at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.“That gives stargazers a good, long chance to find and observe it,” he said.

Furthermore, hope is not lost in spite of the Moon's glare. Saturn's rings will be 13 degrees off-axis from Earth's view. Saturn is 886 million miles from the Sun, whereas Earth is only 94.4 million, yet an unusual phenomena may cause it to seem brighter than usual when it is closest to the Sun, during opposition.
