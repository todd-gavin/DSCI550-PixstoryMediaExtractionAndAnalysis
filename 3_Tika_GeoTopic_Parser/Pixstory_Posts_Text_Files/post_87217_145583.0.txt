8 John O’Shea

the UEFA Team of the Year. In addition, he was named to the PFA Premier League Team ofthe Year in 2006-07, 2008-09, and 2009-10. Evra retired from the club after 379 appearances and five Premier League titles.

Silvestre won four Premier League titles and appeared in 361 Premier League games during his eight years at the club.
