If there is one similarity that almost all music shares it is that the vocals are more often than not the most memorable aspect of music Much like classical music rock and metal too rely greatly on vocals particularly on powerful vocal techniques that few can achieve thus often pushing people to their physical limits The frontman is always the one most thrust into the limelight and often it is their voice that defines the band So much goes into fronting a band from singing to lyrics to stage presence to endurance and while stage presence and the ability to whip the largest of gatherings into a frenzy are certainly key ingredients it is ultimately the quality of the singer to stand out and project their presence in a way that makes them stand out as well as do justice to the song A band has a head start if their frontman has range power articulation and technical control but to be truly iconic they also need to break boundaries possess an indefinable charisma and be able to commuicate emotionally putting them in a class of their own Some of the greats are all well versed in music theory while some let the music naturally come to them Whatever their methods a truly iconic vocalist possesses a strength that simply can t be copied or invented It can only ever be natural These are the top greatest rock and metal vocalists Bruce Dickinson Iron Maiden Ronnie James Dio Rainbow Black Sabbath Dio Bob Catley Magnum Freddie Mercury Queen Rob Halford Judas Priest Hansi K rsch Blind Guardian Roy Khan Kamelot Conception Ian Gillian Deep Purple Russell Allan Symphony X Adrenaline Mob Sons of Apollo Robert Plant Led Zeppelin Geoff Tate Queensryche Peter Steele Type O Negative Ville Vallo HIM J rn Lande Masterplan Ark Millenium Beyond Twilight Vagabond The Snakes Avantasia Myles Kennedy Alter Bridge Slash Layne Staley Alice In Chains Chris Cornell Soundgarden Audioslave Tarja Turunen Nightwish Floor Jansen Nightwish After Forever Ayreon Simone Simones Epica
