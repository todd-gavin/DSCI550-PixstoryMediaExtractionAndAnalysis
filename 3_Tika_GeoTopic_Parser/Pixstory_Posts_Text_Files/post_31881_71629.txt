A highly recommend watch You will be shocked to see how the director carefully takes serious issues like racism LGBTQ and that big strong people can also have a lot of feelings displayed through the various episodes and characters very lightly By the time you end watching this show you don t know but you will actually see the world more clearly and maybe differently
