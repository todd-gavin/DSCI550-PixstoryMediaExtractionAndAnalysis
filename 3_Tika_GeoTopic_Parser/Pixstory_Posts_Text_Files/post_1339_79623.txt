Don t know what got into me but I tried to teach my nephew Rayaan how to play ball pool yesterday haha He couldn t even hold the cue stick properly and yet we had a whole game which went down to the wire Little did I know I was made the official babysitter of the evening as the rest of the adults lounged by the fire in the garden No regrets though We had a lovely time together
