Sageuk in Korean denotes historical dramas, including traditional drama plays, films or television series. In English language literature sageuk usually refers to historical films and television series.
History fantasies are often soothing with a slow burn romance wnd offer an escape from the real life . They also provide an insight into the culture .some of my favourite are 

Mr queen (it's hilarious)

Moon embracing the sun 
Rookie historian goo hae ryung
Mr sunshine

Empress ki 
Moonlight drean by the clouds
