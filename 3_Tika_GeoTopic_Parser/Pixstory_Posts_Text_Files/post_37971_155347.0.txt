 A Brazilian investment fund has called for Neymar to be jailed for 5-years for his move to Barcelona from Santos in 2013. The Brazilian star is facing fraud and corruption charges over the said move. 
The scandal stemmed from the fact that DIS, which owned 40% of the rights to Brazil forward at the time, argues it lost out because the transfer fee was undervalued.
As per the BBC, DIS acquired a percentage of Neymar's rights when he was 17, in exchange for 2m euros.
Barcelona said at the time of Neymar's move that the transfer fee was 57.1m euros, of which 40m euros was paid to his family.
The investment firm received a 40% share of the remaining 17.1m euros that was paid to Brazilian club Santos.
"Neymar's rights have not been sold to the highest bidder," DIS lawyer Paulo Nasser told a news conference in Barcelona on Thursday. "There were clubs that offered up to 60m euros."
DIS is requesting prison sentences for Rosell and Bartomeu, and a 149m euro fine. There is also a five-year jail term that they want Neymar to undergo for the fraud.
Whereas, Spanish prosecutors want a two-year prison term for Neymar and the payment of a 10m euros fine and a five-year jail term for Rosell, plus an 8.4m euro fine for Barcelona.
Baker McKenzie's statement added that the Neymar family have been charged with "corruption between private individuals" which applies to "competition of products and services between companies" whereas Neymar "is not a service or a commodity".
The hearing is set to begin in the Spanish court on Monday with Neymar asked to be present in front of the Judges.
