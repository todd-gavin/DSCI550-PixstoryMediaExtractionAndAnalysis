Cayler Ellingson, an 18 year old from North Dakota, was murdered by Shannon Brandt after a political argument turned physical, and Brandt ran over Ellingson with his car. Brandt states that he did so because Ellingson was part of an extremist Republican group.Upon investigation, North Dakota police stated that there was no evidence to corroborate Brandt’s claims that Ellingson was in an extremist Republican group. He was shockingly released from jail after posting a $50,000 bond and has been charged with vehicular homicide.Following the incident, tests showed that Brandt’s blood alcohol content was over 0.08 and subsequent interviews with neighbors showed that he was always crazy.Sadly, you’ll mainly hear this story only on social media as mainstream media outlets have chosen to either completely ignore it or shift the story to blast conservatives for blaming Biden’s rhetoric for this type of political violence. This loss of life is tragic, but sadly not uncommon, just underreported since it doesn’t fit the narrative.Protests have erupted in Iran, causing the deaths of nearly 50 people, following an Iranian woman being severely beaten by police while in custody and dying as a result of her injuries simply because she violated laws that require woman to wear a hijab out in public.The protests, primarily run by women, have turned into more than just protests on hijab wearing, but on women’s rights, which are set eerily restricted in Iran.Women can be seen in videos burning their headscarves in protests. As of writing, these protests have occurred in over 80 cities with no signs of slowing down.
