The Supreme Court temporarily reinstated a Trump-era regulation that limited the states' ability to halt energy projects that contaminate waterways.  Numerous journalists denounced the Supreme Court's legitimacy in reaction to this decision and urged Biden to simply "ignore" the Court's decision.

“If SCOTUS rules on regulation without a hearing or argument, the administration should simply ignore it and state that, in the absence of a normal process judicial review, it sees the court’s judgements as advisory but not binding,” one reporter stated, apparently unaware that the United States Constitution prohibits federal courts from issuing advisory opinions. Several other journalists expressed flawed arguments against the Supreme Court's legitimacy, stating both explicitly and implicitly that an illegitimate Court's rulings should not be obeyed. We can only imagine the reaction of those same people if "right-wing" journalists were calling on a Republican president to ignore Supreme Court orders.

These journalists should be more concerned with the media's credibility degradation than with the Court's. Left-wing propagandists posing as journalists often issue their own opinions that seem to contradict their previous – and present – stances.

The Supreme Court now has a favorability rating of 40%, while the mainstream media has a rating of 36%. Perhaps these same journalists who denounce the viewpoints of judges with whom they disagree should look in the mirror and ask themselves why they are not respected either.
