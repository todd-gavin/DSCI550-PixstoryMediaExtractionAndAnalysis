The 2022 invasion of Ukraine by Russia is an ongoing military conflict that began on 24 February.[30] Internationally considered an act of aggression,[31][32][33] the invasion has triggered Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II,[34][35] with more than four million Ukrainians leaving the country[36] and a quarter of the population internally displaced.[37][38] The invasion marked a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War, which began in 2014 following the Ukrainian Revolution of Dignity. Russia subsequently annexed Crimea, and Russian-backed separatists seized part of the south-eastern Donbas region of Ukraine, sparking a war there.[39][40] In 2021, Russia began a large military build-up along its border with Ukraine, amassing up to 190,000 troops along with their equipment. Russian president Vladimir Putin espoused irredentist views,[41] questioned Ukraine's right to statehood,[42][43] and falsely accused Ukraine of being dominated by neo-Nazis who persecute the Russian-speaking, ethnic Russian minority.[44] Putin said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) had threatened Russia's security by expanding eastward since the early 2000s – a claim disputed by NATO[45] – and demanded Ukraine be barred from ever joining the alliance.[46] The United States and others accused Russia of planning to attack or invade Ukraine, which Russian officials repeatedly denied as late as 23 February 2022.[50]
