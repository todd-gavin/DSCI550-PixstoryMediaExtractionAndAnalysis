Zhang was visiting China's Qinling Mountains to observe the behaviour of the Sichuan snub-nosed monkey.

The mountains' temperate forests are the endangered monkeys' only habitat, which in itself is under threat from forest disturbance.

Zhang loves to watch the dynamics of the family group -- how close and friendly they are to each other. And when it is time to rest, the females and young huddle together for warmth and protection.

This image perfectly captures that moment of intimacy.

The young monkey's unmistakable blue face nestled in between two females, their striking golden-orange fur dappled in light.

Equipment used: Canon EOS 1D X Mark II + EF 800mm f5.6L IS USM lens; 1/400 sec at f6.3; ISO 800; AV model.
