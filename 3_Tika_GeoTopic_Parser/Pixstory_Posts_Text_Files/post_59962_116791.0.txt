Margaret Alva, an Indian politician, served as the fourth governor of Uttarakhand as well as the 17th governor of Goa, the 23rd governor of Gujarat, the 20th governor of Rajasthan, and the 17th governor of Goa from August 2013 to August 2014. She was the Cabinet Minister in the past. Shivraj Patil, the governor of Punjab, who had also been in charge of that state, relinquished control to her in Rajasthan. She held a high position in the Indian National Congress and served as the committee's joint secretary before being named governor. Violet Alva, her mother-in-law, served as the Rajya Sabha's second deputy chairperson in the 1960s.

Sharad Pawar, head of the NCP, said that former governor and senior Congress politician Margaret Alva will run as a joint candidate for vice president.

A day ago, the BJP-led NDA declared West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar as their nominee for the nation's second-most important position.

On Tuesday, July 19, the final day for filing paperwork for the election on August 6, Alva (80), a former minister for the Union, would submit her nomination.

After hosting a gathering of opposition leaders at his residence, Pawar told a press conference that 17 parties were in agreement with the decision. The seasoned politician predicted that Alva would submit his VP nomination on Tuesday.

Alva stated in a tweet that it was a privilege and an honour for her to be selected as the joint opposition's nominee for the position of vice president of India. "I thank the opposition leaders for their confidence in me and accept this nomination with the greatest humility. Jai Hind," she added in her letter.

Along with the support of the other 17 parties, Trinamool Congress and Aam Aadmi Party, according to Pawar, will make Alva the joint candidate of a total of 19 parties. Sanjay Raut, a Shiv Sena MP, claimed that the opposition is together in this election.
