The other years we started on August After all, it was only a week early I remember that in the USA we played the final of the World Cup against Brazil in Pasadena in July It was degrees and I played regularly Football football Athletes are athletes and they are so get ready to face the most extreme conditions There can be no discussions about this We have not decided when to start and finish the championship There are dates and they must be respected With these words, the FIGC President Gabriele Gravina vetoed a possible postponement of the start of the championship due to the high temperatures that are affecting the Italian peninsula It will therefore not be possible to postpone the kick-off of the championship also and above all in view of the winter world cup which will force Serie A to remain at a standstill for two months
