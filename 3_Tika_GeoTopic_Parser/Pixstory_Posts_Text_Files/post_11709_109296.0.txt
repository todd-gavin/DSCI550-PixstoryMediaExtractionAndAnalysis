Our body requires more nutrients to recover from the surgery. A well nourished body is better equipped to handle surgery allowing the body to heal and recover quickly.

Some nutrients are more recommended than other such as antioxidants.
During a surgical procedure free radicals are released. Hence, it is important for you to consume foods that are rich in anti-oxidants before and after the surgery.

Fruits are best enjoyed either raw or juiced and vegetables are often easier to digest when cooked. The objective is to consume as much as health giving foods before and after the surgery. 

Moreover, raw vegetable juices are very easy to digest and make a good transition back to eating solid foods once you are back home after surgery.

Since our body is more on medications, it is important to keep our liver hydrated before and after surgery so as to detoxify and clear the unwanted substances from our body. 

It  is recommended that we should drink half of our blood volume of water per day, but if it is difficult for people to stay without water, in that case begin your day with a glass or two and then just keep sipping water throughout the day.
