With increasing quantum, nature and dynamism of roles and responsibilities at workplaces, along with wider embracing of WFH culture in a post-covid world, it is more essential than ever to set proper and clear boundaries at workplaces, in order to protect one's peace and building healthy professional relationships. 

It is essential that one is in touch with their emotional and physical capacities, coupled with defined job responsibilities and timings and properly communicates them. Along with that, it is also essential that one has defined priorities set between their personal and professional life, that helps on deciding appropriate boundaries. 


Setting physical boundaries, defining and limiting the level of physical contact that you're comfortable with, mental boundaries - keeping work outside of one's personal time, setting emotional boundaries with colleagues and maintaining proper and healthy communication about everything goes a long way in helping navigating modern, stressful offices.
