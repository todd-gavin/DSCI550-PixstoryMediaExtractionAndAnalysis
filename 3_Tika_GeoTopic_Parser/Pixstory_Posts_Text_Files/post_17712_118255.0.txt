Linda Sembrant's last-ditch winner sent Sweden into a semi-final tie against England scheduled next Tuesday, following a dominant performance against a brave Belgium side.

With the winning strike, Sembrant became Sweden's oldest Women's EURO scorer, aged 35 years and 68 days.

Sweden has won their third successive Women's EURO match, equalling their best run at the tournament.


But will Sweden make it to the final at Wembley?
