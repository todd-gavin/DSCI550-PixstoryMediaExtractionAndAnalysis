Paolo Zanetti coach of Venice commented on the draw in the direct clash for salvation with Genoa on the microphones of Dazn We wanted to win this match as Genoa wanted It was high stakes at stake it was not an easy match We conceded goals in lined-up defense which scared us a bit and lowered the intensity We played with a new formation that exposed us to some new problems But the draw is the right result in the end Ball handling is part of expert teams we have to pay attention and aggression our weapons I got angry on the counterattack not exploited by Johnsen and Aramu because we could have gone the other way We had to exploit the action in a different way l you have to score a question of choosing growth to score points you need to score Nani I had seen him well during the week Johnsen suffered from gastroenteritis Then, given how the game had turned out, it seemed more appropriate to use Johnsen in open-field rebounds and with long teams
