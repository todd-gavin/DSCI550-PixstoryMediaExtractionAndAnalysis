A traveler is no stranger to the feeling of homesickness As much as we love to roam around the globe some days we just want to curl up in our home bed and not get up for days And this feeling often comes when we re out Maybe a bad day bad weather unpleasant experience with a stranger or just nothing Anything can trigger it What I do in those times is find a sense of purpose I remind myself why I m here Develop a keen awareness of your surroundings and take action such as giving a starving dog food or assisting someone with a task that will make you feel good Put some thought into what you do try to do something of purpose to make yourself feel useful in a new place Keep in mind that your time away from home is finite and that soon you will return carrying with you the memories of the things you did that gave you meaning Recognize that your vacation is only a transitory situation Time does not stand still you will be closer to being at home again with each passing second and minute allowing you to fully appreciate the comforts that come with being at home Live in the present and observe your surroundings by choosing a different route finding a hidden beach area snapping pictures of fascinating or beautiful items or posing an open ended question to a stranger
