Outsiders may think of D.C. as a city of stodgy politicos, but its food scene boasts a hotbed of creativity for the people who work, live, and travel here to enjoy. Considering the wood-burning Levantine cooking going down in Navy Yard, the long lines forming for Filipino-American fast food and inventive Asian-American doughnuts at a downtown food hall, or the diners sweating from scotch bonnet-spiked Trini takeout on H Street NE, the Washington area has one of the most vibrant restaurant scenes in the United States. Here is Eater’s regularly updated guide to the neighborhoods and foods every aspiring D.C. aficionado needs to know.

As the stereotype goes, D.C. is a world of power breakfasts and steak houses. But the best thing about eating in D.C. is the variety of international cuisine found around the city and its surrounding suburbs in Maryland and Virginia.

Southeast Asian foods are particularly strong. Longtime popular destinations include Little Serow and Baan Siam for Northern Thai, and Maketto for Taiwanese and Cambodian cafe food. The family that sparked the #LaoFoodMovement with a secret menu at their Thai restaurant in Falls Church (now Padaek) has spots scattered across the area, including Thip Khao in Columbia Heights and cocktail bar Hanumanh in Shaw. Malaysian specialties full of sweet, spicy, sour, and funky flavors at Makan make the Columbia Heights restaurant one of the buzziest in the city. Much of the area’s rich Vietnamese food culture is centered around the Eden Center in Falls Church, Virginia, but for a more upscale, contemporary take, diners can check out Moon Rabbit on the Southwest Waterfront. And for refined Korean bar food from a rising, James Beard Award-nominated chef, check out Anju in between Dupont and Adams Morgan.

Two high-end, wood-burning Middle Eastern restaurants have attracted national notice over the past few years: Albi, in Navy Yard, and Maydan, just north of the U Street corridor. On H Street NE, Trinidadian-themed Cane is known for pimento-smoked jerk chicken wings, whole fried snapper escovitch, and doubles (fry bread, stewed chickpeas, spicy chutneys) that offer a high-end version of the Caribbean specialties found in carryouts along Georgia Avenue NW.
