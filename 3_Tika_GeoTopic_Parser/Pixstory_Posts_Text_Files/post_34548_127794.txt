A complicated moment for Matteo Berrettini The Roman tennis player was eliminated for the second time in the space of a week and always in the first round A week ago he was eliminated from the Montreal tournament yesterday in Cincinnati instead he failed to beat the American Frances Tiafoe The American won with both sets taken home at the tie break in a match that lasted almost three hours Berrettini seemed to be on the up and up but a distant relative to the one who won two tournaments just a couple of months ago The match was very close in almost three hours we witnessed a only break scored by Berrettini in the second set the only one who won for the remaining two sets were played point by point with Tiafoe good and lucky to win both tie breaks the first easily the second with more difficulty for Berrettini&#39;s return For the second round Tiafoe will face compatriot Sebastian Korda
