Valentino always walks last like the nice guy who holds the door open for you and smiles Before I thought it was just a case of a little kindness at most but Valentino always walks last because he knows that after one of his shows no one else would compare in the slightest. art the wisdom and mastery that he demonstrates every single time Pierpaolo Piccioli creative creator of the Roman maison for years now reminds us that he is the last couturier Cursed me if this last sentence smells like Amarcordiana absolutely not Pierpaolo is not the least of the creatives because there won&#39;t be any more on the contrary simply the biggest one around at the moment A show as important as Spring Haute Couture deserves at least a couple of separate posts and in this first one I want to focus on menswear Boys are finally freed from suits and jackets gray the conventional prisons are swept away by showers of crystals These are not men nor angels they are elegant and have an ethereal flavor but you can see from the way they wear the glittery trousers and the ruffled shirt that they know how to have fun Pierpaolo is not only showing us how much beauty can save us but it also tells us that it can make us smile and feel good about ourselves
