So are you a girl who had seen the once hidden 
stars before her eyes, 
as small as they were, 
they saw a refuge in the place she called tears, 
soaring in the night,
she gently lands in the garden of the moon, 
she had seen every petal as a word of poetry, 
a cinematic scene, 
the flowers of her becomes a guest within the heart, they asked, “how did you know of our 
secrets?” 
to which she says, “I am love and so are 
you”.
