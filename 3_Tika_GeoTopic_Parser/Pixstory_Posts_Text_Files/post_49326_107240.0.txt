During their FESTA dinner, a video celebration of the band's founding, the K-pop boy band announced the break. The boys will go their own ways after nine years together to embark on solo projects.

Jin, Jimin, RM, J-Hope, Suga, V, and Jungkook got together for a dinner, which was shown live on YouTube the day following their 9th anniversary. After the band insisted on taking a break to rediscover their voice and direction, a joyful dinner quickly turned serious.

They said they've been struggling to work as a band and need to take a break to have the same equation again.

This will be the third hiatus for the K-Pop artists since they began recording songs together, with the first coming in 2019 and the second in 2021. That was sad but I'm hoping we'll see them come together again very soon! :(
