Wednesday was just another day on AEW Dynamite to kick off new rivalries after the Double or Nothing DoN pay per view on Sunday However AEW s top heel MJF Maxwell Jacob Friedman had other plans as he went into business for himself by delivering a scathing promo following his loss to his former partner Wardlow at the DoN MJF ripped apart AEW President Tony Khan calling him out for signing ex WWE superstars The promo comes on the heels of the reports of MJF having a real life rift with Tony especially as he did not show up at a Fan Fest Mett and Greet event a day before the PPV which many fans are claiming to be a work MJF has always been known up to stir controversies and this promo certainly helped raise his stock as he has become talk of the town During his promo MJF alleged Tony of prioritising ex WWE guys who can t lace his boots MJF AEW have been negotiating a contract since the beginning of the year which expires in However MJF has been unimpressed with the offer on the table as he knows that he can find a better deal with WWE who have been following his work closely Clearly the talks haven t been going well as MJF shouted at Tony in the promo to Fire Him and also stooped as low as to yelling profanities referring to the AEW boss as a mark The wrestling fans on the twitter had a field day with the promo and were very quick to compare this promo to World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk s Pipebomb promo during his time in WWE in The whole situation is riddled with Irony because during the promo MJF s mic was cut by the management similar to Punk during his pipebomb promo During the promo Punk an ex WWE guy ironically made his way to the ring when MJF s mic was cut off It wouldn t be a stretch to imagine that the promo was shoot and was actually unscipted
