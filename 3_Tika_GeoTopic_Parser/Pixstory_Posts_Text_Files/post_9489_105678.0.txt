International Community in Afghanistan continues ..

9/11 was a turning point in the presidency of George W. Bush and US foreign policy, leading directly to US support for the overthrow of the Taleban regime in Afghanistan, where Al-Qaeda was based. The attacks were used to justify, in part, the US-led invasion of Iraq despite the lack of any clear evidence linking the Iraqi government to Al-Qaeda, but the impact of 9/11 contributed to strong American public support for the invasion of Afghanistan. 

The Bush administration, which had already insisted on strong presidential powers, asserted that the US was at war (a response not echoed by the Spanish and British government in the wake of subsequent significant terror attacks in Madrid and London) and that legal restrictions did not exist on the President’s powers to defend the country, a position subsequently questioned by the US Supreme Court. 

In 2001, the response of the American Congress was interesting and important. As Yassin El Ayouty, et. al. points out that unlike in 1941 (Pearl Harbour), Congress acted before the President and had explained to the nation who was responsible for the sudden attack on its shores.

On 18 September 2001, following a week in which panic and confusion gave way to resilience and resolve, Congress enacted a Joint Resolution directed to the source of the attack. Since the enemy had not been officially identified, Congress declared simply that “on 11 September 2001, acts of treacherous violence were committed against the US and its citizens.” Enough was known about the probable source of the attacks, and therefore, such acts rendered it both necessary and appropriate that the US exercise its rights to self-defence and to protect US citizens both at home and abroad.
