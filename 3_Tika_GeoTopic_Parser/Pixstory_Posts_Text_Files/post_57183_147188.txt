No change has been made to the prevalent problems and it s still inflicting the black people in the league Besides many coaches have shown their frustration the recent one was the lawsuit by Brian Flores who got fired by the Miami Dolphins in January He accused the NFL of practising unfair methods while hiring and firing practices Although it s not the first time the news has been hovering around the NFL s behaviour towards people of colour it has happened quite often but still barely any changes could be seen As the NFL s new season unfolds with just three Black head coaches Todd Bowles of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Lovie Smith of the Houston Texans and Mike Tomlin of the Pittsburgh Steelers This same number was present nearly two decades ago so clearly there s no use of the Rooney Rule in the league Also many coaches have resigned thinking they would not get the same opportunities as their white counterparts According to a report nbsp Leslie Frazier defensive coordinator for the Buffalo Bills said in an interview that there had been countless reasons given to choose their white counterparts over them It seems like the criteria moves One week or one year it s We want an offensive minded guy Another year We want a guy with a Super Bowl winning background What s the criteria Sometimes it s because he s a great leader Sometimes it s because he came up the same way I came up But the common theme is an owner is going to hire someone that looks like that owner People still expect the change Source Washington Post
