Roger Federer is a household name at this point in his career. 

He has been phenomenal over the last 2 decades for tennis. Not only is he one of the greats of the game, he is also an amazing role model for young people to look up to. 

Roger has been a trailblazer for tennis winning over 20 grandslams in his illustrious career. 

However, he has become a shadow of his former self. He has had 3 major surgeries in the past 24 months, and hasn't played tennis for the past 6 months. 

Even if he wins another grand slam which would be a miracle, his glory days are over, and before he becomes a nostalgia act, it is better for him, his legacy and the fans that he hangs up the boots
