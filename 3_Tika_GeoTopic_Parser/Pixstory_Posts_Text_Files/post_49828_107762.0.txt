Gun control bills had stirred hope in Us but the proposals have almost no chance of being ratified by the Senate and becoming law.

The bill would increase the age limit for buying a semi-automatic rifle and prohibit the sale of ammunition magazines with a capacity of more than 15 rounds.

The legislation was enacted by a mostly party-line vote of 223-204. It has almost no chance of becoming law as the Senate pursues negotiations concentrated on improving mental health programmes, strengthening school security and enhancing background checks. 



The seemingly never-ending cycle of mass shootings in the US has rarely motivated Congress to act. But the shooting of 19 children and two teachers in Uvalde has revived efforts in a way that has lawmakers from both parties speaking about the need to respond.

“It’s sickening, it’s sickening that our children are forced to live in this constant fear,” said the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi.

Pelosi said the House vote would “make history by making progress”. But it is unclear where the House measure will go after Wednesday’s vote, given that Republicans were adamant in their opposition.

The work to find common ground is mostly taking place in the Senate, where backing from 10 Republicans will be needed to get a bill signed into law. 

Five Republicans voted for the bill: Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, Chris Jacobs of New York, Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Fred Upton of Michigan. Only Fitzpatrick is attempting re-election. On the Democratic side, Jared Golden of Maine and Kurt Schrader of Oregon were the only no votes. Schrader lost his re-election attempt in the Democratic primary. Golden faces a competitive election in November. There is always a fake hope republicans provide now we have lost trust in them regarding gun control yet again.
