An Indigenous Senator has called out Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for holding a press conference with NBA star Shaquille O’Neal.
During the press conference, which was held on Saturday, the basketball superstar was expected to express his support for the Indigenous Voice to Parliament, however after a some vague comments he quickly left.
Country Liberals Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price later spoke out, calling the PM’s publicity stunt “clueless and out of touch
In a post to Facebook, Ms Nampijinpa expressed her disappointment in the PM.
She also said Aboriginal Australians have more in common with Native Americans than African-Americans.
“If the PM and Minister for indigenous Australians thinks Shaq’s experience with “lifting people up who are marginalised” is the answer to winning Yes votes for the Voice then it demonstrates just how clueless and out of touch they both are with what the needs of Aboriginal Australians are.
“I’ve no doubt Shaq’s a top bloke but it’s a bit insulting to call on a black American to help with black Australians as if this is all about the colour of one’s skin,” Ms Nampijinpa said.
She said the act was “shallow” as the country faces “such serious issues.”
The Prime Minister said Mr O’Neal had requested the meeting while in Sydney to learn about the referendum on the Indigenous Voice to Parliament
