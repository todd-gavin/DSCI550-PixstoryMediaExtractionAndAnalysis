There reportedly is optimism that Los Angeles Lakers forward Carmelo Anthony will only be day to day after suffering a hamstring strain against the Los Angeles Clippers Anthony left the Lakers loss to the Clippers on Thursday night after scoring seven points in just minutes of playing time The Lakers certainly need Anthony s offense in the lineup with LeBron James already sidelined due to swelling in his knee Anthony has been a key piece off the bench for the Lakers this season He is averaging points rebounds and assist per game while shooting percent from the field and percent from beyond the arc The Lakers next game will be on Saturday against the New York Knicks It will be interesting to see if Anthony is able to suit up against his former team in that matchup
