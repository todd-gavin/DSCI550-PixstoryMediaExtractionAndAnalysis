White House chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci on Sunday said if former President Trump wins the presidency again in Fauci will not return to serve Trump in the White House Fauci the chief medical adviser to President Biden gave CNN s Jim Acosta a plain no when asked if he would work with the th president again If you look at the history of what the response was during the administration I think you know at best you can say it wasn t optimal Fauci said History will speak for itself about that Trump has strongly suggested his intent to run in but has not formally announced a presidential bid Fauci who also heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases publicly crossed Trump over various health policies and misinformation during the initial months of the pandemic Early on Fauci pressed for masks and social distancing frequently warning of the perils of the pandemic while Trump downplayed the severity of the novel coronavirus As the pandemic wore on Fauci earned the scorn of conservatives who wanted to end public health measures to curb the spread of COVID I can tell you I take no pleasure at all in being in a situation of contradicting the president so it was really something that you didn t feel you could actually say something and there wouldn t be any repercussions about it he said then The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know what the evidence and science is and know that s it let the science speak it is somewhat of a liberating feeling Fauci added
