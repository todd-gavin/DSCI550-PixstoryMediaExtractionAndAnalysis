 continued When I shared my identity in the aviation industry in India they denied my medical certificate Many doctors are reluctant to write gender incongruence in medical certificates Instead they put all trans people under the category of mental illness That s what they were claiming when I went to get my medical certificate They mentioned that I m having a gender identity disorder and I was grounded for a year Also they took me through invasive medical physical and mental procedures to prove that I m not mentally ill After that I decided that I wouldn t give up on my identity I was ready to get surgery at any cost because I was suffocating for years by wearing these binders I expected the experience to be as bad as it has always been in medical institutes As a trans and as a cis passing trans man when you are at the operation table sometimes these people make fun of our bodies But instead I was made so comfortable in Medicity from the reception staff to the anaesthesia specialist they asked for consent for each and every medical procedure explaining the pros and cons of everything When I shared this experience through social media I got very positive responses from a lot of trans people and parents of trans people who are still afraid of doing surgery just because of this taboo that we have I was super happy to help them by sharing my experience
