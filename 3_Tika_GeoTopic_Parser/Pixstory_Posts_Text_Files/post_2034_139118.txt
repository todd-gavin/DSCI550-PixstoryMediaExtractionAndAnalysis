In a major win for Trump in the course of the Mar a Lago raid debacle a federal judge sided with Trump s lawyers and appointed a special master to review the evidence that was seized from the former President s home With this special master appointed it will prevent the Justice Department from accessing the documents that were seized Predictably the left has done to the judge exactly what they admonish when done by the right which is publicly disclose the name and face of the judge who sided with Trump placing her into the public sphere and subjecting her to public condemnation and potential threats of violence This is exactly what occurred when the far right found and publicized the name of the judge who signed off on the search warrant for the raid which the left vehemently admonished The special master will have the duty of reviewing the documents seized in order to determine which are protected by certain privileges such as the attorney client privilege and the executive privilege Despite this being a win for Trump it is likely that this special master will only serve to delay the case rather than provide anything substantive to the process since the Justice Department has likely already reviewed much of the documents from the seizure Whatever the outcome of this may be this is a victory for Trump and a roadblock for the DOJ who engaged in an unjustified raid of the former President s residence
