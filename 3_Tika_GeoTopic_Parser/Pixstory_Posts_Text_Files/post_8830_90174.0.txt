An experiment in Dyarchy and it's failure continues....

A Socialist leader, Mr. Achyut Patwardhan now came to see me in the palace and suggested that I should have a free and frank talk with Sheikh Abdulla in his presence. He further suggested that it would be in the interest of Kasmir if I gave up my office and Sheikh Abdulla was left incharge of the State administration. I told him that I had been invited to come here by the Maharaja and would not quit without his order. 

When I went to meet Sheikh Abdulla at the Guest House, he started talking in a bullying and browbeating manner. He said that I should never have accepted the office of the Prime Minister. He tried to flatter me by saying that I was a brilliant judge and had my own independent office in India. Under the circumstances, he suggested, that it would be advisable for me to leave the State on my own initiative and hand over the administration to him. I told him that his bullying tactics would not work with me. I could net be driven out of the State by Sheikh Abdulla or as a matter of fact by anyone, I would quit my office, I assured him, only when His Highness agreed to release me. At the end of the interview, having felt that he had overdone his bullying, Sheikh Abdulla apologised to me for what he had said and we parted in a friendly atmosphere.
