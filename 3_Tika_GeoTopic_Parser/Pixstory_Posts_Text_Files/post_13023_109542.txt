The sound of footsteps comes from the depths of darkness But not to the sadness of dancing It looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring They laughed at the crowd And they ask for a lyric from Hafez s heart Red pomegranates with rosy watermelons Official of our longtime A lasting memory Apart from all the dumb noise of the city Apart from the polluted darkness But maybe someone is absolutely involved at night Someone like me is left alone in the crowd In the room in the house in the city Everything bears the burden of memories And these public spaces It is our private space and the space of others Autonomy Disillusioned one night Do not hear voices Do not see the pictures Be alone and shout And reflect this wave we choose Do not let destiny write a story full of loneliness and disappointment Let s hear the sounds we like Let s see the pictures we want And change instead of drowning Let s celebrate every night With the name of the night Let s live We can change the dominant color of our life from gray and black and change the color of green and orange to red Even by walking in the streets of my city
