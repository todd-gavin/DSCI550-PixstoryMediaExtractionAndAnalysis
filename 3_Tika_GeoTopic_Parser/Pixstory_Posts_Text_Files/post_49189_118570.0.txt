We cannot let children do whatever they please. You are forgetting, children don't magically have a personality. We, as their parents, teach them one.

Their thoughts, their opinions matter on how we raise them. As kids, they need to be reminded that they are still not mature enough to take some decisions in their life. Especially, they need to be taught how to be respectful.

And this generation is doing a terrible job doing it, we can see that. Kids today do not seem to respect elders at all. It's not to say they can't have their own opinions but they have to understand that their parents only want the best for them and sometimes parents have to be strict.

Parents absolutely are doing a big job raising their kids so why should kids not know that? Children are under the protection of their parents and there's nothing wrong in wanting your children to be respectful about that fact!
