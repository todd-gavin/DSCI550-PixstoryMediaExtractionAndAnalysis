Since I ve become an adult I ve come to realise how important it is to learn how to manage your own finances without depending on your parents and becoming financially independent nbsp So here is what I learnt There s no need to get into all the fancy things after all you re not a professional in this field but start SOMEWHERE Calculate your budget we re doing it monthly it s quite simple really firstly add all your incomes from your job internships fellowships freelance pocket money whatever it is here s a tip if you re young I d suggest you not to count the money that comes in through the deposits your parents had made when you were a kid unless it s really urgent SAVE IT then subtract your expenses and that includes food interests on loans grocery basic necessities college fees conveyance money and all Now what is left behind is ur budget Tip if it s too little try cutting up on some expenses if possible and ALWAYS spend less than you earn on a monthly basis KEEP TRACK of your spending do it in whatever way possible through excel sheets through writing it down whatever makes it work for you Save for retirement and old age look for some long term investment options explore stock market if you re up for it or just invest in bank schemes but saving for old age is necessary Tip please read all the terms and conditions carefully and don t just go over it like the ads show Keep something for emergencies saving for retirement is required but while doing that don t forget to put some savings aside for emergencies because you never know what may happen so put some amout aside and make sure it s liquid enough Plan how you want to pay your loans and debts student loan home loan etc in a clear and phased manner As a last tip I d suggest you look for insurance schemes as well specially the really necessary ones like life insurance vehicle insurance and health insurance Hope this was helpful so lets become financially independent from today
