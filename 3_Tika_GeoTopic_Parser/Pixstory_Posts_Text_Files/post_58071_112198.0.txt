There are thousands of childless married couples  and thousands of orphaned children in India .Yet the adoption rates are horribly low. 
There are several factors in it , lack of children available for legal adoption, now proper guidelines and most importantly social stigma. 

Most couples actually choose to reamain childless than adopting a child. It is seen as a source of shame or last resort when parents are unable to conceive.
Plus the idea of 'apna khoon ' our flesh and blood ,our genes is deeply imbedded in soceity . It is widely believed that you can only be considered family if you share the same blood.

People even have deep obsession with fair skin , a lot of adopted children  are  judged on the basis of their skin color .Soceity is not ready to improve such families.
Sometimes an adopted child is even viewed as a source of evil, that would bring bad luck to the adoptive parents.


But people forget about the most important thing blood is not what makes a family ,love is. To become a mother ,father one does not need to give birth to a child .

Adopting a child is a most beautiful thing one can do , to become someone 's family to form a bond a bond of trust , love and compassion is fascinating.

There are all types of families in the world , some are different than others ,but one thing is common in all of them ,that is love .
Families love and cherish each other .
Love for their child is what makes someone a parent in true sense ,not a blood relation.
