Undoubtedly, if it were not for the displacement of the last three decades, the people of Afghanistan and the world would never have been aware of the tragedy of massacre, slavery and displacement a century ago; Afghanistan provided them to look back. A past that has been nothing but sorrow, massacre, slavery and displacement, deprivation of justice, public welfare and individual well-being.
Thus, migration and displacement, with all its damages and problems that plagued our people and inflicted irreparable blows on everyone from a spiritual point of view, also led to the result of exposing the hidden historical facts. Therefore, this socio-cultural approach is one of the important and significant achievements of the migration period.
In the 1990s, Afghanistan, with more than 5 million refugees, accounted for more than a third of the world's total displacement. Without exaggeration, approximately 10 million Afghans and Afghans have alternated with the phenomenon of displacement abroad. Before the fall of the Taliban in 2001, Afghanistan, with 3.5 million refugees in neighboring countries and the world, accounted for 40% of the world. Of course, this displacement was not related to ethnicity, language, religion and specific region, but included all sections of society from each ethnic group and region. In the current situation, despite the formation of an independent government in the country, but for various reasons, including insecurity, there are still about 5 million Afghan refugees in neighboring Iran, Pakistan and other countries.
