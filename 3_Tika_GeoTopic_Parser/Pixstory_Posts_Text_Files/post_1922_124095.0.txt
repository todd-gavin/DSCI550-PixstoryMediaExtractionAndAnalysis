On July 27th The Walton County Sheriff’s Office raided a home in Loganville, Georgia due to an anonymous tip that someone was downloading child porn. 

After interviewing the suspect, police learned of a another suspect in the same county who was “producing homemade child sexual abuse material with at least one child who lived in the home,” 

Police got a warrant and raided the house of William and Zachary Zulock who had adopted sibling boys. 

Police found evidence the pair, who were the children’s adoptive fathers, “were engaging in sexually abusive acts and video documenting this abuse. 

Both men were charged with aggravated child molestation, sexual exploitation of a child and enticing a child for indecent purposes. 

My question is: who allowed these men to adopt? Why is there not as much screening and background check for adoption as liberals want for firearms? Why is this not national news?
