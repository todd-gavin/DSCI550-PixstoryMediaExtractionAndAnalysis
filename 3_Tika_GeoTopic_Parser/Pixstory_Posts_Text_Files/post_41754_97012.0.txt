The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) said on Tuesday that it will not accept an offer to send athletes to the Asian Games for the first time this year because none of the invited sports federations expressed interest in coming to Hangzhou. 

Ommanorama News reported that the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) had invited roughly 300 athletes and 150 support personnel from Oceania countries, including Australia and New Zealand, to compete in the Games in the eastern Chinese metropolis from September 10 to 25. 

On Tuesday, an AOC spokesperson told Reuters, "We don't have any athletes travelling." 

Outgoing AOC president John Coates, an IOC Vice-President and one of the world's most powerful sports administrators, had long lobbied for Australia's athletes to compete in the Asian Games in order to expose them to more challenging competition. Because the Asian Games are the second-largest sporting event in the world, after the Summer Olympics.
