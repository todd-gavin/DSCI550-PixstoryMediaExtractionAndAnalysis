India clinch the series 3-0 with complete whitewash against West Indies.
Rohit Sharma won the toss and opted to bat first. Wickets in the powerplay, hugely impressive spells from Prasidh, runs for Suryakumar, Iyer and the middle order in general - just a few of the many positives India will take from the series. It's their first ODI whitewash of the West Indies who were just not up for the challenge. Maybe they'll show up in the T20Is which begin in five days time. Before that, the focus turns to the IPL auctions.

India chose to bat first and scored  265 runs with Jason Holder being the only standout perfomer for the Indies yet again as he picked up the last 4 wickets managing an impression spell of 8-34-4. 

With the Indian opening batsmen failing to score big Shreyas Iyer and Rishab Pant fought back scoring 80 and 56 runs respectively. 

West Indies batsmen who haven't been able to bat good throughout the series could not chase the total this time around either as the Indian bowling unit managed to get all 10 wickets in just 37.1 overs and conceded only 169 runs. 
Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna were impressive again as they both picked up 3, wickets each. Deepak Chahar and Kuldeep Yadav picked up 2 wickets each as well.
Shikhar Dhawan returned to the side after his covid spell but failed to score big as the top order fell through very easily with Virat Kohli going out on a duck. 

Odean Smith has emerged as a good all rounder during this series doing good with both the bat and ball who also scored an impressive 36 off just 18 balls.
