Seeing my BFF, or shall I say, former BFF, getting married and not telling me, I got to thinking about relationships—more specifically, drifting in relationships. So what do I mean when I say the word drifting?

If I look up the word in the dictionary, I would learn that Drifting means: " to move slowly, especially as a result of outside forces, with no control over direction".

I guess this is what happened between me and my best friend in college. We could not be separated—we did everything together. We travelled to and from college together, studied for exams together and more importantly, did all our assignments together. 

My best friend was a lot braver than I was, I mean a lot braver. She would push me to always be my best. And I would push her too.

But then one day, as the last exam of our last semester ended, I hugged my best friend goodbye promising that we would be in touch and nothing would change. Alas, life had other plans.

As we started to live our lives and navigate through the post-college childishness, something was left behind. Time for friends. I guess I took my best friend for granted. I got busy and so did she. 

I called her rarely. And suddenly, we shared nothing about our lives. We couldn't go a day without sharing what happened and update about our parents and life too. 

Now, it's been three years since we graduated. She's married and I am on to my endeavours. I have friends who I talk about life with but I miss her. I only want the best for her and I know she would want the same for me too. 

I miss my best friend. I really do. It feels lonely doing what I am doing right now. Of course, you have your family and they are your everything. It's just that I have been missing my best friend too much. 

I guess this is life. We just drifted apart. Life happened. I can wish for turning back time, but that is childish. All I can do is hold on to the memories.
