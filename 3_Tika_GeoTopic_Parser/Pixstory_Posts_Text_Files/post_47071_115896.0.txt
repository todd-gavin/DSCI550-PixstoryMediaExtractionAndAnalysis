Canada and Jamaica will compete in the 2022 Concacaf W Championship on Thursday, July 14, 2022 at 10 Pm (ET) at the Universitario Stadium in San Nicolás de los Garza, Mexico.

With nine points gained in three matches, Canada won Group B. Jamaica, on the other hand,
ended with six points following three games to take second place in Group A.

Their fourth overall encounter will take place here. There are no obvious favorites in this
matchup because the Jamaican women have not yet won, while Canada's women's national
soccer team has won once within head-to-head competition. The final results of the final two
games were draws.

On February 1, 2020, the Canadians blasted Jamaica with a final score of 9-0 in the Olympic
Qualifications, ending their penultimate matchup. As they square off for the first time after that in
the new version of CONCACAF Women’s Championship, it appears to be a really thrilling
confrontation.
