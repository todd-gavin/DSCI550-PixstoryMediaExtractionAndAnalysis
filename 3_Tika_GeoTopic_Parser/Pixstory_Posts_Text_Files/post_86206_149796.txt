The sea the sand and the setting sun Sometimes i wonder what more would you ask from life if you could stay here forever freeze this photograph and live in it repeating it again and again The warm sea splashing against your feet the sand sliding away from under you the clouds taking wonderful shapes and making you a kid again as you find different shapes in them and the sun the sun slowly setting down but leaving with such an incomprehensible beauty that it leaves you spellbound each time
