The Sikkim Government has unveiled two progressive schemes to promote empowerment of women and girl children in the State.

The two initiatives are called “Bahini” and “Aama Yojna”. In the former girls in Class IX and above will be provided free sanitary napkins, making Sikkim the first State in the country to do so. The second scheme is aimed at non-working women and under it Rs.20,000 each will be directly transferred directly into their bank accounts. For the women to receive this amount, it is mandatory that their names should be in the electoral roll.
