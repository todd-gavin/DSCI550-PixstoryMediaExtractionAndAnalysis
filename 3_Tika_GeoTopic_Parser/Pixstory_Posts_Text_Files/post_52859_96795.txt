Just another next door introvert here trying to fit in the glamorous society I m an enthusiastic learner and take deep interest in developing connections be it personal or professional I like reading about finance economics government policies and people I seek inspiration in every little thing I prefer honest conversations over parties walk over rides but peace amidst chaos I m sensitive towards nature and can t tolerate if anyone tries to harm it Also I love collecting books well really guilty of not being consistent with reading I m trying to get back on the track P C Pinterest Flowers and moon bring me immense joy I hope they do the same to you too
