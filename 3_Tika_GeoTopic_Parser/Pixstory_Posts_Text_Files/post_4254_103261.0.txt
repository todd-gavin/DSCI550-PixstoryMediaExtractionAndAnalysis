When news reports revealed that Prashant Kishor, the brilliant election strategist from the land of the legendary Chanakya, was in talks with the Congress Party, there was a wave of excitement and hope in old Congress supporters and those who firmly believe in democracy. Maybe, the man with the Midas touch could revive the comatose Grand Old Party which has nearly been decimated in the country? After all, isn’t Kishor the man who has delivered sure-shot electoral victories for many a political party in India?

Though, knowing the rigid nature of the Grand Old Party which has resisted every attempt at modernising it and rescuing it from the stranglehold of the dynasty, it was too much to hope that Kishor would be able to make a difference. But optimistic Congress-watchers thought maybe it was providence that the 45-year-old who had snatched victory from the jaws of defeat for many a political party, had offered to give the gasping 135-year-old party the kiss of life?

 The “will they, won’t they” get married drama played out in full public view with the country’s media following every move and giving a blow by blow account. Those who wish the country well were hoping against hope that for once, the Grand Old Party -- which is now just Old and nowhere near Grand -- and those who run it and swear allegiance to it, would embrace this opportunity to set their house in order. When I say ‘those who wish the country well’, I don’t mean that it is only the Congress who can run the country well and the rest just make a hash of it. Far from it!
