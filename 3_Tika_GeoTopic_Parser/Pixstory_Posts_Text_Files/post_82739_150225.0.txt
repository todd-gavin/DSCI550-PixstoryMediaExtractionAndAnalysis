India won one sided match against SA
Score : SA 106/8 (20) IND 110/2 (16.4)
Still 3 things to sort out for India
●SA scored very low, consider it either there batting show flop or our bowlers hits but Bumrah is still not in the team, so we must be worry about world cup
●Seniors Rohit and Virat are unable to keep there performance consistent.
● Rishabh or KL who will keep place.
