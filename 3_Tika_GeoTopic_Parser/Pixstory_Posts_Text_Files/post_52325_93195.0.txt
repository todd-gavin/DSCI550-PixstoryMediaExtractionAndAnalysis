The majority of clothing is made of textiles. One of the first achievements of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century was the partial automation of the spinning and weaving of wool, cotton, and other natural fibres. These processes are highly automated and carried out by computer-controlled high-speed machinery in the twenty-first century. A significant portion of the textile industry produces fabrics for use in clothing. Natural fibres (such as wool, cotton, silk, and linen) are used alongside synthetic fibres (such as nylon, acrylic, and polyester). Growing interest in sustainable fashion (or "eco-fashion") has resulted in increased use of environmentally friendly fibres like hemp. Moisture wicking (e.g., Coolmax), stain resistance, and other properties are conferred by high-tech synthetic fabrics.
(e.g., 303 High Tech Fabric Guard), body heat retention or dissipation, and protection from fire, weapons (e.g., Kevlar), cold (e.g., Thinsulate), ultraviolet radiation (Solarweave), and other hazards. Dyeing, weaving, printing, and other manufacturing and finishing processes produce fabrics with a wide range of effects. Textile manufacturers collaborate with fashion forecasters to create fabrics with colours, textures, and other qualities that anticipate consumer demand well in advance of the apparel production cycle.
