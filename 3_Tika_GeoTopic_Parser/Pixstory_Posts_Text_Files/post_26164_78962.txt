In DAKAR Senegal A crowd of people holding metal spikes jumped on trash spilling out of a dump truck in Senegal s biggest landfill hacking at the garbage to find valuable plastic Nearby sleeves rolled up suds up to their elbows women washed plastic jerrycans in rainbow colors cut into pieces Around them piles of broken toys plastic mayonnaise jars and hundreds of discarded synthetic wigs stretched as far as the eye could see all ready to be sold and recycled Plastic waste is exploding in Senegal as in many countries as populations and incomes grow and with them demand for packaged mass produced products This has given rise to a growing industry built around recycling plastic waste by businesses and citizens alike From Chinese traders to furniture makers and avant garde fashion designers many in Senegal make use of the constant stream of plastic waste Mbeubeuss the dump site serving Senegal s seaside capital of Dakar is where it all begins More than trash pickers as well as scrubbers choppers haulers on horse drawn carts middlemen and wholesalers make a living by finding preparing and transporting the waste for recycling It adds up to a huge informal economy that supports thousands of families Source New York times
