We don't always appreciate architecture as much as we ought to. Next time you cross the street, take a moment to look around. Architecture is a root of everything. Consider all the incredible structures found around the world. It's only appropriate that we acknowledge the effort put forth in creating these. World Architecture Day was established to honour this sector of the economy. With their incredible creations, architects have the power to alter the world in which we live. The purpose of World Architecture Day is to celebrate both their contributions and the significance of architecture. Today is observed as World Architecture Day all across the world. Although it may be observed on many days and in various ways, it is still wonderful to see that it is an art and industry that is being appreciated all around the world. From Argentina and Venezuela to Brazil and Bolivia; countries all around the world pay honor to the work of architects.Source: DOY
