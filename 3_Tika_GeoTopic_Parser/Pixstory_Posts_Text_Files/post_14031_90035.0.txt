Ousmane Dembélé might not be renewing his contract with Barcelona after all. He didn't sign the deal during January as he wanted more wages as per the rumours. The fans even booed him but lately he's been performing brilliantly for them, he also had a great El-Classico. So, the Barcelona fans will be disappointed to learn that Dembele might be going to PSG as they'll be looking a replacement for Mbappe who might be going to his dream club, Real Madrid.
