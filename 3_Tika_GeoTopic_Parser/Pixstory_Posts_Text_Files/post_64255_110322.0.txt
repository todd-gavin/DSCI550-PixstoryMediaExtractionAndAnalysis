Oftentimes we people get surprised seeing the husbands' doing the bare minimum for their wives. We appreciate a father when he takes care of his child, however, when the same is done by the mother, we see it as her responsibility,  something which she is obliged to do. Why is it that in our society we always expect a woman to compromise on her feelings, emotions and herself and term it as her 'duty' whereas a man can do anything he wants and if he is doing something then we make a big deal out of it? 
Equality in a relationship doesn't come from touching feet or bowing down, rather it comes from mutual respect, love and understanding. Equality in a relationship comes when you know that you and your partner have the same say in every important discussion and you don't disregard each other based on their earnings or capabilities. Equality in a relationship comes when you know that even though you have different accomplishments, you regard them as an individual and acknowledge their experiences and accept them as who they are and not for who they can be according to you!
