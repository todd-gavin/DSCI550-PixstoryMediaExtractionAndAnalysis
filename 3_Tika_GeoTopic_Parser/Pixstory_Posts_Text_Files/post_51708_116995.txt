Today i want to spread awareness about a really severe problem Young football players are facing The problem is related to the young upcoming players who don t have a ground facility to play football As younger players are not allowed to travel nearby stadiums because their parents don t allow them So these innocent players go to nearby parks to play football but there are a lot of Uncles Aunties who doesn t let these kids play They mostly shout or take away the football from the kids when the ball gets near them When i was a Kid i use to face the same problem and this seems so heartbreaking for a player We use to play football in the park and that park is divided into halves so we took permission from the park authority to play in a particular part of the park In the park some old people use to play gambling card games and Sometimes the ball goes to them they use to shout on us and they use to always take our ball away from us Aunties use to sit in between the park where the authority permitted us to play They all complaint to the authority about us playing football in the park as according to them we are harming people The Gardener in charge use to call the police when we played football IS PLAYING FOOTBALL IS A CRIME Some police officers use to come in the park they use to threaten us and steal our ball away from us Once my fellow mates were arrested while playing football in the case of Destroying Horticulture These were all the strategy to stop us from playing We Really want your Support to fix this problem as there is no one to complaint about We all feel so helpless I REQUEST YOU THAT NEXT TIME YOU SEE KIDS PLAYING ENCOURAGE THEM AND NEXT TIME YOU SEE ANYONE NOT LETTING KIDS TO PLAY PLEASE PROTEST AGAINST THEM This issue is Really important to raise as we footballers never had any platform to express our feelings Please support Us
