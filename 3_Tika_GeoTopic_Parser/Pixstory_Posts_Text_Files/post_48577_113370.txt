I am heartbroken and traumatized by what happened in Highland Park today during the parade It is unacceptable and saddening Out of respect for the victims I hope none of us will indulge in fireworks and other kinds of celebration because today is just not the day for that It is a painful day for America and in this tough time we need to share each other s pain Let us light candles in their remembrance and pray for their peace My heartfelt condolences go to the victims and their families May their souls rest in peace and the injured have a fast recovery I can t even imagine the pain of those who lost their family today My heart goes out to them May the Lord give them strength to cope
