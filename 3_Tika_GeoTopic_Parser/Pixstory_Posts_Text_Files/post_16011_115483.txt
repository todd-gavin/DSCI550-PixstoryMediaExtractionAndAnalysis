Esben Bolvig Mark Christina Brock Abstract Aims This study aimed to investigate cortical source activity and identify source generators in people with type diabetes during rest and tonic cold pain Methods Forty eight participants with type diabetes and neuropathy and healthy controls were investigated with electroencephalography EEG during minutes resting and minutes tonic cold pain immersing the hand into water at C EEG power was assessed in eight frequency bands and EEG source generators were analyzed using standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography sLORETA Results Compared to resting EEG cold pain EEG power differed in all bands in the diabetes group all p and six bands in the controls all p Source generator activity in the diabetes group was increased in delta beta beta and gamma bands and decreased in alpha all p with changes mainly seen in the frontal and limbic lobe Compared to controls people with diabetes had decreased source generator activity during cold pain in the beta and beta bands all p mainly in the frontal lobe Conclusions Participants with type diabetes had altered EEG power and source generator activity predominantly in the frontal and limbic lobe during tonic cold pain The results may indicate modulated central transmission and neuronal impairment Sources
