FIFA has announced its list of 36 referees and 69 assistant referees for the World Cup. The Indian fans, naturally, have nothing to look forward to it – no one from India figures in the list and it didn’t come as an unexpected news. The only time an Indian made the World Cup panel of supervisors was in 2002. K Shankar went to Japan-Korea World Cup as an assistant referee. Thereafter, no one could ever make the elite panel. So, till date, diminutive Shankar remains the only Indian to set his foot on the pitch during a World Cup match. 
There are few Asians in the list of referees and assistant referees and at least one of them is known to Indian fans to an extent. Alireza Faghani of Iran is veteran referee in the top circuit and the 44-year-old will be in Qatar to do duty in the second consecutive World Cup. In between his busy schedule, he once came to India to supervise in the Indian Super League (ISL). In the 2018 World Cup in Russia, Alireza was in charge in four outings, including the third place tie between Belgium and England. He is currently working as professional referee in Australia.
Alireza came to India in 2016 to supervise the final between Atletico de Kolkata and Kerala Blasters. It was a star-studded line-up since Alireza was assisted by his team of co-Iranians Reza Sokhandan and Mohammadreza Mansouri as assistant referees, who had also teamed up with him for the 2016 Olympics Gold medal match.
“As always, the criteria we have used is ‘quality first’ and the selected match officials represent the highest level of refereeing worldwide,” said the chairman of the FIFA Referees Committee, Pierluigi Collina. “The 2018 World Cup was very successful, partly because of the high standard of refereeing, and we will do our best to be even better in a few months in Qatar,” FIFA said while announcing the names of the World Cup referees.
