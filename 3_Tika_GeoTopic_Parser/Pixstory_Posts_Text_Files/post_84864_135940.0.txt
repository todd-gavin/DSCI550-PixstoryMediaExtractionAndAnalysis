Manchester United and Ajax have agreed to pay Â£86 million for Antony. The 22-year-old had been identified by the Red Devils as a key target early in the summer window, bringing an end to a protracted recruiting drama. By agreeing to a five-year contract at Old Trafford, he has reestablished contact with former Ajax coach Erik ten Hag.
Antony has said on the club's website: "I'm going to join one of the illustrious clubs across the globe at this incredible point in my career. The coaching from Erik ten Hag at Ajax was perfect for my needs and my development. Whenever he is around, I am able to play and teach more effectively, and I am motivated by the information he has provided me on his plans and objectives for Manchester. I am eager to work with my new teammates and contribute to Manchester United's success."
Registration must be finished by Thursday at midday in order for Antony to be eligible for United's league game versus the Foxes on Friday. Given the uncertainty surrounding his immigration and work authorization, this is seen to be unlikely. Therefore, he may feature in his maiden Manchester United match on Sunday at Old Trafford against the Gunners.
The addition of Antony gives United's team additional firepower, as he will play a wide offensive role in a style that favors a front three. With the move to United, Antony will reconnect with his former Ajax coach Erik ten Hag, who earlier signed defender Lisandro Martinez from his former side.
Antony has registered 31 goals and 27 assists in 134 club appearances for both Dutch sides and Sao Paulo. Furthermore, in nine senior games for his native Brazil, he scored two goals and added two assists. He has two European titles to his name, as well as an Olympic gold medal from the 2020 Summer Olympics.
