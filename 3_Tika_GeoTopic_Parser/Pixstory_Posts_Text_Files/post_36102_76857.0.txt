Air India, formerly known as Air-India, airline was founded in 1932 as Tata Airlines by JRD Tata.

It was Tata himself who flew its first single-engine de Havilland Puss Moth, carrying air mail from Karachi's Drigh Road Aerodrome to (Bombay's) Mumbai's Juhu aerodrome and later continuing to (now Chennai). 

The airline fleet consisted of a Puss Moth aircraft and a de Havilland Leopard Moth. In its first year, the airline flew 160,000 miles (260,000 km), carrying 155 passengers and 9.72 tonnes (10.71 tons) of mail and made a profit of ₹60,000.

The airline launched its first domestic flight from Bombay to Trivandrum with a six-seater Miles Merlin.

After World War II, it was converted into a public limited company and was renamed as Air India. During World War II, the airline helped the Royal Air Force with troop movements, shipping of supplies, rescue of refugees and maintenance of aircraft.

The government nationalised the airline in 1953. On 21 February 1960, it took delivery of its first Boeing 707 named Gauri Shankar and became the first Asian airline to induct a jet aircraft in its fleet.

In 2000–01, attempts were made to privatise Air India and from 2006 onwards, it suffered losses after its merger with Indian Airlines. 

Over the years, it has grown into a flagship international airline of India, catering to 60 destinations across the world. Apart from serving on domestic routes, it also flies southern and eastern Asia, the Middle East, Europe, Africa, Australia, the United States, and Canada.

The airline became the 27th member of Star Alliance on 11 July 2014. 

Air India's mascot is the Maharajah (Emperor) and the logo consists of a flying swan with the wheel of Konark inside it.

The Indian government had in October last year, inked the share purchase agreement with the Tata Group for the sale of national carrier Air India for Rs 18,000 crore.

The Tata Group would pay Rs 2,700 crore cash and take over Rs 15,300 crore of the airline’s debt. The deal also includes sale of Air India Express and ground handling arm AISATS.

The Tata Group took full control of the airline on Thursday.
