The business end of the 2021-22 season is here, and it couldn't have come under worse contexts for Manchester United. Ralf Ragnick's woes continue, in a period where his players have continually come under the radar for their performances. Last week's defeat against Liverpool was embarrassing as it is, and it was followed by a 4-2 loss at the Emirates.


Now, prior to the Red's next home game against Thomas Tuchel's Chelsea they miss out on a whopping six players. The game against Arsenal came without the likes of Paul Pogba, Edinson Cavani, Fred and Luke Shaw. 


"Fred is unfortunately not yet available,” the boss began. “He tried to train yesterday but after training I had a long conversation with him and he just told me that he doesn't feel fully fit, he's not at 100%, and with a player like Fred who's always committed to give his very best" Ragnick commented.


Captain Harry Maguire too was benched in wake of a bomb threat his family recieved. The Englishman is expected to return tomorrow but Jadon Sancho was ruled out with tonsillitis. 


“And apart from that we have Harry Maguire who is not available. He has some issues with his knee, not a big thing – some niggle in his knee. He hasn't been training, neither yesterday or today." he added.


Right back Aaron Wan Bissaka misses out too, courtesy of an injury Ragnick did not discuss.


“Paul obviously, Fred, Edinson, Luke Shaw and Jadon – Jadon is ill, he has tonsillitis since yesterday, couldn't train today and will also be not available tomorrow."


Nevertheless, he remains confident and in a positive mindset with regards to his team selection.


“We have quite a few players missing tomorrow and one or two still with question marks so we will have to wait and see until tomorrow to see if, for example, Aaron Wan-Bissaka can play," he explained
