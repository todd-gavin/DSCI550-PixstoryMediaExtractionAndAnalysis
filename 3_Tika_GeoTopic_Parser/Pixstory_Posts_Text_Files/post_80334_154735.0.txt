Arsenal’s left sided positional awareness 

Martinelli & Xhaka have been 2 of Arsenal’s best players this season. In this piece I’m going to thinking solely about their fantastic positioning, and how a lot of the work is already done.

I’ll start with Xhaka.

Granit plays an unique role for the Gunners, playing as an 8 often further forward than anyone else, while being there to mop up defensively for extra security. 

What has really stood out to me however is Xhaka connecting play. He has mastered the art of occupying the left channel, to act as the connector to Martinelli, and more commonly Tierney.

What’s even more intriguing is Xhaka’s positoning before the penalty vs Liverpool. Xhaka notices Martinelli picks up the ball a bit deeper, so vacates the space Martinelli would usually be in, to provide a cut back. This wasn’t a one off either, doing it throughout the game & season.

The Veterans intelligence with Mikel’s coaching makes the role so manageable, knowing when to rotate, when to drop off, & when to be aggressive. 

Now onto Martinelli. 

The Brazilian has hit incredible heights this season, often finding himself on the inside left. That’s courtesy of the fantastic positional awareness between the 2. 

With the ability to go in & more than before go on the outside, Gabi is unpredictable & comfortable in many zones such as retaining the ball from deep.

This attribute has been enhanced thanks to last season’s dynamic of Martinelli often finding himself defensively overloaded; massively benefiting his retention under pressure - which has also noticeably improved over the summer.

Now, it’s overloads on each side & most notably the left, a huge ability to play through the centre, and ultimately - a far more exciting, offensive & sustainable dynamic, to provide any teams faced, with a lot of thinking to do.

A key partnership for the foreseeable future and present.
