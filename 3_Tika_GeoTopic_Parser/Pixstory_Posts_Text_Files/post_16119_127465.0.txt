He was seen holding the National Flag proudly and wore a big smile on his face. 

IN Kiara Instagram post Sidharth dropped a cheesy comment and wrote, "Thanks for cutting me out". Now this sparks rumours of them celebrating the day together! And to reply him back, Kiara wrote, "Your hand is still there." Can someone hand over the magnifying glass, please?😂😂❤️
