Jacqueline Fernandez was spotted at Mukteshwar temple in Juhu,today  marking her first public appearance since she was named as an accused in a money laundering probe connected to conman Sukesh Chandrasekhar last week.
Jacqueline was named in the chargesheet filed by the Enforcement Directorate in the ₹200-crore extortion case connected to conman Sukesh Chandrashekhar. 💯💯

Jacqueline has been questioned multiple times by the agency in this case, the last being in June. The ED in April provisionally attached ₹7.27 crore funds of the actor under the PMLA apart from ₹15 lakh cash as the agency called these funds as "proceeds of crime".✅

Jacqueline has not yet spoken in public about her legal troubles. She did, however, take to social media hours after being named in the high-profile case. On Wednesday, after reports said she was to be named by the ED, she shared a note on social media that read ‘it’ll all be ok'.   👍👍👍👍

Previously she was questioned by the ED earlier this year after investigations revealed links between her and Sukesh. Pictures of the two had also surfaced on social media, suggesting the two were dating. Jacqueline initially denied this but as per reports, later admitted to the agency that the two were indeed in a relationship.😱💯✅
Her picture with Suresh went viral over internet marking her relationship him !!!!
