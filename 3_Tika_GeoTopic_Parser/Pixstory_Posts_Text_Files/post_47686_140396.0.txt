New Delhi: Queen Elizabeth II's eldest son Charles, the rightful heir to the British throne, has become the King at the age of 73. The UK now has a new monarch in Charles, the former Prince of Wales.
Charles is the oldest person to ever assume the British throne.
As Charles is set to formally proclaimed King on Saturday, the steps which he will go through to be crowned King is interesting.
The Queen’s death has triggerred what is dubbed in Britain’s royal circles as Operation London Bridge – or the formal preparations and protocol that kicks in following the death of the monarch – with Operation Spring Tide, or the accession of her son and heir Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, to the throne.
"London Bridge is down" is allegedly the way in which the death of the monarch would have been communicated to the Prime Minister, Liz Truss, by the Queen's Private Secretary, who will also tell the Cabinet Secretary and the Privy Council of senior officials and ministers.
The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) Global Response Centre is responsible for informing governments outside the UK where she is Head of State, followed by other Commonwealth nations including India. The day of her death is referred to as D-Day, with each subsequent day a countdown until the funeral, expected 10 days after her death.
