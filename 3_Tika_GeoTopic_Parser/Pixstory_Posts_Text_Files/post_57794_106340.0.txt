Cleaning your room is a mammoth task, no matter what unless you're feeling really energetic and ready to get stuff doneðŸ˜‚
It's worse when someone tells you to clean it up and so you just lose more will to do soðŸ˜‚
It's like you pick up one thing and place it properly and you feel satisfied like you've done it all perfectlyðŸ˜‚
