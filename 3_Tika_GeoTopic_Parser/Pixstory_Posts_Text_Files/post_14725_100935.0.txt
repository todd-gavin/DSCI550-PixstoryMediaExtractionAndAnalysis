Plastic surgery claims a life of a Kannada TV actress, Chethana Raj, 21, who went for a "fat free" surgery. 

The cause of death was due to complications in the surgery that led to the accumulation of fluid in her lungs post surgery. The doctors at the clinic rushed her to Kaade Hospital and according to the statement given to the police, efforts of reviving her was done for 45 minutes. But to no help death embedded her.Â  

The actress underwent liposuction, which is a cosmetic surgery that takes away excess body fat. 

Liposuction is a surgical procedure that targets to remove fats from certain parts of the body like from abdomen, hips, thighs etc. The surgery might take away fats but it comes with various risks. Complications like filling up of fluid under the skin, fat embolism, kidney and heart problems and other infections. 

The fats that are removed through the surgery are the ones that doesn't get reduced through workouts and diet. 

This surgery is not a weight loss surgery. It only gives short term benefits and the fats are more likely to return to the treated areas within few months.

As per the global survey by the Internation Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS), India was placed at the fourth rank in the world for 9,35,487 of cosmetic procedures done in 2015.
