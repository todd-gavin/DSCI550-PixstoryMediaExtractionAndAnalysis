“Aami basibo parim ne? (Will we be able to stay alive?)” the woman asked, visibly afraid.


It was five days since the lean and soft-spoken woman, in her forties, and her teenage daughter had been picked up by the local police, on suspicion of being part of a mob that set fire to a police station.


The woman spoke to Article 14 on the condition that her name not be used. A day after the Batadrava police station, 123 km east of Assam’s capital Guwahati, was set on fire on 21 May 2022, the two were taken from their home in Salonabari village to the Batadrava police station and asked to name those behind the arson.


A part of the police station building was burnt down, though an under-construction wing was intact. 


“We told them we genuinely did not know,” she told Article 14. “But they hit me and my daughter with a cane—three times.” 


The woman is a relative of fish trader Safiqul Islam, 39, who died while in the custody of the Batadrava police station on 21 May.


His death triggered a chain of violent events in Salonabari village, located about 5 km from the police station, in the central Assam district of Nagaon.


After the arson, the police allegedly demolished Islam’s home as well as those of four of his relatives, then booked his minor daughter studying in Class 8, among others, under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967. Police were also accused of “accidentally” killing Asiqul Islam, the man accused of instigating the mob that set fire to the police station.


The violence and death in Salonabari were the latest evidence, said critics, of state prejudice against Muslims in Assam, where custodial deaths and so-called “encounter” killings have risen sharply since the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Himanta Biswa Sarma took over as chief minister in May 2021.
