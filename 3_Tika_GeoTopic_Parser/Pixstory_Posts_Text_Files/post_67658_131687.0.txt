Friends Society is an NGO situated in Fatehgunj, Vadodara. Its home to hundreds of children who mostly belong from either slum areas or from economically backward areas. 
Me being a volunteer there have experienced so much in such short period of time. This is snap shot of a group of children whom I happen to teach on weekdays. It's not a paid or a certified internship but the sheer joy that comes from being able to help the needy is all the boost of encouragement I need to visit the NGO on a daily basis.
