Feminism vs Equalism has been a hot topic of debate on the internet for a while. What exactly is the difference and what makes for such a heated debate when both these movements claim to speak for an equal world?

Feminism is the idea that advocates for an equal world through the lens of a woman, while equalism as a broader idea encourages seeing all of the world's beings under the same light. Then what's so problematic about equalism when it literally advocates for 'equal rights'?

The only way equalism as an idea could be efficiently implemented in society is when everyone stands on the same ground. Seeing everyone as the same on an unlevelled field becomes an unfair way of going about equality, much like how giving two patients – one with a paper cut and the other with a bullet hole – the same attention and care. You cannot pour the same amount of water in two unevenly filled glasses. The systemic oppression of one group cannot be seen by the same perspective with the group already enjoying most of the rights, and by extension privileges. It is not to say, there aren't hardships in the life of a cisgender, heterosexual man, but throughout the history the fact remains constant that they have enjoyed privileges over women. We cannot have simple solutions for bigger, more complex problems. Feminism, as an implemented stance, has many loopholes in itself but with education and time, it is becoming more intersectional by the day. The inclusion of women of color, disabled women, trans women, queer women, non-binary women and many others has proven to be a great step towards an equal future. And once we attain that kind of equality, we can all root for equalism together!
