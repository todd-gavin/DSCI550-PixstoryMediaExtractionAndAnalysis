The whistleblower Zatko has taken the tech world by storm His serious allegations have definitely put Twitter Ina spot Among his many allegations one was submitting to threats especially from the Indian government I am quite shocked that Zatko named a specific country in his allegations That too about breach of sensitive data As per Protocol Twitter was allegedly complicit in threats to democratic government according to Zatko He claimed that the business hired two of the Indian government s operatives and gave them access to huge amounts of Twitter s sensitive data as a result of pressure from that government A U S government source allegedly alerted Twitter that one or more specific firm employees were acting on behalf of another specific foreign intelligence agency according to the complaint This accusation was made only a few weeks after a former Twitter employee was found guilty of spying for the Saudi Arabian government Do you think the Indian government will come forward with a statement to defend itself
