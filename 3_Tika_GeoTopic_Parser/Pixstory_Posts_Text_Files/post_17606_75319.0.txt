Despite surprisingly being listed as questionable for Sunday’s game, Anthony Davis did not return to the court for the Lakers in Miami against the Heat. However, as head coach Frank Vogel revealed prior to the game, that was a sign that Davis’ return was imminent.

“That was more about (the fact) he’s getting closer, felt good with his work yesterday but not quite there yet,” Vogel said of Davis being upgraded to questionable. “We knew this was the first game where it would be possible but still unlikely so we just checked in on how he felt yesterday knowing that he’d still be probably not ready yet but getting closer.”

In lieu of reps in practice that are unavailable with the Lakers being a road trip, Vogel and the Lakers have had Davis practice against and with assistants in an effort to have him ready to hit the court. But it’s a fine balance the Lakers have had to manage of not rushing Davis back despite the team floundering without him.

“We have to make sure we do it safely and at the right pace and at the right time,” Vogel said. “In terms of what pushed it, we just knew he was getting close and we wanted have transparency with reporting that it wasn’t 100% that he wouldn’t play so we upgraded him to questionable. We knew it was probably unlikely. There was no setbacks or anything like that, just a matter of him getting closer.”

Davis was not the only Laker with a recent injury update as Kendrick Nunn’s return was further delayed last week. Vogel revealed some more information on the guard, who would not be available for his return to face his old team in the Heat on Sunday.

“We’re hoping it’s a short-term gap,” Vogel said. “He did get back to work on the court. He’s not in a shutdown or anything like that. But the timeline, it was just delayed with the soreness that he was feeling.”
