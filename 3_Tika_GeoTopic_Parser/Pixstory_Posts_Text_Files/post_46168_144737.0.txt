If you’re dedicating valuable time in your day to a staying in shape , you want to know it’s actually worth your time , right ? 👍
I have probably heard some people say cardio is the ultimate calorie-burner , while others swear by weight lifting ! so what actually gets you the most burn for your buck ? So which exercises burn the most calories exactly ?🤔🏋️
Lemme tell you some high calories burning Exercise ; ✅🏋️
1 Jumping Rope ;
The burn : 667-990 calories/hour (if you’re jumping at 120 skips per minute) . This little rope is actually a big-time fat burner . Try using a weighted jump rope to engage your arms and shoulders even more !
2 Running Up Hills / Stair Sprints ; 
The burn : 639-946 calories / hour . You want to sprint at max effort on stairs or a hill at a pace that you can only maintain for about 20 seconds , and follow that with a recovery run at half of the intensity of the sprint and double the time . The harder you push yourself during those sprints , the greater the calories burn .
3 Cycling Intervals ;
The burn : 568-841 calories / hour . Riding at a sustained high intensity will give you a greater calories burn as compared to a steady state ride at a low intensity but adding high intensity intervals throughout that training time will increase the afterburn even more .
4 Strength Training ; 
The burn : 341-504 calories / hour . You’ll increase your afterburn by working your muscles to exhaustion each set instead of stopping at an arbitrary rep range like 10 or 12 . And focus on compound movements that employ more muscle groups over more joints , too !
5 Power Yoga ; 
The burn : 226-335 calories / hour . To get the most burn , practice power yoga regularly . And see the results ! 
Try these exercises for high calories burn and thank me later !✅🏋️
