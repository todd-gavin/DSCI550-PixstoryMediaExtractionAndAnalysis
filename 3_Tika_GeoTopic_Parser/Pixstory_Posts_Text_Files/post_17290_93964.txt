The France international tells PSG TV about her arrival at the club and the ambitions the squad still has this season Very well I ve settled in well because I already knew quite a lot of the girls Also I was coming back to the Paris region It s where I m from so that makes it easier The girls immediately made me feel comfortable so it was very easy to adapt I had played with some of them with the national team and with Sakina Karchaoui at Montpellier So I already had a connection with some players and everything has gone as I had hoped You play with Paulina Dudek Amanda Ilestedt and Estelle Cascarino at centre back How have you built the connection between you all I had played with Estelle for a number of years at Paris FC so it was a bit easier for us two Paulina and Amanda are two great players so it s easy to adapt to them to communicate Paulina speaks French very well so it was easy to get to know her and know what she expected from the person playing alongside her We learn from each other every day and even playing against forwards like Marie Antoinette Katoto or Jordyn Huitema defending against them helps us improve How do you feel the season has gone so far Very positively I think that we ve met expectations so far It s true that in the league we ve had a few slips but nothing is lost We haven t lost hope We want to go all the way in the Champions League and the same for the Coupe de France It s the same we want a trophy You re playing Issy on Saturday What s the mood like in the squad We know it s going to be difficult to get back into things after the international break but we owe it to ourselves to win this game to refocus on the club We re in good spirits and in a good spell We have to stay focussed because I think anything can happen in football positive as well as negative
