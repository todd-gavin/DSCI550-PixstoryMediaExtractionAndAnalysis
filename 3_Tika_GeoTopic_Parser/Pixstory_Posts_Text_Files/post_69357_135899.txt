This Kashmiri onion chutney is a typical side dish for many parties and feasts A short pickling procedure that is very easy to do brings out the sour and savoury flavours in the food Although the recipe calls for dry mint fresh mint would work just as well In the summer and fall I dry my mint and it keeps for at least six months Many Kashmiri foods benefit from the distinctive flavour that dry mint adds to them You will find that it was used with many other ways such as sandwiches and kebabs but I offer it as a side to rice and savoury foods
