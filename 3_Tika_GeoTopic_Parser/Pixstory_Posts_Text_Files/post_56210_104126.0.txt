The last time the Royal Family seemed on the balcony was in 2019 - including Prince Harry, his wife Meghan, and Prince Andrew.

Balcony at Buckingham was always an awe factor for Britains- as it has been a stage for many Royal moments.

The balcony will be the centre of focus for For the Platinum Jubilee celebrations too, with Queen Elizabeth II and 17 other members of the Royal Family on it.

There have been many discussions regarding the same and it is said that only "working royals" and their children will appear, which excludes the Queen's son Prince Andrew, her grandson Prince Harry, and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.

This is the most "tactful" way of dealing with controversies surrounding the trio, says Prof Maclaran-researcher. Prince Harry and Meghan withdrew from their royal roles and moved to the US.

There have been more than 40 people on the balcony on previous occasions, so curbing the numbers overall is also a deliberate choice. Thus making a statement on whom are the important royals.

The balcony is very much a royal space. Only two prime ministers have made it onto the balcony - Neville Chamberlain, after negotiating the Munich Agreement with Germany in 1938, and Sir Winston Churchill as crowds commemorated the end of the war in Europe in 1945.

The Queen is prominently at the front. Accroding to prof Maclaran, there is an invisible choreography that which senior royals take their places in the central area of the balcony while the rest of the family fan out around the edges.

For the jubilee, among the 17 invited to appear will include the Queen's son and daughter-in-law Earl and Countess of Wessex and their two children, and her daughter Anne, Princess Royal, and her husband, Sir Timothy Laurence. There will also be the Queen's cousins the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, and the Duke of Kent and Princess Alexandra, who carry out royal engagements on her behalf.
