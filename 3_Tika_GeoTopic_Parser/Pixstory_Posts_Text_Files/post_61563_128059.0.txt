it's been nearly two years since i've read "all the bright places" and it still is one of my all time favorite reads. this book legit broke me, but i still adore it. finch will forever hold such a special place in my heart.

"you are all the colors in one, at full brightness" is hands down my all time favorite book quote. ever since i read it, it's always stayed with me. i just think it's a beautiful way of someone expressing love for another, and a reminder that you are an incredible person. :)

ALSO PLS IGNORE HOW BAD THE ANNOTATION IS
