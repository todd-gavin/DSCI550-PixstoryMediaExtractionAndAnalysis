His signing surprised so many It was an RKO out of nowhere But one that could mean big things for the future Gabriel Jesus Zinchenko has stolen the limelight but for me Fabio Vieira could have the highest ceiling A Porto lad through through he leaves at years of age as a time league winner Also accomplished internationally he made the U EUROS team of the tournament in Oh not to forget he was the player of the tournament too A diminutive left footed playmaker so comfortable in tight spaces There s no surprise why people have drawn comparisons to Bernardo Silva Able to play as a midfield his final ball is something special One similar to KDB Trent AA at Liverpool His assists last season only back that up So have Arsenal found their own long term answer to De Bruyne I personally think so
