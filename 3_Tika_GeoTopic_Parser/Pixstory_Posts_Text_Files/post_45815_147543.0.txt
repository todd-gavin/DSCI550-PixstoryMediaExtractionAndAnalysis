NASA said it completed all the objectives of a Space Launch System tanking test Sept. 21 despite the reoccurrence of liquid hydrogen leaks.Sky News reported that the day-long test at Kennedy Space Center’s Launch Complex 39B involved filling the SLS core stage and upper stage with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants, carrying out the “kickstart bleed” of liquid hydrogen into the core stage engines and a “pre-press” test of the liquid hydrogen tank. The test was designed to confirm that changes such as replacement of seals and a new loading procedure would prevent hydrogen leaks seen in the previous launch attempt Sept. 3.Another hydrogen leak took place during the pre-press test on a second, smaller liquid hydrogen line, with concentrations as high as 5%. Engineers continued the test and the leak diminished over time.NASA said at the conclusion of the test that they met all of their objectives but stopped short of declaring they were ready to proceed with a launch at the next opportunity, Sept. 27.Let’s hope the launch happens soon!
