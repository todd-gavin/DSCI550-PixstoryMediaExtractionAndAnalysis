I don't know how I feel about this. I've missed them but this prequel wasn't how I imagined any of the Winchesters would return. However I do think Sam will be there in some episodes. I mean, Jensen and Jared have said many times about their intention to work together again. Jensen has directed an episode of Jared's show, made an appearance on it and even showed interest in acting in Walker in future. I hope we can have a reunion on the show as narrators because we all know, 'there ain't no Dean, if there ain't no Sam' (his words, not mine!).

The premise of both 'The Winchesters' and 'Walker: Independence' look great. I do wonder how they will take the story of John and Mary Winchester forward without deflecting from their canon story shown in Supernatural, which was...interesting for the lack of better words. It'll be interesting to watch. The Walker Prequel has rightfully turned heads. Padalecki has managed to make a great reboot of the original. Let's see how these two shows come about and whether they manage to do justice to their parent shows. (no pun intended!)
