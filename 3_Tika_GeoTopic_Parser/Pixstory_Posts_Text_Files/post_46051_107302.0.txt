Yellowstone National Park has renamed Mount Doane to First Peoples Mountain, officials said, in an effort to remove a "offensive moniker" invoking the deaths of almost 200 Native Americans from the iconic wildlands. 

National Park Service officials said in a statement on June 9 that similar renamings may be considered in the future. 

As per The Guardian, Gustavus Doane, a US army captain, was named after the 10,551-foot mountain. Authorities say Doane was a "key member" of an 1870 trip that resulted in Yellowstone being the country's first national park.

In retaliation for the alleged murder of a white furrier, Doane led an attack on a band of Piegan Blackfeet earlier in the same year as the expedition. According to authorities, this assault, now known as the Marias Massacre, resulted in the deaths of at least 173 Native Americans. 

Officials said that the new First Peoples name was chosen "based on suggestions from the Rocky Mountain Tribal Council, subsequent votes within the Wyoming Board of Geographic names, and [National Park Service] endorsement." This name was eventually forwarded to the US Board on Geographic Names this month by these entities. 

Officials say the board, which is in charge of maintaining geographic name consistency across the federal government, voted 15-0 to approve the rename.
