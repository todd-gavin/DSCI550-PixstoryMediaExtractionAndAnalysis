This assertion is founded on a crucial concept. Depending on who you ask, certain mathematical concepts can be considered "difficult." My professor of abstract algebra once said, "Math gets hard at some point."
But at what precise point is this? Some people start having problems with math in elementary school. Others find high school calculus to be practically impossible. Some people wait until they start using research-level arithmetic to test the limits of knowledge before they feel challenged.
People might never cross their individual thresholds. They may easily complete their math courses, but eventually their math education ends (many non-mathematicians choose to stop learning new math eventually). Some of these folks so deceive themselves into believing that arithmetic is simple. However, this is untrue. The only math that they haven't encountered that they would find challenging is algebra.
So definitely, math is challenging in a unique way for each person.Some of these folks so deceive themselves into believing that arithmetic is simple. However, this is untrue. The only math that they haven't encountered that they would find challenging is algebra.
