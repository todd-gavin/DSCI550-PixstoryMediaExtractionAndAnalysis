Moldova will play Andorra at the Estadi Nacional on Monday, looking to make it two wins from two in Group D1 of the UEFA Nations League.


Andorra were denied a fairytale start to their Nations League campaign on Friday as they were defeated 3-0 by Latvia.They had won their previous two games, defeating Saint Kitts and Nevis and Grenada, respectively.Andorra is unbeaten in four of their previous six home games, with three victories and one tie in that period.


Moldova, meanwhile, won 2-0 away to Liechtenstein on their Nations League debut last time out.Prior to it, they had gone on an 11-game losing streak, with 10 losses and one tie since a 1-0 victory against Azerbaijan in June 2021.Next up is a matchup against an opponent against whom they have gone undefeated in five of their past six encounters, winning four and drawing one.

Moldova vs Andorra: Probable Playing XI

Andorra: Joseph Gomes; Jesus Rubio, Christian Garcia, Max Llovera, Albert Alavedra, Marc Garcia; Marc Rebels, Marc Vales, Joan Cervos; Jordi Alaez, Albert Rosas


Moldova: Dorian Railean; Veaceslav Posmac, Vadim Bolohan, Igor Armas; Ioan-Calin Revenco, Vadim Rata, Mihail Platica, Oleg Reabciuk; Victor Stina, Marius Iosipoi, Ion Nicolaescu

Moldova vs Andorra: Prediction

Although Andorra won the most recent match between the two teams, Moldova will take heart from the fact that they had won three straight games against the Tricolors before Andorra's 1-0 triumph in October 2019.

While the hosts struggled in their Nations League debut, Moldova will be inspired by their success over Liechtenstein, and we believe the visitors will utilize that confidence to record a narrow victory.

Prediction: Andorra 1-1 Moldova
