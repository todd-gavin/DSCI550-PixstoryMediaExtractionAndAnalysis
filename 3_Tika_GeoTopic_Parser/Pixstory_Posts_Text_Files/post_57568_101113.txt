Yes apparently superheroes are shown as incarnations of ideal men not just them it is almost every man onscreen But I would disagree that the cinema never ceases to show men this way Things seem to be changing and even people creating these movies are those men who somewhere felt they don t always have to be stern aggressive or powerful to be an ideal man Some movies have shown men to be vulnerable and experience emotions They too have the ability to cry at times openly A Star is Born where Jackson Maine played by Bradley Cooper shows his most vulnerable side when he is affected by the complex emotions of love and jealousy from Ally the love of his life Jared the protagonist in Boy Erased depicted how nonsensical gender restrictions should be dispelled from society as he broke down on a program to embrace his vulnerability in the movie Timothee Chalamet who starred in movies like Beautiful Boy and The King shows a gentleman who proved his vulnerability and soft side despite killing an opponent in a sword fight in the latter movie These movies have shown that men do everything to embrace and accept their emotions making them a man enough
