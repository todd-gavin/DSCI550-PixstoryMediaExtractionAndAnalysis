In a big move for Activision Blizzard the company has dropped the loot boxes from Overwatch as the system of loot boxes is a crucial element in the world of Overwatch Blizzard has confirmed at a reveal event that that the team based FPS won t have loot boxes on its October th premier Instead the new Overwatch will now go with a seasonal model using battle passes by which players will have and an in game store which will allow access to separate exclusive rewards available for purchase in real life money For those who don t know what a loot box is it is an in game device a virtual treasure chest of sorts that operates on probability Imagine that you want a certain item like a cosmetic or weapon upgrade a loot box is something that might have what you are looking for Though the downside of this is that you can only gain access to a loot box through some powerful game currency or by spending real money and even then chance is that you will not get what you want forcing you to spend more time and money Furthermore making it even more worse is the fact that even though you know it s bad loot boxes are intoxicating and can become a bit of an addiction So essentially it is gambling This is a step in a better direction as loot boxes are just a total pain in the ass to deal with
