I was always afraid of it To wake up in the morning Tell me in fear You were just asleep Spring came and went I wake up and ask where did spring go Nobody answers me They are silent It is raining in the back of my room I ask maybe this is spring rain Nobody answers me They are silent When I open the window The rain is over I look in the mirror at my face My face is slowly getting older I look out the window at the ground It is wet and quiet I get dressed I come to the alley From the first pedestrian to run in the rain without an umbrella I am asking Didn t you see the passage of spring in this alley He is in a hurry he just says no I m disappointed with the neighbors I say is not this oppression Didn t you tell me when spring passed through my window They are silent The silence of the neighbors is an insult to me A child holds my hand in the rain It leads to a field full of colorful fountains The child and I stare at the colorful waters of the fountains But there is no news of spring He goes with me I go to the old quarters I m looking for a printing press that had lead letters in my youth I wanted to write the name of spring in lead letters on the wall in front of my house There is a large rusty lock on the worn door of the printing house I m coming home I look up the word spring in the dictionary In the absence of spring all the words of culture are meaningless and absurd In the absence of spring I have not forgotten suffering fear dread doubt deprivation terror I am looking for comfort Who should comfort me in the absence of spring
