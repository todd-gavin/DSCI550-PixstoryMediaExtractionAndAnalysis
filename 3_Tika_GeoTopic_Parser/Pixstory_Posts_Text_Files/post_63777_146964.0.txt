 This August saw our a familiar masked face web sling his way through to the NPD rankings. In NPD’s latest monthly report of game sales Marvel’s Spiderman reached the third spot, a surprise given the game is more than four years old now.
 The game was topped only be Madden NFL 23 and Saints Row which took the top two spots among the best selling games in the US in August, which shouldn't be a surprise as they both debuted last month.
According to NPD analyst Mat Piscatella, Spider-Man was also the month's best-selling game across all tracked Steam titles, and was a key reason why the total market's PC content segment is up year-over year.
Insomniac’s web-crawler hit the PlayStation in 2018, but the remastered version made the shift to PC on August 12, with the jump being a very successful one, both critically and commercially. 
This is also possibly for gamers hoping Sony might deliver more exclusives onto PC at some point in the future:
"Sony's PC ports have been strong performers," Piscatella says. "Looking at some recent history, God of War jumped from #146 on the December 2021 chart to #5 in January 2022 with the launch of its PC version, while Days Gone also had a big spike with its PC release, climbing to #20 on the May 2021 charts after ranking at #247 in April of that year. PC has been a fantastic platform for Sony not only in sales of the PC releases themselves, but also in how these releases have had a positive halo effect on the properties involved. Wins all around, really."
