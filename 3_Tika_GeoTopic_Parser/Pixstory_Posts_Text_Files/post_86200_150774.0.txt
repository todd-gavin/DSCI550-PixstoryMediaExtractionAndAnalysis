If there was one tourist spot in the entire world which you love so much that you just want to live your entire life there, what would it be?
For me it would be the Gardens by the Bay in Singapore. It's a hugeeeee nature park full of flora and fauna and other pretty parts of the nature located in the central region of Singapore. There are three waterfront gardens and it's FlowerDome is the world's largest glass greenhouse. 
Literal wonder blooms at Gardens by the Bay. There are towering Supertrees, spectacular indoor waterfall, and iconic cooled conservatories â€” engineering and architectural marvels that enable plants from around the world to thrive in the tropics. There are hundred other attractions to see there and trust me you could easily spend an entire day there.
I still get nostalgic thinking about that place and it's beauty and serenity even though i was only there for some hours.
