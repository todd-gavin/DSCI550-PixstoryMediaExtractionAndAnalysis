When I think of reading (Its obvious that i am not reading, but only thinking about it), I wander off. 

Then I thought of remembering one book that I had read long ago. Well, a book that resonates like the hiss of a steam, or clink of a cup and a promise that keeps coming back.

Many books flashed across. 

"The hurt is in the act of possession
We are too small in mind and body to
Possess another person without pride
Or to be possessed without humiliation".

(Quite American by Graham Greene). The best line in the book could be this: "you can't love without intuition". 

Not reading anything worthwhile for long is akin to falling into the uneasy despair of doing nothing well. 

Then I can't be what I am not. So I dont want to think toomuch about having a sustainable timetable for reading. 
Is it an excuse or a valid reasoning? I think at best it is an escapist reason whose supreme mission to protect my laziness.
Well thats like saying, philosophy is the experimental physics of the soul. 

As I am treading the path of soul, another book knocked in.

The Preacher and The Presidents: Billy Graham in the White House by Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy. Reading that book made me realise one thing. 

The Presidents, who all had been brought up by the strong faith of their mothers, didnt need anything from the pastor that other people don't.... So Eisenhower wantes to know. "How do I know if I will go to heaven? . And Lyndon Johnson asked the ambassador of Jesus Christ "Will I see my parents when I die".... 

So am I for reading with a set goal to achieve or content with useful yet useless ruminations such as this one? I am not sure. As I grow old I can say one thing for sure when it comes to thinking of past reading. Like Mark Twain wrote: The older one gets more vivid recollection of things that have never happened.
