Chiranbal is one of many unexplored areas in Kashmir that hasn’t attracted much attention from tourists. Despite the fact that hikers can be seen travelling there, it hasn't received the publicity and attention it deserves. In Kashmir, Chiranbal is the biggest subalpine meadow.  Most people visit the nearby Aharbal waterfall, another popular tourist spot in the Kulgam area, don’t really know about the Chiranbal Falls which is only 15 kilometres away. The name ‘Chiranbal’ is the combination of two Kashmiri words-Chir, which is short for young lamb, and Bal, which denotes place, are combined to form the name "Chiranbal" in Kashmiri. Shepherds are the main visitors to the area, and they come to Chiranbal in the summer to graze their livestock. The pastoralists travelling from the Jammu plains to the higher elevations of Kashmir would find this to be the ideal location for them in many ways, including a refuge from the oppressive heat, an abundance of grass, and a stream for survival. The river that flows through the meadow known as Zajinar river which exceptionally gives it all the charm and bobbing waters are mostly liked by night campers. They erect their tents alongside the river and relax the moments by its sounding and gushing water. Chiranbal offers fantastic opportunities for rafting, fishing, and photography.
