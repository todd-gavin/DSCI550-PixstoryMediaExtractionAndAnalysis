Today the whole world is celebrating World Environment Day and this year World Environment Day is hosted by Sweden The slogan for this year is Only One Earth which focuses on living sustainably in harmony with nature Today I am telling you my story which changed my perception of nature and how I started taking nature seriously So around two years back I went to Nanital and one day when I took a walk into the small jungle far from the noise of the people and there I was just me and the nature Not even a single sound of a human being was around me and at that moment I could listen to the sound of nature whether it is the sound of leaves the sound of birds or the sound of water who is coming from the top of the hill And when I came back to the hotel I started missing that quietness I started missing the moments when only nature was with me and nothing else When I was able to talk to myself without taking care of my surroundings People around me always say what type of kick do you get by travelling to hill stations and even I was one of them but that one walk changed my perception and one thing I want to say is that please save the environment please save the greenery around yourself because that s the most important thing in this world after water The home you are living in is not the only place that you should be worried about cleaning but you should worry about every place you are going to and you should do a bit to clean that place on your own
