Erin Reed a transgender activist created a Google Map listing trans affirming clinics LGBTQ community centers and other services across United States to create access to lifesaving healthcare for trans youth But a website founded by Alix Aharon called The Gender Mapping Project or The Gender Mapper reposted Reed s map to propagate their right wing agenda against gender affirming caregivers by spreading misinformation against vital healthcare The website enlisted gender affirming clinic and care givers onto anti trans groups and made them vulnerable to harrasment and vandalism This incident highlights Google s conservative nature as it remains incapable of pulling down the map from the website
