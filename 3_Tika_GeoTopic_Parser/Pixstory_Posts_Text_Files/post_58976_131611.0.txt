The GoI proposal for a common charging device for phones and other small and medium portable electronic devices like e-readers and tablets is applauded. Users and the environment will benefit from a universal charging device (UCD). Reducing the need for multiple charges reduces material consumption and e-waste generation, as well as the headache and financial burden. The GoI must establish a timeline based on stakeholder consultation and an assessment of the measure's impact. An UCD is a charging port and charging communications protocol that is shared by brands and devices with similar power requirements. GoI is investigating two UCDs: one for smartphones, tablets, e-readers, and wearables, and one for feature phones.
The sale of smartphones in India alone has increased dramatically. In 2021, 162 million smartphones were sold, representing an 11% increase over 2020. Sales of 190-200 million are expected in 2022. A reduction in the number of chargers required means less demand for the materials used to make them, as well as less waste, which is good for the environment. With the EU transitioning to common chargers in the middle of 2024, India must move quickly to avoid an influx of 'old' chargers into its market.
