Argentina are one of the hot favourties heading to the FIFA World Cup in Qatar in November this year. The Copa America champions are in an amazing run of form and it would certainly not surprise anyone if they avenge their loss in the finals of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. 

Lionel Messi's team faced off against the Euro 2020 winners, Italy in the Finalissima on Wednesday. The competition pitted the champions of both Europe and South America in a one-off game to determine the winner. 

Having missed out on the bus to the 2022 World Cup, Italy were desperate to have some saving grace and add another trophy to their cabinet. However, Argentina steamrolled through them as they pulled out a comfortable 3-0 win. Goals from Lautaro Martinez, Angel Di Maria, and Paulo Dybala were enough to make Argentina the first-ever Finalissima Champions! This win strengthens the resolve of the Argentine side before the World Cup. 

Argentina will face off against Mexico, Poland, and Saudi Arabia in Group C later this year. Hence the Albacete would certainly be the favourites to qualify for the knockout stages. 

However, games against fellow giants like France, Germany, and Brazil could be tricky for the Albacete as they look to regain the World Cup in Qatar this year.
