Maher al-Agal, the head of ISIS in Syria, was killed by a drone hit that the US carried out in northwest Syria on Tuesday.

During the attack, a top ISIS officer who knew Maher well suffered critical injuries.
There were no civilian injuries, according to a preliminary investigation.
Col. Joe Buccino, a spokesman for Central Command, stated that the elimination of these ISIS commanders would prevent the terrorist group from continuing to plan and execute assaults.

According to the official statement, the attack happened northwest of Jindayris.
The terrorist group's ability to further plan and carry out attacks will be disrupted by the loss of senior ISIS commanders.


The attack was a part of ongoing attempts to fight ISIS, which has recently made a comeback in a number of locations throughout Syria and Iraq.

A senior ISIS leader in the nation was captured in June by the US-led multinational task force combating ISIS.
In a statement, the coalition said that Hani Ahmed al-Kurdi, also known as Salim, was in charge of organising terrorist activities throughout the area. He supported the development of improvised explosive device facilities, provided instruction to others on how to make explosive devices, and encouraged attacks against US and partner forces
