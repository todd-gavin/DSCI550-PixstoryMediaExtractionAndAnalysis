The International Day of Human Space Flight commemorates humanity's entry into the space age, underlining the vital role of space research and technology in today's society. The day also attempts to encourage people to want to explore and preserve space for peaceful purposes. 
Photo exhibitions, conferences exhibiting space technology, and the release of commemorative stamps have all been held to mark the occasion. 

As T&D tells us, the first human space mission was carried out by Yuri Gagarin on April 12, 1961. This momentous occasion paved the path for future space exploration. The United Nations designated April 12 as "International Day of Human Space Flight" in 2011 to commemorate the first human space flight and to encourage the exploration and use of space for peaceful purposes and the benefit of humanity. 

On or around the International Day of Human Space Flight in the past, commemorative stamps portraying human space flight have been issued. Approximately 40 kilometres (about 25 miles) from Saratov, Russia, is a statue honouring Yuri Gagarin, the world's first cosmonaut to travel into space. In 1981, it was built.
