Q Will in the coming years covid be like another flu virus which will come and go with every change of season A This is what is expected but there is a catch More the virus replicates the more there is a chance of a dangerous variant cropping up So if in some part of the world there is a pandemic happening there can be a chance that many types of variants can be formed some can be dangerous But like i said it is survival of the fittest so if a variant is very dangerous the host will die and so will the virus with it So delta will not survive for long but omicron has a survival advantage Q So weaker viruses have better chances of survival A Take for example the flu virus it is highly infectious but does not generally cause great damage in majority of immunocompetent hosts Similarly the SARS CoV is also wanting to co exist with us and the milder and the more infectious variant is likely to survive Q Since you are saying that we have to still be very cautious and the virus mutations can go either ways Does it mean we have to keep living with masks and taking boosters Precautions are important Regarding boosters it is a global pandemic some countries feel they will be safe if they keep boosting the immunity of their population but WHO said no one is safe till everyone is safe So if economically developed countries feel that they can keep boosting their populations while poor countries have pandemics where the virus keeps on replicating all the immunity gained can be rendered meaningless if virus develops capacity to evade this immune response irrespective of how many booster doses you give For short term this strategy can work but in the longer run it will not work So we have to reach a level where global herd immunity is achieved through vaccination For that everyone has to chip in So I will reiterate no one is safe till everyone is safe
