Piping hot samosas origin can be traced back to Central Asia. As per legends, various traders travelled to India using ancient trade routes from Central Asia. Since heavy food could not be carried around, they started cooking small dishes that were easy to cook at the campfire during night halts, and were also convenient to be packed into saddlebags as snacks for the next dayâ€™s journey. Eventually, samosas found its way to India through spice route travellers!
