The dictators 


An odor has remained among the sugarcane:
a mixture of blood and body, a penetrating
a petal that brings nausea.
Between the coconut palms the graves are full
of ruined bones, of speechless death-rattles.
The delicate dictator is talking
with top hats, gold braid, and collars.
The tiny palace gleams like a watch
and the rapid laughs with gloves on
cross the corridors at times
and join the dead voices
and the blue mouths freshly buried.
The weeping cannot be seen, like a plant
whose seeds fall endlessly on the earth,
whose large blind leaves grow even without light.
Hatred has grown scale on scale,
blow on blow, in the ghastly water of the swamp,
with a snout full of ooze and silence 
-Pablo Neruda 

Image of rotting flesh in the sugarcane fields probably of a war is given and a fussy dictator is chatting away in fancy clothes. Everything of his including his palace is safe and he travels through the hallways his laughs travels. It shows how everyone who battles loses their life and has to leave their loved ones to lose whereas the one who spurred the fire of hatred in the minds lavishly enjoys this tragedy with his/her/their impending sadism
