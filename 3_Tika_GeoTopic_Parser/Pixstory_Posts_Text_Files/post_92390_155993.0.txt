Your honor, she's slaying.🖤🥵
When it comes to a parents’ night out, Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott just proved that even the coolest couples like to match sometimes, too.😍
On Thursday, the new parents of two were spotted heading out for a late-night dinner at celebrity-loved Craig’s in West Hollywood. Kylie opted to break out a sexy faux LBD for the occasion, sporting a micro mini latex🥵🖤 Blumarine top and skirt set that featured spaghetti straps and a very ‘90s rose detail on the bust. Matching black knee-high boots and a mini Amina Muaddi handbag accessorized Jenner’s look, and she completed the moment by throwing on a pair of oversized Coperni sunglasses and blowing out her hair with a side part.💝🥰
