These enormous fish can reach lengths of 20 feet and weights of 4,000 pounds. Great White Sharks are the top predators in the ocean when they are fully matured. Orca whales and other great white sharks are the only species that will attack a great white shark. Along with having strong jaws, great whites also have very long teeth that can reach lengths of two and a half inches. And that's not there for the show. These sharks are capable of ending their prey with one bite.

Sharks, notably great white sharks, are superb hunters in part because of their keen senses of smell, hearing, and sight. The Ampullae of Lorenzini, a sensitive electro-receptive sense, are also present in them. They can detect blood in the water up to three miles away because to their keen sense of smell.

They don't like conflict. They are chill beings to be honest, who avoid getting in fights so they leave when Orcas are around. They're not too fond of human flesh so they do not usually attack a human, shark attacks â€“ even though there, are very rare by them. Jaws did not tell you all the truth after all!
