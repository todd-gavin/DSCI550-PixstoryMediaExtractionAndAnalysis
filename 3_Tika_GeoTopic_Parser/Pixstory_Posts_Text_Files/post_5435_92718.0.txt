I'm not sure if Hollywood is growing crazy or not. 

Bella said in an interview with Vogue that her biggest regret in life is getting a nose job.

In an interview with Robin Roberts, our lovely Khloe Kardashian revealed that her biggest regret was getting a nose job. 

HELP ME OUT FOR A SECOND. 
Is there anyone else who regrets having such a costly surgery.....???? 

Because these two are saddened by it. 

My heartfelt condolences to your old noses. 

It's fine if they don't accept you as you are, new nose.
