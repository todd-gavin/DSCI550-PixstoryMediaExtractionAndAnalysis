Have you ever felt like you could use a bit of an overhaul? Or wish you could just push a button and reset your life…sort of like when your mobile phone starts acting all slow and wonky? That’s exactly where I am right now and I suspect I’m not alone. In fact, springtime often brings on this urge for new beginnings. Along with pollen-induced sneezing! If you are feeling this way, let’s work through this together.

HOW TO RESET YOUR LIFE

When life gets out of balance it can be difficult to know where to begin getting everything back in alignment with our goals and values.

1. ACKNOWLEDGE THE SITUATION
Awareness is always the first step. You can’t fix anything until you admit there’s something that needs fixing. Take time to do some soul-searching. Try to put words to your feelings.

2. TAKE A BREAK
If you can take a vacation that can be extremely helpful. Or maybe a long weekend away. If you can’t go somewhere, figure out a way to give yourself some sort of break in your usual routine. 

3. REVIEW YOUR GOALS, VALUES AND LIFE PURPOSE

4. GIVE YOURSELF A FRESH START
Change your passwords. Create a new exercise routine. Clear out expired items in your fridge and pantry then go shopping for some healthy foods. 

5. MAKE TIME FOR SELF-CARE AND PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT
When was the last time you spent 30 minutes soaking in a bubble bath? Have you read anything more enriching than the latest drama on Facebook? Eliminate everything you can that doesn’t contribute to your beautiful life and spend that time doing things that do. Read. Write. Paint. Plant a garden. Learn a new skill.
