This would be a difficult question for me as Kansas is one of my most favourite bands but I am still at my high after Kansas playing in yesterday's Walker episode paying a tribute to Supernatural. So currently I'm going to be a littled biased towards 'Carry On Wayward Son'. To be honest, Carry On has probably been my THE favourite track of them for years. I also really like Dust In The Windâ€”the mix of Travis' superb picking and thought-provoking lyrics propels it to one of my favourites. The Wall, Icarus-Borne On The Wings Of Steel, Portrait, People Of The South Wind, Hold On and Closet Chronicles, are some others.

If I have to be honest, most of what has come from Kansas has managed to win my heart. And this is coming from someone who isn't even from the band's time. What are some of your favourites from them?
