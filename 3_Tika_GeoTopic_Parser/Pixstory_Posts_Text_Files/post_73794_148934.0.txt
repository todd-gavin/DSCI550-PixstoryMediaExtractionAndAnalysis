Bollywood is notorious for destroying beautiful songs by 'remixing ' them for newer generation. Tanishq Bahchi and Neha Kakkar have been at the centre of it . Before "O sajna "Â  remix of maine payal jo chankai there were many others let us take a look at them .
1. Masakali 2.0 by Tanishq bagchi 
This tops the list 
2. Ek do teen by Sandeep Shridokar 
Why would anyone do this ðŸ˜­? 
3. The jawani song by Vishal Shekhar
Why would you touch a kishore da and pancham da song ?
4. Tu cheez badi hai mast madt by Tanishq Bagchi 
Again why ? 
5 . Leja re by tanishq bagchi 
I really don'tÂ  have anyÂ Â  words
