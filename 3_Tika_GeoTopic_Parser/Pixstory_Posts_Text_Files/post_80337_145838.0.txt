Weaknesses:
Despite being a top-notch club in all aspects, Juventus too has had its own weaknesses at several points. The players in the midfield have often been seen side passing the ball too much instead of finding their men up front in the forward direction. 
This leads to lack of momentum, the poachers in the team don't get much service and hence the goals seem to dry up more often. The defensive approach of the majority of the players has led to an overall decline in the team's rhythm. This in turn provides the opposition with an opportunity to counterattack with all its might and attack Juventus' goal from several positions. 
The ball is majorly being played by the Juventus'players in their own half of the play which keeps the defence line under pressure to keep proper possession of the ball and away from the attackers of the opponent team. This often has resulted in Old lady getting exposed and conceding goals in crucial moments.
Opportunities:
The team which once ruled the domestic league and the whole of Europe seems faded in the past few seasons. The present structure of the team too looks fragile and lean. However, with a new set of players in the squad who were brought in via the summer transfer window will be of some relief to the team in all probabilities. 
New players like Angel Di Maria, Filip Kostic and Arek Milik who've been newly added to the team will hopefully help their team achieve greater heights in the season 2022-23. Juventus will be looking to re-conquer the Serie A title once again after having last won it back in the 2019-20 season under Sarri. 
The quest for the Champion's league too shall go on with the team having failed to reach beyond the quarter-finals stage since 2019. In addition to this the hopes of lifting the Supercoppa Italiana and Coppa Italia, each of which was out of Juve's reach last season.
