The word halwa comes from the Arabic word for “sweet,” and refers to desserts that are cooked down with ghee and sugar. Whether made with noodles (vermicelli), lentils (moong dal), grains (like semolina), or vegetables (like carrots or beets), Indian halwa is a pudding that is absolutely delectable.
Halwa is a yummy dessert that is reserved for celebratory occasions. It isn’t difficult to make, but it does tend to take a bit of time. 
Carrot halwa is a popular sweet made in North India, and it is especially popular during winters. The traditional gajar ka halwa recipe is made with only carrots, whole (full-fat) milk, ghee and sugar; there’s no need for khoya (evaporated milk solids) or condensed milk.
It's a mouth watering receipe that is everyone's favourite..
