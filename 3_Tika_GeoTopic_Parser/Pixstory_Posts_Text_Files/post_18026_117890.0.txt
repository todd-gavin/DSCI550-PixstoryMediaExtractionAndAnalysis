Ricky Martin  won a proceeding against his nephew who accused him of having  sexual relations and then molested him. That's because his 21-year-old nephew withdrew his proceedings. 
 
A source with direct knowledge tells TMZ ... The judge overturned the detention order  he  issued a week ago.

As tmz says , his nephew  claimed that he and Ricky had a seven-month sexual relationship, after which Ricky began stalking and harassing. Ricky firmly denied his claim, saying he had never had sexual relations with a  man. The singer's legal team said his nephew was suffering from mental health problems. 
 
The nephew received a detention order last week, but Ricky and his team did not stand in court.
