The popularity of Wordle has spawned a multitude of similar word games. There's Quordle, for those who like a tougher challenge. Then there's Sweardle, for those with a riper vocabulary. 
In that vein, here's Footle, for football fans. Tried it out the past couple of days. It's neat. Not that tough if you watch the top leagues regularly. You can find it at https://footle-game.io/ .
