Establishing another record, tech tycoon Elon Musk-run SpaceX has endured its second attempt to send off 46 Starlink satellites into Earth’s orbit effectively.

On the social networking platform Twitter, Musk saluted the SpaceX group on a record number of satellite dispatches.

“Deployment of 46 Starlink satellites confirmed- completing SpaceX’s 32nd mission of 2022,” SpaceX wrote on the Twitter.

As per Space.com, the two-stage Falcon 9 rocket, which prompted a clean at T-46 seconds on Thursday, took off effectively from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on Friday.

The takeoff occurred at 1:40 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (17:40 Greenwich Mean Time) amid seriously hazy circumstances on the west coast.
