With Harrdy Sandhu’s songs, we have seen Pollywood meeting Bollywood a lot of times. His songs have featured Nora Fatehi, and Urvashi Rautela, and some of his tracks have even been used in Bollywood movies. And now it seems that once again the Punjabi singer is collaborating with a B-town star, and she is none other than the gorgeous Parineeti Chopra.
There is something cooking between Harrdy Sandhu and Parineeti Chopra, as both the celebs have shared the same picture on their respective social media handles and have written ‘Hi’ to each other in the caption.
The picture features both Harrdy and Parineeti rocking their winter best attires. With boots, gloves, earmuffs, and jackets, the stars have covered themself totally from head to toe. In the backdrop with can see a snow-clad landscape, which is nothing less than a sight to the sore eyes.
