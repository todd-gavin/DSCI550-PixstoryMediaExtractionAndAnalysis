As India knocked out England for 246 in the current one-day international at the Lord's Cricket Stadium in London, Yuzvendra Chahal shone with the ball. With openers Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow, England had a solid start after being put into bat. India made its first stride forward as Hardik Pandya struck out Roy. Chahal, who also defeated Joe Root and Ben Stokes, then dismissed Bairstow. Jos Buttler was bowled by Mohammed Shami to keep him from exerting himself, but Moeen Ali and David Willey's respective scores of 47 and 41 helped England post a formidable total. Along with Prasidh Krishna, Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah also finished their periods with two wickets each.
