It is the 6th time a host nation has reached the final.


After 1984 and 2009, the Lionesses are hoping to win it for the first time at home. Beth Mead, Lucy Bronze, Alessia Russo and Fran Kirby scored for the hosts. 

Sweden had come into this tournament as the highest ranked nation. They were defeated finalists at the Tokyo Olympics last year and had beaten England in the third place play-off at the 2019 World Cup. They too were desperate to make history. 

English coach Sarina Wiegman said: "I’m very proud. Again, the team found a way. We didn’t start that well. But during the first half, we did a little better and better and the players on the pitch found solutions. The first half we struggled but the second half we played so much better."

Tuesday's victory was the 17th of Wiegman's 19 matches in charge of the Lionesses since taking charge of the team last September. She has reached a third straight major-tournament final - having led her former side the Netherlands to the finals of both Euro 2017 and the 2019 World Cup.

After a shaky start, England found their rhythm and started attacking. They soon found the net to take the lead in the 34th minute. Mead took a shot with a turn, which beat the goalkeeper. In the 48th minute, Bronze header bounced through the legs of defenders, which took the goalkeeper by surprise. 

 Super sub Russo came in the 57th minute and scored the 3rd goal of the match for England in the 68th minute. Her first attempt was blocked by the goalkeeper, but the rebound ball, which she kicked using backheel, went in by surprising the Swedish goalkeeper. Fran Kirby put the last nail in the 76th minute. She was through to the goal, but took the shot early over the goalkeeper, which crossed the goal line after touching the hands of the keeper. 

Beth Mead was announced as the Man of the Match, and is now leading goalscorer of the tournament with 6. England will face winner of France or Germany in the final at Wembley on 31 July.
