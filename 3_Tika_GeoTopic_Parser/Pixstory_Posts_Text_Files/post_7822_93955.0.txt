During the last semester of my college, I've been bombarded by deadlines, sometimes they're of assignments, sometimes dissertations and most importantly new college admissions.
 
The spirit of That Sucks Day is about the Tax day in USA on 15th April. It's the day when everyone has to submit their personal tax returns, well guess who has to submit a seminar paper today as well..
.
Not only have these deadlines been draining my energy, they're not letting me enjoy my last days in college. 

So on this years, That Sucks day I'd just like to say deadlines suck and let students enjoy their last days in college to some extent!
