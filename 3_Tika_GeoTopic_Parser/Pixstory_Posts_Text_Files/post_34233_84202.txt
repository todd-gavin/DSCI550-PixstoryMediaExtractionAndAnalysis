To the microphones of DAZN Vincenzo Italiano commented on the last minute defeat against Sassuolo C great bitterness takes away all the good and beautiful that we have done Once again outnumbered we managed to straighten the match Sorry in those final seconds we could have done better It&#39;s a shame because despite the changes the team had put in an excellent performance I&#39;m happy about this but I&#39;m saddened because we wanted to continue the positive streak With a little more attention we could have brought home a positive result I don&#39;t know what Bonaventura said to the referee but one with his experience cannot make these mistakes Not the first time it happens we cannot continue like this The boys believe in what we are trying to propose They also want not to let the opponents keep the ball one of our principles We are doing it well but even today we have we had some restarts where we could have been more effective Then a close on Fiorentina&#39;s next match in the Italian Cup against Juventus Our preparation for the match will be no different from the others From Sunday we think about Juve we are in the semifinal it becomes very important to be prepared to put Juve in difficulty We will face a very strong team with great champions and with a boy Vlahovic who was with us until recently.
