For the first time in more than 50 years, NASA has chosen Axiom Space to provide a moonwalking system for the Artemis III mission, which will set foot on the Moon's surface. The task order for this award, the first under a competitive spacesuits contract, is to create the next-generation Artemis spacesuit and supporting systems and to demonstrate their use during Artemis III on the lunar surface. 

With this prize, NASA has added another another pillar to its plan to send astronauts back to the Moon as part of the Artemis mission in order to support ongoing scientific advancements that will benefit people on Earth. NASA will set foot on the Moon for the first time as a woman and as a person of colour as part of its next human lunar exploration missions. 

After examining suggestions from its  two eligible spacesuit vendors, NASA selected Axiom Space for the task order, which has a base value of $228.5 million. A future task order will be competed for recurring spacesuit services to support subsequent Artemis missions.

“NASA is proud to partner with commercial industry on this historic mission that will kickstart the United States building a lasting presence on the surface of the Moon,” said Lara Kearney, manager of NASA’s Extravehicular Activity and Human Surface Mobility program. “What we learn on Artemis III and future missions on and around the Moon will pave the way for missions to Mars. Spacesuits enable us to literally take that next step.”
