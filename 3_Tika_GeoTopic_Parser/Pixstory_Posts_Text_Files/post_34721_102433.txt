All&#39;s well that ends well The day after the victory of the scudetto on the Sassuolo field Stefano Pioli had reported the disappearance of the medal received during the awards ceremony for the championship victory I would like to have it back the first one he had written hoping that whoever had stolen or found it he would get it back A hope which however materialized The medal was presented by three boys between i and years to the Carabinieri of Reggio Emilia The three would have found it outside the changing rooms after the celebrations following the Milan award ceremony At least that&#39;s what they would have declared In progress there are checks to understand if things actually went like this Pioli will get his medal back, therefore even if the Serie A League had already reassured him by responding to his complaint on social media Hey mister Pioli, we&#39;ll give you the medal again tomorrow
