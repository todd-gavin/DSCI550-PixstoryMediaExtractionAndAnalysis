Student life is someplace where we ve all been through wishing someone taught us how to get through I wanted one too But over the years of struggling in the name of being a topper and playing it safe to failing and taking risks I have grown up I never imagined life would push me around this way but it did How could it I did everything according to the plan and yet I was kicked like a football on the open ground And so is a student life It takes up so much part of our life and yet we take it lightly These make up the initial years of our lives and so don t you think we should take control of it
