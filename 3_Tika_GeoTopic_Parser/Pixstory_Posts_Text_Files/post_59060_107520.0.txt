Hailey Bieber spoke in an interview about the idea of her skincare brand  “Rhode” 

Hailey wanted to focus on hydration for the first launch because of its universal appeal. She said, “I’m somebody who’s on the move all the time, so if I had to pin it down, what would be the three things I need on a flight?” she says. “Can’t live without it, has to be in my bag—that’s how I think about the edit of the skin care.”
