As Russia’s aggression in Ukraine continues to unfold, videos made by Indian students trapped in Ukraine emerge on social media, requesting the Indian government to help them evacuate the region. One such video is of Vaishali Yadav, who is allegedly an Indian medical student stuck in Ukraine. Vaishali claims in a video that several Indian students are holed up in a flat due to bombings outside and efforts to evacuate have been futile as flights to Ukraine were cancelled. She says that the students are hoping that the Indian government helps them.

Multiple pro-BJP propaganda handles shared her video on Twitter claiming that Vaishali was “pretending” to be a student in Ukraine but is actually in India. The claims suggest that she was detained from Hardoi by UP police and has admitted to making the video at the behest of her father Mahendra Yadav, a Samajwadi Party leader.

The claim has been shared on Twitter by various BJP leaders such as Neetu Singh, Naveen Kumar Jindal, Sunil Yadav, Dr Richa Rajpoot, Anil Kumar and others.

The claim is also viral on Facebook.

Fact-check
We performed a keyword search on Google and came across a statement by Hardoi SP Rajesh Dwivedi uploaded by a Facebook page called Khanzar Sutra. Dwivedi debunked the claim of Vaishali’s arrest and said that she is currently in Romania. Vaishali had created the video seeking help from the government and the claim that she was detained or arrested in UP is false.

Taking the Facebook page’s help, we got in touch with Mahendra Yadav, who is the father of the young woman and an SP leader. Speaking to Alt News, Mahendra Yadav said, “This is a conspiracy of the BJP. My daughter was trapped in Ukraine when she made the video. Now she has moved out of there and is in Romania. Fake information is being shared on social media. Vaishali has released another video in which she is herself informing that the claim is false.” Mahendra Yadav also shared with us Vaishali’s contact.
