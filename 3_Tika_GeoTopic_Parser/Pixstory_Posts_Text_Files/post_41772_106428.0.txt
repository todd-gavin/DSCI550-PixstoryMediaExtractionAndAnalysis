Brad Brider has already made a name for himself in his home state as a leader for the blind and visually impaired. Now that he is the vice-captain of Australia, he has other ideas about how he wants to make an impact. 

Brad Brider lapped up every second of a momentous chapter in Western Australian cricket from the optimal vantage point of the WACA scoreboard and via the dual lenses of his trusty binoculars. 

The Sheffield Shield was heading west for the first time since 1999 - when Brider was one. Brider, a member of Australia's national blind men's cricket team and a hat collector, had been present to witness the event.

â€œIt was an awesome moment," he tells cricket.com.au. "It's been a long time. I mean, me and my friend Steffan (Nero), who's in the (Australia blind) squad as well, he lives in NSW now but for a long time we'd message each other at 7:30 in the morning when the games are started over east, and we'd 3-40 or 3-30 or worse and we'd go, 'Here we go again'.

"It was good to finally have some joy."

Brider's cricket obsession also extends to his own playing ambitions. And as he eyes Australia's forthcoming clash with New Zealand in Brisbane, he believes the time is now for him to turn his potential into performance.
