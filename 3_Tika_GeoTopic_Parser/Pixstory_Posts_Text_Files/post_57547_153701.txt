I find it interesting to delve into the field of phobias and actually know what they mean and what situation makes a person develop a fear of something Although it is a very common kind of phobia that we all would have heard of somewhere or else I still felt like reading and sharing what it is all about The phobia I m talking about here is Claustrophobia defined as a fear of enclosed spaces That is quite a simple definition to define something entirely traumatising and dreadful I mean to live in a world where we mostly dwell in chambers or four walls there is barely a time to escape or avoid the fear of enclosed spaces Like some claustrophobic people become uncomfortable in elevators tunnels trains aeroplanes small cars caves and MRI imaging machines It could also be the rooms that are without windows What triggers this phobia is the thought of being confined in a space The suffocation and suffering arise when there s no way out People often try to live in open spaces to avoid the attacks and fear they experience once their phobia is aggravated Besides there s no explicit finding of how much people are affected by Claustrophobia but still some studies suggest of the population is affected by severe Claustrophobia
