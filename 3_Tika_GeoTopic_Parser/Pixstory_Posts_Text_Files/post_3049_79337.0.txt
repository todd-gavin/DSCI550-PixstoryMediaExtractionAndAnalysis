It’s been only two months since Olaf Scholz took over as German Chancellor, and he has been found wanting on the foreign policy in his own country. On Russia and the Ukraine tensions, he is facing the heat.

According to reports, Germany's new governing coalition has serious differences in taking a stand on the issue. Germany is the most powerful voice and the biggest economy in Europe, its silence while other countries like the UK, France, and others have been at the forefront of diplomatic efforts or taking on Russia.

While Chancellor Scholz has chimed in with other countries saying that Russia would suffer “high costs” if it attacks Ukraine, NATO allies are not convinced, even according to the German media. Scholz disputed that allies could see Germany as an unreliable partner in a recent interview.

It is probably because of this pressure that Scholz has announced that he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, but no date has been set. “Soon" is what the German government is willing to say so far. 

The German government has rejected that it has been silent or absent. But it has faced ridicule when it cited some cases like sending 5000 helmets to Ukraine or Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock travelling to Kyiv and Moscow, but coming back empty-handed. It is also not clear when the Chancellor last spoke with Putin. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/02/04/german-chancellor-olaf-scholz-missing-in-action/)

Scholz has been quoted in the media that Germany has a clear strategy of warning Russia with sanctions if it invaded Ukraine while also offering to host talks and bring the situation under control. (https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-olaf-scholz-announces-impending-moscow-visit/a-60640844)
