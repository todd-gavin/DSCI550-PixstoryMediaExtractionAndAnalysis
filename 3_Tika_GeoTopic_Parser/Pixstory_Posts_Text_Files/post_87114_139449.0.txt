‘I almost joined them’ - Barcelona defender Jules Kounde brutally trolls Chelsea following their defeat against Dinamo Zagreb
The newly arrived Barcelona defender Jules Kounde trolled Chelsea following their defeat against Dinamo Zagreb on Tuesday (September 6).
Chelsea traveled to Croatia to lock horns with Dinamo Zagreb to kick-off their Champions League season. Undoubtedly, the Blues were the favorites to clinch the encounter but it turned out to be a big upset for them.
The tie ended 1-0 in favor of Dinamo Zagreb, thanks to a 13th minute goal from Mislav Orsic. Chelsea had no answer to make a comeback, losing out on three crucial points.
Following their defeat, Barca defender Jules Kounde, who was close to joining the Blues this season, uploaded a story on Instagram mocking the London club. However, he deleted the story after facing outrage from fans. “I almost joined them” he captioned.
‘It was an easy choice’ - Jules Kounde on picking between Barcelona and Chelsea
Notably, the 23-year-old defender was very close to signing for Stamford Bridge when the Blues offered €55 million to Sevilla. However, later Barcelona’s offer of €50 million plus €10 add-ons was preferred.
Kounde also admitted that Barca manager Xavi Hernandez had an influence on his decision as he was attracted to the Spaniard's football philosophy.
"Barca is still a club able to attract anyone, and the manager was very important too. He gave me a lot of confidence and I liked his way of approaching football. It was an easy choice for me because he gave me all that I was looking for,"
The french defender has featured in two games for Camp Nou, providing two assists. For now, it looks like he is likely to retain his starting position in the team. The Blaugrana will play Viktoria Plzen in their Champions League opener at home on Wednesday (September 7).
