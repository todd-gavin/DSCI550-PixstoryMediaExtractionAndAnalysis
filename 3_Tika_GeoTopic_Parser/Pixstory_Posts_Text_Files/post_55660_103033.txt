My weekend watchlist is ready The Gloaming is right up your alley if you re seeking for a dark crime thriller with a hint of the uncanny Molly McGee Emma Booth and Alex O Connell Ewen Leslie are police detectives investigating the murder of a lady near Hobart and the drama is inspired by Tasmania s haunted history Their research takes them down a rabbit hole that leads to a year old cold case corruption cults and a long running Tasmanian mystery Currently there is only one series available although there is speculation that a second is in the works
