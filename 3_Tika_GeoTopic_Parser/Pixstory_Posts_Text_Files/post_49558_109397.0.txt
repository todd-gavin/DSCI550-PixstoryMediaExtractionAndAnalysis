This is absurd! What is this madness about living in delusion just because you don't want to feel guilty about causing harm? This is literally a first-world mentality, it screams privilege! Just because you have your eyes closed to it doesn't mean it's not happening! If the truth is what makes you feel guilty, you should probably be guilty. And for a long time.

These lies does no one good. Not the buyers â€“ who are being lied to, not the workers - they're still having to live through such blood, gore and PTSD only to earn a living, and definitely not the animals.

We don't *need* meat to survive. We have come a long way from that dated belief. Humans can, and are surviving just fine without meat. We've evolved enough to not be dependent on the flesh of a poor tortured animal. If you still want to go ahead with it, though, at least have the guts to face the truth.
