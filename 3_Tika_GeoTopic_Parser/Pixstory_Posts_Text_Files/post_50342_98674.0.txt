The events in the Sone Mahotsava were further continued in 2010 with extended and deeper focus on connection of the hill tribals into the mainstream. The Rohtas Fort theme had become quite popularly known in the district as well as outside. 

Several Boards were placed at places of prominence including Railway Stations and highways passing through the district as Landmarks inviting tourists to visit Rohtas. This had a message in itself as it portrayed the Historic Rohtas Fort known to be under Maoist control as a tourist destination and thus created confidence about change in the outlook. To encourage the youth residing in the villages near the Fort, a two day workshop was organized on the 14th and 15th of March 2010, for 40 selected tribal youth at Dehri-on-Sone to create awareness about the promotion of tourism on the fort. 

The youth were motivated to act as tourist guides for tourists visiting the fort due to publicity by the police. They were given bicycles and other equipments for supporting the tourists and were also delivered special sessions on hospitality by experts from the Hotel Maurya, Patna.

 Later, Bicycles and torches were also distributed to a group of another 40 youth in Rohtas to act as messengers of change.   To recognise tribal aspirations, the Police involved the community in celebrating tribals legends and heroes together. During the month of June, 2010, a festival was celebrated in honour of the local hero Nayak Pratapdhaval, known from his historical inscriptions at several places on the hills, which further helped in building bonds.
