The largest surf park in the southern hemisphere with 150-metre-long waves and the potential for "beast mode" surf will be built in Perth with special government assistance to guide it through the regulatory process.

Planning Minister Rita Saffioti was adamant that even though the wave park — on state government land next to Kwinana Freeway in Cockburn — had been given "state significant project" status, there would still be rigorous environmental and other assessments.

The state government and project proponent Aventuur have signed a 21-year lease agreement for the project, with the option to extend it for another 17 years.

Ms Saffioti and Aventuur said the park would provide consistent and quality waves for the almost 300,000 wave-starved surfers who contend with often "awful" surf in the metropolitan area, and also be a significant drawcard for interstate and international visitors.

Cost and time frame blow out

Aventuur confirmed the price had blown out by $20 million to $100 million, to be funded by private equity, because of higher construction costs.

It also confirmed the timeline for it to open to the public with surfable waves had been pushed back by six months to early 2025.

The company was announced as the developer and operator in September last year after a competitive tender, with UrbnSurf, which built the Melbourne wave pool, also in competition for the Perth site.

UrbnSurf had initially planned to build a $30 million surf pool on parkland at the riverside suburb of Alfred Cove, south of Perth's CBD.

But that met with intense opposition from parts of the local community, and in March 2019 the WA Government rejected a request to hand over Crown land for the project.
