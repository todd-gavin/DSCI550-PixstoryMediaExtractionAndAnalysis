Sato is by far the most intriguing character even more than Jake He goes from low level yakuza initiate to one of Ashida s trusted advisors this was largely in part to Sato saving Yashida s life from assassins Sato more than any other character encompasses the theme of choice because he wasn t really given the choice of what type of life he d have as a youngster he holds the ability to choose in high esteem This is why he gives the character Koji who he sees a lot of himself in the choice to leave the gang even giving him a stack of bills to go back to his uncle and not take the path he went down a path that has led him to murder Sato also sees himself as a protector he protects Koji by letting him go and Sam from the man threatening to turn her back into her parents with him now in charge of Sam s new club it could put him in a precarious situation At the end of the season he is brutally stabbed by fellow Chaharikai member Jen the same one he had a fight with in the show i think his journey is far from over and that he s one of the most interesting characters on the show but the main thread at the end of the season revolves around sam s missing friend Paulina and the yakuza running a sex slave ship called the Yoshino Thats about all im going to tell you about the show because if I go any ahead i will ruin the whole thing The show is a must watch it was everything from Clan wars to mysterious life stories to hidden secrets of about every character to weird friendships and love relationships The show has great cinematography you really do feel like you re in Japan when you watch the show I really do hope the show gets renewed for at least another season and we get to see more of the story
