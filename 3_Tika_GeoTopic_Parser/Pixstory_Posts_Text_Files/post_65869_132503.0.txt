India begin their Asia Cup title defence against arch-rivals Pakistan on Sunday. With key pace bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi out injured, Pakistan will depend heavily on Azam's blazing batting. India, who are without Jasprit Bumrah, will expect runs from former skipper Virat Kohli, who hasn't hit an international century in November 2019 and is going through the worst phase of his otherwise stellar career.
India and Pakistan reignite cricket rivalry after a nine-month gap. The two teams can also meet in the Super 4 stage of the tournament and there is a strong possibility of them locking horns in the final too.
Former New Zealand all-rounder Scott Styris feels India need to impose themselves on rest of the teams, which would help them "squash" everyone including Pakistan in the continental tournament.
“Well, as we know, India has a very strong T20 league as well. I think it's the ability to come together and play the style and brand of cricket that best suits your players. I thought that was the big trick that India missed at the last T20 World Cup as it took them about two games. The two losses they had before they just started to go after the opposition, impose themselves with the talent and skill that they've got.
"I want to see India do that in this Asia Cup. I want them to impose themselves on the other teams and l they've got the ability to do that, I think they've got the ability to squash everybody, including Pakistan, in this Asia Cup," said Styris, while speaking on SPORTS18’s daily sports news show ‘SPORTS OVER THE TOP’.
"But if they're going to go into this with this middling attitude of how they want to play the game, then I don't think it's going to happen. I think that's where Pakistan have figured things out a little bit more. So yes, they've got a great T20 competition, but so does India. I don't think that's going to be a defining moment or factor in this match,” added Styris.
