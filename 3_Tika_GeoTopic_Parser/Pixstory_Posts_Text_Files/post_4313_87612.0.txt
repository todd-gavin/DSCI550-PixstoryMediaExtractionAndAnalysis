Basketball is my first love and I will forever hold it dearly in my heart. It has risen me from childhood,shyness, opened me up culturally and turned me in to the man I am today. With that being said, the growth that I am embarking on is beyond my basketball career, and I am super excited to share my endeavors with you all. I have so much more to accomplish for my family, myself and our community.  More to come folks, stay tuned.
