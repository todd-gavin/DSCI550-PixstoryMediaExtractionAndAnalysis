someone who's scared of falling in love ! üíî

Hey I'm laiba ! let's Talk about it ! At one point in my life , i too have been in your shoes going through the same feelings . or rather i would say for the longest time in my life i have been scared of love , just like you . 

I have even convinced myself that love only exists in fairy tales and dreams and when we wake up reality is so different . I couldn't believe in the concept of happily-ever-afters . I always kept wondering how it feels like to be loved , to be someone's priority . I often used to think what is it like to be loved by someone without any expectations !

And the battle of rejection . yes , i fear if my partner finds someone else and they don't love me anymore . or what if i end up messing things between us ? all these if's and but's always stopped me from falling in love . üíî

but when love stepped in my life , it made me realize that it's not love that i'm actually afraid of . it's the uncertainty which comes with the love that scares me . we are afraid of investing ourselves in the wrong person . we are afraid of getting our heart broken in love . 

The thing is at the end of the day life is all about giving chances . you can't stop walking on the road because of the fear of accidents . can you ? just like that if you're going to be in love , be ready to get hurt . because there are no roses without the thorns . ü•Ä

loving means giving everything and not expecting anything in return . love teaches us to even embrace the pain if it comes from our lover . and maybe that's why it is called the most beautiful feeling ever , which we all deserve to experience once in our life .
