Being the defensive midfielder, her passes are not key passes or progressive passes, but she gets the job done. She has made 28 progressive passes and 6 key passes. Her passes are not as eye-catching as Katie Zelem's or Ella Toone’s but they find the receiver.
With Katie Zelem and Ella Toone,  Kirsty Hanson, Martha Thomas, Leah Galton, Alessia Russo, and Jackie Groenen marshaling the offense, Ladd was not able to show her offensive side to the game, and it's shown in the above picture. The Welsh international has made most of her touches in the defensive third and in her own box helping out her teammates. She ranks 97 percentile each with 23.20 and 4.89 per 90 in those areas. However, she likes to play as a defensive midfielder too and she has 30.82 touches per 90 in the middle third.

Hayley is skilled enough as she ranks 100% per 90 or 99 percentile in dribbling past players. She has a trick or two on her sleeve, dribbling past players with ease.


Looking at her defensive side of the game, she has made most of her tackles in the middle third having made 1.18 tackles per 90. 

Ladd has tackled dribblers the most. Her marking is spot on. She makes sure to mark her target and tackle her opponents who try to dribble past her. She is a leader in stopping top dribblers past her. She ranks 99 percentile in the percentage of dribblers she tackled or she ranks 57.1 % per 90.


Hayley has great defensive awareness. She is not afraid to pressurize her opponents to make mistakes. 


Hayley  won her first player of the year award in 2019. 


This season, almost half of the squad was out injured - including her. It goes on to show how important she is to the team. Ladd is adored by her fans and her teammates alike for her selfless work ethic and versatility to play as a defensive midfielder or a center-back. Next season, she will be very important for her team to fight for first place if she does not get injured.
