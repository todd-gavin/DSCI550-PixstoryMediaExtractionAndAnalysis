Premier League club Leeds United have secured the services of American midfielder Brendan Aaranson from Austrian club Red Bull Salzburg for an undisclosed amount. The player has signed a five year contract with the club. Leeds Manager Jesse Marsch was keen to be reunited with the attacking midfielder, as he had previously managed him while at Red Bull Salzburg.

The move will go through on the 1st of July. Midfielder Aaranson made 41 appearances for Salzburg this season, scoring 6 goals and providing 10 assists. The midfielder has 18 caps for the United States national team, scoring 5 goals. 

Leeds will be looking to improve the quality of their squad, after a nervy campaign saw them secure Premier League status on the final day with a 2-1 win over Brentford. Aaranson with certainly help out with that, with being technically sound on the ball and possessing a good passing range. The midfielder is energetic and operates as an attacking midfielder willing to lead the team press, closing down and hurrying opponents into making mistakes. The midfielder is also versatile, as he will drop deep to find the ball and bring other people into play. 

With Christian Pulisic being the lone exception, young American footballers have struggled to make an impact in the modern European competition. Tyler Adams' arrival might signal the start of the USMNT's new era, and Brenden Aaronson has the potential to be a part of it.
