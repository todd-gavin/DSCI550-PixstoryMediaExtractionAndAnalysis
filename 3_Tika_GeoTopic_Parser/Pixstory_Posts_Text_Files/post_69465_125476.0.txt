The sheer majesty of Aharbal, which is located on the River Veshav and is one of the most well-liked tourist destinations in Kulgam, is a sight to behold and worthy of its nickname, "Niagara falls of Kashmir." After the 25-meter drop, the roar of powerful white water flowing through blends with the serene surroundings into a pool of still, azure blue water. This one promises to enthral not only nature enthusiasts but also ardent photographers, and with nearby fishing spots and hiking trails, it has something for everyone.
