Let's talk about PARASITES!

Contrary to popular belief, parasites are prevalent in
ALL countries. If a doctor tells you parasites are only found in 3rd world countries, it's because they were taught under the Western medical system which, as always, seeks to medicate  before investigating potential root causes.

"IF YOU HAVE A PULSE, YOU HAVE A PARASITE." Yes,
it's true, EVERYONE has parasites.

We are meant to have a symbiotic relationship with
these organisms. Some parasites are even beneficial to the human body.

When our "terrain" becomes compromised by heavy
metaIs, iron overload, poor nutrition, environmental toxins and chronic stress, parasites will take the opportunity to overgrow. This is when symptoms start to develop.

Parasites are NEVER the only issue at play. There are
many factors here that must be addressed. This is why It is recommended to get bioenergetic testing, which helps us analyze root causes and pathogens alongside nutrient deficiencies, hormone imbalances and more. It takes a WHOLE-istic approach!
