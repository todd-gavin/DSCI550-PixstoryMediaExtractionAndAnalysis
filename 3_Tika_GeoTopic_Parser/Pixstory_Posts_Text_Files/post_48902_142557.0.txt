Horse is probably the most forgotten animal when it comes to conversation revolving around animal abuse.
Horse riding is cruel in a variety of ways. The first and most obvious way is that horses are forced to pull heavy loads over long distances, which can be extremely damaging to their muscles and bones. They also have to deal with the fact that they're often ridden bareback, which is extremely painful and dangerous.
Other concerns include the fact that horses are routinely whipped and beaten when they make mistakes, or to control them forcing horses to run in extremely hot conditions or placing them in areas where they risk falling off a cliff or into water, which leads to them becoming aggressive and difficult to control. 
In fact horses are subjected to force breeding and their offsprings are taken away from them as soon as possible to be sold off to a life of endless abuse.
These horses have no control over their own life because humans think we own them. Animals are not our commodities. We need to put an end to such practices.
