Are we alone in the universe This is a question that has intrigued humans for centuries and inspired countless studies and works of fiction But are we getting closer to finding this out Now that the James Webb Space Telescope JWST is in operation we might have taken one giant leap in being able to answer this one day One of the four main objectives of the JWST is to study exoplanets planets which reside outside of our solar system and determine what gases their atmospheres are composed of Now our new research into the variation of oxygen on Earth over geological time has offered clues about what to actually look for To try and comprehend how when and why life might evolve on other planets it makes sense to look to the only planet we currently know of which hosts life Earth Understanding our own planet s complicated evolutionary history might provide the key to finding other planets capable of supporting life Life and oxygenWe know that animals require oxygen in order to survive although some such as sponges require less than others Yet while oxygen is readily available today making up of the atmosphere we also know that this was not true for the majority of Earth s history If we travelled deep into our past beyond around million years ago we would need to carry a handy supply of oxygen tanks with us But what we are less certain of is the absolute amount of oxygen in the atmosphere and oceans through time and whether rises in oxygen levels fuelled the evolution of animal life or vice versa These questions have in fact sparked numerous debates and decades of research The current thinking is that oxygen levels have risen in three broad steps The first called the great oxidation event occurred around billion years ago transforming the Earth from a planet essentially devoid of oxygen Read more
