Mateo Kovacic lauded Luka Modric before Chelsea's crucial UEFA Champions League match
against Real Madrid on Tuesday, stating that the Real Madrid playmaker was his boyhood idol.

The Blues will head to Santiago Bernabeu with a 3-1 deficit from the first leg, in which Karim
Benzema netted a hat trick. Modric excelled as well, despite the fact that the Frenchman got all
the attention.

Kovacic stated during Chelsea's pre-match press conference: "Preventing [Modric] is a difficult
task. He's a fantastic player. I idolized him as a kid when he played for Dinamo Zagreb, my
favorite club. "

The Chelsea midfielder went on to say how consistently outstanding Luka has been throughout
his remarkable career.

He's been as good as he is now his whole life. He has been on the same level for the whole
time I've known him, which is incredible. He is a huge football fan. He's a seasoned pro. I
envision him playing for another three or four years if he keeps going like this, "he added.

It really was fun and challenging to play against him, but it's never fun to lose. I like to have him
on my squad at all times. We are currently pitted against one another, and we are prepared to
give it our all tomorrow in order to succeed. "

After that, Kovacic talked about how confident he and his Chelsea teammates were going into
the game against Los Blancos.

"Of course, we have our chances [to progress], and we are determined to show our best
tomorrow," continued Kovacic.

"We didn't have our best game, and the result wasn't good, and the result wasn't good in the last
game, but there's hope, and we're motivated to give it our all; it'll be a good game, and we're
looking forward to it."
