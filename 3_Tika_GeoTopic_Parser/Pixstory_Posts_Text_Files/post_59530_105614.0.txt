Lawrence Bishnoi has denied his role in the issue after the threat letter delivered to Salman Khan and Salim Khan was linked to him during the initial probe. A team of Delhi Police questioned Lawrence on Monday. Lawrence told the news agency ANI that he had no involvement in the probe and that he had no idea who sent the letter. Lawrence is also being investigated for the murder of Sidhu Moose Wala, a singer-rapper who was murdered in Punjab last month.
