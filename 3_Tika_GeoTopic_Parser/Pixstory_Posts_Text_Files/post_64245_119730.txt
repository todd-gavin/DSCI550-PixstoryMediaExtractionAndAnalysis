Finding yourself is actually returning to yourself An unlearning an excavation A remembering who you were before the world got its hands on you Emily McDowell If you ask me what are the things which I detest the most I would say Maths and telling about yourself to another person Like how preposterous this idea is say something about yourself when in actuality you are still figuring out who you are I am a years old girl who really doesn t know much about herself One day I love writing about people and the next day I am crying because my favourite web series is over You see that how utterly confusing and futile it is I believe that the human mind is like a maze You can t decipher it until the very end Just like in a maze you keep on finding new ways similarly for every human mind every day you will discover new layers how agile it is and till the very end of our lives our thoughts beliefs keep on changing like the seasons of the earth maybe that doesn t make much sense but that s what it is about me I don t want to put myself into boxes or put labels on everything I do I am just another human who wants to know what is she capable of doing how far she can go observing the extremity of anything which piqued her curiosity I want to write I want to express I want to relate with people I want them to relate with me I want to know their experiences I want to tell them my stories I want to know what was my own views before other people s opinions were thrust upon me and hence feel the surreal beauty of the people around me I believe it isn t necessary for someone to completely figure it out all You just need to go with the flow When you do what makes you happy and content life eventually figures it out all for you Still confused but slowly and steadily paving a way for me to achieve this simple yet unlikely goal of my life
