Cinema is a powerful art form that can greatly contribute to social change. Films have a subtle influence on societyâ€™s perspective and have undoubtedly contributed plenty to the queer movement in India. Sexual minority in India comprises all those people who fall under the categories of the LGBTQ+ community. The over-saturation of gender stereotypes in films results in the misrepresentation of gender roles which is ingrained in human perspective and is therefore passed on along generations as an acceptable view. India is a country where cinema has the potential to shape the perception of the majority of the population. Realistic films about the LGBTQ+ community would have a massive impact on the mindsets of people. Over the years, the representation of LGBTQ+ community in Hindi cinema has found itself under strict observation from the middle-aged society. Hindi cinema has witnessed a steady display of LGBTQ+ characters - some for-comic relief and some true to reality with effort to treat the subject in seriousness. The engagement of the LGBTQ+ community with the politics, culture, and art needs to be proactive in order to achieve harmony.
