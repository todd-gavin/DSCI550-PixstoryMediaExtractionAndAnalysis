Mail us certainly been a brand that has delivered iconic advertisement campaigns. Sylvester daCunha and Eustace Fernandes created the Amul baby to rival the Polson girl in 1965. Kurien, the head of Amul gave them a free hand to make these ads and this " blessing " has stayed with Sylvester's son Rahul daCunha who heads the advertising firm now.

Amul Baby has won many hearts. She is witty, unapologetic and SO cute! She has a take on everything, be it a political situation, a victory in the sports field or a path-breaking movie. The print ads featuring Amul Baby have become an important part of our lives as Indians.
