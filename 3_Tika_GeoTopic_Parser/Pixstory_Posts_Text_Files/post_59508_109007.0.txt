Tripathi recently spoke at a press conference in New Delhi to promote the movie and to discuss his experiences portraying the role of "Gangaram." The actor claims to be a lover of nature and has spoken of his passion for woods, wildlife, flora, and fauna. After watching the film, Tripathi adds, "I became more attached to wildlife." 

Tripathi gained additional knowledge of the conflict between humans and animals in the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve through the character of "Gangaram." He continued by describing how his relationship with wildlife and outdoors has been strengthened by his role in this film.

Director Mukherjee discussed his inspiration for making this film as well as how he improvised the plot by giving the character of "Gangaram" a heroic twist. 

The real-life events surrounding Pilibhit Tiger Reserve are satirised in the film. Both Srijit Mujherjee and Pankaj Tripathi think that a single story can have multiple perspectives and that satire makes it simpler to get a point across because, in addition to amusing viewers, it also prompts serious thought.
