Things have not gone according to plan for Gareth Southgate in the past couple of months. After guiding the Three Lions to the Finals of the Euro last year, Southgate's men had a horrific Nations League campaigh.
England were relegated to the B division after finishing on bottom of their group, which involved the likes of Germany and Italy. Hence, the pressure is growing on the English manager to step down before the World Cup commences in Qatar next month.
There have been a few candidates rumored to be in line for Gareth Soutgate's post if he decides to step down. As reported by the Telegraph, Thomas Tuchel is among the leading candidates to take over the role. The German manager was sacked by Chelsea after a poor start to the campaign. However, there has been no contact between Tuchel and FA yet.
It looks likely that Gareth Southgate will continue as the England coach for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, which will be his third major event in charge of the Three Lions. England have done well in the past two events, reaching the Semi-Finals of the World Cup in 2018, and the Finals of the Euro in 2021.
England start their World Cup campaign against Iran, followed by battles with USA and Wales.
