Good movement and positioning in front of goal. Ability to anticipate any type of play (reflexes).The best Goalkeepers are able to read the game, and have an eye for anticipating what's going to happen next.On the other hand, weaker Goalkeepers will regularly mis-read the game, get caught in the wrong position/situation, and put themselves and their team under unwanted pressure.Key attributes every goalkeeper must have to:1.
