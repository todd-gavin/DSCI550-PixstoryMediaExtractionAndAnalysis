Marshmallows are light and fluffy, a favourite treat of kids and adults alike. Did you know they're incredibly easy to make at home? All you need is sugar, water, gelatine, and cornstarch. 

Marshmallow gets its name from a plant of the same name. Marsh-mallow is a perennial flowering herb that grows in marshes, hence the name. It has strongly veined heart-shaped or oval leaves and white-pinkish flowers. 

It is not known exactly when marshmallows were invented, but their history goes back as early as 2000 BC.

Ancient Egyptians were said to be the first to make them, and eating them was a privilege strictly reserved for gods and for royalty, who used the root of the plant to soothe coughs and sore throats, and to heal wounds. The first marshmallows were prepared by boiling pieces of root pulp with honey until thick. Once thickened, the mixture was strained, cooled, and then used as intended.

Whether used as candy for medicinal purposes, the manufacturing process of marsh mallows was limited to a small, almost individual, scale. Access to marsh mallow confections was limited to the wealthy until the mid-nineteenth century. Common people only tasted marsh mallows when they took pills; doctors sometimes hid the medicine inside the candy to cover the pill’s undesirable taste.
