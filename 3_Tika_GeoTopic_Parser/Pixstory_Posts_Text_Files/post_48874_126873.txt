It s pretty much a conflicting topic for most people and I get why But there s one thing kids even though have the blanket understanding of right or wrong are still not mature enough to understand the consequences of their actions Especially in cases like stealing which you mentioned When it comes to more heinous crimes like rape or murder it could be debatable but being treated like adults for simpler crimes That s absurd In fact I don t think even adults should be treated how badly they are for simpler offences like stealing from the supermarket let alone children We re forgetting that children are just starting their lives They deserve more than anyone to get another shot at it if they mess up Most of them don t grow up as criminals just because they committed theft as a youngster They deserve to grow up with right tools guidance and support Putting them at the same field as an adult is unfair because they don t have the kind of resilience like adults If anything it will take away any scope of rehabilitation from them and they will likely become more violent than otherwise
