Lionel Messi is expected to start when Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) take on Clermont Foot in Ligue 1 on Saturday.

Mauricio Pochettino's side returned to winning ways in the league by securing a 5-1 win over FC Lorient last weekend. Kylian Mbappe was involved in all five goals, scoring twice and providing three assists.

Lionel Messi also got onto the scoresheet along with Neymar. However, it is worth noting that it was only Messi's third league goal of the season. Messi will want to carry his goalscoring form when they travel to Clermont Foot on Saturday.

Due to their successful outing against FC Lorient, the trio are expected to start together once again. According to the club's official website, Angel Di Maria and Julian Draxler will both miss out on the trip to Clermont.

It is worth mentioning that Lionel Messi did not feature the last time PSG played Clermont Foot earlier this season. The Parisian giants secured a 4-0 win on that occasion, with Ander Herrera scoring a brace.

As things stand, PSG are inching closer to regaining the Ligue 1 title after missing out last season. Mauricio Pochettino's side are currently top of the table, having amassed 68 points from 30 matches. They are 12 points clear of second-placed Olympique Marseille, with eight matches remaining in the season.

Clermont Foot, meanwhile, are just one place above the relegation playoff spot in 17th place. They are currently a point above St-Etienne. However, Clermont Foot have lost their last four Ligue 1 matches.
