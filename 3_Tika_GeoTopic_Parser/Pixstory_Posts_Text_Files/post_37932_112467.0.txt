The WWE Money in the Bank PPV starts in just under an hour. The field looks set as 7 talented superstars are set to fight it out to get their hands on the briefcase. But which superstar has the advantage over the others? 

Possible winner of the 2022 WWE MITB:

The winner of the 2022 MITB could very well be either Drew McIntyre or Seth Rollins. Both the superstars have bounced out of the main event scene in the last year or so. Hence the Briefcase could take them back to the top, where they deserve to be! 

With Roman Reign having an unstoppable reign as the WWE and Universal Champion, Seth and Drew seem to be the best talents that the WWE could rely on to win the title off the tribal chief. 

Another option that the WWE could take is giving the title to Sammy Zayn. The SmackDown star has been sucking up to the Bloodline and hence this could give an interesting angle to his ties with Roman Reigns and The Usos

Reigns could eventually ask him to relinquish the briefcase in order to prove his loyalty to the Bloodline and hence make sure that there would be no "surprise cash-ins" on him.
