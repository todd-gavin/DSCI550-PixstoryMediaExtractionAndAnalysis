We went to the top of a mountain up a mountain road we wound our way because we know it s the perfect place to watch the sun set on the day We never tire of watching a sunset for each one is unique The sky is ever changing as the sun and clouds play hide and seek There is something soothing mesmerizing watching another day go to bed as colors stretch across the sky in shades of yellow orange and red I guess you could say as far as sunsets Deborah and I are fans but this evening as we stood atop the mountain the sun and clouds had other plans This evening s sun was bashful she seemed a lttle shy choosing to hide behind the clouds as they spread across the sky But we were not upset on a mountain top surrounded by the trees for even a sunset with no sun is a beautiful sight to see With no sunset to watch our eyes found so many other sights to see For instance a group of little birds as they landed in a nearby tree They were a little distance away but we noticed how the tree they landed in shook so I ran to the car got our binoculars so we could get a closer look There on the mountaintop unable to watch the sunset we adore we saw instead a group of birds we had never seen before A google search led us to cedar waxwings and I admit we were both stunned because the cedar waxwing has the same colors of our bashful setting sun To top it off we were serenaded by this previously to us unseen bird with one of the softest sweetest birdsongs we have ever heard Yes we came to the mountain to watch a sunset but when that sunset was obscured we were blessed oh how we were blessed to find our sunset in a bird
