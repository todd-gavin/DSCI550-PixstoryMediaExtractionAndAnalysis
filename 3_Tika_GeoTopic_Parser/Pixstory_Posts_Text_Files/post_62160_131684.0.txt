On Sunday evening against Lille PSG superstar Kylian Mbappe scored a goal in just nine seconds, direct from the kick-off with an assist from Lionel Messi.
It is as if Paris Saint-Germain have finally got with the times.
For so long the capital club has been focused purely on the performance of their superstars. It seems now as if they have learned to watch what is happening elsewhere, and adjust accordingly
It all started with Mbappe playing the first touch backpass to Veratti, and then taking off ahead to make a run towards the goal.
Veratti made a forward pass to Neymar, who stopped it a few paces ahead of him, and turned the ball towards Messi.
Messi sent the ball flying over the defensive line as Mbappe zoomed past them, making sure he isn't caught offside.
Then the ball bounced once, and Mbappe flicked it over the keeper's head and as the ball travelled in. AND THAT"S ALL SHE WROTE.
It only took 9 seconds to unfurl all of that. After that,.Lille was on the tilt, and they never recovered and PSG thrashed Lille to a 7-1 defeat at their home.
