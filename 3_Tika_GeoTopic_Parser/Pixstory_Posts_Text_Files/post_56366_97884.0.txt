Women from a very early age are taught to consider themselves as humans who are meant to suffer. For example, they have food and can eat but they were conditioned to eat after all the people in the family ate! Self-worthiness was a forgotten concept for many women. Things are changing but not in the case of sexuality. Many women learn about masturbation through movies and series like sex education. Where is the female equivalent for the word virility? Even in the field of pornography, there is a bias the focus is on control over women. The​ ​impact of highly sexualised content, including porn, is that young people could mirror porn-typified roles during intercourse, instead of more balanced sexual gender dynamics. 

Pleasure is normal and it doesn't require a partner at times. The clitoris is also not mentioned in the sex education classes or conversations, as sexual pleasure for women is largely identified only with penetration. Masturbating stimulates the clitoris and produces sensations of sexual pleasure. When a woman orgasms it increases the pelvic floor strength. There is increased blood pressure in the clitoris. The muscle tone, heart rate, and respiration increase and the uterus go up from the pelvic floor, thus increasing pelvic muscle tension and strengthening the entire region.

Female pleasure is crucial to female empowerment. When a woman is allowed to explore her desires and embrace the complexity of sexual pleasure in an environment that is welcoming, empowering and indulgent it can hugely boost a woman’s confidence. Sex topics shouldn't be awkward but normal. Even now a woman who is comfortable and vocal about her sexual needs is termed a slut. Masturbating is normal and no one should be ashamed or feel guilty about doing it.
