If you're breaking out long after your teen years are over, you may need to look beyond your skin for the source of the problem.
Sometimes acne is a symptom of an underlying hormone condition that can cause far more than facial blemishes.
Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) ; 
PCOS is a hormone disorder that affects women. Although it's not fully understood, doctors believe that itâ€™s caused by insensitivity to the hormone insulin.
Besides irregular menstrual cycles and ovulation, weight gain, and thinning hair, one of the most notable symptoms of PCOS is acne . PCOS-related acne tends to flare in areas that are usually considered "hormonally sensitive," especially the lower third of the face. This includes your cheeks, jawline, chin, and upper neck.
People with PCOS tend to get acne that involves more tender knots under the skin, rather than fine surface bumps, and will sometimes report that lesions in that area tend to flare before their menstrual period, "They take time to go away." So if you tend to get acne in those places and have noticed irregular periods, it's a good idea to ask your dermatologist to refer you for PCOS testing.
