Dolce & Gabbana is an Italian luxury fashion house known for taking the traditional masculine suit and crafting it into a female symbol of power and confidence. Early in their careers, the two famed designers created pantsuits made of leather, embroidered with sequins, classic pinstripes, etc.

Apart from creating a sparkle with its grandeur in clothing, it has also opened a whole Home Decor collection with various products from upholstery to rugs and ceramics. The collection's name is Casa.
Every curated style and pattern in their home decor collection represents a concept. “We are obsessed with chairs; they symbolise hospitality. Lunch is an opportunity to share without haste,” they said.

The chic and colourful collection also includes seating, tables and cabinetry, all adorned in one of four signature motifs: Mediterranean Blue, Carretto, Leo, and Zebra. A sofa upholstered in a statement swirling blue and white pattern, a round table covered in the eyepopping Carretto motif, animal print stools, and a leopard pattern rug. Each piece is fun and functional, exuding sunny optimism and a desire to be seen. The familiar D&G motifs make the furniture, crockery, glasses, dinnerware, and tablecloths feel like a natural extension of the brand and imbue traditional Italian artisanal crafts with extra opulence. Dolce & Gabbana collaborated with Venetian heritage brands and artists like Murano glassmakers Barbini and Salviati and luxury textile company Tessitura Luigi Bevilacqua to bring the collection to life.
These designs portray a unique lifestyle with an enchanting look and meaning.
