Constructed on the principles of Vastu Shastra and Pancharatra Shastra, this temple is situated near the banks of River Yamuna in Delhi. The authenticity of the temple is reflected in its resemblance with ancient Indian architecture and the spirituality the place exudes.

The principal deity of the temple is Lord Swaminarayan, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. The 11-feet idol lies below the central dome of the temple. The structure has been built of Rajasthani pink stone and Italian Carrara marble.

The magnificent temple of Akshardham looks more stunning during the night with the beautifully installed lighting arrangements. There are many activities and events like exhibitions, movies, statues and boat rides through which information about the history and philosophy of the Swaminarayan sect and its founder is given to the visitors.

Light and music show, which takes place in the evening, is the most fascinating element of the temple.
