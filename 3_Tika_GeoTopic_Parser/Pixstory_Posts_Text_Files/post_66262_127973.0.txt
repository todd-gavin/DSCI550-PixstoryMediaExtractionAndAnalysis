Iron Man has been a major reason for the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, launching it in 2008 and saving its existence in 2023 by Avengers: Endgame logic -- but it's time we let this character rest. It's no secret, I'm a big Iron Man fan. Team Iron Man was the right team in Civil War (unless of course you're okay with someone killing your parents and your best friend covering it up). The character has done more than enough for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, sometimes a little too much, and it is time for Robert Downey Jr.'s iconic character to take a break.

Iron Man has been a major player in the MCU since its very launch in 2008, this whole thing might not exist without Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. At a minimum, it would all be very different. The MCU's world doesn't need this suit of armor around anymore, though.

Iron Man has gotten 3 movies of his own, basically got half of a Captain America movie for his story. He was pretty much the lead, if not one of the supporting leads, in four Avengers movies. Honestly, the only character you could say played more of a role in one of those is Thanos. He essentially took Uncle Ben's job in Spider-Man: Homecoming, which I was really fine with because I'm not a extreme purist who needed to see Uncle Ben die again and I was okay with Tony and Peter's relationship shaping both Peter and Tony's lives.

But then Tony also created the villain of Spider-Man: Far From Home and who knows, he's probably going to be involved in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings since the Mandarin in and the 10 Rings were not only a part of Iron Man and Iron Man 3 but also are very common major villains for Tony Stark in comics. Not to mention, Ultron.

So, MCU clearly needs to get over their obsession with Tony Stark and do something else!
