But we have to remember He is with us Isaiah Fear you not for I am with you be not dismayed for I am your God I will strengthen you yes I will help you yes I will uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness Behold all they that were incensed against you shall be ashamed and confounded they shall be as nothing and they that strive with you shall perish You shall seek them and shall not find them even them that contended with you they that war against you shall be as nothing and as a thing of nothing
