If you loved the cast of Only Murders In The Building (OMITB) Season 1, you will not be disappointed when you see who is paying a visit to The Arconia in Season 2.


In OMITB Season 2, Charles (played by Steve Martin), Oliver (Martin Short), and Mabel (Selena Gomez) find themselves as suspects in the murder of Arconia Board President Bunny (Jayne Houdyshell).

Things are not looking good for the true-crime-loving trio as at the end of Season 1, Bunny was found dead in Mabel's apartment with Mabel's knitting needle plunged into her chest.
As they try to clear their name and find Bunny's killer, they will be introduced to a whole host of interesting Arconia residents and more.
With Sting, Amy Ryan, Jayne Lynch, and Nathan Lane all appearing in Season 1, Newsweek has everything you need to know about the famous faces and their characters appearing in Season 2 of OMITB
