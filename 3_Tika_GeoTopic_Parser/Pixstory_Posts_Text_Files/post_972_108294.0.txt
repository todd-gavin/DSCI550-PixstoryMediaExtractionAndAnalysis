Let's face the following facts. 

1. The BCCI has been marketing and encouraging Cricket. It is the richest cricket board in the world. In addition, it is the richest sports controlling authority in India. So it's clout will prevail. 

2.  No sports authority can manage their game in India like the BCCI. India has won 3 World Cups, 2 Champion Trophies, and many prestigious tournaments. So it's natural the game gets more patrons and youngsters swarming around lanes and by lanes around the country to play the game. 

3. Let's face it. When it comes to cricket, an Indian game accidentally invented by the British, Â there is money and popularity along with raw passion. In Cricket, even players at the Junior level can earn handsomely, whereas players of other sports don't. It is also one of the motivating factors offering financial security and motivating players to play well.
