Arnaud D Kaze MD MPH Justin B Echouffo Tcheugui MD PhD ABSTRACT Background Epidemiological data on the associations of microvascular disease with atrial fibrillation are scarce We evaluated the associations of diabetes related microvascular disease in multiple vascular beds and its burden with incident atrial fibrillation among adults with type diabetes Methods A total of participants with type diabetes and without atrial fibrillation were assessed for diabetic kidney disease retinopathy or neuropathy at baseline in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes ACCORD study Incident atrial fibrillation events were adjudicated using follow up electrocardiograms Modified Poisson regression was used to generate risk ratios RRs and confidence intervals CIs for atrial fibrillation Results Of the participants mean age years women White n had microvascular disease defined as the presence of of diabetic kidney disease retinopathy or neuropathy at baseline Over a median of years there were atrial fibrillation events Participants with microvascular disease had a fold higher risk of incident atrial fibrillation compared to those without microvascular disease RR CI Compared to no microvascular disease the RRs for atrial fibrillation were CI and CI for those with and microvascular territories affected respectively The RRs for atrial fibrillation by type of microvascular disease were CI CI and CI for neuropathy retinopathy and diabetic kidney disease respectively Conclusions In a large cohort of adults with type diabetes the presence of microvascular disease and its burden were independently associated with higher risk of incident atrial fibrillation Sources
