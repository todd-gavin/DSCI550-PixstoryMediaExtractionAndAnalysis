Death cannot be avoided, but this directing team will undoubtedly make an effort. Hollywood Reporter said that the filmmaking duo of Zach Lipovsky and Adam B. Stein, best known for their 2018 sci-fi movie Freaks, has landed the coveted job of helming Final Destination 6, the revival of the Grand Guignol horror franchise from New Line. Producing alongside Sheila Hanahan Taylor is Craig Perry, the original franchise producer. Along with Atlanta star Dianne McGunigle (FX), director of the Tom Holland Spider-Man films Jon Watts is also producing the film. Watts also wrote the relaunch treatment. The script was written by Guy Busick and Lori Evans Taylor, whose previous work includes Ready or Not and the revived Scream series. The previous Final Destination film was released in 2011, more than ten years ago.The main idea of the story is as follows: A character has a premonition of a terrible and fatal event, cheats his or her own death, and saves several other lives in the process. However, Death, as a personified but unstoppable force, comes for the survivors one by one. Plot details are being kept under lock and key.
