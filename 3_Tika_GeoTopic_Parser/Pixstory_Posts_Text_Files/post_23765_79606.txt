The researchers of Netherlands have discovered a new HIV variant It has been named as VB variant It was lurking the country for a long period The variant causes times to times higher levels of infection However there is no cause of alarm because of modern treatments About the VB variant The recovery of immune system in VB variant is same as that of the other HIV variants The variant emerged between and in Netherlands However it began to decline in Inference from the discovery Viruses evolve to become more virulent Delta variant of COVID is justifies the statement Therefore it is essential to widen the testing points The widened HIV testing helps in early diagnosis Therefore one should never be overconfident about the evolution of viruses Also it wrong to assume that viruses evolve to become milder Virulent nature of the new variant The VB variant has so far had mutations It is constantly evolving Finding mutants is normal However it is not common to find new variant with unusual properties What is unique in VB variant The HIV kills the immune cells It deteriorates the immune system This is measured by monitoring the decline of CD T cells These cells are the primary target of HIV And these cells play a major role in human immune system In patients infected with VB variant the CD decline is two times higher This means the development of AIDS diseases is faster and vigorous What are CD T cells These cells are called helper cells These cells trigger the response of the body They do not neutralise the infections Beehive Project The variant was first identified under the Beehive project The project monitors HIV samples collected from Uganda and Europe Current Scenario The VB Variant is becoming less virulent in Uganda and more virulent in the US The reason for the happening is not yet known Source GKtoday health hiv variant
