Mental health is an incredibly important part of our overall health This year in NAMI joined the national movement to raise awareness about mental health globally and the month of May has been named Mental Health Month So in honor of this movement I will like to address the topic of loneliness Loneliness is what we experience when there is a mismatch between the social connections we need and the ones we currently have It s not about the time we spend alone or with someone but instead the quality of such relationships and friendships If anyone is ever feeling alone here are some tips Focus on yourself learn about yourself reflect on how you communicate give yourself the time and love that you want others to give you write yourself a letter and call a friend If you re finding that the relationships you currently have are not fulfilling then join a group based on your interests reach out to people who make you feel good and positive and try something new by participating in an event If you don t feel comfortable asking someone out for a hang don t worry it s ok too Back yourself to fly solo read a book and go take a walk Now it might feel weird but learn to accept these feelings Validate your emotions and you will start to feel better Always remember It s okay to get the support you need It s okay to ask for help
