The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) says that 190,800 children who lost their homes and families in the recent earthquake in Paktika and Khost provinces are in urgent need of humanitarian aid. This institution is present in the field and provides health services and supplies through nine mobile teams.

Two weeks ago, the provinces of Paktika and Khost in the southeast of the country were shaken by a deadly earthquake with a magnitude of 5.9.

The Taliban say that more than 1,000 people died and more than 1,500 others were injured in this incident.

However, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Aid (OCHA) has said in a report that about 770 people in both provinces died as a result of the earthquake and nearly 1,500 others were injured.
