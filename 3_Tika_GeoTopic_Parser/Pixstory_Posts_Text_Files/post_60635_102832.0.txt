Water, as we know, plays an essential part in our life. To keep our body functioning at its best, we need to stay hydrated. Nearly two-thirds of our body is composed of water, and we need a constant supply of it to keep our system replenished. During the summer we need to increase our intake as a lot of water and electrolytes gets depleted with sweating

Each cell in our body needs water to carry out various activities. When a person doesnâ€™t have enough water content, he may experience fatigue. Due to the low energy levels, it may be difficult to produce the energy needed to keep moving. This can further lead to other health complications.

Excessive weight gain and poor digestion are problems that are a result of insufficient water intake. During summer we drink more water to keep up the water content in our body because water is lost through sweat when the body tries to cool down. Knowing that our body carries 70 per cent water, not drinking sufficient water, up to at least 8 glasses, will lead to health problems including heat-related illnesses.
