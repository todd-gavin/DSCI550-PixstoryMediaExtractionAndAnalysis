Breastfeeding is  hands down the
hardest thing  to adjust to as a new/first-time mom.

There’s an invisible load that only breastfeeding mothers have to go through and these need to be addressed.

-Being the only on who can feed 
-Staying hydrated 
-Feeling tired of being touched 
-Leaking milk blocked ducts and mastitis
-Worry if they’re getting enough 🥛 
-Only being able to leave for 2-3 hours at a time 
-Pumping, labeling and storing milk
-Adjusting caffeine, alcohol and diet
-Being the one waking for night time feeds 
-Limited wardrobe options 
-People’s opinions about when to wean 
-The weight of the responsibility
