When we pack for a trip, we often forget to think of unusual circumstances that might occur to us. And that's natural, because who'd think of bad things while going on a happy tour, right? But as much as we don't want to talk about them, emergencies do happen, and those it affects the most are the ones who think it can't happen to them.

You can never prepare for everything, but you can in fact prepare for something. So here's a list of some emergency supplies that you should always carry should something go south.

1) A copy of your documents: I have said this before too. It's important to keep a copy of your documents and some extra cash with you, in case you lose your other copy.

2) First Aid Box: A first aid kit! You just never know where you get hurt and there's nothing worse than getting an infection to an open cut on a foreign land.

3) A pair of deck shoes: Everytime a natural disaster occurs, tons of tourists have to walk through the debris barefoot, which not only makes it harder for them to walk and slow them down but also give them all sorts of skin infections.

4) A permanent marker: It always comes in handy! From noting down an address you might need, phone number of a new friend to marking up your way in an emergency. Keeps you from going in circles, getting lost and helps you get found!

5) A sharp device: Now, you might not be able to carry it with you in airports and malls etc, but it's always a good idea to buy a swiss knife or something like that after you land if you want to go to a more remote area. Not only is it good for self defense but it comes handy if you get lost in the wood.

6) A life straw: It's a strangely helpful device I very recently came across. It's a straw that's also a water filter. Saves you from buying bulks of sealed plastic bottles and you can directly drink from a stream/river.
