‌America becomes trending as more than 100,000 borrowers will receive student debt forgiveness because of the policy fixes made to the public service loan forgiveness program. 
‌
‌As per the US department of education, the relief amounts to more than $6 billion. This isn't a new program in the nation as it was introduced by George bush in 2007 and allows non-profit and government employees to have their federal student loans cancelled after 10 years or 120 payments. There have been some issues as the borrowers had issues with loan cancellations. More borrowers are now seeing their loans cleared after reforms to the program announced last year by the Biden administration.
‌
‌Even though the bill is quite a relief why is education so costly in America? It's like economically higher sections can study and the poor students should begin searching for a way for tuition fees for college after high school. Finishing college without a loan is just a matter of luck for many. Why does going to college have to cover a lot of costs? It's like compensating for money not spent on public schools. Not to mention the hurdles for international students. I don't understand the logic of top colleges being so expensive to study. It's almost like colleges don't want anyone who can't afford it to access high-quality education. 
‌
‌Not to mention the difference between the education at school and college. A high level of education is necessary for a better economy. The returns on the government's investment in education are substantial. We see students preferring Germany and Norway because of the free education program it offers. This is a great step towards ensuring education. Many drop college in the fear of not being to afford it. Don't forget to invest in education for a better future.
