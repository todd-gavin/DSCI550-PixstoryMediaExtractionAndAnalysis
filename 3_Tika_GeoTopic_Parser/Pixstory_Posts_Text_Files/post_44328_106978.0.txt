Man City has met the 21-year-release old's clause and have paid Â£85.5 million in total, including
agency fees, signing bonus, and other expenses. The Premier League champions have signed
the Norway international to a five-year contract.

"This is a proud day for me and my family," Haaland told mancity.com after completing his
move.

"There are so many world-class players in this squad and Pep is one of the greatest managers
of all-time, so I believe I am in the right place to fulfill my ambitions.

"I want to score goals, win trophies and improve as a footballer and I am confident I can do that
here. This is a great move for me and I can't wait to get started in pre-season."

Erling Haaland is set to join Manchester City in the Premier League, but how will this affect the
team's strategy? Pep Guardiola has used a rotating cast of personalities to fill the role of
centre-forward at the club, but the signing of the Norwegian might change that.

Being City's center-forward should be the most straightforward position in the game. This season, this is the Premier League team with the most possession, touches within the box, and
goals. Simply take a position in front of the net and shoot the ball.

However, it is not that straightforward. So much so that none of City's current senior players appear to be interested in taking on the position. Gabriel Jesus wants to be out in the open,
where he can find room. In the centre, Jack Grealish has given his least convincing displays.

Although Phil Foden and Raheem Sterling have performed better at times, they still appear to
be happier out wide, as evidenced by Guardiola's decision to deploy Bernardo Silva there. He
did so despite the fact that it was inconvenient for the Portuguese.
