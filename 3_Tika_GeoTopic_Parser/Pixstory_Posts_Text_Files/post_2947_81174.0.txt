The world outside is in flux. The U.S. and the European countries are convinced that the Russian attack on Ukraine is imminent, and Russia has accused the Western countries and the media of going into a tizzy.

Ukraine’s citizens have been used to the threats of invasion by Russia for many years now and they have also seen conflict that saw the Crimea territory getting annexed by their neighbor in 2014.

The U.S., fearing an invasion has asked its officials and citizens to leave the country. It has also relocated some of its troops training Ukranian armed forces to another country. According to latest reports, NATO countries have sent additional troops and military equipment. But all these moves have not moved Russia. Russia has sent more ships to the Black Sea and more troops surround Ukraine on three sides.

But the outward calm in Ukraine doesn’t mean that people do not fear the worst. According to experts, many who can are fleeing the country and many residents are stockpiling supplies. Electric generators have also vanished from the market. 

The officials are ready to make underground railway stations and subways as possible bomb shelters.
