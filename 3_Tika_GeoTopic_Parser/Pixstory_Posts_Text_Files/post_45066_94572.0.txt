In a truly tragic and unexpected turn of events, Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has lost his newborn son. Ronaldo and his partner Georgina Rodriguez announced the pregnancy in October last year, stating they were expecting twins. The family mostly kept the birth of their children private, but images from the hospital emerged nevertheless. 


“It is with our deepest sadness that we have to announce that our baby boy has passed away. Only the birth of our baby girl gives us the strength to live this moment with some hope and happiness."


Cristiano's baby girl lives to bring happiness and hope to her family.


"We would like to thank the doctors and nurses for all their expert care and support."


Ronaldo concluded his tragic post by asking fans for 'privacy at this very difficult time'.


Cristiano's Argentine girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez appears to have signed the announcement too. The couple are already parents to four children besides their latest twins. Namely, twins Eva and Mateo, Cristiano jr. And the youngest daughter Alana Martina.


"Our baby boy, you are our angel. We will always love you," he wrote.


Ronaldo netted thrice in Manchester United's latest premier league fixture but his involvement in tomorrow's crucial game against Liverpool is out of question. The club are expected to announce a statement in support of their superstar in the hours that follow
