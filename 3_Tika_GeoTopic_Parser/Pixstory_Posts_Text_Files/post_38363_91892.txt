Instead of basing it on preference or what is in style South Korean women only have about three different types of hairstyles to work with and they are based upon their age and relationship status If you see a girl with long hair she is unmarried one with a short cut has recently gotten married and older women wear perms does that mean i cannot get my fav haircuts there
