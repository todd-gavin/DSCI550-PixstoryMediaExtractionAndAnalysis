Since Mesut Ozil made his debut in September 2013, after joining Arsenal for a club-record
price from Real Madrid, a lot has changed at Arsenal. As the Gunners overcame Paolo Di
Canio's Sunderland 3-1 at the Stadium of Light, Ozil made a good first impression, setting up
Olivier Giroud for the early opener before Aaron Ramsey's second-half brace sealed the three
points.

When Ozil made his debut, who were his teammates and where are they now?

Wojciech Szczęsny

During his early years at Arsenal, the Poland international was a touch inconsistent, and he was
finally replaced by established winner Petr Cech, who arrived from Chelsea.

With hindsight, the choice to let Szczesny move on a permanent transfer is questionable, given
that he had rehabilitated his reputation during his two years on loan at Roma. Szczesny has
established himself as a regular title winner for Juventus, while returning club veteran Gianluigi
Buffon will have to make do with second best.

Carl Jenkinson

The right-back, a Gunners supporter since childhood, secured a dream move from Charlton to
the Emirates in 2011, but he was never able to establish himself as a regular starter. He
eventually left Arsenal in 2019 and signed for Championship side Nottingham Forest after a
succession of loan spells away from the club.

Bacary Sagna

After stints with Benevento and Manchester City, the right-back hasn't played since 2019. He
was last seen in MLS with the Montreal Impact in 2019. He hasn't ruled out comeback, but it's
becoming increasingly unlikely.

“To me, personally, if they wanted me to stay I would have stayed,” Sagna told Goal in March
2020 when reflecting on his Arsenal exit. “But I didn’t feel like they did everything to make me
stay.

“I was not expecting them to run around after me, but I at least expected them to show me some
love and make me feel like they wanted me to stay one year before the end of the same
contract I had kept for six years without asking for one penny more.”
