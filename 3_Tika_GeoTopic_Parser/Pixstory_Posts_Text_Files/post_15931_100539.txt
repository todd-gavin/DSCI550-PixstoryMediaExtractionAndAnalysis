Marcos Pazos Couselo Francisco Gude Abstract Aims This study aimed to determine the effect of aging on glucose profiles in a population without diabetes Methods We investigated the evolution of glucose profiles in an adult population without diabetes using continuous glucose monitoring CGM in two periods separated by years Anthropometrics laboratory tests HbA c fasting blood glucose and CGM data mean glycemia level coefficient of variation time in range were measured in both periods to study the change in values over time Results participants women mean age years and classified as normoglycemic at baseline were included Of the total population had worsened glycemic status after years age and baseline glucose values HbA c and percentage of values above mg dL were the variables related with this change Related to CGM we found that after years there was a decrease in the percentage of values between mg dl to p and an increase in the mg dL range to p Conclusions Our results indicate that in an adult population without diabetes there are changes in glucose profiles with aging highlighting the reduction of blood glucose values below mg dL Sources
