Airbus is the first of the present-day corporations to see the writing in the sky. The European aviation giant is currently developing the world’s first emissions-free passenger aircraft. Yes, you read that right: zero emissions. But is this all just an exercise for engineers to get creative? Not at all. The Airbus ZEROe should be good to go in 2035 and could herald a new era for the aviation industry.

The most exciting model is the teardrop-shaped BWB (blended wing body) jet concept. It could revolutionise the layout of passenger, baggage and engine areas and those hydrogen tanks would probably go underneath the wings. Airbus is also designing the required infrastructure in conjunction with Europe’s main airports, with the Hydrogen Hubs at Airports initiative paving the way for a smooth transition that could enable service vehicles to use the technology as well.
