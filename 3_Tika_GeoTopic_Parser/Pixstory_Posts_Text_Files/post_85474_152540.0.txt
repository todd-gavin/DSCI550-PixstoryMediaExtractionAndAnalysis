We turn our attention to the UEL, and Arsenal face Norwegian side - Bodø/Glimt as the visitors for match day three of the group games.Arsenal are expected to rest key players - Martinelli, Partey, Saka - with the cover players filling in for most of the roles. It’s an opportunity to recharge the team, from players needing minutes to players being saved for the next league game against Liverpool.An interesting perception of European football is the challenge of resting players in the Champions League. Teams tend to play their strongest side since the competition is far more stronger. In the UEL, you can afford to rest 3-4 players as the opposition is weaker, thus Arsenal have an advantage in this area when it comes to Premier League football.Fabio Vieira is expected to start, alongside Marquinhos and the retuning Reiss Nelson - with the latter returning from injury. Nelson is yet to show Mikel Arteta the promise of his ability and talent, with injuries being a regular issue. Nelson joins a long line of Hale End graduates - Saka, ESR and Nketiah - and he will be optimistic he can show what he’s capable of.Bodø/Glimt are 20+ games into their league season, so it will be interesting to see the fitness levels and quality they bring to the Emirates. Although fairly unknown, Arteta will be keen to maintain a level of respect and not go into this game with complacent minds.An Arsenal win will see their confidence grow, as we face Liverpool in the league next.
