Accidents are a part and parcel of life True it doesn t matter how careful we are accidents are bound to happen But that doesn t mean we should go looking for them By this logic we will have to ban cars machines and even walking Because all of that can be a cause of such unfortunate accidents Driving a car machines and walking are necessary daily tasks that one performs Last I checked no one needs a gun to function as a human In my opinion owning guns is not about safety as pro gun people claim It s all power Shooting a gun is always exhilarating but it manages to combine adrenaline pumping high octane excitement with a sense of serenity and focus that must be experienced to be appreciated This statement by Mr Campbell is a proof of this Gun owners take pleasure in having power over other s lives It is exhilarating for them because they know that they can shoot anyone according to their whims and fancies Moreover if people are so keen to learn the sport there are professional shooting ranges for that There are literally a hundred other sports you can play without putting your life and the life of others around you at risk Your physical and mental discipline is coming at the cost of hundred of Americans dying every year because of lenient gun control laws It s time to stop making excuses and take responsibility for gun control
