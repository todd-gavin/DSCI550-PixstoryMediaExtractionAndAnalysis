Suddenly somebody who had been a part of your life might cease all forms of contact and communication without any explanation. Even though it happens mostly online; this can happen offline too- you end up feeling betrayed and suffer from a lack of closure.

People ghost because it is a convenient method without confrontation, they might not know how they feel and hence they need a break to work through. Instead of being honest and inflicting pain, they ghost! Some people also ghost when their boundaries are being constantly violated and they have to leave for their good which is an appropriate form of ghosting.

Ghosting triggers a person's traumas- brings emotions of abandonment, neglect, and fear of attachment. This can leave a person in severe trauma which they carry on because of a lack of closure.

How do you deal?

Understand it's their problem, not yours- it's their fear of commitment or communication its not your problem. Donâ€™t demean your worth.

Try to see it as a positive aspect- what
 emotional distress would that person cause if they stayed in the relationship? They showed you their level of emotional unavailability and lack of respect.

Therapy works- talk about your feelings. Open up. Do what they feared to do and promise yourself that you will never do this to a person.

Getting in touch with the ghosted person is not recommended by the experts. However, you can reach them for closure just to hear from them this has come to an end with zero expectations or hope.
