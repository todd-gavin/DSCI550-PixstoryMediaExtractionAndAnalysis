The only dragon that truly lives up to its name the Komodo Dragon is the largest existing lizard on the planet Komodo dragons belong to the Varanus genus and the Varanidae family making them monitor lizards They can grow to a length of feet or more and weigh up to pounds Their skin resembles armour due to their strong teeth and claws and the little pieces of bone in their scales They can sprint at a speed of roughly mph when hunting Although not always particularly fast they accelerate swiftly so being chased by them isn t exactly the real danger here Komodo dragons can be deadly with just one successful bite Their lower jaw contains glands that secrete venom that prevents blood from clotting resulting in severe bleeding and frequently sending the victim into shock So THAT is the dangerous part With their Jacobson s organs and long forked tongues that all monitor lizards possess the Komodo Dragon is easily able to track prey for days at a time Because they can easily accomplish a kill and because they are reptiles they may wait for their prey to bleed out making them particularly effective predators This thing wants to eat you You can t tame it even if you wanted to However that doesn t take away from the fact they are being brutalized by humans These magnificent creatures deserve our best efforts to ensure their preservation
