Everyone is aware about how pleasant Bangalore weather is. Having lived here for oved 20 years, I have gotten used to this. But I haven't grown tired of it.

It's a wonderful sight when it rains, especially on our campus. The trees and plants come alive and it's a lush green sight. It's an unspoken rule that we all carry umbrellas at all times. The rain can drench you even if you're just trying to make it to your next class on time.

Other than the inconvenience of having to wait for the rain to stop if you aren't carrying an umbrella, experiencing it on campus is truly delightful. It's great to huddle around our campus Nandini store, having discussions over steaming cups of coffee. I also love seeing the campus turning colourful when all the umbrellas open up.

When puddles form during heavy rains, you might even catch some students splashing through it and I think these are core memories we make in our youth that we'll cherish when we are older. Sometimes, I don't bother opening my umbrella. A little drizzle never hurt anybody 🤷🏻‍♀️☔️
