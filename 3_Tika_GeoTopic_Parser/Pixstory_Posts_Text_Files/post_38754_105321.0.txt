So Thibaut Courtois, the boy from the Genk academy, won Real Madrid’s 14th Champions League title and his 1st ever UCL title. 


Courtois, who started his career at Genk, progressing through the ranks, joined Chelsea for a reported sum of 8 million. But he was sent out on loan to Real’s cross-town rival Atletico Madrid, as the Belgian replaced the departing David De Gea, who had joined Manchester United. He was there for 3 years. He rejoined Chelsea again in 2014, winning the Premier League, League cup and the Premier League golden gloves. 

In 2018. Spanish giants Real Madrid came knocking at his doorstep and he joined Los Blancos for a reported sum of £35 million. 


Chelsea Journey


We will be focusing on his last season at Chelsea - which is 2017/18. During that time Antonio Conte was managing the Blues. That season, Chelsea finished in the 5th position - outside the UCL qualification spots.


Courtois made a total of 2090 passes out of which he completed 896 of them. He had a passing accuracy of 70%. The Belgian made 40% of long passes to his teammates. 


He made a total of 3.0 short and 13.8 short passes per 90. This visualization is not per 90 metrics. He has made 105 short passes and 483 medium passes which put him in the top quadrant

Due to his 6 ft 6 inches frame, he won most of the aerial duels by jumping and collecting the ball at ease. He engaged in 5 aerial duels out of which he had successful 80.00% aerial duels.

Courtois is known for shielding the ball whenever an opponent is planning to shoot or pass, he will jump on the ball and cover it or parry it away. His height helped him in that.


Despite finishing in top 10 with a number of  clean sheets kept, Courtois yearned for Spain as he had his wife and son there. He had to take permission from Blues director Marina Granovskaia to leave England. The Belgian, being at the final year of his contract, was sold.
