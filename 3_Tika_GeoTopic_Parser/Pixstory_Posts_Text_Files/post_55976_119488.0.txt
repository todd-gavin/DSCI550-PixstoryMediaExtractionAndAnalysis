According to Business Insider, a prominent conservative donor said, If Rishi Sunak doesn't become the UK's next prime minister, the country will get a "bad name" and be "perceived as racist”

The comments were made by Rami Ranger, who has given £1.3 million to the party personally and through his firm Sun Mark. It came as Sunak competed with Liz Truss to be chosen by Conservative Party voters to succeed Boris Johnson as the party leader and therefore prime minister.

Ranger told the Indian news channel,, Bharat Tak he was backing Sunak, a former chancellor because his "caliber is above everyone else". The interview was in a mixture of Hindi and English, which Insider translated. He said that "internal politics" could work against Sunak, who if victorious would become the UK's first prime of Indian origin.

"If people reject him, it will be a bad name for the party and the country because this will be perceived as racist," Ranger said. "And so there is pressure on them to prove that here race does not matter. Caliber matters and Rishi's caliber is above everyone." He added: "I am optimistic that people here will be fair and will not reject anyone based on race."

The race to succeed Boris Johnson has been widely praised as the most diverse in British history. Sunak, who was the frontrunner during the parliamentary stage of the contest, made it to the final two against Truss, who currently has the edge. She would be the UK's third female prime minister if she wins. 

Now the issues have been driven a bit into a clash between racism and feminism-both of them are important and cannot be placed above one another. I think we should take either of the decision positively as both of them are different in ideologies on many levels. Yet who does suit best to be the PM? Whomever the MPs are choosing we should be glad about whom they represent.
