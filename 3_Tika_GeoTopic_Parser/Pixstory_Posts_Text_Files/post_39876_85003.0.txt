To answer those questions, it's necessary to first define what olive oil is and how it's manufactured. Extra virgin olive oil is the easiest to describe, followed by olive oil, and finally olive pomace oil. This is due to the fact that most consumers are unaware that "olive oil" is actually a refined, lower grade form of EVOO.

Evoo Comes From Fruit Vs. Pomace Comes From Dry Pulp
Another distinction between olive pomace oil and EVOO/olive oil is the source of the oil.

The fruit of the olive is used to make extra virgin olive oil. The entire olive is mashed into a paste, including the fruit and pit. To remove the oil, the paste is usually centrifuged or spun (rather than pressed, as the marketing term "first cold press" implies).

Some of that oil will be refined into "olive oil," a light, flavourless oil made from high heat, natural clay, and steam. Then a little amount of EVOO is poured back in, resulting in the grade known as olive oil, or Pure Olive Oil, as found on store shelves.

Pomace, on the other hand, is made from the pulp that has already been spun and is left over after the Extra Virgin is made.
Evoo Is Produced With Expeller Pressing Vs. Pomace Is Solvent Extracted
Is olive pomace oil of superior quality? Without a doubt, no. It isn't true, as no one would assert. Is it, however, the worst? Without a doubt, no.

In my home kitchen, I always use Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil when cooking with olive oil. However, I am aware of the taste profile, heat, and price constraints that food manufacturing corporations' R&D and purchasing divisions face. They are two distinct circumstances that are not easily comparable.

However, I prefer to cook using olive pomace oil, which is still derived from olives and is often recognized as one of the healthiest oils available. It's still a superior quality oil than ordinary maize, canola, or soybean oil (your normal vegetable oils), which are also produced by solvent extraction (pomace's biggest disadvantage).
