An exact date for the asylum and migration of individuals or groups and ethnicities of the Afghan people as in other countries may not be available Because migration and displacement have a history as old as human history But in this regard the factors of migration in the contemporary history of Afghanistan and the opportunities and harms of Afghan migration abroad have been studied According to Dr Tabibi Some people in Afghanistan have been migrating abroad for a century The first mass migration of Afghans apparently took place from Afghanistan to Australia in AD At the request of the British government more than Afghans from Ghazni and Kabul districts were taken to the largest island which was the gathering place of some British criminals and murderers The aim was to help these hardline and resilient immigrants get to know the scorching plains of Gabson and Samson off the west coast of Australia which connects to the Indian Ocean to the east ending in the Pacific Of course Afghan refugees living in Australia were not the group of Afghan refugees because years before that date Afghans had gone to Central Asia India Iran and Iraq and settled there forever Among the emigrants during the reign of Shah Mahmud son of Timur Shah Saduzai who left Afghanistan for good and settled in Iran were from the Oimaq tribes of Herat and Badghis Of course before the time of Abdul Rahman people had tasted the bitter taste of migration and displacement However according to history in no other period has the people especially the Hazaras suffered from the tragedy of massacre captivity migration and displacement and no such ominous event has occurred in the history of the country All writers researchers and immigration advocates believe that displacement is a pain that not only afflicts the displaced person but also others But the migration of the Afghan people in the last few decades is very different in the last three decades and in the last century Because the flight of Afghans from the country in the last three decades not only did not cause them to be forgotten
