It's been a year, this Dog been laid on the cradle of death. Yes, 28 Aug . 2021 , was the date. 
His Name was Sparko. 
He got pelvis fracture and dislocation. Due to this, he lost his sense of move and walk. Sitting all day and night under a car, waiting for any help. We contacted PETA, but it was late. He received death injection by doctors because of his sufferings. 
He was a good dog. Waiving tail before every other guy. 
And there is a guy who is responsible for his long serving pain.Â  People knowingly and unknowingly hurt these innocent beings just for their pleasure. I want to say please do not turn the fate of any other dog the same as done with sparko. 
I wish peace in the afterlife if God has destined an afterlife for animals.
