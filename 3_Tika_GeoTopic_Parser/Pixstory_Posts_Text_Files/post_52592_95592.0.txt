Thousands of children in India are forced to beg. These youngsters live in poverty and are subjected to severe conditions, violence, and torture. The youngsters have no choice except to beg to make ends meet. Many children are abused and forced to beg for money to give to human traffickers, and the money they receive is frequently spent on drugs and alcohol rather than clothing and food. These children are also sedated. The majority of these children come from low-income families with no one to look after them.

Recently, I was in Kamla Nagar, Delhi where a girl came to us asking for money. I don't prefer giving them money so I thought of offering her some food and order. So very diligently I asked her if she wanted something to eat or drink but she bluntly refused and kept on saying " Mujhe 10rs do ". 
That really broke my heart. I really want to know about what she does with the money she gets by money.
