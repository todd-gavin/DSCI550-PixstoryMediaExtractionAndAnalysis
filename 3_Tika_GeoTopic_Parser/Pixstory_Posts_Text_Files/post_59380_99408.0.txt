With so many world-famous sites and attractions to visit, deciding on the best things to do in Los Angeles can be a bewildering task.

If you’re only in town for a short time, you could spend all your trip wandering around L.A.’s essential museums without even making it to Hollywood. This city is big—and stuffed with so many worthwhile experiences that you’ll never be asking yourself what to do—so expect to put in the miles taking in everything it has to offer, from the beaches of Santa Monica to the vibrant historic streets of the Arts District and super-hip Silver Lake. 


There are so many great places to visit and things to see, it can be hard knowing where to start and what to fit in. This list should help you decide and get the most from your L.A. getaway:

1. Relax on postcard-perfect beaches in Malibu

Put in the extra miles to venture north and west from Venice and Santa Monica and you’ll be rewarded with the most picturesque beaches in L.A. County

2. Smarten up at the Griffith Observatory

Sure, you can’t see all that much through its enormous telescope, but you can still spend a few hours browsing around the Griffith Observatory quite happily (open Fri–Sun; grounds open daily).


3. Get animated with Mickey and Minnie at Disneyland

You’re never too old for Disneyland. This legendary theme park overflows with brilliant things to do, spread over numerous themed lands—including Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge and Avengers Campus—and the adjacent California Adventure.

4. See a concert in style at the Walt Disney Concert Hall

There’s nothing cartoonish about the Walt Disney Concert Hall, which is the crown jewel of the Music Center. Designed by Frank Gehry, the auditorium has an open platform stage and some of the finest acoustics you’ll find anywhere in the world—plus a semi-secret garden.
