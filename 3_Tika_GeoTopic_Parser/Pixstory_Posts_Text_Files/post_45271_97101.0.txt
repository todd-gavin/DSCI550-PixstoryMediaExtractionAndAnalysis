But where did it go wrong for the Frenchman?

In his first and second season with Manchester
United under Jose Mourinho, he was paired alongside prime Nemanja Matic which allowed him
to feature as a deep-lying playmaker.

The lack of natural defensive midfielder was a glaring
issue that the Red Devils failed to address. After the departure of Mourinho, Ole played him in
the attacking midfielder role which allowed PP6 to score bangers as well as break the lines.

Also, the continuous injuries to him called Manchester United to sign Bruno Fernandes for the
AM role. Before Pogba returned to the team, Bruno had occupied the place and Pogba was
again dropped to the No.6 role.

Alongside McTominay and Fred, Pogba never felt comfortable
and his inability to contribute defensively made him a less chosen option by the manager.

The last thing that affected Paul Pogba’s tenure at Old Trafford was his and his agent’s remarks
over the club. Mino Raiola and Paul Pogba’s brother commented on the club whenever Paul
Pogba was on international duty. This made him less fan favorite and was always disliked by the
majority of the fanbase.

Despite measures taken by the club, it was sulking and the player's inability to contribute in the
difficult circumstances made the move feel wrong. The player was on higher wages and his
contribution was sub-par in several
seasons.
