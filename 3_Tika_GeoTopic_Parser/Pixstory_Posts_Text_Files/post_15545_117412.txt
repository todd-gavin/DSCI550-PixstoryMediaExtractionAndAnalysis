released We are not at the Center of the World feat Fanfara Station distributed by ADA Music Italy the new single by the singer-songwriter SGR in collaboration with the cosmopolitan trio that blends horns and electronics with Maghreb rhythms and chants We are not at the Center of the World an invitation to move away from calculation confident and comfortable in one&#39;s daily life Even on a musical level the song encourages discovery and contamination with the fusion of two very different worlds: the more songwriting one of Sgr and the more world music one of Fanfare Station In the fantastic West one always has the feeling that let the center be the asset the balance point the natural place of convergence sheltered from excesses and extreme positions crisis beyond the established borders we would perhaps not come out fuller more aware and less frightened by the violations of our presumed integrity
