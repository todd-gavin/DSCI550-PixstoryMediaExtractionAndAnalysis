•Kadha is a homemade drink rich in medicinal values•

-The home made immunity booster, Kadha, is known to all. Ever since the coronavirus was detected in India, much before the pills and tablets came, moms and grandmoms had started feeding us this coffee colored decoction called Kadha.

While we all have grown up drinking this warm medicinal liquid, the use of it sprung up during the early 2020 when coronavirus induced COVID-19 was linked to common cold. When the symptoms of COVID-19 were seen to be that of common cold, our households smelt cinnamon, tulsi leaves, ginger and saunth.

•Excess Kadha is not good•

-Two years into this pandemic, we haven’t stopped taking our magic drink. But did you know that over drinking kadha can lead to serious health issues?

"Do not mix so many things in Kadha," says Yogacharya Dr Navdeep, Navyoga. In an interview with public broadcaster DD News, he said excess intake of Kadha can affect the normal functioning of your kidney, and liver. He further advised to consult a doctor and take suggestions on what ingredients can be taken in Kadha and in what amount based on your medical condition.

What Dr Navdeep’s statement holds is the part we all have overlooked in these two years, which is that Kadha as a medicinal drink needs to be taken in a balanced way.

•Ingredients•

-ndia’s affinity towards Ayurvedic medicinal practices dates back to thousands of years. Panchvidh Kashyapam in the Charak Samhita says that medicinal plants can be consumed in five different ways: Swaras (juice), Kwath or Kadha (decoction), Kalka (paste), Hima (herb concoction), and Phant (herb-infused concoction).

Kadha is one of the most common ways of consuming Ayurvedic medicines.

Some of the common ingredients used for Kadha are Tulsi, Giloy, Haldi, Black Pepper, Ginger, Clove, Lemon, Ashwagandha, Cardamom, and Cinnamon. These ingredients have essential phytochemicals like Oleanolic acid, Ursolic acid, Rosmarinic acid, and Eugenol.
