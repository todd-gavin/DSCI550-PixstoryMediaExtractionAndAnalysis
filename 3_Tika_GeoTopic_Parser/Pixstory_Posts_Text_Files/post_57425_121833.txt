Starting here what do you want to remember How sunlight creeps along a shining floor What scent of old wood hovers what softened sound from outside fills the air Will you ever bring a better gift for the world than the breathing respect that you carry wherever you go right now Are you waiting for time to show you some better thoughts When you turn around starting here lift this new glimpse that you found carry into evening all that you want from this day This interval you spent reading or hearing this keep it for life What can anyone give you greater than now starting here right in this room when you turn around William Stafford
