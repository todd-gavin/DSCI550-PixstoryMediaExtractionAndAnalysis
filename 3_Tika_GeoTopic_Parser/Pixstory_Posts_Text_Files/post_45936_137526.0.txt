According to The Times of London and Radar Online, Melania Trump's pals alleged that she felt violated after FBI officials "defiled" her home at Mar-a-Lago last month while carrying out a search warrant there. 

BI reported that an inquiry into the management of presidential documents was the reason for the raid, which included an FBI search of the former first lady's wardrobe, a source told Politico last month. 

Her husband, former President Donald Trump, reportedly had a fit over this and later complained on Truth Social that the raid had left her Florida home's closet in a "mess." 

It was further reported that additionally, the former first lady considered the FBI agents' search of her possessions to be intrusive and expressed special worry that her undergarments had been handled, according to reports from her acquaintances.

"Melania doesn't like the idea of strangers going rifling through her things. Who knows who touched her underwear during the raid? She's never going to feel comfortable wearing those ever again," a friend said, per The Times, citing a Radar Online report.
