There is perhaps no better way to see the absolute pinnacle of human athletic abilities than by watching the Olympics But at the Winter Games this year and at almost all professional sporting events you rarely see a competitor over years old and almost never see a single athlete over This is because with every additional year spent on Earth bodies age and muscles don t respond to exercise the same as they used to I lead a team of scientists who study the health benefits of exercise strength training and diet in older people We investigate how older people respond to exercise and try to understand the underlying biological mechanisms that cause muscles to increase in size and strength after resistance or strength training Old and young people build muscle in the same way But as you age many of the biological processes that turn exercise into muscle become less effective This makes it harder for older people to build strength but also makes it that much more important for everyone to continue exercising as they age How the body builds muscle The exercise I study is the type that makes you stronger Strength training includes exercises like pushups and situps but also weightlifting and resistance training using bands or workout machines When you do strength training over time exercises that at first felt difficult become easier as your muscles increase in strength and size a process called hypertrophy Bigger muscles simply have larger muscle fibers and cells and this allows you to lift heavier weights As you keep working out you can continue to increase the difficulty or weight of the exercises as your muscles get bigger and stronger It is easy to see that working out makes muscles bigger but what is actually happening to the cells as muscles increase in strength and size in response to resistance training Full story at The Conversation Image Courtesy
