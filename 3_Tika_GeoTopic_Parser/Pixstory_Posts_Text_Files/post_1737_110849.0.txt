Mangal Pandey did not launch the first war for independence in India against British oppression. Tilka Manjhi did in 1771. Even the Hool revolt led by Sido and Kanhu in 1855 preceded Mangal Pandey's revolt in 1857.

June 30 commemorates the great Hool Rebellion. On this day in 1855 around 40,000 tribals from 400 villages of Bhognadeeh, Sahebganj district, refused to pay land revenue to the British, under the leadership of Sido, Kanhu, Chand, Bhairav, and their sisters Phulo and Jhano. Sido declared, "It's time we push the British out." He also gave the slogan "Karo Ya Maro [do or die]" and "Angrezon Hamaari Maati Chhodo [British leave our land]." 

The British immediately ordered the arrest of the four brothers. A policeman came to the purpose but was beheaded by the Santhals. This terrified the British officials in the Santhal Pargana.

It is said that every attempt to tinker with the culture and tradition of the Santhals, or usurp their water, land and forests was met with a rebellion. When the moneylenders, landlords or the British tried to grab the land of the tribals, the result was the Hool Rebellion of June 30, 1855. 

In the battle that followed, 20,000 Santhals, alongwith Sido, Kanhu, Chand, Bhairav, Phulo and Janho laid down their lives to protect their water, land and forests. 

When the British realized that the attempt to subjugate the rebellion was futile, they called in the army and imposed martial laws. Thousands of Santhals were arrested, lathis were charged and guns fired against the protestors. The battle continued till the last tribal was alive. 

Thus, the first rebels against British imperialism in India came from the primitive hill tribes. They took on the British in the hills of Jharkhand.
