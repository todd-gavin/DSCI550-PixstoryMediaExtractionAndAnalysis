Beanie Feldstein, the lead in the Broadway revival of 'Funny Girl' announced on Instagram that she would be leaving the production at the end of this month, which is earlier than expected.

"Playing Fanny Brice on Broadway has been a lifelong dream of mine, and doing so for the last few months has been a great joy and true honour," Feldstein wrote in the post. "Once the production decided to take the show in a different direction, I made the tough decision to step away sooner than anticipated."

Lea Michele would be replacing Beanie Feldstein in the show.
Michele will assume the role of Fanny Brice on Sept. 6. In the interim, Julie Benko will perform the title role from Aug. 2 through Sept. 4 and every Thursday beginning on Sept. 8.

Jane Lynch, who plays Mrs Brice, is leaving the production earlier than expected and will be replaced by Tovah Feldshuh ("Yentl") starting Sept. 6.
