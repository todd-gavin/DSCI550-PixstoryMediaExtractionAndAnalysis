The Scottish champions presented their magnificent Adidas Celtic 22-23 away kit earlier today,
confirming previous leaks. The new Celtic away jersey, which is inspired by a classic from the
early 1990s, is now available for pre-order and will be delivered on June 23, 2022.

The Adidas Celtic 2022-2023 away football kit is primarily black, with green stripes with a thin
white border on each side. The Adidas Celtic 22-23 away football shirt has green 3 Stripes on
the shoulders, while the Adidas and Dafabet badges are white with a black outline.

The Adidas Celtic 2022-23 away jersey's overall design looks to be inspired by Umbro's
 1992-93 away kit, which can also be observed in the way the club badge is enclosed by a
shield.

The outfit is completed with black shorts and socks. The Celtic 22-23 away kit can be pre-ordered online and will be delivered on June 23, 2022.

Harry Kewell, a former Australian international, is expected to join Celtic manager Ange Postecoglou's backroom staff. Kewell, 43, has been unemployed since being fired by Barnet in
the National League last year after only four months in command.

Postecoglou claimed that he initially elected not to add to his coaching staff, instead relying on
John Kennedy for assistance, with Stephen McManus, Gavin Strachan, and Stevie Woods
making up the backroom staff.

Postecoglou has turned to the former Liverpool and Leeds attacker who will join as a first-team coach after winning the Scottish Premiership and League Cup in his first season. Kewell just lost out on working with Postecoglou for the Australian national team and Melbourne Victoria,
but the 56-year-old had previously provided a critical piece of advice.

"The one thing Ange told me, and this has stuck with me, is go your own way," he said.

"Once you start listening to other people, you run into trouble."
