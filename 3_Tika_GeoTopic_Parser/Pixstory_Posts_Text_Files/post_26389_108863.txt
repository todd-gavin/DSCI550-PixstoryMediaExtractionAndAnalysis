The Missoni men&#39;s spring summer collection signed by the new creative director Filippo Grazioli lets itself be enchanted by the alphabet of new words that arise from the lightened and also energized aesthetics of the new course of the maison where the great classics are revisited from a different perspective A timeless wardrobe and ageless which translates into comfortable elegant informal dressing where the essential is synonymous with elegance celebrated in the spontaneity of wearable combinations both during the day and in the evening A way of dressing that certainly embraces the casual style but with a transversal mindset that touches everything from the cardigan to the suit from the vest to the pullover and even in the trousers with a loose silhouette without constraints and is also found in the shorts combined with the bowling shirt
