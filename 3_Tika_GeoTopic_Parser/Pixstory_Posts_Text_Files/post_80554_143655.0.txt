Arsenal completed five signings this summer: boyhood fan Matt Turner, the promising Marquinhos, the exciting Fabio Vieira, but perhaps the two most important ones, Gabriel Jesus & Oleksandr Zinchenko.Zinchenko & Jesus, both 25, have joined Arsenal in their prime years & are coming off a remarkable four Premier League titles since joining Manchester City in 2016 & 2017 respectively. It’s already been visible the pair share a close bond, both on & off the pitch, so it’s no surprise Mikel Arteta was so keen to reunite them once again.Jesus’ impact was instant, showing fans his goalscoring instinct, power, drive & link-up from his first pre-season match, but it’s his leadership that intrigues me the most. During the final stages of the win against Aston Villa last month, Jesus, the Man of the Match that night, was replaced after 88 minutes, but his contribution didn’t stop there. He was seen yelling instructions to his team-mates from the touchline, as Arsenal hung on to secure a 2-1 win. It’s no wonder Jesus was added to the side’s leadership group, alongside captain Martin Ødegaard & Granit Xhaka.Zinchenko, on the other hand, has added flair & technical security on the ball, as well as the all important competition for Kieran Tierney, but it’s his leadership that has caught my eye. Zinchenko is said to have failed a late fitness test before Arsenal’s match against Fulham last month, but that didn’t stop him being on the bench to support his team-mates. The Ukrainian was a prominent figure during celebrations for Gabriel’s winning goal, with a steward even mistaking him for a pitch invader. Zinchenko was then seen arguing with the fourth official about a decision against his side in the remaining minutes of the comeback win, showing he’s just as passionate off the pitch, as he is on it.Jesus & Zinchenko’s leadership qualities have been very evident in this young Arsenal squad already & have raised the level of the entire squad without a doubt. If Arsenal are to achieve anything this season, you really feel both players will be pivotal to any success.
