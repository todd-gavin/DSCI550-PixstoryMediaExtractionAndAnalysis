TALKING TACTICS Why Arsenal are TOP of the Premier League Please like and retweet so more Gooners can see only managers in Premier League history have won the opening five games of their league campaign Perhaps the most obvious tweak Mikel Arteta has made this year is to Arsenal s on ball first and second phase or in possession structure before the final third This change has facilitated much of Arsenal s newfound control and therefore consistency in results Clearly it s never quite as simple or symmetrical as these diagrams show in an actual game as our positional play means players interchange up and down in and out consistently but it s moved from what could roughly be described as more of a last season into something more like a this season with Zinchenko and White tucking in to form almost a midfield at times when they ve been available Zinchenko sits tightly on Xhaka and White stands in a triangle with degaard and Saka both closer to the centre of the team than a traditional full back with neither attempting to join the front line as a fifth forward in the outside lane in the way that Kieran Tierney might Owing to their comfortability in possession and ability on the ball Zinchenko and White can sit narrowly either side of Partey as almost auxiliary midfielders allowing the game to be stretched ahead of them by the forward players
