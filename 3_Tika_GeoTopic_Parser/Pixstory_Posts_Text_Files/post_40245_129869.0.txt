While her third wife Melania is thought to be worth an amazing $50 million in her own right, her husband Donald Trump is thought to have a whopping $3 billion in wealth. But how did she make her money before she became president, and how does she make money even now? 

MSN reported that perhaps taking a cue from her business-minded husband, Melania debuted her own line of jewellery in 2010 but it plummeted!

Therefore, her modelling days came to her rescue!

It was reported that even though Melania's days as a model are behind her, the money she makes from being in front of the camera is still enormous. In 2017, it came to light that she received royalties from vintage images owned by Getty Images ranging from $100,000 to $1,000,000. 

With the image distributor, Melania has a lucrative licencing agreement that gives her access to nearly 200 photos taken by Belgian photographer Régine Mahaux years before the Trumps took office. 

The images that Melania receives payment for can only be used for "positive" press, according to sources.

Also, let us not forget the lawsuit!

After a report about her being an escort during her modelling career was published in the UK's Daily Mail before the 2016 US elections, Melania sued the newspaper's proprietors in 2017. She prevailed in the lawsuit, which was heard in London's High Court, and the newspaper later apologised and retracted the statement. 

Melania was suing the Daily Mail for a whopping $150 million in damages. Although the amount she took has never been made public, sources claim she ultimately walked away with just under $3 million, which included legal fees and damages.

Well, I don’t know about you, but above all adds to a comfortable amount to live the rest of her life in luxury!
