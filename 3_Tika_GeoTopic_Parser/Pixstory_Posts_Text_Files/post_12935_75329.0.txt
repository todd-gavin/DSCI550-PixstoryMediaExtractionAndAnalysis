Malaika Arora spoke about her divorce with Arbaaz Khan and mentioned it as her lowest phase. 

Adding to which she said ‘I can't be like that because like I said, my decision was going to impact all the lives around me. When I say mine, at the end of the day, we were two people. As a couple, as husband and wife, we together decided that this was what was best. But yes, it was definitely the most difficult, the lowest phase in my life where I probably did turn to a lot of aspects, like yoga, meditation, because I felt that these were outlets that would help me channelise better, that would help me sort whatever upheaval that I was dealing with internally.”
