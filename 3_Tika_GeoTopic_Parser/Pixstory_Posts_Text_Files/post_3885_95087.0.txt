After two years of being expected to mask up, the mandate in my city had only just been lifted. It’s a different matter, though, that it’s probably about to be reinstated.

Whether or not the mask mandate stays, I think I will prefer to wear a mask in public more often than not. 

For three reasons, primarily. 

Firstly, it offers me an incredibly freeing sense of anonymity. It’s almost as if it allows me to walk around and exist in public spaces without being seen. 
Secondly, it enables me to step out of the house with little concern for my appearance. 
And, thirdly, the mask is always a wonderful reassurance to the hypochondriac that is me. 

So, in the absence of the mask mandate, what’s your preference — mask or no mask?
