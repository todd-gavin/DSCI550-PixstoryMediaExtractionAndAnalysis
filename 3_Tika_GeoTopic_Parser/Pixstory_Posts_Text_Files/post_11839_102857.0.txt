You know the women I’m talking about — the ones who turn heads as they walk gracefully and boldly in a room . They might not be the prettiest , thinness , or even most successful , but they have this positive energy and aura that either makes you want to be around them or get intimidated by them . They seem comfortable in their skin and very unfazed . ✨💪

A self-assured woman takes control and accountability for her life . She's very intentional with where she invests her time and energy . She might not have her life altogether yet , but she has a clear vision of what she wants out of life , and sets smart realistic goals and takes action to achieve them . 💪
