Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a 15-week abortion ban into law. This is what he had to say according to pbs.org, "This will represent the most significant protections for life that have been enacted in this state in a generation."
This bill is indeed a blow to abortion access in other states. 

The law is expected to take into effect on July 1, including exceptions if the abortion is necessary to save a mother's life, prevent serious injury or if the fetus has a fatal abnormality. It does not allow for exemptions in cases where pregnancies were caused by rape, incest or human trafficking, despite several Democratic attempts to modify the bill. 
This is unacceptable as I believe it would be the choice of a woman! Nobody should have a say in this other than her! It's her body! 

After the U.S. Supreme Court motioned it would uphold a Mississippi law banning abortions after 15 weeks the Republicans hadn't rested. The high court's decision, expected this summer, could potentially weaken or overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established a nationwide right to abortion according to pbs.org.

If Roe v/s Wade is overturned 26 states are likely to ban abortion and this could lead to further more protest!
