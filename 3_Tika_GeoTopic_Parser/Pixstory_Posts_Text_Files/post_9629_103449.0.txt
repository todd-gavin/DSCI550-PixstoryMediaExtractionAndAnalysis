While credit must be given to decision makers at the time for avoiding any further escalation, the long term consequences for the stability of Afghanistan and India-Pakistan relations would be enormous. The immediate effect of the 7 June 2002 compact started being felt in Afghanistan by 2005, where by this time the Taliban had well and truly regrouped. The base where they were trained, sustained and sent into Afghanistan was in Pakistan which persisted in denying any involvement. 

However, most NATO and ISAF intelligence agencies had concluded by this time that Pakistan was a “principal recruiting ground and logistical centre for global terrorists.”

Reviewing just one source of reportage—in this case The New York Times—from the period of 2003 to 2008 shows the increasingly negative reportage of Pakistan in the US press.
