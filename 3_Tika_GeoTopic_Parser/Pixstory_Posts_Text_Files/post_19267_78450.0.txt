A transfer window deadline is always something a football fan looks forward to. Especially when there are supposed to be incomings to strengthen your squad going forward into the season. A winter window doesn't fancy a deadline day as hectic as the summer transfer window, but this term we were in for something weird and you all must have witnessed it. More probable if you're a Manchester United fan.
United focused more on the outgoings (all on loan) as it was more sensible due to no permanent manager at the helm. On the last day, the Dutch international in Donny van de Beek who spent most days as a substitute for his parent club found a way to move away for proper game time. Two English clubs in Crystal Palace and Everton were his most likely destination, the former being the front runner in the early days of the window. 
A managerial change at the Merseyside club and Donny had a situation to deal with. Frank Lampard (new Everton manager) was keen and wanted to seal Donny's signature as his first move for the Toffees. Donny van de Beek signed on loan until the end of the season for Everton with no option to buy, as the decision would be made by the then new Manchester United manager.
This move has come as a blessing in disguise for a midfielder as good as Donny who can finally showcase his talent and thrive in the English league. A move where he can hopefully prove his abilities in the game and one can only wish for the player to succeed after watching how professional he has been throughout and come back to Manchester as one of the main men for the club.
