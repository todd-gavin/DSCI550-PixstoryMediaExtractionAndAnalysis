 Your adornment must not be merely external braiding the hair and wearing gold jewelry or putting on dresses but let it be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit which is precious in the sight of God Peter Beauty is not for the world but for Christ God does not care about our appearances in the end what matters is our heart Diet culture takes people away from God It makes them indulge in self hate and how can we hate ourselves when we were so lovingly carved by the Lord himself Instead of looking thin or curvy we must teach our kids to be merciful beings for who is merciful to others God is merciful to him Outer beauty fades inner beauty sustains No matter how fat how skinny how tall or short a person is God will love him as he is So we should rather focus on our deeds to attain God and not the approval of the society
