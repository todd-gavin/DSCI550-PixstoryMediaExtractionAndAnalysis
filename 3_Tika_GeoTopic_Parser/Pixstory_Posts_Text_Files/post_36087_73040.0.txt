All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. 
Being L,G,B or T is not a ‘problem’, nor is it a ‘choice’ as such. LGBT individuals are simply individuals who have sexual preferences that differ from what would appear to be the ‘norm’, due to differing learned behaviours. Saying that it’s objectively wrong for people to have sexual preferences that differ from the norm is objectively wrong itself.
We should promote the values of tolerance and respect for diversity, and to build a world where no one has to be afraid because of their sexual orientation and gender identity.
