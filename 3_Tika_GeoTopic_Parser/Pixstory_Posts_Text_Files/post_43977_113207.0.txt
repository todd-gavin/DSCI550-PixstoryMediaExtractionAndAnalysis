Franck Kessie, a former midfielder for AC Milan, has officially been signed by Barcelona on a free transfer. Over the past three years, Kessie established himself as one of the best midfielders in Italy. In 2019, he permanently transferred from Atalanta to Milan, elevating his performance to a new level. The 25-year-future old's had been the subject of much speculation as he neared the end of his contract at San Siro, but Barca has finally won the race to sign him.

On December 19, 1996, in the Ivory Coast city of Ouragahio, Franck Kessie was born. The midfielder began his professional career in his native country at Stella Club d'Adjame before relocating to Italy in 2014 to join Atalanta.

Kessie began his career with the club's development levels in Bergamo, and he quickly made the transition to the professional level with a loan move to Serie B outfit Cesena. The Ivorian made his Serie A debut in midfield and played centre back for the Emilia Romagna club, impressing new Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini enough to lure him back to Bergamo.

Kessie has since developed into an essential first team player.

After a great 2016–17 year with Atalanta, Kessie caught the eye of Serie A powerhouses AC Milan. The midfielder joined the rossoneri in 2017 on a loan deal, and in the summer of 2019, Milan paid 33 million euros to make the deal permanent.

Kessie proved to be a complete midfielder over his five seasons with AC Milan, scoring goals, dishing out assists, and putting in a lot of defensive effort. His career at Milan came to a successful conclusion as the Ivory Coast international led the team to its first Serie A championship in 11 seasons in 2021–2022.
