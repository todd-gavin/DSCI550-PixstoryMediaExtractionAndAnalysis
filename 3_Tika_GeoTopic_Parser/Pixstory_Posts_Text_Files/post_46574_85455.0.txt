According to Variety, an I Am Legend sequel is in the works, with Oscar nominee Will Smith (King Richard) and Emmy nominee Michael B. Jordan (Black Panther) set to star in and produce the film for Warner Bros. Oscar winner Akiva Goldsman (A Beautiful Mind), who adapted I Am Legend from Richard Matheson's 1954 novel in 2007, will write the screenplay for the sequel. 

Weed Road Pictures, which is run by Goldsman and Greg Lassans, will produce the film. The plot of the I Am Legend sequel is being kept under wraps at the moment. The film has yet to find a director (via Deadline). 

Through their Outlier Society company, Jordan and Elizabeth Raposo will produce, while Smith and Westbrook Studios Co-President and Head of Motion Pictures will co-produce.

Coming Soon reported that I Am Legend takes place years after a plague kills most of humanity and transforms the rest into monsters, with a sole survivor — who is immune to the virus — in New York City struggling to find a cure. Directed by Francis Lawrence, the movie also starred Alice Braga, Charlie Tahan, and Dash Mihok. The movie earned over $585 million at the worldwide box office.
