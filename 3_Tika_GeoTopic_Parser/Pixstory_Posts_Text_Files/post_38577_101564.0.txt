This season Ronaldo has made a total of 1600 passes, out of which 718 passes were successful. He had 24 key passes to his name, out of which he has created 7 big chances for himself and his teammates. 


Past managers such as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick had revolved the team around him. Ronaldo had received 218 progressive passes from his teammates. 

Ronaldo had made a total of 1184 touches, with the majority of it coming in attacking third and the six yards box with 549 and 591 respectively. 


Cristiano being a striker had to cover back to help his teammates. Even though he prefers staying upfront, under Ole and Ralf, Cristiano had to track back very often. It is seen by his 91 percentile in goal-line clearances, and he ranks 99 percentile in tackling defenders. He is good in Aerial duels as he had 43.2% of them and also scored from the air. 



Darwin Nunez 


The Uruguayan is another high profile player being linked with Man Utd. Known for playing as a centre-forward, this season he has scored 26 goals in 28 matches. His actions are mostly down the left-wing but it can’t be classified as a left-winger movement, nor are they central enough to confirm, that he is a proper centre-forward. With Cavani departing this summer, expect Ten Hag to go after him. Ten Hag is known to have a keen interest in Uruguayan.

Christopher Nkunku


The man from the same suburb as Paul Pogba is being linked with Manchester United. He is an attacking midfielder, left winger, right-winger, second striker and even a centre forward. He is known for creating an insane amount of goal creating chances. He has an insane amount of assists in the Bundesliga with 13 assists and 20 goals to his name. Ralf Rangnick is a keen admirer of him and would persuade ETH to get him.

Even Though RB Leipzig has denied selling him, United will try their best to get their man.
