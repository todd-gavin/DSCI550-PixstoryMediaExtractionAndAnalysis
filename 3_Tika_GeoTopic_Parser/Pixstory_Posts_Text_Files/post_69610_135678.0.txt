Jharokha Mughal Garden is located in a village named Bijbehara on the banks of River Jhelum. The garden was named after Dara Shikoh, the son of Shah Jahan. Chinar trees are the main attraction of the garden. It is located on the rocky north eastern bank of the most romantic and solitary Manasbal Lake. Most likely, the name is a misspelling of "Daroga Bagh," also known as "Lalla Rookh's Garden." The Empress Noar Jahan commissioned the construction of this palace. The garden, which was formerly in ruins, boasts a mesmerising view of the lake and its tranquil surroundings. This 3.5 hectare site is a charming and tranquil setting for absorbing in the beauty of nature and historic ruins. Oozing with utmost beauty and greenery, the gardens made by Mughals in Kashmir make a magnificent picture worth capturing. Nestled with splendor, these gardens are an example of striking Mughal style architecture. The garden is known for its scenic beauty and magnificence.
