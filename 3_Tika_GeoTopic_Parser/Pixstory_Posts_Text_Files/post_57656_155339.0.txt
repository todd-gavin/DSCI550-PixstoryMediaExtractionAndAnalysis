We all have a fear of failure because to fail is to fall. So that's how everyone thinks of it.
But it is quite genuine to be sceptical of not succeeding when putting in so much effort.
The problem occurs when this fear is turned into a phobia.
The fear of failure sometimes referred to as atychiphobia, is an irrational and persistent fear of failing. Sometimes this fear might emerge in response to a specific situation. In other cases, it might be related to another mental health condition, such as anxiety or depression.
The fear of failure may also be related to being a perfectionist. Because perfectionists have such high expectations for how they expect things to turn out, they may experience a nagging fear that they won't live up to those often unrealistically high standards.
It may cause you to put off or avoid any activity or scenario with the potential for an unsuccessful outcome. Someone with this condition may be scared to try new things, take risks or embrace growth for fear of failure.
