Let me take a storll,
Through my feelings of love,
My deepest desires,
They lie in the darkness,
Of my despair-ridden heart,
Still an uncharted territory to me.

These dark alleyways,
Something new to feel everyday,
My anxious self,
My veins make me feel her presence,
Even before she's by me,
She's the only presence of Light in my life.

Why wouldn't I chase,
Someone so radiant as her,
But how do I expect her,
To be with someone like me,
I prefer these dark quiet scenarios,
Whereas she's the antonym of me.

My life so monotonous,
Rather only dark,
Sorrow my eternal friend,
Melancholy beside me at every step,
One glance from her,
Makes me forget all my woes.

She's the flicker of Light,
I've always prayed for,
I'm just a little moth,
In the night's darkness,
Trying to chase the only Light I know,
Even if it leads me to death,

Death may be complete blindness,
It's better than having my sight,
And not being able to see her,
I may be blinded by the light of her reflection,
Till the moment her eyes light mine,
Into the new dreams of her universe.

Someday she may ask,
How I first saw her?
It was just another day of dejection,
Shadows of misery were all around,
Suddenly these eyes caught a sparkle,
So scintillating that my eyes couldn't get a glimpse,

After all these years in the night,
For the first time I see hope,
Even if the Light tries fade away,
Even if she isn't in my destiny,
She'll always be special,
For she's the Light my dark eyes search for.
