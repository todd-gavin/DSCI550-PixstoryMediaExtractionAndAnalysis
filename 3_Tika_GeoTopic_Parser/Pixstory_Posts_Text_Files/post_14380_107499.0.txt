2021-22 Champions League winner Luka Modric has tipped Argentina as the favourites to win the the World Cup later this year in Qatar. 

Calling the La Albiceleste a ‘strong group’ with Leo Messi as their captain, the Croatian said "We played against Argentina in the last World Cup and we won. What I see now is a very good team, it seems to me stronger than a few years ago. They have a good group, they created a very strong group with Messi at the head, who is a different player.”

“They are more united. They haven't lost many games. That says a lot. Having Messi, they are always one of the favorites to win the World Cup,” Modric added. 

Argentina recently won the Finalissima after defeating Italy at Wembley and are unbeaten in their last 33 games in all competitions. The Copa America champions lost 3-0 to Croatia at the last world cup - which took place in Russia.

Argentina have been drawn against Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Poland in group C and will kick start their campaign on November 22.

What are you thoughts on this? 

Are Argentina the favourites to win the World Cup? The South American team looks really strong as a team and with a couple of titles and unbeaten streak, the group seems to be motivated to ‘win the World Cup for Leo Messi’.
