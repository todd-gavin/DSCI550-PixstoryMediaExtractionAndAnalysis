 Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it every time I watch The Shawshank Redemption golden quotes from the clean script lure me Especially in Red s rugged voice It can t be any more precise to express those behind bars You spend the whole movie with the inmates of Shawshank prison So is it a prison story Or is it about the camaraderie between Red and Andy Then can you skip fights and corruption in there What about the perseverance of Andy to create the best possible library in Shawshank How hope is treated as the best word in our lives Andy Dufresne Tim Robbins was pronounced as a particularly remorseless and icy man by the judge after issuing two life terms His cold attitude continues in prison Red Morgan Freeman the man who can get things done develops an instant likeness towards the new kid on the prison block It s beautiful to watch their bonding grow Like any in Shawshank prison Andy claims to be innocent but Red jokes he is the only guilty man in there His redemption sessions prove how hopeless is a prisoner s hope to get out As he puts in our whole life is consumed by walls Director Frank Darabont skilfully avoids flashbacks and focuses on how a connected body of people can make a chained life interesting Brooks the oldie librarian is a proof though he brings in some sentiments to endorse it You would be moved by the narration when the script follows his last days When the paroled Red ends up in the same store also an unknown pain creeps into our hearts Another fascinating lead is time in the movie Like the inmates say it just passes in the wink of an eye even for us with each star in the poster change No overdo in looks of prisoners and no dramatic scenes occur in dark room or escape Even the money laundering runs discreetly We fail to hate the gentle evil warden Bob Gunton despite a twist A surprisingly gentle gripping narration tops charts since
