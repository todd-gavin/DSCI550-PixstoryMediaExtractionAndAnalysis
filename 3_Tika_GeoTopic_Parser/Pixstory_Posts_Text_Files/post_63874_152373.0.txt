With the coming of the ‘Adipurush’ teaser trailer, the only question that comes to mind is “Why?” The amount of things done wrong in this teaser is laughable and it is hard to put it all together so dissecting it one by one is better. 
First the VFX, with a Rs.500 crore budget, this is an exorbitant wastage of money given the end result. If director Om Raut was out to make a PS3 game then he is ten years too late because PS5 is already in the market.
Compared frame by frame it is painfully obvious just how CGI dependent this movie is going to be, and that is going to be one of this film’s biggest downfalls.
 Most designs are off proportion and just feel sketchy, citing just pure laziness. The environment feels dull, drab and pre-rendered and the tone just feels very disinterested, though the ending song is really good. 
When you have ‘RRR’, ‘Ponniyin Selvan’ and even ‘Brahmastra’ type VFX to show for, then this level of misfire is indeed a shame. It is very much possible that this teaser was pre-production footage which was released unfinished in haste, hopefully that is not wishful thinking. 
Then comes in the cast, Prabhas is a good actor though he is too old to play Lord Ram if anything he looks more like Ravan while ironically Saif Ali Khan who plays Ravan looks more like a discount Islamic tyrant not having even one percent of the grace and aura of the wise and erudite man that Ravan was.
 Plus Ravan riding a chicken dragon bird instead of the Pushpaka Vimana in the name of creative liberty is just stupid. To add to it, Lord Hanuman looks like a mullah and Lakshman looks like a hipster while Kriti Sanon just does not have the presence of Sita.
We already have two incredible examples of Ramayana done just right, whether it is Ramanand Sagar’s 1987 live action series or the 1993 anime film Ramayana: The Legend of Prince Ram, the makers of ‘Adipurush’ ought to rewatch these masterpieces to gather just how to adapt such a timeless classic.
