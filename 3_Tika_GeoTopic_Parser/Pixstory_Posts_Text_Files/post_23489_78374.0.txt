Even though Kovalam beach in Kerala is very much close to my house, we rarely visit it. My parents yet again amused my sister-in-law by telling her the story about how I was there playing on the beach just one day before the Tsunami struck on the day of Christmas. 

‌This time I noticed many changes at the beach. It has become one of the most crowded beaches of all time and has the people scattered like petals of a flower. 

But the crowd was so thin that the introvert in me was celebrating. We saw the red Sun sinking into the sea. 

Even took some photos of the couple (brother and sister-in-law ). I saw kites hurling in the colourful sky which was a delightful experience after a long time. 

There were many shops lit up with beach dresses and home decor. Changes include parasailing and boating which were recently introduced. I might try those next time as parents are over-protective. Ah! I have to wait for the next time! We walked down the beachside to the lighthouse and then returned. There were many hotels with seafood and we were confused to choose and finally opted for Ustad Hotel, which is about nine minutes away in Vizhinjam. We ordered Seer Fish, Prawns, Kappa (Tapioca ) and Sulaimani Tea (Mint/Cardamom). The food was amazing and the sulaimani was overwhelming so I drank two glasses.

If you ever are planning to visit Kerala, do try out Kovalam consisting of Lighthouse beach, Hawah-Beach and Samudra Beach. 

It had the uranium content and hence has black sand which is very rare in India. Usually, Hawah-Beach is more crowded and I recommend Samudra Beach if you don't like crowds as it is the area for fishing. There are numerous beach resorts and home-stays but I would recommend KTDC by Samudra and Travancore Heritage. Kovalam is also near Vizhinjam Harbour. The place is also famous for ayurvedic treatments but be careful and don't fall into the wrong hands.
