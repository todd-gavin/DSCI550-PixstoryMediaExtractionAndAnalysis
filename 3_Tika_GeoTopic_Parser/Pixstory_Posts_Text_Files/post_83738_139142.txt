I spent the first part of my life in Bombay where I was born and raised before moving to Latur Latur is fantastic it has lovely incredibly helpful residents and it serves as a centre for education throughout south eastern Maharashtra However I wish there was a little bit more diversity in the food in Latur Yes we have nice food but there is so little variation that I get tired of eating the same thing People who have lived their entire lives may not feel the same way as I do because I grew up in Bombay and am accustomed to seeing and enjoying a tremendous amount of variety at a reasonable price It s not like some people haven t tried to change it by opening new restaurants that serve a variety of different dishes and delicacies but to my surprise I learned that they were rapidly losing business despite the fact that the food was excellent and that I was one of their few regular customers I was initially shocked to hear that but as it repeated itself with other eateries that began offering a variety of foods I began to notice a pattern People in this area have very finicky taste buds and don t enjoy trying new foods It would greatly improve Latur if that changed and the variety of cuisine increased here
