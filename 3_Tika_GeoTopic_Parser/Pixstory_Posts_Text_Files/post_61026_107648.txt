From reading children s novels to being engrossed in financial books my life revolves around books I believe I got this habit of reading from my dad His massive collection of books stacked in the black cupboard made me wish I had a cupboard filled with books in a coordinated color pattern Books are the reasons for my wild imagination a creative escape from reality and the million fantasies built in my head Such content can be found on the internet However one usually gets lost in the world of searches Besides there is a whole different irreplaceable feeling of holding a hard covered book feeling the pages with your fingertips as you run it across the sentences Through books I can gather wisdom and apply that learning to my situations Books have really impacted my life Do share what kind of books you like and if there was any book that changed your life
