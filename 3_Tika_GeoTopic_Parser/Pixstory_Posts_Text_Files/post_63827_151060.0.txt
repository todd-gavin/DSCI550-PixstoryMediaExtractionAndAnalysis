 Based on initial impressions, it seems that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is building itself up to be the biggest name in the series. 
The Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II beta concluded on September 26 and was perhaps the biggest beta recorded in the history of Call Of Duty with the largest group of players and most hours recorded, alongside the most number of matches played across PlayStation® 4 and 5, Xbox One and Series X|S, and PC platforms combined.
After the beta testing, Infinity Ward acknowledged player feedback and stated it will look into making changes accordingly for the full release on October 28. 
Infinity Ward’s blogpost touched on three primary changes it's looking for solutions to: balancing enemy and friendly footstep audio, better visual tracking of enemies, and creating disbanding lobbies.
Other adjustments include weapon tuning changes, and more tweaks and fixes for the Battle map modes Ground War and Invasion. 
The development team also went on to state their satisfaction with the player interest around the Third-Person playlist while making further refinements to it alongside other features before the final release.
Available across PS4, PS5, Xbox and PC, Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare II releases on October 28, but players who pre-order the game can obtain early access to it and start the campaign as early as October 20.
