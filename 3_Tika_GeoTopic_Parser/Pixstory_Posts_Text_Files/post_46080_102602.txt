The recent Texas shooting massacre has taught us one thing All Lives Matter equally In a time where literal children are being killed and they need us to be their advocates are we really going to focus only a single section of the society I am not saying that black lives don t matter I am just saying that all lives matter equally and we should fight for them all Fortunately Black people are a represented section of the society they have a voice But what about the others who are oppressed How will they feel when they see us fighting only for a certain section just because of their skin colour These are some of the questions we need to ask ourselves And I am not the only one who thinks this Several notable individuals have supported All Lives Matter United States Republican Senator Tim Scott has used the term when calling for racial equality and unity Moreover as per reports In American football player Richard Sherman supported the All Lives Matter message saying I stand by what I said that All Lives Matter and that we are human beings He wanted African Americans to be treated like human beings and did not want innocent police officers being killed If we are fighting for equality we have to make sure that we are fighting equally too for ALL LIVES
