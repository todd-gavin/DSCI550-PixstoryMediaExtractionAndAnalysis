My ended really nice It was cheerful I was happy and healthy and wasn t one bit worried about the spreading virus Because Covid felt like an integral part of normal life the new normal where you know you can t go outside without masks and you ve to be aware about your surroundings all the freaking time and not forget your sanitiser ever I had this spreadsheet of plans things to do in the first week of January but who knew Covid was making its own plans too I got slight itching in my throat on the third day of January and by th I had developed a strong cold I didn t really think it was Covid and basically dismissed it as a winters cold but by evening I had body ache and my throat was swollen so bad that I was unable to utter anything My brother told us to get our rtpcr tests done because he d received news that someone in his grade had been tested positive and he s attended a th grade farewell party with that person That was the alarm bell because his health wasn t at its best too he had fever a day before and my mom was also suffering from similar symptoms as me so for the next day early in the morning we d booked a Covid test at home It obviously came back with detected virus result and hence we all were positive I had caught the virus fully vaccinated It was mild like people said I didn t have any breathing problems but it could also be mild because I had already been vaccinated and so my white blood cells kind of had an idea that we gotta fight this virus Hence I completely disagree with people who are saying Omicron isn t deadly It is dangerous I had the worst cough ever It was really bad that I couldn t sleep at night My stomach and head were aching as well they still ache infrequently even after recovering from omicron The first half of January felt like a blur All I remember is coughing really hard all throughout night and my chest aching because of it So yeah don t take Omicron lightly take precautions and stay healthy
