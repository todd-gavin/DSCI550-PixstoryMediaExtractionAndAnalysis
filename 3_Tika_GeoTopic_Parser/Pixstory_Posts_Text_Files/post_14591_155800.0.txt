ðŸ‘‰It Hurts Your Heart
Scientists first noticed something was up in a study that compared two similar groups: transit drivers, who sit most of the day, and conductors or guards, who donâ€™t. Though their diets and lifestyles were a lot alike, those that sat were about twice as likely to get heart disease as those that stood.
ðŸ‘‰It Can Shorten Your Life.
Youâ€™re more likely to die earlier from any cause if you sit for long stretches at a time. It doesnâ€™t help if you exercise every day or not. 
ðŸ‘‰Dementia Is More Likely.
If you sit too much, your brain could look just like that of someone with dementia. Sitting also raises your risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol, which all play a role in the condition.
ðŸ‘‰Youâ€™ll Undo All That Exercise.
Even if you work out 7 hours a week -- far more than the suggested 2-3 hours -- you canâ€™t reverse the effects of sitting 7 hours at a time. Donâ€™t throw away all that hard work at the gym by hitting the couch for the rest of the day. Keep moving!
ðŸ‘‰Youâ€™ll Gain Weight.
Watch a lot of TV? Surf the web for hours on end? Youâ€™re more likely to be overweight or obese. If you exercise every day, thatâ€™s good, but it wonâ€™t make a huge dent in extra weight you gain as a result of too much screen time
ðŸ‘‰Your Anxiety Might Spike.
It could be that youâ€™re often by yourself and engaged in a screen-based activity. If this disrupts your sleep, you can get even more anxious.
