Bankim Chandra Chatterjee is a key figure in Indian literature Although he was a writer of verse prose and even essays it is his prose writings that make him a key figure in Indian English literature Additionally he was the first Indian writer in English to explore feminist theme in his writings Case in point is his novel Rajmohan s Wife This has become one of my favourite novels This is an imperative novel in the repertoire of Indian literature not only because it is the first novel in English by an Indian but also because it explores feminist themes In the novel we see how the female protagonist Matangini enters a man s world and meddles in non domestic affairs To portray a woman in the nineteenth century venturing into the world outside the threshold of the domestic space was a pioneering move In an era where women characters in fiction were exemplified for obedience and loyalty to men Chatterjee s Matangini actively embraces her identity as an individual and even goes against her husband Talking about his writing style in the novel people often write it off his style as too simple but in my opinion that is one of the best things about this novel He conveys the plot events and the inner workings of the characters without being too verbose If one reads this novel it will become evident that although he belonged to the elite educated class his writing was for the middle class too
