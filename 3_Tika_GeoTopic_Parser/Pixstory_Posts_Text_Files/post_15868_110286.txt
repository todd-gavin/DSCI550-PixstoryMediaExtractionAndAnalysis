Objectives Risk assessment models for cardiac surgery do not account for degrees of liver dysfunction Ultrasound shear wave elastography measures liver stiffness LSM a quantitative measurement related to fibrosis congestion and inflammation We hypothesized that preoperative liver stiffness would be associated with hospital length of stay after cardiac surgery Design Prospective observational study Setting University Hospital Single Center Participants adult patients undergoing non emergent cardiac surgery Interventions Preoperative liver stiffness measured by ultrasound elastography Measurements and Main Results Associations were analyzed using linear mixed models with adjustments for preoperative variables duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and type of surgery Median liver stiffness was kilopascals kPa range kPa The median length of hospital stay was days range of days Each unit increase in liver stiffness treated as a continuous variable was associated with an increase of days in hospital p When treated as a categorical variable kPa kPa and kPa LSM kPa vs LSM kPa was strongly associated with an increase in hospital length of stay of days p Conclusions A preoperative LSM kPa was associated with a significantly longer postoperative hospital length of stay This association appears independent of preoperative comorbidities commonly associated with coronary disease Preoperative liver stiffness is a novel risk metric that is associated with postoperative hospital length Sources
