Potassium is "essential in generating muscle contractions and regulating heartbeat," It plays a significant role in energy metabolism. It helps the body build proteins from amino acids and metabolise carbohydrates for energy. Potassium helps your body convert glucose (sugar) into glycogen, which is then stored in the liver to have fuel to walk, run or do whatever else you need to do.


Every movement your body makes and any thoughts you have are made possible by potassium, helping cells communicate with one another.

In particular, taking inadequate potassium levels is critical to keeping your heart functioning properly. The heart is essentially just one large muscle, so adequate potassium levels are essential for keeping the heart functioning properly.
Interestingly, a potassium-rich diet is linked to many powerful health benefits. For example, it may help reduce blood pressure and water retention, protect against stroke and help prevent osteoporosis and kidney stones.

The National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements reports that adults aged 19 and older should consume 4,700 milligrams of potassium daily. (For reference, a medium-sized banana contains about 400 mg of potassium.) Breastfeeding women should seek 5,100 mg daily, while children under age 13 needless, ranging from 400 mg during their first six months up to 4,500 mg daily between 9 and 13.
