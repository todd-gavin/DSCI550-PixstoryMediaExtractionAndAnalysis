We ve known since early on in the pandemic that COVID reinfections could occur One of the first reinfections reported was in a year old man from Hong Kong His initial infection was diagnosed on March with his second infection with a genetically distinct virus being diagnosed days later Since then reports of reinfection have become common especially since the emergence of the omicron variant Early research from South Africa still in preprint so awaiting review by other scientists suggests that the risk of reinfection increased quickly and substantially after the variant arrived So why are reinfections increasing The simple answer is because our immunity is often no longer sufficient to prevent an infection This can be due to the appearance of a new viral variant like omicron that because of mutations to its form is less recognisable to the immune system meaning the virus bypasses prior immunity Or it can be because immunity has waned since we were last infected or vaccinated We know that this is a particular issue with COVID immunity hence the need for vaccine boosters Plus as I have discussed previously the coronavirus almost always enters the human body via the nose and throat Immunity in the mucosal linings of these areas tends to be relatively short lived compared to systemic immunity throughout the body This may explain why protection against severe illness usually rooted in the lungs lasts longer than protection against infection How common are reinfections The UK has recently started publishing data on reinfections on its COVID dashboard It classifies a reinfection as someone receiving a new positive COVID test result more than days after their last infection Up to February there had been over million primary infections and around reinfections in England so one reinfection for every primary infections Over of all reinfections have been reported in since December suggesting again that the risk of reinfection has increased substantially with omicron Read full story at The Conversation Image courtesy
