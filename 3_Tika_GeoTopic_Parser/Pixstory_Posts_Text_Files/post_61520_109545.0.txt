Transgender: We need to understand the difference between sex and gender right. So sex is a very medical and biological term which looks at genitalia, organs, chromosomes, physiological functions and so on. When it comes to gender, it's about self-determination -- who you think you are. We need to understand the difference between an intersex person and a transgender person. So people who are not 'classified' in binaries of male and female, are put into a broader category of intersex persons. All transgender people are not intersex and all intersex people are not transgender. There might be intersex people who are transgender and transgender people who are intersex, but these are not mutually exclusive terms.

As Vqueeram talked about the diversity within the trans community -- all transgender persons are not from the Hijra or Kinnar community. In fact, not all persons from the Hijra community are transgender. Majority are trans women, but not all.

In response, Vikramaditya Sahai:
It is really important -- especially when you are reporting on communities that are not fluent in English -- that you do actually spend the time to understand how they identify, and to not just pick up a term picked up from someone else. You have to spend some time figuring it out, because it is important to them. It may not be important to your readers, but it is important to the person you are speaking to, on how they identify. One person may identify as more than one -- you can be both Jogappa and a trans woman.
