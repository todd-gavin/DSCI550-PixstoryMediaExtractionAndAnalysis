Even though I have been living here for the past few years But this is the first time I can see Mazar Sharif melon here Today was a very good day for me Everywhere I went fresh and tasty Afghani fruits were pleasing to the my eye The Mazari melon season was one of the best fruit seasons in Afghanistan for me the sweetness makes the mouth water more with every tasteToday was the end of a great day My homeland if I am a few farsakhs away from you I love you with all my I am proud I have endless heat behind me I will fight for your freedom with all the hardships and problems that are put in our way
