James Arthur Baldwin was a prolific  American writer and activist. His writing transversed various mediums, including essays, novels, plays, and poems. His first novel, Go Tell It on the Mountain, was published in 1953; decades later, Time magazine included the novel on its list of the 100 best English-language novels released from 1923 to 2005.

Baldwin's work talked about many socially relevant themes. It fictionalizes basic personal questions and dilemmas amid deep social and psychological pressures. 

Themes of masculinity, sexuality, race and class intertwine to establish intricate narratives that run parallel with some of the major political movements toward social change in mid-twentieth-century America, such as the civil rights movement and the gay liberation movement. 

Baldwin's protagonists are often but not exclusively African American, and gay and bisexual men often feature prominently in his literature. 

In all of Baldwin's works, but extremely in his novels, the main characters are twined up in a "cage of reality" that sees them battling for their soul against the constraints of the human condition or their place at the latitudes of a society consumed by several prejudices.

These characters often face inner and external obstacles in their exploration for social and self-acceptance. 

Baldwin is a true literary stylist—sharp, enigmatic, witty, and brutally honest. He writes like the best jazz-music moves: rhythmic, elegant but angular, with some spellbinding staccato. 

Critics acclaimed Baldwin for both his style and his themes. “Baldwin has carved a literary niche through his exploration of ‘the mystery of the human being’ in his art,” observed Louis H. Pratt in James Baldwin.

Some of his major books are: Giovanni's Room,The Fire Next Time and Go Tell It on the Mountain.
