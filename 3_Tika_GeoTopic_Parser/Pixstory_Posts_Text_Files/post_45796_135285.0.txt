A spiral of solar systems 32 million light-years from Earth, the Phantom Galaxy is seen in stunning new photos from the Hubble and James Webb telescopes. 

According to the European Space Agency, which works with NASA on both the Hubble Telescope and the James Webb Telescope, the galaxy is situated in the constellation Pisces. 

As per CNN, the Phantom Galaxy, also referred as as M74, belongs to the class of spiral galaxies called "grand design spirals." 

This indicates that it has distinct spiral arms that can be seen spiralling outward from the centre in the most recent pictures.

It’s fascinating, isn’t it?
