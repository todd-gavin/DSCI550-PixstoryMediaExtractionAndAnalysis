Melbourne Victory vs Manchester United is slated to commence at 11.05am BST on Friday, July 15, 2022 at Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne.

The MUFC 2022–23 preseason got off to a winning start on Tuesday, July 13, when they defeated Liverpool 4-0 in Bangkok. As a result, they won the Bangkok Centenary Cup, the first trophy for new manager Erik ten Hag.

Summer purchase Tyrell Malacia replaced Luke Shaw in the second half and made his Red Devils debut.

Manchester United's opponents, Melbourne Victory, are the reigning runners-up in the previous season's A-League Men. Luis Nani, a longtime United fan favorite, just signed a two-year contract with the Australian squad.

Nani joined the Victory squad after players like Tomi Juric, Paul Izzo, and George Timotheou joined them during the summer transfer window.

Manchester United last visited Australia in 2019. The Red Devils defeated Perth Glory and Leeds United, winning both games 2-0. (4-0).

Melbourne Victory vs Manchester United: Prediction

With a win, Man United will undoubtedly face challenging opponents, which is precisely what Ten Hag needs at this point in preseason. But because of the stark disparity in skill between the two teams, we predict that the Red Devils will win again on Friday. 

Prediction: Melbourne Victory 1-4 Manchester United
