The Picture is Blur But My favourite Have you even seen sky more beautiful than this Like Trust me i can see this beautiful sky for hours without blinking eyes Whenever i see such beautiful Skies i feel like the clouds are speaking directly to my soul The sky inspires me in many ways It make me feel like dreams peace No limits Har Ek Ka Apna Sky Hota Hai What Colour Is Your Sky
