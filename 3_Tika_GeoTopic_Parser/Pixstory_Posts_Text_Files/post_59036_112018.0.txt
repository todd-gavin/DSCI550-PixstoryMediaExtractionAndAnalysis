A Twitter user posted a video to criticize the actor and had written in a tweet ( which is now deleted)“Madhavansplaining: This ActorMadhavan is spewing non-stop nonsense to promote his film and it is only getting more and more laughable with every passing day. Isn’t there any other way to promote his film than this?”

R Madhavan slam back at a Twitter user who trolled him for saying that only 25 lakh Indians are on Twitter in an interview.

Maddy (Madhavan)reacted by tweeting, “Easy bro.. you are a sportsman. I am exhausted sleep deprived .so said less than 25lakhs instead of 250 lakhs .. but the point was it still less that 1.7% of the population – which was my point .. why so much venom bro.. not good for your sport.”
