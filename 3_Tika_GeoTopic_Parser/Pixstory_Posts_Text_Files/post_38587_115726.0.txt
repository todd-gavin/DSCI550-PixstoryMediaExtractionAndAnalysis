Time has a way of proving itself” 


The same could be said for Marcus Rashford. When he burst onto the scene against Midtjylland. He scored two goals in that game, and two more in his next game against Arsenal. The future was bright for him. He was going to show the world why the Manchester-born and bred boy is going to awe the world for years to come. He was touted as the ‘golden’ boy.


At Euro 2020, England performed admirably, by beating tough teams to make it to the final against 2006 World Cup champions Italy led by Roberto Mancini. The game was beautifully poised at 1-1 and heading to a penalty shootout. Marcus Rashford botched up the spot-kick as Gianguli Donnarumma was able to parry it away, resulting in Italy winning the Euros. My assumption is that from then, it started affecting Marcus Rashford psychologically. 



In 25 matches he had played, he returned with 4 goals, which was very low by his standards. Under former boss Ole Gunnar Solskjær he scored 49 goals. He leads all the United players.

Ole assembled a winning team by acquiring Jadon Sancho, Raphael Varane, and the prodigal son Cristiano Ronaldo but that team failed to click leading them to finish in the 6th place which is out of the UEFA Champions League. 


With Ole axed, and interim manager and the grandfather of gegenpressing - Ralf Rangnick not able to steer the ship, he has been replaced with recently crowned Ajax champion Erik Ten Hag. Will Marcus Rashford, after a year of horror, be able to find his old form? 

2021

Injuries didn’t do him any favors. As he played fewer games due to injury and he looked devoid of confidence. He had a return of 4 goals. He had 1.93 shots per 90 which put him in the 44 percentile. He had 2 assists to his name. In 2022 against West Ham United the match looked to finish at 1-1 but in the 93rd minute, Man Utd counter-attacked, Edinson Cavani prodded Marcus who made 2-1 at the death. Everyone thought the old ice-cold Rashford was back.
