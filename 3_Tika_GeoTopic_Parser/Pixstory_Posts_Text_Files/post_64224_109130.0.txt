Most of us are aware about the free DTC bus facility available for women in Delhi. Many will support this move of Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. 
In my opinion, It is just like bribing people to ensure that he again wins the next Assembly elections. In reality, Residents of Delhi, like me, have to bear the bill for this freebie, in the long run to enable Kejriwal become CM again.
What the politicians do not understand is that they are elected to provide good governance, not to distribute freebies (as indirect bribes) to win elections.
Instead of distributing these free things, Enable people to earn more. Let people earn and pay for the services. Develop the nation. Create infrastructure. Create an enabling environment for new jobs. Govern well. Ensure the rule of law. And, much more, that is expected from a government.
