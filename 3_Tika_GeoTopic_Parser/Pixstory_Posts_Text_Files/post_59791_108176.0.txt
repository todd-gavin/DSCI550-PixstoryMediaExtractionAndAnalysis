Officials say at least two people were killed and seven others were injured in an attack on a gurdwara in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, on Saturday, following a blast in a car filled with explosives. There was no quick claim of guilt, though. According to a Taliban spokesman, assailants loaded explosives onto a car, but it detonated before reaching its intended target. The facility was being secured by Taliban authority, he claimed. "There were about 30 people inside the temple," said Gornam Singh, a gurdwara officer. "We have no idea how many of them are alive or dead."
