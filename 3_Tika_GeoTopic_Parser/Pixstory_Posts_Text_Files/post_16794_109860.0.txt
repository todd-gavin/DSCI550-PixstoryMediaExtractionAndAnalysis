The best thing about the Hindi film industry🎬is that the industry folks balance their professional and personal life seamlessly. 👤👤

Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone showed us their professional side when they signed Ayan Mukerji's film after their controversial breakup. 💔💔

But all's well that ends well as both the ex-flames are now happily married to their respective partners, Alia Bhatt and Ranveer Singh.❤️❤️

Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone are versatile actors, who share tremendous on-screen chemistry. Every time they come together, they manage to create magic. Fans would love to see this onscreen jodi in the films. ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
But, for that, fans will have to wait for some time. However, filmmaker, Punit Malhotra has managed to rope these actors for a project.
