Bollywood has been going through a lean phase in 2022. While some movies like Bhool Bhulaiyya 2, Jug Jug Jiyo, etc. performed well, the majority of other star films like Laal Singh Chaddha, Samrat Prithviraj, Attack, Raksha Bandhan, etc failed miserably. Bollywood Stars like Aamir Khan, Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn, and John Abraham all have faced massive failures.While Ranbir Kapoor’s Brahmastra opened brilliantly, it couldn’t sustain the momentum and become the absolute blockbuster it was expected to be. This is why Bollywood star Ajay Devgn is taking no chances for his upcoming film Drishyam 2. In order to register a solid opening, Drishyam 2 makers have decided to give 50% off on tickets on an opening day.https://twitter.com/taran_adarsh/status/1576453601777844224?s=46&t=NGxNpM5O3r3SrfVffiSlVQ
