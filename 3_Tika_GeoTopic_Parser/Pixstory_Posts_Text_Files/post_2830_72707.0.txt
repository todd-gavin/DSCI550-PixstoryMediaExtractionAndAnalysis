During a TV discussion about President Biden’s stance on rights abuses suffered by China’s minority community of Uyghur, billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya said he didn’t care about them and nor do most Americans. Following social-media backlash, he apologized (but many are unhappy with his half-hearted apology.) On the Uyghur question, a section of the business firms of the West have attempted to take a stance though China is swift in making it costly for them. Yet, for business leaders there are good reasons to be concerned about rights violations and other civil issues.

Palihapitiya, a part-owner of San Francisco's basketball team, had said: “Let's be honest, nobody, nobody cares about what's happening to the Uyghurs, okay? You bring it up because you really care. And I think that's really nice that you care but .... The rest of us don't care. I'm just telling you a very hard truth”: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/17/chamath-palihapitiya-says-nobody-cares-about-uyghur-genocide-in-china.html

As social media expressed shock, he admitted that his comments “lacked empathy”. He wrote on Twitter, “I believe that human rights matter, whether in China, the United States, or elsewhere”: https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1483228175391866881
  
Whether business should take positions on political issues or not is an open debate. In the US, some firms like Coca-Cola had taken a strong stance on the new: https://www.coca-colacompany.com/media-center/voting-rights-act-reauthorization , Republican-backed voting laws, but refrained from criticizing (or supporting) the Republican-backed stricter abortion laws: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/24/business/shar-dubey-match-texas-abortion-law.html

China’s human rights record notwithstanding, several leading brands have queued up to sponsor the Winter Olympics: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/24/business/shar-dubey-match-texas-abortion-law.html

But when it comes to the Uyghur issue, the matter is complicated. Xinjiang province, where the mostly Muslim community has been facing the Chinese might, is a major producer of cotton, and several western textile/fashion firms like H&M had last year decided to boycott purchasing that cotton. China unleashed a campaign against them at home, with nationalist social-media users calling for their boycott: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-56533560 That prompted many firms to backtrack in order to keep the vast market open for them: https://www.dw.com/en/xinjiang-cotton-boycott-leaves-western-brands-reeling/a-57130450

Yet, businesses are part of society. A stable, progressive society, economists argue, provide them better prospects in the long run. Speaking up might be in their own interest.
