Recently, The World Health Organization and the International Labour Organization have called for measures to be put in place to protect workers’ health while teleworking..

A new technical brief to healthy and safe teleworking, outlines the health benefits and risks of teleworking...

Among the benefits, the report says, there can be :
1.  *Improved* *work* – _life_ _balance_ , _opportunities_ for flexible working hours and _physical_ _activity_ , _reduced_ _traffic_ , and time spent commuting and a decrease in air pollution — all of which can improve physical and mental health and social wellbeing. 
Teleworking can also lead to higher productivity and lower operational costs for many companies.

Also the report warns that without proper planning and organization and without health and safety support, the impact of teleworking on the physical and mental health and social wellbeing of workers can be significant. 
It can lead to *isolation* , *burnout* , *depression* , *home* *violence* , *musculoskeletal* and other injuries, *eye* *strain* , increase in *smoking* and *alcohol* *consumption* , prolonged sitting and screen time and *unhealthy* *weight* *gain* 

Measures that should be put in place by employers include :

 1. Ensuring that workers receive adequate equipment to complete the tasks of the job
 2. Providing *relevant* *information* , guidelines and training to reduce the psychosocial and mental health impact of teleworking
3.Training managers in effective *risk* *management* 
4. *Distance* *leadership* and workplace health promotion
5.  Establishing the “ *right* to *disconnect* ” and sufficient rest days.

 Occupational health services should be enabled to provide ergonomic, mental health and psychosocial support to teleworkers using digital telehealth technologies, the report says...

Perdigão, Director of the ILO Governance and Tripartism Department. 'As we move away from this ‘holding pattern’ to settle into a new normal, we have the opportunity to embed new supportive policies, practices and norms to ensure millions of teleworkers have healthy, happy, productive and decent work.”

Enterprises with teleworkers should develop special programmes for teleworking combining measures for the management of work and performance with information and communication technologies and adequate equipment, and occupational health services for general health, ergonomic and psycho-social support.
