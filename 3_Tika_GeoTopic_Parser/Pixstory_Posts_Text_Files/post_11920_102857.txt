You know the women I m talking about the ones who turn heads as they walk gracefully and boldly in a room They might not be the prettiest thinness or even most successful but they have this positive energy and aura that either makes you want to be around them or get intimidated by them They seem comfortable in their skin and very unfazed A self assured woman takes control and accountability for her life She s very intentional with where she invests her time and energy She might not have her life altogether yet but she has a clear vision of what she wants out of life and sets smart realistic goals and takes action to achieve them There are many qualities and traits of confidence I will tell you traits that a truly confident woman possesses Self Care Is Her Top Priority She Practices Authenticity and Doesn t Conform She Knows What She Wants and Takes Action to Get It She Steps Outside Her Comfort Zone She Sets Strong Healthy Boundaries She Is Self compassionate She Owns Her Actions and Feelings She Doesn t Take Things Personally She Doesn t Care About Attention and Praise She Has Effective Communication and Listening Skills She Isn t Afraid to Ask for Help She is Supportive Overall truly confident women are like little sprinkles of empowering magic that reminds us of how good we are and how great we could be
