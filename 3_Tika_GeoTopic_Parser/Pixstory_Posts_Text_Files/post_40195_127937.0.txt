Just a few moment spent petting a black cat will result in a devoted lifelong companion. But throughout history, these dark, good-looking, and sociable cats have been associated with myths, superstitions, and legends that have either made them respected or dreaded. 

As per fourpaws, many of the early immigrants in America had the belief that witches could assume the shape of black cats. They would be able to cast spells while moving covertly thanks to this. The idea that cats have nine lives may have something to do with the belief that a witch can transform into a black cat up to nine times. Black cats are frequently depicted as witches or appearing with witches in modern pop culture.

That is where this myth stems from! Surely you don’t believe that a cat can transform into a witch?
