Beverley Farmer was a writer difficult to classify, whose stories, novels and essay-fiction hybrids touch on themes of home and restlessness. 

As Madeleine Watts points out, many people first came to Farmer on the recommendation of Josephine Rowe who recommended the undefinable The Bone House—a difficult-to-categorize triad of essays about the life of the body and the elements that shape our lives: water, fire, blood, darkness. 

The Bone House was published in 2005 (and Rowe has since written a book on Farmer, On Beverley Farmer: Writers on Writers, published in 2020). Reading Farmer was like having the lights turned on in my mind, a focus and attention suddenly brought to bear on every part of life. 

The opening story in This Water,another masterpiece,“A Ring of Gold,” is a perfect novella, and a master-class on the themes Farmer depicts best: water, women, transformation.
