The person I spent the majority of my life with is a bit reserved at first, which leads people to mistake him for being shy, but he is simply observing. Once he is finished, he comes out of his shell and emerges as the most kind and amiable person in the world.
People laugh and warm up to him because of his unique sense of humour, or sense of omar as he likes to call it.
As you could have suspected, I am the person.
