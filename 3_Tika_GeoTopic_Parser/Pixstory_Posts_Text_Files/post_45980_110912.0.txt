When the Supreme Court decided that the eastern half of Oklahoma is on tribal grounds and that the state cannot conduct criminal charges for offences on Indian land without the permission of the Indian nations, Native Americans in Oklahoma celebrated three years ago. 

NPR reported that, however, the court limited that ruling on Wednesday, triggering a vehement dissent from Justice Neil Gorsuch, the decision's author and a fervent supporter of Indian rights. 

This situation can seem simple on the surface. After the court's 2019 ruling, the state lost its ability to pursue anyone who were allegedly guilty of crimes on Indian land. That could only be done by the federal government or the tribal courts, and the tribal courts often not authorized to prosecute non-Indians. According to the federal government, effect of that decision was a 400% increase in federal prosecutions from 2020 to 2021, with many people either not held accountable or receiving lighter sentences in plea deals.

In light of that, Oklahoma's governor and attorney general asked the Supreme Court to reverse its earlier decision. The high court refused, but on Wednesday it issued a more limited decision, declaring that the state may prosecute crimes committed against Native American victims by non-Indians in Indian country. Bottom line: power to prosecute will most likely now shift back to the state, and away from the federal government.
