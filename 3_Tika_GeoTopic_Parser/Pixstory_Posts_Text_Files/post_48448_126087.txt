 The fool has said in his heart there is no God A certain type of pride that claims I don t need anyone to tell me how to live my life is the source of all unbelief in God In essence those who reject the existence of God are proclaiming their own supremacy There is no one superior to them There is no ruling body They have complete control over their own life However we all know it s just not possible Most of the things are in fact out of our control Some of them just subscribe to the theory that there is only the physical world and that there can be no spiritual or unseen realm because science lacks the means to discover and study it They decide they have the right to judge God They forget that science makes new discoveries everyday A hundred years ago nobody could have believed in facetime yet here we are One thing about the atheists is that they are particularly hostile to Christianity They believe that the Christian God is absurd monstrous illogical merciless or something along those lines When in reality He sent His son to die for us for them They think they have the freedom to reject the existence of God since humans are apparently more intelligent about what is right good and possible than God is The ironic thing is they fall flat on their face each time Thankfully there is still hope for even God s enemies to have their hearts and lives changed God is watching and waiting to accept and bless anybody who comes to Him because He loves everyone even those who hate Him
