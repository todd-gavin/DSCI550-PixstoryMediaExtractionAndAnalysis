The French Super Cup match between Paris Saint Germain and Nantes was won 4-0 at Stadium on Sunday thanks to two goals from Neymar, two from Lionel Messi, and two from Sergio Ramos.

The typical Ligue 1 champions versus French Cup winners matchup, which has frequently been played outside of France over the past ten years, was won by the Parisians for the ninth time in ten years.

Messi scored PSG's opening goal in the 22nd minute thanks to a through ball from Neymar that allowed him to get around the goalkeeper and shoot from a tight angle. PSG's roster of world-class talent did not let the Israeli crowd down.

Before Sergio Ramos, who came from Real Madrid and missed most of last season with an injury, added the third with an incredible backheel from close range in the 57th minute, Neymar added a second with a curling free kick just before halftime.

After Nantes defender Jean Claude Castelletto fouled Neymar in the 82nd minute and was sent off, the Brazilian scored the game-winning goal from the resulting penalty kick.
