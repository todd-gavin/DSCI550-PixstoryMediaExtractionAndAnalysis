Australia's most marginal seat has been smashed by devastating bushfires, floods and a pandemic since it last went to the polls in 2019.

The Macquarie electorate stretches from the turf farms and historic suburbs around the Hawkesbury River, to the eucalypt forests and tourism towns of the Blue Mountains at the furthest reaches of the Sydney basin.

In 2019, Labor incumbent Susan Templeman beat her Liberal opponent Sarah Richards by 371 votes — a close result that took more than two weeks to determine.

At 0.2 per cent, Macquarie boasts the slimmest margin in the country.

Differing opinions

Des Lloyd has voted Liberal for 45 years and planed to do so again on May 21, but said he had a "sickening feeling" Ms Templeman would be returned for a third stint.

"She's very well liked in the community," he said.

The North Richmond local believed the Coalition had been "a good government".

But only a couple of kilometres away near the Hawkesbury River on the Richmond Lowlands, Samantha Magnusson disagreed.

Her property has been flooded three times this year and she is yet to bring her horses back after the most recent inundation in March.

"This area really can't afford another Liberal government," she said.

"Climate change is real [and it is] here.

"It's not something that's happening in three years; it's happening now

"We see that with the flooding, we've seen it with the bushfires, we're seeing it with the urban heat, and I think those are issues that are now starting to resonate with people."
