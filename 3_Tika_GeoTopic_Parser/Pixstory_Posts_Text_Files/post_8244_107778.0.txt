The Golden State Warriors and the Boston Celtics are locked in a tense NBA Finals series, and longtime fans (and even those with passive interest in the championship) may wonder what how it’s affecting certain players’ popularity. Parrot Analytics’ Talent Demand tool, which tracks demand for any talent globally and regionally, including talent in sports and non-traditional entertainment industries, found that of the top 10 NBA talents of the last 30 days, half were players and coaches in the NBA finals — though not the player in the No. 1 spot, LeBron James.

It should come as no surprise that James is the most in-demand NBA star over the last 30 days, even though the Lakers aren’t in the championship finals. James is a superstar inside and outside of the league — similar to Michael Jordan or Shaquille O’Neal (who’s also listed on the top 10 rank). Between stories about James wanting to start an NBA league in Las Vegas, his ongoing appearances in films and his commentary about the sport that made him an icon, it’s no surprise that James is still one of the most in-demand players even without being in contention for the championship right now.

Meanwhile, Steph Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson, all playing for the Golden State Warriors, are on the list. And Steve Kerr, the Warriors’ head coach, is one of the few NBA coaches who has mainstream appeal and recognition beyond fans who closely follow the sport.

Curry has 31.79 times the average demand of all talent in the United States over the last 30 days, putting him just on the edge of exceptional, which only 0.04% of all talent ever reach. Kerr has 27.15 times the average demand of all talent, putting him in the outstanding category, which only 0.5% of all talent reach. Green and Thompson are relatively close to each other, sporting 16.9 times and 15.9 times the average demand of all talent, respectively.
