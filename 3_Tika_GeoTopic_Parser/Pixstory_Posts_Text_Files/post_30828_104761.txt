A very excited Gianmarco Pozzecco began his adventure as coach of Italbasket with the presentation press conference held in Milan Poz, current deputy of Ettore Messina on the bench of Olimpia Milano, declared I think there are few sportsmen who have suffered as I have suffered for the blue shirt I know that coaching the national team will be something completely different Playing with the national team it will be equally exciting to train them but the responsibility that he will have will be enormous Pozzecco explained that he will devote himself completely to the national team called to drive the whole movement My role will be full time because I think there is a need to have not only the goal of making the national team win but also of making the movement grow I want basketball to regain that visibility it has not lost but which is a bit lost On the burning issue of the call-up of the players absent at last year&#39;s Tokyo pre-Olympic Pozzecco added My responsibility towards those called up and excluded will be so studied and evaluated that I am convinced that I have little margin for error We want to create a competitive national team but also a group of people with great sense If Gigi Datome is willing to be part of this group
