Interior Ministry of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan on Wednesday, January 19, 2022, announced that the interim government led by Mullah Muhammad Hassan Akhund has passed the scheme of uniform for the ministry's personnel.

In a video clip, Deputy Spokesperson of the Ministry engineer Izam said that the scheme was sent to the cabinet over a week ago that has been passed now.

Engineer Izam said that the uniform for the Ministry of Interior will not be much different from that of the national police of the previous government.

"The scheme of the police of the Interior Ministry sent to the cabinet was passed by ministerial council, and the uniform will soon be distributed across Afghanistan." Said Izam.

It comes as the Taliban affiliates-police- are yet to be given a specific uniform now six months after the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan regained power on August 15 last year.

Gunmen and bandits have misused the opportunity and have conducted heinous crimes and felonies while impersonating the Taliban affiliates.
