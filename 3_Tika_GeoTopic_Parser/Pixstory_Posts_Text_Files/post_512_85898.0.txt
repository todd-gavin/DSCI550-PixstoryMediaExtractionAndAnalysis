Ok so the day is finally here- International Womenâ€™s day. 
I am a woman, proud to be one infact but what am I supposed to do today. 
I did see some messages wishing me on the day, some as part of group forwards and some personal, direct messages. 
Hailing women, some general patronising , some outright feminist ( trying atleast) and some grudgingly true . 
Ok so now that the women have been hailed. Some interesting profiles done, covid warriors honoured but my question remains . What is it to a woman like me? How do I celebrate. 
Will someone get me a cake ? or will I be given a day off at work, will I be given extra credit for work today ? Is my family supposed to love me more today ? My children supposed to give me cards telling me what a great mom I am?
What is the right way to celebrate ?
Or am I just supposed to celebrate it with my own self. Take it as a reminder, an alarm that I will repeat to myself tell my self who I am. Make sure others respect me and give out the same amount of respect back irrespective of gender. 
Not let people patronise me, decide the right and wrong for me. Not set boundaries and limits . Trust my own ability to tell the wrong from right. 
Let me run my life, my work, my house , my family my way. 
Not that I am infallible, no one is . 
I am a mortal capable of mistakes now and again. Let me make my own mistakes, let me pledge myself to learn from them.
Like a friend said -No one please try to empower me, I am empowered enough. Accept me and respect me for Who I am.
