Rafael Nadal is unbeaten at that level in the 2022 season heading into the US Open, the year's final grand slam. Before being forced to withdraw from Wimbledon prior to his semi-final due to an abdominal tear, Nadal triumphed in Australia and France, moving him over Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic for the record for the most grand slam victories by a man. Despite this, he has a 19-0 record in grand slams this year, with 4 triumphs on those hard courts in the 2010s making New York his second-most successful tournament. His health will be his top priority because he has a history of injuries and wants to keep his body in top condition.
