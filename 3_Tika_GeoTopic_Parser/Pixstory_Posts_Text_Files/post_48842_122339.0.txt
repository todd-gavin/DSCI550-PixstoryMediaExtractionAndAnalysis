I feel you, man! I have been going through a burn out lately too. I think it's just all stress from work and personal life that just doesn't leave any scope to do what we like or for fun. But I also think your guilt is misplaced. Don't get me wrong, I understand that you're feeling guilty for not being productive on those days, but the matter of fact is day offs are not meant to be productive.

Living in capitalism is hard. This whole "grind hard hustle culture" thing is just unfair. To the point that even resting feels like a crime. It cultivates a perpetually poisonous climate where you feel terrible if you spend too much time on something unrelated to work. A form of cognitive dissonance is fueled by it.

It is deadly. It promotes not only unhealthy habits but those habits have deadly consequences. From physical illnesses to mental ones. It makes us feel guilty for taking care of ourselves so much that we start feeling that way even on the days we're supposed to rest.

Cut yourself some slack, buddy! You're doing nothing wrong by giving your body the rest it needs.
