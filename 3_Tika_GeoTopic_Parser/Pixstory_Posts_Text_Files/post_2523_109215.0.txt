Today 23rd June is Birth anniversary of Rehman a Character Actor from
1949-1970s 
Whether it is the distinctive Chenoy Seth of Waqt or the suave, sophisticated Mr.Ghosh, the publisher in Pyaasa; the debauched and insensitive Zamindar (Chhote Sarkar) of Sahib Bibi aur Gulam or Nawab of Chaudvin ka Chaand, he played these roles with an exquisite finesse.
He performed the negative roles rather subtly, through his expressions and his arresting voice, raising his eyebrows while smoking a pipe, one hand in his trouser pocket. His sarcastic tone and his dialogues in chaste Urdu added to the effect.
In the famous historical film Taj Mahal (1963), he played emperor Jahangir. In Palki (1967), he is Nawab Mirza, in Dil ne Phir Yaad Kiya (1966), he plays Amjad, Dharmendra’s best friend, in Dharmputra (1961), he is Javed who is married to Bano (Mala Sinha), in Gazal (1964), he is Akhtar Nawab. He provided an interesting dimension to these films. In Aap ki Kasam in 1974, we saw Rehman playing father to the heroine, Mumtaz. 
His flirty roles in Mere Humdum Mere Dost (Sharmila Tagore) and Baharen Phir Bhi Aayengi (Mala Sinha) were played with impish charm.
Of course Exchanges with Raaj Kumar in Waqt are etched forever. He held his own with ‘Jaani’. 
 ”Effortless” is the perfect word to describe Rehman’s acting.
