Nupur Sharma, the BJP's spokesperson, has been suspended following her provocative remarks about Prophet Muhammad during a TV debate.

Nupur Sharma, the BJP's national spokesperson, was suspended from the party on Sunday for making provocative remarks about Prophet Muhammad during a recent TV debate. Naveen Kumar Jindal, the Delhi BJP's media in-charge, has also been dismissed from the party's primary membership.

The party's central disciplinary committee noted in the suspension letter, "You have expressed opinions that are diametrically opposed to the party's stand on a number of issues... With immediate effect, you are suspended from the party and your obligations pending further investigation."

On Friday, violence erupted in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, after a Muslim organisation called for the closure of stores in Parade Market in response to Nupur Sharma's remarks. During the clashes, at least 40 individuals were hurt, including 20 police officers, according to the police.

Nupur Sharma is claimed to have suggested in a TV debate over the ongoing Gyanvapi row that certain items from Islamic religious books might be mocked by people. Muslims, she claims, are insulting Hinduism by referring to the 'Shivling' discovered inside the mosque complex as a fountain.

Nupur Sharma has been charged with injuring religious sensibilities in Hyderabad, Pune, and Mumbai.
