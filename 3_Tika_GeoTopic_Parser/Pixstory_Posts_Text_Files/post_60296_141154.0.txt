The 19th of September will be the day of the Queen's funeral, according to a statement from Buckingham Palace.
Following the passing of Queen Elizabeth at the age of 96 on Thursday, an official 10-day period of mourning will end with the event. It will start in Westminster Abbey at 11 a.m.
Following his official crowning on Saturday, her son Charles issued a proclamation declaring his mother's death day to be a public holiday.
During his first meeting with the privy council in St. James's Palace, which was the first in history to be broadcast on television, King Charles III announced the public holiday.
The Queen will lie in state in Westminster Hall for four days before her funeral so that people can pay their respects.
The Queen's coffin is currently in the Balmoral Castle Ballroom and will be transported to Edinburgh's Palace of Holyroodhouse on Sunday.
The coffin will be brought to the city's St. Giles' Cathedral on Monday in a procession that will include the King and other members of the royal family. To allow Scots to pay their respects, it will remain there until Tuesday.
The coffin will be driven to Buckingham Palace after being flown from Edinburgh airport to RAF Northolt on Tuesday night together with Princess Anne.
