I'm sorry, but today's unveiling of the portrait of former President Obama is poor. In a homage to ultra-modern art, his position against a stark (nearly blinding) white background resembles a 1970s Kodak photograph as opposed to a classical traditional portrait intended to endure for generations. 

Portraits of presidents are not intended to be experimental works of art; rather, they are supposed to express a timeless sense of leadership. Less about the man and more about the symbol of the country he represented as president.

Stoic. Pensive. Reflective. Moderated.

These are the characteristics that a presidential portrait should reflect. 

Save the chic Hollywood experiments for the local wax museum.
