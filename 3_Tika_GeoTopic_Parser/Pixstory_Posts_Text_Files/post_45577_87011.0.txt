Renee Zellweger is going to star in the Peacock drama 'Avenger Field,' which is currently in development. 

According to Variety, the one-hour drama series chronicles the storey of individuals who set up a secret all-female US Airforce unit known as the WASPs (Women Airforce Service Pilots) to fight Hitler from home. 

Inspired by the true storey of Jackie Cohran (Zellweger), a WASP leader, and the varied group of women who battled the system, sceptics, and even sabotage to safely return everyone to their homes. 

WaterWalk Entertainment has signed Felicia D. Henderson as a writer, showrunner, and executive producer. Susanna White will direct and produce the film. 

The series' announcement coincides with the premiere of NBC's short series 'The Thing About Pam,' a real crime thriller in which Zellweger stars as Pam Hupp. Zellweger is well known for her role in the Netflix series "What/If." 

She is best recognised for her cinematic roles, with her performance in the Judy Garland biopic 'Judy' receiving critical acclaim.

Under their Big Picture Co. label, Zellweger and Carmella Casinelli will executive produce.
