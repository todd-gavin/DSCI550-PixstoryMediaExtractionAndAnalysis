Hyperpigmentation is a common problem that can be difficult to treat. There are a number of ways to reduce the hyperpigmentation, but it will take time and patience. Here are some tips:
- Try using lightening creams or gels that contain hydroquinone (HQ). This medication works by darkening skin cells, which reduces the appearance of hyperpigmentation. Be sure to follow the directions carefully so you don't end up with any unwanted side effects.
- Apply sunscreen every day even if you're only going outside for a short while. Sunlight contains UVA and UVB rays, both of which can cause skin damage and hasten the development of Hyper pigmentation lesions. Use an SPF 30 or higher when sunbathing, swimming, skiing, etc., to protect your skin from harmful UV radiation exposure.Â  
- Avoid wearing too much makeup or doing excessive tanning sessions because they will just make your spots darker.
- Apply topical treatments that contain glycolic or salicylic acid daily to your affected areas. These acids will break down melanin, lighten your skin tone, and reduce the appearance of dark spots and blemishes.
- Exfoliate your skin regularly with an alpha hydroxy acid (AHAs) such as lactic acid or glycolic acid strips or gel pads. AHAs penetrate into the layers of the skin to exfoliate them gently without damaging delicate tissue.
