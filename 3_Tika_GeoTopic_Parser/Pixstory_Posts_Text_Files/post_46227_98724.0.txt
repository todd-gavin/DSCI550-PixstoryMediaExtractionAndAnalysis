Muslims pray five times a day every day , but the most important prayer of the week is *jummah*  or the day of gathering , on Friday . 🕋✨

So why are Friday prayers so central to the Islamic faith ?✨

The Qur’an invokes the importance of Friday as a sacred day of worship in a chapter called *Al-Jumah* , meaning the day of congregation , which is also the word for Friday in Arabic .🕋✨

Muslims believe Friday was chosen by God as a dedicated day of worship . ✨

There are many reasons as to Why Friday is a special day :

1. Judgement Day 'Qiyamah' will be on Friday .
2. Holy Prophet (P.B.U.H) delivered his last speech 'Khutbah' aka 'Khutbah Hajtul widah' .
3. Allah created Prophet Adam (A.S) and he entered Paradise on this day .
4. Prophet Adam(A.S) was sent to earth on this day .
5. There is a blessed hour on Friday during which a person is granted anything lawful and good by Allah that he prays for .
6. The charity given on this day is more virtuous than the other days of the week .

Have A Blessed Friday Ahead 🕋✨🕌❤️
