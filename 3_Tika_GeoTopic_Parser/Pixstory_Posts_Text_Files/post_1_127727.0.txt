We Indians do love to bastardise our foods- Chinese bhel, chopsuey, Szechuan noodles- all these would scandalise a Chinese person, who would not recognise their home food in our aggressively spicy dishes! 

I don’t mind it, to be honest. ‘Chinjabi’ food deserves its own recognition! But I have to draw the line at ‘tutti frutti momos’ and ‘momo burgers’ and momo pizza. WHY on earth would you ever put a momo inside a burger? Those textures do not play well at all together 😭 it just doesn’t make sense 

What’s the weirdest fusion food you’ve ever seen on a menu?
