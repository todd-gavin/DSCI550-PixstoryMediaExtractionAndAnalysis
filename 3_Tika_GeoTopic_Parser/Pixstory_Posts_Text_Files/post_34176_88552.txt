Roma coach Jos Mourinho&#39;s analysis to DAZN after the derby success against Lazio Great performance the victory against Atalanta was already a solid victory even if with a different result Today was really special because it seemed that everything we had planned Lazio was put on the field in the second half he tried to play with pride but we never lost control There is no doubt the lads deserved the win When you say Abraham is fantastic I disagree he can do even more I demand so much from him because I know his potential I don&#39;t talk about goals but he has to play every game with this attitude I don&#39;t like ol&#39;s I don&#39;t like how they are interpreted by players on the pitch You always need respect for your opponent In the league it seems obvious to me that the four up front they will go to the Champions then there are four teams from fifth to eighth There are four teams that are playing well finish fifth or finish eighth a difference Let&#39;s see if we can finish the championship well
