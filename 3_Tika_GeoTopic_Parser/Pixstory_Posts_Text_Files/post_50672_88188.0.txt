Every one of us is a consumer in some way. According to the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, a person who buys goods for his use is a consumer. Consumers today are surrounded by hoarding, black marketing, adulteration, overcharge, low measure, and weighing. Consumers are not organized because they are cheated everywhere. Thatâ€™s why the consumer will have to wake up and save him from these crises. For this reason govt. has come with some objectives of consumer awareness.
