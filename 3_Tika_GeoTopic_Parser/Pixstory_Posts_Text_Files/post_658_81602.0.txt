WHO says Omicron might not be the last variant of Covid 19, WhatsApp forwards are scaring you with half the news. Here is what more you need to know. 
Part one of my conversation with Dr Neeraj Nischal, Additional Professor Medicine at AIIMS (New Delhi). Excerpts from our conversation.

Q:WHO experts said Omicron might not be the last variant of covid 19, and the next one would be more infectious.

A:As long as the virus is replicating and multiplying there will be the possibility of new variants cropping up.
The RNA viruses have no proofreading mechanism. To put it simply, when Human cells multiply and each cell is identical to the other ,if it's not the cell is discarded. This mechanism is not present in viruses like SARS-CoV2 .
When the viruses mutates most of the mutations are useless but sometimes they change from the parent cell and gain a survival advantage and produce a new variant . 
As far as A virus is concerned it cannot survive on its own; it has to depend on host cells and has to co-exist with the host. The new variants keep cropping to survive long- the law of nature is ` survival of the fittest'. The ideal situation for the host and the virus would be virus has high infection rate but at the same time is not dangerous /not causing any symptoms to the host (human).

Q:Are we going to reach that stage where the covid virus is very infectious but not that harmful.
A:We have to see the chronology of the virus. Take for example Delta, it was infectious and also was caused a lot of harm to the human host - hospitalisations , high death rate. Omicron on the other hand is more infectious but seems to cause milder symptoms -whether it is because of the increase in vaccination or the virus's own properties needs to be seen.
