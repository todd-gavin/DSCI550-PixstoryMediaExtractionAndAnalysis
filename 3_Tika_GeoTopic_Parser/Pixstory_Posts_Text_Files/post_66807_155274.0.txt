Real Madrid have been linked with a number of big names in recent times. 
Los Blancos have moved away from their Galacticos style signings in recent years but it looks like after quite a few quiet windows, Florentino Perez might be looking to add a superstar or two to Carlo Ancelotti’s squad, after failing to bring Kylian Mbappe in the summer.
Of course, as well all know by now, Mbappe appears to be looking to leave PSG and the name of Real Madrid cannot be counted out from this race completely, even though it might be unlikely.
On the other hand, one player that they have been heavily linked with over the past few months as their top priority for the next summer transfer window is Jude Bellingham of Borussia Dortmund. But it appears that they have been handed a blow by Chelsea early on in the race for the English midfielder
As reported by Sport Bild (via Bulinews) Chelsea have contacted Borussia Dortmund about a transfer next summer. Todd Boehly is believed to have made signing Bellingham a top priority, with ‘The Blues’ already said to be in talks with the England international’s entourage.
Thus, it looks like Chelsea are moving early in order to try and beat the competition for the signature of Bellingham.
