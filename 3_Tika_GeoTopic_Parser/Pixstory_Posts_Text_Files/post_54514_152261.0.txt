Things are not going well for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. On September 30 he announced the annexation of four Ukrainian regions that are partially controlled by Russia. Yet less than a day later, Ukrainian troops captured the strategic town of Lyman in the north of the annexed Donetsk region.Before the lower house of the Russian parliament, the State Duma, could even approve the annexation on October 3, the Russian front in the southern Kherson region had collapsed in parts. These successes showed how tenuous the Kremlin’s grip was on the regions it had proclaimed to be “forever Russian”.By the morning of October 4, Ukrainian forces had advanced some 30km beyond their positions over the weekend, indicating that there was still significant momentum behind their counteroffensive.Western condemnation of the annexation was hardly a surprise. Nor was a warning from Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, that there would be “severe consequences” if Putin made good his threat to use nuclearAgainst the background of the alleged sabotage of the Nordstream 1 and 2 pipelines in the Baltic Sea, the alliance also issued a statement that “any deliberate attack against allies’ critical infrastructure would be met with a united and determined response”.The increasingly tense and volatile situation in and around Ukraine now clearly has more potential than ever to escalate into a full-blown conflict between Russia and the west. This makes it even more of a global security concern and raises the question of how China – Russia’s most significant strategic ally – positions itself.China: the sum of all ambiguitiesA UN security council resolution condemning the referendums and denouncing the annexation was predictably vetoed by Russia on September 30. Putin may consider it a success that China – alongside Brazil, Gabon and India – was among the four security council members that abstained. But nothing in the Chinese representative’s subsequent statements indicated that Beijing would recognise the annexations.Read more: https://theconversation.com/ukraine-war-chinas-lukewarm-support-for-russia-is-likely-to-benefit-kyiv-heres-why-191790
