Drinking water is super important. Most people enjoy a cold refreshing glass of water. You may not know that some people also enjoy a refreshing glass of hot water. 

📍Why drinking hot water can be good for you♨️

♨️First thing’s first, drinking water at any reasonable temperature is good for you. Over half your body is water. 

♨️Some benefits are specific to hot and warm water — and these might surprise you. When we say hot, we mean water between 130 and 160°F (54 and 71°C). Don’t drink water that’s hotter than this. There are literally no health problems you can manage by scalding your mouth and throat.

🫖 Drinking hot water might help with:

📍congestion relief

📍constipation relief

📍smooth digestion

📍boosts nervous system function

📍hydration

📍less shivering when cold

📍improved blood circulation

📍possible stress reduction

📍detoxification

📍achalasia symptom relief

📍enhanced tea and coffee consumption

📍better sleep

•Just make sure it’s not too hot and that you don’t glug too much.

☕️Tea comes with its own benefits. 
Hot tea doesn’t only chill you out. Further studies found that tea may have similar properties to coffee in keeping risks of serious conditions such as stroke and cardiovascular disease low. And green tea has a heap of possible health benefits.

♨️However, the evidence for this is very limited, so don’t treat tea and coffee as an all-healing elixir.But give hot water its flowers for getting involved with such deliciousness.

🥛As any 5-year-old will tell you, a cup of warm milk or hot cocoa works wonders for helping you drift off.
