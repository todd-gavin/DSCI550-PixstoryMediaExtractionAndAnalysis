Unlike most substances and supplements, caffeine can affect cells throughout your body, including muscle and fat cells, as well as cells within your central nervous system.
For this reason, caffeine’s effects are quite varied. These include:
👉The nervous system
Caffeine activates areas of your brain and nervous system to improve focus and energy while reducing tiredness.
👉Hormones
Caffeine increases circulating epinephrine (adrenaline), the hormone responsible for the “fight or flight” response, which can increase performance.
👉Fat burning
Caffeine may increase your body’s ability to burn fat via lipolysis, or the breakdown of fat in fat cells.
👉Endorphins
Beta-endorphins can increase feelings of wellness and give you the exercise “high” that people often experience after working out .
👉Muscles
Caffeine may improve muscle performance through activation of the central nervous system; however, the exact mechanisms are unclear.
👉Body temperature
Caffeine has been shown to increase thermogenesis, or heat production, which raises your body temperature and may help you burn more calories.
👉Glycogen
Caffeine may also spare muscle carb stores, primarily due to increased fat burning. This can enhance endurance performance.
