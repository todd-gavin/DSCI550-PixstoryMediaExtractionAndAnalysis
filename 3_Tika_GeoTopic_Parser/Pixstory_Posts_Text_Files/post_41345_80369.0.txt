Kathy Hochul, the Governor of New York has announced that the mask mandate in the state will expire on Thursday. She also maintained that CDC has advised that masks should still be in use in areas of high transmission. 

The people of New York are overjoyed at this decision as it is a major step towards returning to life before covid after the deadly Omnicron wave. 
However, some are still apprehensive as this decision was against the federal public health guidance. 

White House has also released a statement on this decision. The Guardian reports: White House press secretary Jen Psaki said when asked about whether the White House is out of step in its messaging compared with the moves that Democratic governors such as Hochul have made this week, Psaki said it was clear that the US is “moving toward a time when Covid won’t disrupt our daily lives” and won’t be a “constant crisis” any more.

The mask mandate is a very trivial topic in America. Over the course of the pandemic, the country saw many protests against this mandate with slogans like “My Body, My Choice” being raised. This was specifically against the establishments which refused to allow patrons in their premises without a mask. 

Simultaneously, awareness was being raised online about the necessity of masks and the crucial role they place in preventing the spread of coronavirus. 

While the country was starkly divided, covid claimed many lives in the US and all over the world.
