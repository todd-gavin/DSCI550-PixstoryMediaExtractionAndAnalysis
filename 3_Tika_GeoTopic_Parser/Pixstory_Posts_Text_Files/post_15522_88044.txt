the PAV Parco Arte Vivente presents the collective exhibition La Natura e la Preda which addresses the theme of colonial memory through the works of some young Italian artists Irene Coppola with Vito Priolo Edoardo Manzoni Daniele Marzorati and Alessandra Messali Far from being an innate condition indifferent to circumstances being prey a positioning that is conferred in relation to other subjects the object of the predator&#39;s targeted strategy We can say that something becomes prey and therefore huntable as a result of a process of distinction hierarchization or exclusion from shared orders To trace a theory of prey it is necessary to think both to the politics of representation and to the ways in which power builds social identities through repression Compared to other strategies of conflict, hunting is not a fight between equals but foresees an original disequilibrium given by the material supremacy of the hunter Confronting today with the Italian colonial memory and not only does it not mean dealing only with a forgotten and removed past the forms of oppression that we thought we had left behind at the time of slavery or plantation re-emerge in the neo archaic reconfigurations driven by the power of neoliberal economic policies Prey which has the same etymology of the verb to always take something that is acquired with violence and capture and an action that we have legitimized and attributed to nature Building a theory of prey can be an important tool in dealing with the dramatic current situation of colonial memory the four emerging artists invited to the exhibition they are naturalists but archaeologists of a social history of nature who investigate by working on representations of the exotic of hunting and colonial experimentation on plants
