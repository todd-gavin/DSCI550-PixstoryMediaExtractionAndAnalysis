The Office, Friends, The Big Bang Theory, and even Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah are examples of iconic sitcoms that many of us have found ourselves binge-watching.
The overall appearance of the show barely changes when each episode is released.
However, when we revisit the first episode after seeing the first half of the series, we notice a noticeable difference, as if the tone of the entire series has changed.
Going back to the first episode after finishing the entire series makes everything appear different. When did it even happen? we find ourselves wondering as the plot develops, the camera work is of high quality, or the character appearances.
The same can be said for our efforts throughout our lives.
So Trust The Process!
