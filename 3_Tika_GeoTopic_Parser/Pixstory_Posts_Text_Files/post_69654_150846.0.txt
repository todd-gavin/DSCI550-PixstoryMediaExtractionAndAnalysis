BEST WAY TO TAKE A PENALTY IN FOOTBALL⚽️!Choose a side: Left or right? (Don’t change your mind)• Look at the goalkeeper in the eyes.• Stare into the opposite corner to which you are going to hit the ball (Make sure you are making eye contact with the goalkeeper when you do this).• Side foot the ball with power into the other corner (the opposite corner to which you were staring).Tell me if you like thi is notes..Thankyou😍⚽️.
