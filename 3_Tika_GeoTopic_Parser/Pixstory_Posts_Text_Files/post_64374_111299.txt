Honest communication is something that is very important because unspoken disagreements grudges etc will just sit like a boulder both inside you as well as in your relationship It never ends well and is a ticking bomb that is set to be the demise of whatever it is you share and have with that person s It is necessary to speak your mind so as to avoid keeping the problems in your mind from festering and giving way to assumptions and conclusions that may be wrong Honest communication only brings people closer together and can result in relationships that are absolutely beautiful and worth treasuring with everything you have in you
