According to a report from Deadline, Ezra Miller “is simply not a part of those plans going forward in the future universe regardless if there are more allegations or not," This means that following the release of their film, Miller will no longer be a part of the DCEU.

Another source added: “There is no winning in this for Warner Bros. This is an inherited problem for Zaslav. The hope is that the scandal will remain at a low level before the movie is released, and hope for the best to turn out.”

Miller has been in many controversies, which included grooming of young children and harassment. The court has been unable to locate Miller in order to serve the order, thus he is thought to be on the run. Ezra Miller's verified Instagram account (@ezra. x .aradia), which included memes taunting authorities regarding their location, has also been deleted.
