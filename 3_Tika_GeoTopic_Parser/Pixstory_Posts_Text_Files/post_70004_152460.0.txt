Everybody gets anxiety sometimes 🌈💫
Somebody's probably told you this in hopes to make you feel better, to comfort you, to make you feel as though you are not alone.🤝🫂
Unfortunately, it can end up making you feel invalidated because you know your experience is much different than everyone else's "anxiety".🤔🤨
Truth is.....
✅They're right. Everyone does get anxiety. But- not everyone has a server level of anxiety or disordered anxiety.
Remind them of the following differences -
An anxiety disorders are very debilitating and can impact multiple aspects of your life including relationships, work, and overall wellbeing.🔪
Those having anxiety in a dangerous situation, such as being chased, or in a nerve-wracking situation, such as giving a presentation, are experiencing anxiety the way it meant to be experienced.💁
Those with anxiety disorders are in fight-flight-freeze mode more often than not. Often, they are experiencing physical symptoms that make them feel not only mentally, but also physically unwell.🤕
If you're experiencing anxiety to a level which is interfering with your daily life, you should reach out to a mental health professional.👩‍⚕️
There are options for treatment and you don't have to to suffer alone.🫂💝
