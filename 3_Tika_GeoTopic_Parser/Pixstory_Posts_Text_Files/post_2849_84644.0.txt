As Russian armed forces march on Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, the U.S. and the European countries have been on an overdrive announcing sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s government. One of the EU countries that has been on edge because of the sanctions is Italy. 

Although Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi has been at pains to say his country is entirely on board and also pledged to “very tough package of sanctions.” At the same time, Italy always had friendlier relations with the Putin regime than any other country of Europe. Italy also has a large stake in Russia in investments, including state-controlled energy group Eni with long-term gas contracts with Russia.

Understanding the importance of optics, Putin held a call with major Italian energy firms in early February, indicating Russia attaching importance to Italy.

For Italy, gas price is the biggest concern. According to experts, Italy is more dependent on natural gas for energy from Russia than most EU members. Russia alone supplies around 40 percent of its gas requirements. “In case of interruptions of gas supplies from Russia, Italy has more to lose compared to other European countries that rely on different sources,” Draghi, the Italian prime minister, told the Italian Parliament on Tuesday.

Italian media is reporting that the country is looking for other sources for its energy needs. Food prices are also likely to go up in Italy, especially wheat and corn, which it imports from Russia and Ukraine.

Since luxury goods are not included in the European Union’s new round of sanctions against Russia, in other words, luxury goods from Italy and France to Russia can continue. It may not be that easy to get online transactions for the luxury goods because of western sanctions.
