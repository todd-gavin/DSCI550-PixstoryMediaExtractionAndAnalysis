It s a children s movie about a mermaid with red hair that falls in love with a prince Grown adults need to stop losing their sh t over this And Ariel s skin color is truly the last thing people should be surprised by She s literally a half fish I think it has more to do with people s own racism than anything else Why is it that people are okay with the constant cultural appropriation in Hollywood or stereotypical and racist representation of characters of color but a BIPOC woman playing a mythical creature is where they draw the line Oh humor me
