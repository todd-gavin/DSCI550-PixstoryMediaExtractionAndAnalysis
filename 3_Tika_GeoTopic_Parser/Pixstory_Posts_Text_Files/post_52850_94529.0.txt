That person who likes staying in her own little space, diverted from reality and into the books
That person who just can’t get her eyes off the pretty sunsets and the moon
That person who can never get enough of the beauty that exists around in the form of music, paintings, and poetry
That person who’ll be there to listen to your endless rants about literally anything and never get tired of it

That person is me, Adishree. I hail from Darjeeling, a city in the foothills of Himalayas. 

Besides being an avid reader, I write sometimes. I’m passionate about good music. I also sing and play guitar in my leisure time. 
My introverted personality makes me less fond of 
socialising with a lot of people but I do love the ones I have in my close-knit circle. I do have dreams and aspirations, but importantly, I strive to create a better version of myself each day. 
Little things matter a lot to me like a word of appreciation or a small gesture of kindness.
They say, ‘In a world where you can be anything, be kind’. I strongly resonate with this. It makes me put my faith in humanity because I think at the end of the day, we all are fighting battles we don’t speak about, and being more kind, warm and compassionate to each other is the only way through which we can get the strength and hope to keep moving no matter what comes our way.
