Whats the real meaning of love?
Ask someone who isn’t in love.

The ambiguity of my nature,
Can be explained only by my love.

This whole universe doesn’t matter,
To someone who’s truly in love.

People tend to run away,
When someone’s madly in love.

Everything you believe in changes,
When you suppress the feeling of love.

Been all alone this whole time,
Trying to separate these lies from love.

If there is no struggle,
Can it even be called love?

Even the fallen angel once,
Knew what it is to love.

“I can’t handle this....”
Society’s answer to love.

Mir this life isn’t worth living,
If you can’t feel love.
