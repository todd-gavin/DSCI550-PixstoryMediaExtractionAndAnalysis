5 Robbie Fowler
When legendary Ian Rush left the club, many believed it would take time to fill his position. But when Fowler wore the t-shirt and stepped onto the pitch, demonstrating his play, fans forgot for a moment that the position was once occupied by one of Liverpool's legendary strikers.
He was an excellent replacement for Ian Rush, who scored 171 goals in 330 games for Liverpool. Robbie Fowler returned for a second spell in 2005, cementing his legacy as one of Liverpool's best strikers.
4 Michael Owen
Owen experienced it all as a football player, from being a fan favourite to becoming the club's villain. But there was no denying that when he was at Liverpool, he enchanted many fans with his playing style. He rose through the Liverpool youth system and quickly became the club's leading scorer.
His blistering pace and ease in dribbling past defenders was a joy to watch, and he was also the best playmaker. Everything he did on the field appeared flawless, and his heroic performance in the 2005 Champions League final earned him the Ballon d'Or. He finished his Liverpool career with 158 goals and 298 appearances.

3 Emile Heskey 
Emile Heskey, a Liverpool record signing, was brought in when he was too young and regarded as an inexperienced player. The manager had faith in the player, believing he would "give Liverpool a different dimension" and complement Robbie Fowler and Michael Owen. Heskey's breakout season came in 2001, when he scored 22 goals in 55 games. He quickly became an imperative player for Liverpool, scoring 60 goals in 223 appearances.
