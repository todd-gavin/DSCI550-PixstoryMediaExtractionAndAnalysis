Covid is a problem that the world has been struggling with for the past two years now However amidst our privilege we often forget that the things we take for granted like access to vaccination might be a challenge for other people especially the marginalised section of our society Yes I am talking about my Native American friends When Covid vaccinations first became available Native Americans went quickly and decisively to obtain their doses as if their lives depended on it NBC News reported that american Indian and Alaska Native hospitalisation and death rates had surpassed those of non Hispanic whites Native Americans used established mechanisms like the Indian Health Service and tribal groups to administer immunizations quickly They had the highest immunisation rates of any race or ethnicity according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Nonetheless tribe health officials said they finally ran into the same problems that stymied the US vaccine campaign particularly in convincing people to receive booster doses Nationally percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives of all ages had received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine as of March and percent were fully vaccinated A far lesser percentage percent of fully vaccinated Native Americans ages and above had had booster injections compared to whites Asian Americans Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders and whites Asian Americans and Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders Data issues according to tribal health experts may be partly to blame but there are other concerns as well Finding injections and making appointments has become increasingly challenging in recent months Some individuals were sceptical about the value of a third shot owing to a lack of scientific understanding of the virus and widespread suspicion of the federal government in indigenous areas
