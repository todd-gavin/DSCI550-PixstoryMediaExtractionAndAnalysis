When you are struggling with your mental
health, the margin between coping & not coping can seem very small. This is so true for OCD. When life is already tough then you may not have any reserves left for the inevitable negative events that life throws at us. 

If you are bombarded with difficult thoughts & feelings, It doesn't take  much to feel overwhelmed. Illness, relationships, school, work, studies, other people, career, money and family can seem like the final straw. 

Sending love to anyone going through that right now. But we want you to know that there is support, empathy and resources out there. We
also know that you are stronger than you thinks. You can do this but please reach out and don't suffer alone.
