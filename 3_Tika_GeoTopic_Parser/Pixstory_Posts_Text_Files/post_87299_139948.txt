The Brazil National Football Team is managed by Adenor Leonardo Bacchi commonly known as Tite His managing style focuses on a narrow defensive and an expansive attacking style He has been using the formation recently which changes into when they are defending The Brazilian team is full of tricksters and players with flair but their defence is very compact They have like all the other big teams a good and worthy replacement ready for every starting player This year picking the squad for Tite is going to be very difficult as everyone is in top notch form The Goalkeeper position will likely be contested between Alisson and Ederson The starting fullbacks will be Danilo on the right and Sandro from the left Now at the Centre Back positions Tite has almost world class players and he can choose anyone but I think he ll prefer experience and go for Marquinhos and Thiago Silva Militao Gabriel and Saliba will remain on the bench Coming to the midfield Casemiro will start as the sole Central Defensive Midfielder Lucas Paquet and Fred will play more of an attacking role in the midfield If Tite doesn t decide to play Neymar as the No if that happens then Paquet has started the games on bench before If Neymar plays as the no and not on the Left Wing then Vin cius J nior who has been in red hot form will play there Gabriel Jesus will likely play as the striker and Raphinha will play from the right Antony and Firmino will likely start from the bench This Brazillian squad has the passion and flair to go all the way through to win tbis World Cup and it ll be a joy to watch them light up again this year
