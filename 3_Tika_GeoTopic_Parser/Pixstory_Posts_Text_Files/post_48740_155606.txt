I personally think your take is pretty tone deaf Forcing kids into boxes of preset roles and responsibilities on the basis of their gender because they will be bullied for being free is misplaced concern Our focus should instead be on making sure children have safe spaces to go to That they can express themselves freely in schools and at other places What will we accomplish at the end of the day by teaching children to not express themselves because they might not be accepted in society So many trans gay disabled kids kids of color already go through every concern you expressed What are we doing for their safety
