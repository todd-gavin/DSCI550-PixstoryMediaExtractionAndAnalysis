Why do I still care?

It disturbs my mind,

After all the things I hear,

Still I want to know how you are.



Thoughts used to be of a future,

Now they seep blood,

I can’t see past red,

You took the little purple I had away,


My only worry were you,

How would I secure a tomorrow?

That’s all i used to think,

Then the present altogether disappeared.


I remember that day by heart,
Our only little meeting,

How we looked into each others’ eyes,

Yours were clearly more beautiful.


I whispered a few words to you,

Do you remember,

Well how would you?

Someone else resides in your heart now.


I’m still here,

Love isn’t the only reason,

It’s a certain promise,
That keeps me bound here.


It wasn’t made to you,

But to this careless dumb heart,
“Be there for her,

Even when she abandons you.”



My thought will never come,

I’m easily forgotten,
If it does some unfortunate day,

Do lend me a few words.


Tried to forget it,

Put it in the past,

Well I see your fave everywhere,

So, tell me how can I?

Maybe I was too proud of this love,

I couldn’t remember Icarus,

Though he died once,

Unlike me, I die everyday.


The tears have soaked,

I’ve started to hate destiny,

It took you away,

“Whats meant to be, will be.”


I used to believe it,

Until you left,

Now I just study and explore,
New ways to explore these emotions.
