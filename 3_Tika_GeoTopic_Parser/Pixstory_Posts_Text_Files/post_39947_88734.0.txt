Ordinarily we all are guided by desire. The fulfillment of desire makes us happy. But this happiness is transitory. The motive of all our actions is satisfaction of our personal ego. Our life is nothing but a chain of bondage. We are slave to our desire, passion, ego, liking, disliking and many impulses of our lower nature to which we do not have any control. Under these circumstances we lose ourselves in our happiness, grief and pleasure.
 
To get rid of this situation, we follow certain rules as prescribed by our Gurus. But most of the cases, in following this we forget our true aim of life and cling to the means and entangle us in clumsy net of superstition. This superstition is very much deep-rooted. I have seen a vegetarian atoned for taking non-vegitarian item unknowingly. Again while fasting, we forcefully suppress our desire. Forceful suppression stands on the same level as free indulgence since in both cases, the desire remains. 
"The difference between suppression and inward essential rejection is the difference between mental or moral control and a spiritual purification."(Sri Aurobindo, Letters on Yoga, p1398)

In life we need to face all the situations calmly and develop detachment and equality within us. Our spiritual progress needs aspiration for higher consciousness, strong will for the sadhana, development of divine qualities; surrender to indwelling divine and not by mere artificial or physical means. We should not be slave to anything but to make us free from all bondages.
