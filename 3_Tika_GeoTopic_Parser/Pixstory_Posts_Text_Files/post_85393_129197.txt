This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers Darker than the colorless beards of old men Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women And the hints about old men and mothers and the offspring taken soon out of their laps What do you think has become of the young and old men And what do you think has become of the women and children They are alive and well somewhere The smallest sprout shows there is really no death And if ever there was it led forward life and does not wait at the end to arrest it And ceas d the moment life appear d All goes onward and outward nothing collapses And to die is different from what any one supposed and luckier Walt Whitman
