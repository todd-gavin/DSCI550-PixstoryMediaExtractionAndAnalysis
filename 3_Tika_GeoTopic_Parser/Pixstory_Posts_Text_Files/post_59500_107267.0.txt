Gandhi, who is being interrogated by officials of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for the second day in a row in the National Herald money laundering case, shared a tweet in Hindi on the announcement made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding the jobs.
"Just like eight years ago the youth were deceived with a promise of two crore jobs every year, in the same manner it is now the turn of 10 lakh government jobs. This is a government of not 'jumlas' (rhetoric) but 'maha jumlas'," the former Congress chief said.
