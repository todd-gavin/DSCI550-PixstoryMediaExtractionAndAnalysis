Beautyblender makeup sponge
It's that easy! When to use this makeup sponge: Use to apply foundation, concealer, beauty balms (more commonly known as bb creams), serums and moisturizers. The good: The beautyblender is known for the flawless, poreless finish it can provide.

In order to really get the most out of your makeup sponge, follow our 3-step process: wet, squeeze, and bounce.

Wet
Many people are surprised to find that the Beautyblender makeup sponge is meant to be used when wet. Before each use, run it under your faucet until it’s fully soaked.

Squeeze
Once your Beautyblender makeup sponge is fully saturated, it’s time to squeeze it out. The goal is to apply your makeup with a damp blender, so you’ll want to wring out all of the excess water. 

Bounce
Now for the fun part: the bounce. Bounce powder or liquid foundation, bb cream, or concealer across your skin for a flawless finish. Pro tip: we don’t recommend dragging the blender across your face.
