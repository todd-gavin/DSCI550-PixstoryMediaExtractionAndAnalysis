Don Young, the longest-serving member of Alaska's congressional delegation and a blunt-speaking Republican, has died. He was 88 years old when he died. 
Young's death was reported by his office in a statement released late Friday night. 

Politico reported that Young, who was first elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1973, was noted for his harsh demeanour. His off-color remarks and gaffes sometimes overshadowed his efforts in his later years in office. He described himself as aggressive and less-than-perfect during his 2014 reelection campaign, but he pledged he will not stop fighting for Alaska.

President Joe Biden on Saturday paid tribute to Young in a statement. “There is no doubt that few legislators have left a greater mark on their state. Don’s legacy lives on in the infrastructure projects he delighted in steering across Alaska. In the opportunities he advanced for his constituents. In the enhanced protections for Native tribes he championed. His legacy will continue in the America he loved,” Biden said

U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri talked about how some of his favorite stories as Republican Whip in the House are about Don Young. He added that nobody represented their state better or with more determination than Don Young represented Alaska. 

May his soul rest in peace.
