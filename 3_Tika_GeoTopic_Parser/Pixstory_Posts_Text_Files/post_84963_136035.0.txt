Barcelona forward Memphis Depay has sent a message to all the supporters after deciding to stay at the Camp Nou this season.
The La Liga side had been trying to off-load the attacker to make room for other signings and were ready to let him go for a small fee or even free. The Dutchman has been strongly linked with Juventus, Manchester United and Chelsea.
However, he didn’t like any of the available options and decided to fulfill the final year of his contract with the Spanish team. Announcing his stay at Barcelona, Depay took to Twitter to post a message which read:
“I have decided to stay at Barça ! Fully committed to contribute to the club's sporting success. #ViscaBarca”.
Depay landed at Barcelona last summer on a free transfer from Lyon at the command of Ronald Koeman, who was the manager of the side at that time. The striker made 38 appearances last season, netting 13 times and assisting two goals.
Since Xavi Hernandez became the manager of Barca, the Dutch forward’s role has seen a fall. With the club signing more quality forwards this season, it was evident that Depay would be left far behind in the competition.
But failing to reach any transfer agreement will see him continue to play for the Blaugrana. With Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang moving to Chelsea, the Dutchman's role has now become an important chunk of the side who can serve as a quality back-up to newly arrived striker Robert Lewandowski.
Depay, who has proven experience of playing in the Premier League, was very close to signing for Chelsea as they are in need of quality attackers after they lost Romelu Lukaku to Inter Milan on loan and Timo Werner rejoined RB Leipzig on a permanent deal.
Thomas Tuchel has used Kai Havertz and Raheem Sterling in false 9 roles, which have not paid the dividends so far. Aubameyang has already worked with Tuchel at Borussia Dortmund and his arrival would give the Blues a proper striker.
