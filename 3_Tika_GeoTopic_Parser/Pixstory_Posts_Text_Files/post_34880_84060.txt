Corporate revolution in Chelsea Given what is happening between Russia and Ukraine, the owner of the Blues Roman Abramovich has decided to step aside and leave the administrative control of the club to the administrators of the Chelsea Charity Foundation This according to the English tabloids could be a step before the sale of the company The decision came given Abramovich&#39;s closeness to Putin and given the sanctions that could come from the British government against Russians who do business in the United Kingdom According to rumors, offers to buy Chelsea have already arrived but the decision has not yet been made whether to proceed or not In any case it seems that the valuation of the club is in the billions of euros During my almost years of ownership of Chelsea I have always considered my role as that of caretaker of the Club whose task is to ensure the greatest success we can have today as well as build something for the future and at the same time play a positive role in our communities wrote Roman Abramovich announcing the transfer of management I have always made decisions with the interest of the Club at heart I remain faithful to these values Thats why I am today entrusting the trustees of the Chelsea Charity Foundation with the management and care of Chelsea FC I believe they are currently best placed to look after the interests of the Club players staff and supporters
