Brahmastra Part One- Shiva is officially back on track. After four successive days, where the film’s domestic box office collections showed big drops, the film has picked up again in its second weekend. On its second Saturday – September 17 – the film showed a huge 50 percent growth in collections across India, raising promises of a healthy lifetime run. It also overtook The Kashmir Files in terms of global earnings to become this year’s highest-earning Hindi film. The nett domestic collection of the film is now the second-highest for all Hindi films this year, crossing Kartik Aaryan’s Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, which collected ₹185 crore in India. In that list, Brahmastra is still behind Vivek Agnihotri’s The Kashmir Files, which had nett collections of ₹252 crore. It is to be noted that The Kashmir Files’ budget of ₹15 crore was a mere fraction of Brahmastra’s overall budget.Trade analysts have said that the jump on Sunday may not be as high now, but even a mild rise will give the film a chance to register a ₹40-crore second weekend, which is a very healthy number. The absence of major releases in this weekend has helped the film, something that will continue next weekend as well. In fact, Brahmastra virtually has no competition at the Indian box office till Vikram Vedha and Ponniyin Selvan: I arrive on September 30. That means the film should break into the ₹300-crore club domestically, if all goes well.
