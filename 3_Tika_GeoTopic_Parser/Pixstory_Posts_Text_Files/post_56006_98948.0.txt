‌The loss suffered by Conservatives of almost 500 seats in the local elections might put extra pressure on Boris Johnson.
‌
‌The Labour Party which wasn't dominant for a long time in powerplay now has won control in Wandsworth, Barnet, and Westminster - three main thresholds held by conservatives. The Labour party also earned control in some regions of Wales and Scotland, as well as some regions of England. This could be the results of scandals faced by Johnson and members of his party on issues of Brexit - a project Johnson championed - and sickened by the Prime Minister's lockdown rules and sexual misconduct claims against other prominent Conservatives. 
‌
‌Yet Labour party did not sustain much of its victory throughout the UK, especially in working-class northern England, where PM Johnson successfully wooed voters in the 2019 election. PM Johnson had promised to strengthen local economies and opportunities following Britain's withdrawal from the European Union. Moreover, people vote for their needs which aren't fulfilled by Boris Johnson- inflation and soaring prices are examples.
‌
‌we all know local elections don't exactly predict the general elections. But this should be considered a warning.  Although Conservative losses are not as bad as some in the party had warned, there was still criticism of Mr Johnson from his side, with several Conservative council leaders blaming him after they underwent defeats locally.
