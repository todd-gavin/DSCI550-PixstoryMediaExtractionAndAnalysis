After the thousand emotions of the derby Stefano Pioli analyzed the match to the microphones of DAZN We are a team that never gives up with players who go beyond their limits and difficulties A victory that must give us more conviction but there is a lot to do knowing that we have the same points as last year After the first half I told the boys to believe it The obstacles are insurmountable for those who don&#39;t believe in it We must continue like this it is a great satisfaction to win the derby at Inter&#39;s home best team in the championship Now let&#39;s throw ourselves at the Italian Cup A question of mentality the one brought back to AC Milan by the managers Maldini and Massara above all and by the arrival of Pioli and Zlatan Ibrahimovic the big absentee from this match today Then the Milan coach returned to talking about the uphill match in the first half but then won in the second At the beginning we made the right choices There was space to go deep sometimes but Kessie was not served And a few too many passes allowed Inter to restart I think that in the second half we were already playing the game Inter waited for us and when we once we dominated the field, we needed more agility and freshness, hence the choices Messias and Brahim In closing, the coach spared no compliments for his number The purchase of Giroud or the fact that the club has included players who have already won something it can teach young people a lot Those who have never won don&#39;t know what it takes to win And with those who have won something you raise your level These are very important signals that young people are taking on board Finally, there was also room for a nice little curtain I promise if the derby wins to make a foil I adore my Tuscan cigar so much and I won&#39;t smoke it for a month Maybe it will do me some good Credits Photos Twitter profile AC Milan
