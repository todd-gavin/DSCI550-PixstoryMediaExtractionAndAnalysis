A biosensor is a device used to detect biological responses such as heart rate or brain waves and then convert those responses into measurable data Biosensor technology has potential to make a sizeable impact in the healthcare industry as well as the day to day lives of all who use them monitoring health or helping to make smarter decisions biosensors have an important role to play moving forward Today biosensor technology drives much of the mobile and wearable device industry For example ECG biosensors make it possible for people to use their mobile wearable devices to measure everything from their heart and breathing rates to their stress and fatigue levels all while going about their typical routines Biosensors in Environmental Monitoring have been found in widespread use for the detection of chemical agents organic pollutants potentially toxic elements and pathogens that might pose a health hazard For example a biosensor was developed to detect pesticides such as organophosphate and carbamate and also monitor their effects on the environment Biosensors detect pollutants by measuring colour light fluorescence or electric current Biosensors in Food Industry and Smart Packaging used for determination of particular compounds in foods In agriculture and food industries early detection and sensitive analysis of potential contaminants and toxins is crucial and driven by a multiplicity of factors such as the short shelf life of many fresh food products etc There is a growing consumer demand for developing technology to ensure the safety of food products The quality of food is usually determined by the environment in which products are packaged and delivered to the consumer Biosensor in medicine have a vast significance In medicine biosensors can be used to monitor blood glucose levels in diabetics detect pathogens and diagnose and monitor cancer Early intervention with the help of biosensor technology will provide the opportunity to cure illness and even prevent it before it happens In terms of detection of cancer By measuring levels of certain proteins secreted by tumor cells biosensors can detect whether a tumor is present whether it is benign or cancerous and whether treatment has been effective in reducing or eliminating cancerous cells
