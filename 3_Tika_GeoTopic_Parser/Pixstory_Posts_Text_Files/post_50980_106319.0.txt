According to various studies, it has been proved that some of our bad habits lead to this disorder. Here are a few things we must stop doing before going to bed for a sound sleep.

1. Do Not Go To Bed Immediately After Having Your Dinner. You must give a gap of two hours between your dinner and the time you go to sleep. This is because your body doesnâ€™t let you sleep until the digestion process is complete.

2. Avoid Drinking Coffee At Least 4 to 5 Hours Before You Go To Sleep. Caffeine stimulates your brain and keeps you awake. So, drink it only when you wish to stay awake.

3. Do Not Sleep At Irregular Timings. Sleeping at any time of the day can disturb your sleep at night. Follow a routine and sleep at the same time every day so that your body gets used to it.

4. Do Not Exercise Just Before Going To Sleep.

5. Do Not Sleep On Your Stomach. Try to find the position that you are most comfortable in and then sleep in that position. Sleeping on the left side will aid sound sleep.

6. Try To Stay Away From Electric Gadgets. Staring at mobile phones, tablets or laptop stimulates your brain, and prevents you from sleeping peacefully. Keep your bed gadget-free.
