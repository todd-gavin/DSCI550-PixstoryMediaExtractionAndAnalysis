If there's one thing we cherish all the time, it's the constant bonding with our mum since childhood, whom I wouldn't say I love the most because there's no one I could possibly love more than her.

There is nothing unusual or unique about our everyday routine; it is kind of the same every day in some way or another.

Absurdities make us laugh.ðŸ˜‚
I disturb and annoy her every minute.ðŸ˜›
We keep fighting about the same things on and on.ðŸ¥º
She continues to scream whenever she is in the mood, as if her vocal chords are equipped with a microphone.ðŸ˜Ž
But, through all of it, what we always have in common is the constant love and care between us.ðŸ’›

So here's wishing all the lovely mom's,
A very Happy Mother's Day! ðŸ’Ÿ
