Reigning NCAA champion David McCormack of Kansas worked out for the Los Angeles Lakers on June in the franchise s third round of pre draft showings After an inconsistent McCormack finished the season on a high note putting up with points and rebounds to help Kansas complete the largest comeback in NCAA championship game history and beat North Carolina The foot forward averaged points rebounds and blocks in games last season He is known for his commanding presence in the paint and rebounding skills McCormack felt he showcased those qualities in the workout with the Lakers and proved his shooting range isn t as limited as people think Today I definitely showed my strengths as far as being strong being physical rebounding getting second possessions the year old said During a skill and drill work during shooting drills I was able to show that I had somewhat of a perimeter shot and doing pretty well on all ball screen defense McCormack is an older draft prospect having played a full four years of college basketball But the forward thinks his experience and familiarity with the pressure of representing a renowned institution would make him a good match with the Lakers Being an older guy gives me I would say an understanding of the game IQ experience playing through adversity and then also playing for Kansas you always have a target on your back just being one of those programs he said When you re with the Lakers organization you have a target on your back you know Everybody loves the Lakers Huge fan base and everybody s always gunning for them so I kind of have that same mindset as if I m playing for Kansas to the Lakers You have to have the same mental fortitude and that transition
