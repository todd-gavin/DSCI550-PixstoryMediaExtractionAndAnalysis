‌We need a constructive and clear cut approach as gender disparities in politics to vary across geography.
‌
A comparison of state rankings on the overall U.S. WPS Index finds the highest-ranked states are Massachusetts, Connecticut, Washington D.C., Vermont, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire, indicating greater opportunities for women in the Northeast, particularly in New England. In contrast, the lowest-ranked are Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Kentucky, and West Virginia, indicating fewer rights and opportunities for women in the Southeast. Mississippi and Louisiana have among the highest majority of women who are working poor, the very low state-level political representation of women, no laws requiring domestic abusers subject to protective orders to renounce firearms, and large gender gaps in perception of public safety in local neighbourhoods. 

Between women, there are racial disparities in politics. Black, Latina, and Native American women have a lower level of representation in politics. These differences are seen in other aspects of health, deaths, violence etc. In the absence of addressing these issues with an intersectional lens, gender equality cannot be achieved. Hence intersection representation is necessary to find the needs of women from different geography or races. 
 
Hence it is necessary to Eliminate geographic variation of women’s rights and opportunities across the U.S. States.	Promote racial equality and economic justice essential to achieving gender equality and representation in politics. Without addressing these concerns effectively we cannot address the problem of women. It is about women from all sections of society, of all races and statuses being represented in politics so that we can address the issues of every woman!
