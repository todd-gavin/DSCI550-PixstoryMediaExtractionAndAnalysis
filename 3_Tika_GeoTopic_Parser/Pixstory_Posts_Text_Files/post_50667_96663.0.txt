As part of Vote Compass, Australia's largest study of voter views, ABC News asked Australians how serious they think corruption is today. 

Just under half of Australians (49%) believe corruption is a major issue, while 36% believe it is "somewhat of a problem." 
Only 1% of us believe that corruption is not a problem. 

Depending on which party you intend to vote for, opinions on the size of the corruption problem varies. In Australia, less Liberal and National supporters appear to be concerned about corruption. Only 3% believe it isn't a problem at all. Nineteen percent believe it is "very much a problem."

Of Labor voters, 55 per cent believe it is "very much a problem", and that increases to 62 per cent for Greens voters and about 44 per cent of Australians who intend to vote for the Coalition believe corruption is "somewhat of a problem". 

Analysts are not surprised by the results splitting along party lines. The topic of corruption and its impact on important policy decisions has been front and centre in recent years, with Labor accusing the Coalition of proposing a toothless federal integrity commission.
