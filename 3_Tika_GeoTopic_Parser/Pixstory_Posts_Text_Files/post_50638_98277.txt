The root of all anti abortion laws is misogyny It is a plain desire to establish control rather dominance over the bodies of women hiding behind a facade of right to life It is ironic how in this country people on one side fight for their rights to not wear a mask because it is their body and on the other hand fight for a woman to forcefully carry a baby in her body she does not want Exactly like a parasite The main argument of people who are anti abortion is that abortion constitutes as murder It is ironic how our lawmakers claim to care so much about unborn babies but this regard goes out the window when it comes to children in foster homes who are growing up in sub par conditions We have to realise that banning abortion will not ensure that abortions will not happen it will just make sure that SAFE ABORTIONS do that happen There have been instances where women have resorted to extreme measures like throwing themselves down the stairs using court hangers and taking drugs to get rid of the foetus for various reasons Some are rape victims some are not physically capable of carrying a baby to term some are not financially stable and some simply don t want to be mothers It is high time we recognise the fact that women are not mere wombs put on this earth to reproduce We are rational individuals and no other person has a right to decide what we do with our bodies We have come a long way when it comes to women s rights but we still have a long way to go Overturning Roe vs Wade will take us back a hundred years and we must stop it
