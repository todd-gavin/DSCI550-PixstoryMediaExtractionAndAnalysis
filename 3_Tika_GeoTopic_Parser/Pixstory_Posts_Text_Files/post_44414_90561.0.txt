Carlos Tevez
Carlos Tevez is the most well-known of all the players to have played for both Manchester clubs. After a season in London, the Argentinian came to Old Trafford after a contentious move to West Ham in 2006. He played with United for two seasons, but he never really established himself as a regular starter. In each of his seasons there, he won the Premier League, as well as the Champions League in 2008.

At the end of those two years, his contract was renewed, and he moved across Manchester to join City. Despite a split with Roberto Mancini midway through the season, he was part of the team that won City's first Premier League title in 2012. He played for the Etihad for four seasons, scoring 73 goals in 148 appearances in all competitions.
