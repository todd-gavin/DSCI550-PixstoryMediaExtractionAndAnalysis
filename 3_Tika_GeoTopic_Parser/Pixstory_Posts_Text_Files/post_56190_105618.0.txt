After a report found financial firms and individuals linked to the sector donated £15m to political parties and gave £2m to MPs during the pandemic, there have been some concerns over the City’s influence on Westminster, 

The campaign group called Positive Money estimated the gifts, expenses and donations oh handed to MPs, peers and their parties, as well as the income from politicians’ second jobs, AS contributed to financing’s “oversized influence” on policymaking.

Many banks, insurers and lobby groups have held a disproportionate amount of meetings with the Treasury. It is also recorded that the Conservative party was the biggest recipient of City donations to political parties, accounting for more than £11m or 76% of donated cash over the two years.

“Once the scale of big finance’s influence over government is laid bare, it becomes obvious how banks get bailouts and tax cuts while the rest of us get austerity and tax rises,” said David Barmes, a senior economist at Positive Money.


About £1.2m of that total was obtained by just five Conservative politicians, including former prime minister Theresa May, who was paid more than £200,000 for speeches at events run by JP Morgan and Amundi Asset Management, and the health secretary, Sajid Javid, who was paid a total of £175,000 for his former role as a senior adviser for JP Morgan, as well as speeches for firms including HSBC.
