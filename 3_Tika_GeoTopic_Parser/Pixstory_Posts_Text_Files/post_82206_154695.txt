As Bengalis we are really fond of our cuisine and dishes Kolkata Biriyani is the favourite of every Bengali one we cherish and relish it on any occasion possible It is jarring for many of us when we travel out of Bengal or move out to find that Biriyani doesn t taste same like home It is even more shocking to find that there are no potatoes in it the most loved part of it So why is it that only Kolkata Biriyani has potatoes in it The most common story circulating about the origin of potatoes in Biriyani is that when Nawab Wajid Ali Shah was deposed by British and settled in Metiabruz he brought along his few courtiers and servants and introduced the Awadhi culture including Biriyani But when the funds started dwindling the chefs decided to add potatoes to cut the costs and add to the dish But was the Nawab really poor From the records we learn that Nawab kept a large menagerie of animals and even housed tigers He spent a whopping rupess just on food for animals Such a man could be anything but poor Instead if we see it from this point of view that it was time when for the first time the Portuguese introduced potatoes chillies and tomatoes on Indian soil Thus it was considered a rare and exotic vegetable even offered as gifts in the higher circles So the chefs added this exotic vegetable to Biriyani This was loved by the nobles The British wanted it to be believed that that the Nawab of Awadh one of the biggest kingdoms was weak thus proving their claims Hence these lies were spread Anyways next time you eat and revel in the deliciousness of the Kolkata Biriyani thank Nawab Wajid Ali Shah and his chefs for making this wonder
