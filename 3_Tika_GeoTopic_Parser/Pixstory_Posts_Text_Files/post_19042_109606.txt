Matteo Berrettini will start Wimbledon playing the match against the Chilean Cristian Garin number in the world The Roman tennis player first of all returning from over days of forced rest after the operation on his right hand but also from the double victory of the Stuttgart and Queen s tournaments which bode well for Wimbledon since both were on grass Berrettini starts as the favorite but a round that could reveal more pitfalls than the second round in which the winner will face the other winner of the challenge between the Swiss Marc Andrea Hsler and the French lucky loser Hugo Grenier forecasts become more complicated The most difficult opponent would be the American Jenson Brooksby Doubts increase for the round of 16 where, looking at the scoreboard, the one most to fear would be the Australian Alex De Minaur For the quarterfinals there is a great chance that Berrettini will face Tsisipas but in the semifinal perhaps the toughest opponent Rafa Nadal could meet In the final instead there could be Djokovic for a remake of last year&#39;s final
