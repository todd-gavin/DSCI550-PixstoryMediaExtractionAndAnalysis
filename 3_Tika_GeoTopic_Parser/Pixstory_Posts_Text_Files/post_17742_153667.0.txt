Photographer Misan Harriman has shared a pair of new, never-before-seen portraits of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.
Taken on September 5 at the One Young World Summit in Manchester, they show Prince Harry and Meghan Markle holding hands before they walk out in front of the audience. In one, the couple looks straight at the camera, whereas in the second, Harriman captures them in profile. The duchess is wearing a fire red bow blouse and tailored paints from eco-conscious brand Another Tomorrow, while the duke wears a blue suit. “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex moments before attending the opening ceremony of One Young World last month,” Harriman captioned the photos on Instagram.
Markle gave a speech at the event, which aims to empower youth leaders to build a better and more sustainable future. “We often hear people say, ‘The time is now,’ but I’m going to double down on that by saying your time is now,” she said to the crowd. “The important work can’t wait for tomorrow.”
Three days later, on September 8, Buckingham Palace announced the death of Queen Elizabeth II. The couple continued to make appearances around the United Kingdom, alongside various other members of the royal family, to honor the monarch. “Granny, while this final parting brings us great sadness, I am forever grateful for all of our first meetings—from my earliest childhood memories with you, to meeting you for the first time as my Commander-in-Chief, to the first moment you met my darling wife and hugged your beloved great-grandchildren,” Harry wrote in a public statement about his grandmother. “I cherish these times shared with you, and the many other special moments in between. You are already sorely missed, not just by us, but by the world over."
Recently, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, along with King Charles and Queen Consort Camilla, also shared a portrait from the night before Queen Elizabeth’s funeral.
