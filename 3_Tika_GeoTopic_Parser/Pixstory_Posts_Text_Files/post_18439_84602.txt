Juventus seems to have become unstoppable in the league to the point of having reduced the margin from the leaders Milan Napoli to just points Distance which instead reached over points just a couple of months ago All this despite the many injuries that affected all departments including the defense prolonged absences of Chiellini and Bonucci have in fact given De Ligt more responsibility which he likes a lot I have noticed that the club is giving me more and more responsibility which I like I realize that I can take on an important role I think at some point we were fourteen points behind the leaders said the defender Then we put the Scudetto out of our minds a bit we said we had to concentrate to get to the Champions League and since then we&#39;ve been looking at it match by match Inter Milan and Napoli are continuing to drop points and now we are only seven points away A miracle should happen but the situation already seems better than in games ago One of the assets for the end of the season Vlaovich striker who arrived in January and is already a protagonist in both the league and the Champions League We lost Ronaldo at the end of the summer and of course with his departure thirty goals were lost We couldn&#39;t immediately sign someone like Vlahovic because it was late We certainly missed this at the beginning Always on Vlaovich When I played against him I had already noticed how strong and technically good he was And what made me he really impressed his motivation to score he almost called his team mates if he didn&#39;t receive the ball I needed a striker like him up front
