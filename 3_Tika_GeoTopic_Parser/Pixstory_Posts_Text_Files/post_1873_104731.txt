As a Reader in Physics at Dhaka University in a young man arguably the most brilliant student of Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose and Sir Prafulla Chandra Roy submitted a paper in quantum physics for publication in the research magazine of the University The paper was rejected by the editorial board Undaunted he sent the paper to none other than Albert Einstein on this very day June th in with a letter asking him if it could be published in the Zeitschrift fur Physik an esteemed journal of Physics in German He also requested Einstein to translate the paper as he felt that his own German may not be adequate for same Einstein not only translated the paper and had it published but appended it with the line Bose s method of derivation in my opinion signifies a forward step The rest was history This paper which suggested a statistical description of quantum mechanical systems in which there is no restriction on the way in which energy of particles can be distributed laid the groundwork for the subsequently well known Bose Einstein Statistics and the theory of the Bose Einstein Condensate On this very special day and forever I bow in reverence to the scientific greatness that was Satyendra Nath Bose the Quantum Indian and Father of the God particles Note Thanks to Google for helping us remember this historical day with their very creative doodle
