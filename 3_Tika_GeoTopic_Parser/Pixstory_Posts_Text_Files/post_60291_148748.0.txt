However, the former India Test captain and cricketer lost his cool with a member of his own side during the Duleep Trophy Final.
Even though West Zone dominated in the game, Ajinkya Rahane and Yashasvi Jaiswal's interaction attracted everyone's attention. When West Zone was fielding in the fourth inning of the game, Rahane became enraged and motioned for his teammate Yashasvi Jaiswal to leave the field.
While the BCCI has not released an official statement regarding what truly happened, many have alleged that Jaiswal used foul language, got into a dispute with a South Zone player, and was given repeated warnings from both the player and the umpire.
People have begun responding to this on Twitter after seeing it; some are in favour of it, while others are angry with Rahane for acting against a member of his own team; some are also drawing comparisons between this incident and Harmanpreet Kaur's response to her baller Deepti Sharma's controversial run out against England.
Yashasvi did eventually enter the game, though, as West Zone went on to win by a score of 294 runs, with Jaiswal scoring a spectacular double hundred in their second inning to add 265 runs. In addition, he received the Man of the Match award for his efforts.
