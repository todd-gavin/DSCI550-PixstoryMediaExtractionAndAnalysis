This is not Afghanistan, it's a black hole that blinds a generation with its desires in the darkness of being dug up, where not humans but animals decide.
Here is a chessboard where the king and the minister dance to their own tune, but the losers are the same women who have sacrificed for so many years.
My country, you are a black hole for me

"My mother was told not to go to school today; "Girls are not allowed to go to school," said a 10-year-old school girl. "Thousands of girls cried behind closed doors today." Will the same group be recognized by the world?
The Taliban, a terrorist group that blew up schools for years, filled and killed students. This black group of girls desecrates us because of their gender. Women are discriminated against. They have been deprived of the right to work and participate in society. Afghanistan is the only country in the world where girls are not allowed to go to school. Has Taliban changed to black? It is always black on the Taliban, but on those who wrote, lobbied and wanted to have a piece of bread in the bloodthirsty, murderous and misogynistic Taliban regime, it is blacker, uglier and dirtier than the Taliban. This is the demand of the one who today slapped a generation of the children of that land with a slap of ignorance and said; You are not allowed to go to school.
Today, our girls have asked with tears in their eyes: "We are human beings, why don't we go to school? Is studying a crime?"

After seven months of waiting, the Taliban again refused to allow Afghan female students in the seventh grade to attend school.
