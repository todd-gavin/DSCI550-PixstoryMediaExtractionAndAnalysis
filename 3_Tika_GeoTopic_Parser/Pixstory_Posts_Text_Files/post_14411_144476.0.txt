A study conducted by a team of Indian-
origin researchers has found that the impact of breathing diesel exhaust fumes may be more severe for women than men.

The researchers looked for changes in people's blood brought about by exposure to diesel exhaust.

In both females and males, they found changes in components of the blood related to inflammation, infection and cardiovascular disease, but they found more changes
in females than males.

Among the proteins that differed between females and males, were some that are known to play a role in inflammation, damage repair, blood clotting, cardiovascular
disease and the immune system.
"These are preliminary findings, however they show that exposure to diesel exhaust has different effects in female bodies compared to male and that could indicate that air pollution is more dangerous for females than males,
" sayS Professor Neeloffer Mookherjee.

This is important as respiratory diseases such as asthma are known to affect females and males differently, with females more likely to suffer severe asthma that does not respond to treatments.

The research will be presented at the European Respiratory Society.
