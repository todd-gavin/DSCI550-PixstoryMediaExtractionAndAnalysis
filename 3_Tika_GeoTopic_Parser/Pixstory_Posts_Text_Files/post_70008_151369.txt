Do you actually need an intimate hygiene wash You must have seen hundreds and thousands of ads for these vaginal wahses that claim to clean and detoxify and pH balance and lighten and brighten etc ect etc Make some magical changes outside of your vagina if and only if you use their vaginal wash But do you actually need them Well the answer is simple but not so simple The idea is that if you want to use a gentle mild wash you can use it but you don t HAVE to use it and if are going to use it you only need to use it on the outside which is the vulva The vulva is the part of your body that touches your cloth the parts that you see The vagina is actually the thing on the inside so the the vagina is the canal inside So if you were to insert your finger that would be the vagina You don t need to put anything inside the vagina not even water if you want to clean you can clean the vulva with a wash or with water it s totally your choice
