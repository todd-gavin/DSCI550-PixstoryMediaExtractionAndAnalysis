Sex Education is losing another cast member. Tanya Reynolds, who played Lily on the series, revealed she won't be returning for season four of the hit Netflix series. 

Tanya explained the loss of Moordale's resident expert on all things erotic and aliens during a recent interview, Entertainment Weekly reports. Speaking with Radio Times, she said, “It's just the natural progression of these shows — when you have such big ensemble casts and so many characters, I think you have to let a few older characters go to make way for newer ones, which is absolutely the right thing, the way it should happen.”

She continued, saying, “I loved every minute of it and I loved Lily with my whole entire heart. Three seasons was just a really perfect amount for me."
