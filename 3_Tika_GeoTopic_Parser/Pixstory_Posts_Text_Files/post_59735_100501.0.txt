The inspiration for this artwork came while reading a collection of haiku.haaiku is a tiny verse form in which Japanese poets have neen working for hundreds of years.Many such poets were students of zen. These poets expressed the rapturous awareness in that mystical philosophy of life in all its forms..the haiku which inspired me is below 
In these dark waters 
Drawn up from my frozen well ..
Glittering of spring
