Alessio Dionisi&#39;s Sassuolo falls at the Unipol Domus in Cagliari This is the comment from the Neroverdi coach at the end of the match to the microphones of DAZN We were less good and determined than in the previous match Cagliari deserved the result on the pitch We handled the ball badly on our way back often behind I&#39;m very angry We need the stimulus of the big names a limit that we need to improve with everyone&#39;s help We didn&#39;t have a wrong approach but a wrong reading of the race In the second we created something but we could have done even better We don&#39;t expect easy races we have to put always against all teams also because if you give your best with Inter Juve or Napoli you can still lose The goal We have to improve and consolidate our position in the standings
