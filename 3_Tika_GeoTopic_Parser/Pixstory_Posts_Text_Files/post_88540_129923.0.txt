Released in 2015 , this Bollywood movie is a seven star 🌟 with meaningful content, superhit songs and excellent acting, a total power package. This blockbuster movie  completed its seven years , still every glimpse of the movie is well settled on my mind.

It is one of my favourite movie and the quality which fascinates me more is its title, Bajrangi - the hindu God and Bhaijaan - an urdu word which  denotes brother.

 The Title signifies Unity , love and brotherhood. I yearn to see more such movies in our Bollywood industry.🤍
