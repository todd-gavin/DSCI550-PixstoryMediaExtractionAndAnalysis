Many people have severe anxiety issues about sex and relationships. This might hold them from having the intimate connection that they crave. This might be insecurity and sensitiveness to rejection and it takes years for some people to build a connection mentally and physically.
‌
‌even though you might be okay with it your age might be an issue for you. Those commenting and judging you for not settling down don't know settling down doesn't mean having a boyfriend or getting married. There is no settling point in life as it has its ups and downs. 
‌
‌You have to understand each person is different you might need time to be intimate with someone you love and this might not be because of your lack of trust. It's okay to feel insecure if that's what works for you. Make sure you find a partner who understands you and never judges you. Or else you can separate mutually. 


It might be because of underlying generalised anxiety, avoidance issues, or phobias around sex, intimacy and even non-sexual intercourse.  Seek some help for these things, but above all respect who you are. You have high standards for relationships, and there is nothing wrong with anticipating a great deal of support from people with whom you become connected. Rejections come hand in hand and are ready to face and understand the fact that nothing is wrong with you.
