Seth Rollins has been on fire ever since he turned heel in the beginning of His character work has been so emaculate that it doesn t matter who he is featured against he makes them look like a star After a brief stint as The Messiah Rollins adopted the Drip God Persona and I haven t seen a better version of Rollins ever In the past year alone he has given us two of the all time best Wrestling Triologies one with Edge and the other with Cody Rhodes Rollins has nowhere to go but up from here and he needs ro be pushed into title contention soon as there is no one more deserving of a title run after the way he has placed himself He has become a mainstay feature attraction that can only be paralleled by Roman Reigns Rollins is on a run of a lifetime and it makes sense to put the MITB briefcase on him as he is a real threat to Roman Reigns as Reigns has never beaten Rollins in a Championship Match
