David Raya Under looked Brentford s Number has really established himself as a the ideal modern day keeper and for me is right up there with the very best currently The year old is quite a small presence at yet doesn t come across that way on the pitch being capable and a reassuring man to lay back on Profile David Raya is an incredible passer of the ball with great confidence and abilities on the ball Additionally he is a great sweeper imposes himself very impressively on the game Distribution The focal reason to write a piece on the year servant at Blackburn is the distribution it s out of this world Whether that be going direct to Toney finding Mbuemo with a long ball or just a simple clipped pass to Henry Raya is integral for evading press Not only does he allow an easy option in possession at all times due to his adaptability and passing capabilities but he is at the fore front of a lot of Brentford s possession on the ball with touches per David is also a great shot stopper with a save percentage fbref Ultimately Raya is press resistant incredible for buildup one of the best passers of the ball I ve ever seen for a keeper a competent commander great shot stopper reliable and is the full package for everything you d want from a keeper It s no surprise Arteta was after him a season before signing Ramsdale and it should be no surprise if some of the worlds best clubs or the Premier League s T are after him particularly Spurs United also gaining a well deserved Spain Call up He is that good
