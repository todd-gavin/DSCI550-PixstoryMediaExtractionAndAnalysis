Yashwant Sinha, a bureaucrat turned politician, has been named the Opposition candidate for the presidential poll slated for July 18. 

Nurtured by veteran BJP leader L K Advani, picked to head the prestigious Finance and External Affairs Ministries in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government of 1999 to 2004, Sinha who has reshaped his political profile since leaving the BJP under Narendra Modi has now emerged as the Opposition’s consensus candidate for the presidential elections.

While the NDA is not expected to face more than a few hiccups in the polls, Sinha’s candidature carries huge symbolism for both his former party as well as the Opposition, that is looking for a moral stand against the Modi government.
