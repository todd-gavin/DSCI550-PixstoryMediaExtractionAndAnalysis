Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of Delhi, has introduced a motion of confidence in the house today in an effort to demonstrate that all Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) lawmakers support him in the face of what he claims are BJP attempts to split his party and overthrow his government.
The day began with a voluble brawl between the BJP and AAP. Just prior to the trust vote, BJP MLAs were taken out the Delhi assembly for raising a disturbance.
 Arvind KejriwalÂ  claimed that the BJP had promised everyone of his MLAs 20 crore to switch sides. According to him the BJP has "purchased" 277 MLAs so far in order to overthrow numerous state governments across the nation, including those in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka. "Delhi has rejected the BJP's Lotus Operation. They failed to recruit even one AAP MLA "he stated.
53 of the 62 Delhi MLAs for the AAP were present at Arvind Kejriwal's meeting last week, which was held at his home. The remainder were basically present and accounted for, according to Mr. Kejriwal, who afterwards accompanied the MLAs to Rajghat, the site of Mahatma Gandhi's memorial.
"I've heard they're attempting to buy over 40 MLAs. I'm relieved that no MLA has caved down "After visiting Rajghat, Mr. Kejriwal made the statement.
Manish Sisodia, his deputy, allegedly stated that the BJP had offered to "close all cases" against him if he resigned from the AAP. In the 70-member Delhi assembly, AAP has 62 MLAs. The BJP now has eight and needs 28 more to reach a majority.
In a case involving suspected irregularities and corruption in Delhi's alcohol policy, which was implemented earlier this year and then reversed, the CBI recently conducted a raid at Mr. Sisodia's residence. The CBI's FIR on violations of the liquor regulation names Mr. Sisodia as the first of 15 accused. Additionally, the Enforcement Directorate has accused him of money laundering.
