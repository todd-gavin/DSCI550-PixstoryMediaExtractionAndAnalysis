The Vice President tweeted : 

" We can’t fail the American people on gun violence anymore. It’s time for the Senate to do something. Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Raise the age to purchase guns from 18 to 21. Strengthen background checks. Let's get this done".

"No 86-year-old should fear for her safety at the grocery store.
 
No 9-year-old should be afraid to go to school.
 
And no 18-year-old should be able to buy a weapon of war".
