Diamond and White Sapphire for Scorpio 
ascendant

Venus is not an auspicious planet for this ascendant as it controls death inflicting and loss creating houses in this ascendant. Venus becomes the Lord of the 7th house of relationships and death and the 12th house of expenditure, losses and bad habits. 

The gemstones ruled by Venus should be considered only when the Venus periods are operating. Individuals in whose charts Venus is posited in the 5th, 7th and 12th houses can wear diamond/white sapphires gems only when the Venus periods are operating and that too after a trial. 

Diamond and White Sapphire for Sagittarius ascendant 

In this ascendant ruled by Jupiter, Venus becomes the Lord of the 6th house of disease, debts and enemies and the 11th house of profits. Venus gemstones should only be considered when its planetary periods are operating. Individuals in whose charts – Venus is posited in 4, 2, 11th houses can wear diamond and white sapphire in Venus periods and that too after a trial. 

Diamond and White Sapphire for Capricorn ascendant

Maharishi Parasher in his classic, Brihat Parasher Hora Shastra classifies Venus as a powerful Yogkaraka planet (a planet capable of doing much good to an individual) for this ascendant. In this ascendant Venus becomes the Lord of the 5th trine house of higher knowledge, sudden windfall gains, mantra Shakti, divine grace, skills of diplomacy and negotiation and the 10th quadrant house of career and profession. 

Thus, by the virtue of owning one trine house and one quadrant house Venus becomes very powerful in this ascendant ruled by the Karmic planet-Saturn. Individuals, in whose charts-Venus is posited in 1, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11 
houses should wear diamond/white sapphire throughout life.
