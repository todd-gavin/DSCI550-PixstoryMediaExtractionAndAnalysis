According to reports by Sami Mokbel, new Arsenal signing Marquinhos will be facing a legal complaint from Wolverhampton Wanderers over a breach of contract. According to Wolves, the Brazilian forward from Sao Paulo had signed a pre-contract with the team, meaning he would be violating the same by signing for Arsenal. 

It has been said that the team has looked at hiring a law firm in Brazil to start proceedings against the player. It is yet to see if Wolves would bring charges against the Brazilian club for offering the player or Arsenal for moving in to sign the player. It has been said that Marquinhos has even completed his medical and is due to join the Gunners in the coming few days. This spin however, might slow down the transfer for a while. 

It is reported by Sportsmail that Marquinhosâ€™ current contract was set to expire on July 12. Wolves allege their contract with Marquinhos was signed for July 14. While Marquinhos had signed a five year deal with Sao Paola in 2019, he was just 16 years old then. The maximum FIFA allows underage players to sign are three years contracts - meaning Marquinhos would be a free agent this summer allowing his pre-contract with Wolves to stand. 

However, as Arsenal have paid Sao Paulo a small fee for the signing, they claim that they have the right to make the signing as well. Wolves are evaluating their legal options as the situation develops.
