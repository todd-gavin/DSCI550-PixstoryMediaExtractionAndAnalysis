BJP won the Rampur and Azamgarh Lok Sabha segments. Additionally, in Tripura, the saffron party won three of the four constituencies.

The BJP won five of the ten constituencies that were up for byelection on June 23, extending its winning streak.

The BJP won three out of four assembly seats in Tripura and took over the Samajwadi Party strongholds of Rampur and Azamgarh Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh after the byelection results for three Lok Sabha and seven Assembly seats in five states and Delhi were released on Sunday.

Despite its outstanding result in the most recent state elections, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) lost the Sangrur parliamentary constituency in Punjab but won the Rajinder Nagar district in Delhi.

The Samajwadi Party (SP) suffered a significant defeat when the BJP captured both of the Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh that were up for byelection on Thursday.

While the BJP's Ghanshayam Singh Lodhi defeated the SP's Asim Raja in the Rampur Lok Sabha byelection by a margin of more than 42,000 votes, the party's Dinesh Lal Yadav "Nirahua" won the Azamgarh segment by a margin of more than 8,000 votes.

Lodhi received more than 3.67 lakh votes (51.96%), whereas Asim Raja received almost 3.23 lakh votes (46 per cent).
