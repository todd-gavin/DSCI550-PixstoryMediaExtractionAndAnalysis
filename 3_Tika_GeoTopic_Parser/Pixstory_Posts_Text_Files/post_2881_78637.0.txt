It is the latest problem Israel is facing. But the government is showing no urgency to stop the attacks of Jewish settlers against Palestinians in West Bank. According to media reports in the country, radical Jewish organizations pelted stones at Palestinians' cars in the village of Hawara near the city of Nablus on Monday. 

These have been called "nationalist" attacks against the Palestinians. Although Israeli Public Security Minister Omer Barlev has described recent attacks as the "actions of a terrorist organization," analysts say that some government members could support these attacks.

The attacks have been taking for weeks now. When it was brought to the attention of the Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett in December, he called settler violence as an "insignificant phenomenon." (https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-they-re-trying-to-drive-us-out-spike-in-settler-violence-last-year-1.10466085)

In fact, the Israeli settler violence led to the 11-day war between Gaza and Israel in May last year. That resulted in the death of over 270 Palestinians and 13 Israelis. Can recent attacks lead to the situation spiralling out of control? People are divided on it. (https://english.alaraby.co.uk/opinion/israeli-violence-crescendos-western-media-shuts-its-eyes)

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), stated that in the first 10 months of 2021, there had been over 400 attacks against Palestinians by Jewish settlers. That number would spike even further if the attacks in December and January are included. (https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=27792&LangID=E)

The recent attacks has alarmed at least one senior official of Bennett's cabinet. In a letter to Jewish organisations, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid has said that "the government is committed to cracking down on acts of violence wherever they occur and on whoever is committing them." In a recent interview, Bennett said that he had asked Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) and the IDF chief of staff to control the violence. (https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/article-695171)
