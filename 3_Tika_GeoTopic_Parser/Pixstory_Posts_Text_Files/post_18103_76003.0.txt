Taylor Swift has issued a response to Damon Albarn on twitter. Damon is the front man of the band “Blur”, in a recent interview he bad said that Taylor Swift does not write her own songs. Taylor Swift is credited with writing and even co-writing all of her songs, she has called Albarn’s accusations, “completely false and so damaging.” 

Albarn in an interview talking about songwriting, when the Los Angeles Times interviewer said that Swift was a talented songwriter and she also co-writes, Albarn responded, “That doesn’t count. I know what co-writing is. Co-writing is very different to writing. I’m not hating on anybody, I’m just saying there’s a big difference between a songwriter and a songwriter who co-writes. Doesn’t mean that the outcome can’t be really great.” 

He continued, “A really interesting songwriter is Billie Eilish and her brother…I’m more attracted to that than to Taylor Swift. It’s just darker — less endlessly upbeat. Way more minor and odd. I think she’s exceptional.” 
Swift responded to these allegations on Twitter saying, “I was such a big fan of yours until I saw this… I write all of my own songs. Your hot take is completely false and so damaging. You don’t have to like my songs but it’s really ****** up to try and discredit my writing. Wow.” 
Swift in the end said, “PS I wrote this tweet all by myself in case you were wondering.” 
After this, Albarn publicly apologized on Twitter saying, “I totally agree with you. I had a conversation about songwriting and sadly it was reduced to clickbait. I apologize unreservedly and unconditionally. The last thing I would want to do is discredit your songwriting. I hope you understand.”
