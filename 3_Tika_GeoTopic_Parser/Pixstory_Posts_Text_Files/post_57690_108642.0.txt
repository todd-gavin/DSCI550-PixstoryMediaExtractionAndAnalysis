This is so annoying! Especially when it's a work file, something you actually need to send by a deadline and it's just gone! Poof!!😂🤦‍♀️
Scouring through all your folders, you just don't see it😂
It's like the file never existed😂
Even searching in Everything becomes so difficult cause you start questioning yourself about what the name of the file was😂
That's why you should just look for a sec where you're automated saving feature saves the files😂
Otherwise, finding the file is too mammoth of a task of its own😂
