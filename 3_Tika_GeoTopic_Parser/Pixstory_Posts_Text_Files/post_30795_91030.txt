Mario Balotelli was the big one excluded from coach Roberto Mancini&#39;s call-ups for the qualifying playoffs for the World Cup in Qatar He cost the Azzurri qualification with Macedonia increased regrets for the absence of the former Inter player Reached by the microphones of Sky Sport Balotelli commented on the defeat of Italy It hurt everyone I was very hurt the question not the failure to call up against Macedonia or Turkey the World Cup in December there was the possibility of going the doors had not been closed to me in fact I thought I would have the possibility of to show that I could get into the group so I lost an important chance too and in any case seeing Italy out of the World Cup hurts too much Talking about Balotelli&#39;s attack that went dry without missing a jab at his critics I&#39;m only missing when you lose It&#39;s easy to say now before the match no one thought of me I saw the match and there were chances I&#39;m good in front of goal but not necessarily we would have won if Mario had been there but there were good chances of scoring a goal
