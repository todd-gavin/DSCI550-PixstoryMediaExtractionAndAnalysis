Achanta Sharath Kamal was born in In India won the cricket world cup and by serious money had started flowing into cricket Cricket players became Godlike to a populace that had no knowledge or appreciation of any other sport I am not sure how Sharath Kamal views this craziness for cricket and how he motivates himself but I guess as a true professional his first duty is towards the sport that he has chosen Public adulation and financial rewards are just cherry on the cake At years and feet inch tall Sharath Kamal looks like an earnest Professor He does not smile or emote much He just stands there acknowledges a good shot and moves on In the ongoing commonwealth games Sharath Kamal is both a player and mentor He is taking on a big workload either out of choice or out of necessity He has played in the men s team matches he is playing mixed doubles he is playing men s doubles and he is playing men s singles Such has been the schedule that on days he has turned up to play matches one after the other A couple of days ago just before his mixed doubles match he found his young partner Akula Sreeja crying in the room because she had lost in her quarterfinal match He asked her to not let defeats affect her and play the next match as best as she could Yesterday the pair of Sharath Kamal Akula Sreeja won the gold beating the Malaysians who have been a real thorn in badminton and table tennis He also won silver in men s doubles And today he plays his gold medal match in men s singles Sharath won his first gold in the commonwealth games in And it is clear that he won t be denied in A true legend
