Paid period leaves, a mandatory step towards equality. 

Anyone with a uterus knows that sometimes
your period is more than just a monthly routine. Sometimes it is a debilitating event that requires medical intervention
or at the very least, rest and self-care.

In an op-ed for Teen Vogue, Sara Youngblood Gregory makes the case for paid menstrual leave:
"Paid menstrual leave isn't about special treatment, playing the system, or isolating menstruators in the workplace.

Menstrual leave simply acknowledges that workers live in bodies with different needs, functions, and experiences
and that working standards must meet the needs of a changing labor force."

Many countries have already legislated this right for people who menstruate. Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan, and Spain all offer full or partial payment for time off for period pain. We hope to see this trend to continue globally.
