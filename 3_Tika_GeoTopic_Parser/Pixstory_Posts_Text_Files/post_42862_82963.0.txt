Yes, you read it right! Polo is a sport played in India both on horses as well as elephants.

It is believed that elephant polo was played by maharanis (queens) riding in sedan chairs installed on elephants for entertainment and amusement.

However, the ingenious idea of playing polo on elephants is also credited to Jim Edwards, a jungle lodge owner and James Manclark, a Polo player.

It is said that they came up with this weird sport idea over a couple of drinks in Nepal in 1982.
