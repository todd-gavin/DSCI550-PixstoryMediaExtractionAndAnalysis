French Fries Day honours the delectable snack known by a variety of names, including "French Fries," "Chips," "Finger Chips," and "French-Fried Potatoes." 

French fries are the delicious result of "batons" of potato cut to various thicknesses and then fried in oil. French fries are not to be confused with American "Chips," which are thinly sliced pieces of potato fried until crisp. 

This common side dish with hamburgers and other grease-ball classics often has a golden exterior with a texture that ranges from soft to crispy, and it is typically served with little more than a sprinkle of salt.

As DOY says, Of course, National French Fry Day was created in order to celebrate this amazing food dish! Whether you have French fries when you get McDonalds or you often cook your own fries at home, there is no denying that the addition of this potato dish can take any sort of meal to the next level. 

Therefore, it is only right that we have a National French Fry Day, so that we can indulge in as many French fries as we want and not feel guilty about it.
