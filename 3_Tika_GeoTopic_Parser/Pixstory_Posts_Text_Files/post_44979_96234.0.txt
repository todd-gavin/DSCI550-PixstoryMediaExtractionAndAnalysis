The ex-Arsenal star, who is currently with Fenerbahce in Turkey, is astounded to hear how far
unhappy fans are willing to go to vent their rage.

Mesut Ozil, a former Arsenal star, has voiced his disbelief at an alleged bomb threat against
Manchester United captain Harry Maguire.

A 4-0 loss at home to arch-rivals Although the confirmation of Erik ten Hag as the club's new
manager from 2022â€“23 offers a ray of optimism for the future, Liverpool has done nothing to
boost the atmosphere at Old Trafford.

Frustration on and off the field has been growing for some time, with some fans going too far in
targeting certain people for what Ozil believes is "insane" treatment.

The England player has become a scapegoat for United fanatics, and his family home has now
been targeted with a "severe threat."

On Thursday, a spokeswoman for Maguire made the following statement: "Harry has received a
significant threat to his family's home in the previous 24 hours."

He has informed the authorities, who are currently investigating the incident. Harry's top goal is
certainly the protection of his family and those around him.

"He will continue to prepare as usual for this weekend's match, and we will make no additional
comments at this time."

The World Cup champion, who currently plays club football for Fenerbahce in Turkey, has been
startled.

I absolutely saw the news about Harry Maguire.

This is just absurd, "Ozil said on social media.

Football can never be so serious as to put a player's family in danger. I'm taken aback.

 Football
has a tendency to bring out the worst in people. Hopefully, everyone involved is held
accountable. "

Maguire and Man Utd will face Ozil's old side Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday in
their next Premier League match.
