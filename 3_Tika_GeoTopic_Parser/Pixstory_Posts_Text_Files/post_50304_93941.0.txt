The Combined Police team vowed to enter into the territory of the Maoists and stay there with full resources in a sort of long range combing operation in the various hill villages in order to send a clear message of area domination and also to fully understand the terrain and build bridges with the residents of the remote villages. 

It led to one of the biggest operations carried out till date on the Kaimur Hills which was named as ‘Operation Vidhwansa’. The large scale combing and area domination operation was carried out with meticulous planning in several phases with a large number of forces camping on the Hills for days together with all required equipments that could be thought of such as Satellite phones and medical aid. A helicopter used to be kept in standby mode for any need of urgent evacuation. The first phase of the Operation was launched on the morning of the 4th October, 2008 on the Kaimur Hills. While I led about 300 men with me in a large convoy containing food items on hired tractors along with tentage, lighting and generators for camping from the Tarachandi side on the GT Road near Sasaram, the SP of Kaimur started in another direction from Adhaura with another 300 men with him in order to reach Rohtas.
