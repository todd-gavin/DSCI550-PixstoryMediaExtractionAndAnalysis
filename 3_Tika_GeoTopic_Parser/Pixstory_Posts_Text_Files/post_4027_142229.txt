Got a handful of hands on experience in years But nothing like this Exploration of myself My mind character and behaviour Overthrowing have dilapidated me But this new found gift of gaining an insight of me is nourishing me Calling it selfish I would say lookin into myself is my mantra to stay calm No mantra was recited but it came to me like how the night had brought the gift of wind to calm my soul The chambers of my mind might be small but I have a soul to learn and unlearn That s all that matters to me by the end of this day
