Let’s talk about culture. Culture is an crucial aspect of our society. It is the foundation on which this civilisation is built. The older the foundation, the stronger it is. Now, some aspects of our culture may not be “modern” but they are nevertheless important. 

However, feminists these days have a habit of twisting everything and representation it as “sexist behaviour”. The people who engage in “sublimal sexism” (assuming that such thing exist) are products of their environment. It’s a part of their upbringing. It is inherent in them. Asking your mom to cook for you is instinctive. Taking the help of your father to change the tyre is something that comes naturally to us because it’s part of us culture. It doesn’t mean one is sexist or is marginalising women. 

A grandfather can have women workforce in majority in his workplace because he understands the need for equal representation but at the same time expect his daughter to give him grandchildren. What is wrong with that? We have to break the notion that feminism and sexism are black and white areas. 

Let’s take language for example. To expect change in language is unrealistic. Language is something we grow up with, something that is imbibed in us from childhood. It is the basis of communication for us and it has certain standards which may not be “feminism” friendly. 

My question is, so what? The point of feminism is to advocate for women rights on the basis of equality of sexes. It constitutes equal representation and opportunities. This is what our focus should be. 

Let’s not abandon old traditions and culture to please the “feminists”.
