On April Los Angeles Lakers center Andrew Bynum invited the Denver Nuggets to a block party in L A s first playoff game of the year swatting shots to tie an NBA playoff record for blocks Ten rejections already sound impressive but it seems like an even greater feat when realizing that the Nuggets only took shots meaning Bynum blocked percent of Denver s total attempts Bynum also scored points and rebounds to finish with a triple double As a big man that was bit of a rarity Of course if Bynum ever had a shot at such a stat line he d likely have to reach it with blocked shots not the more common assists As dominant as he was Bynum still didn t even have the Lakers highest plus minus on the day That distinction belonged to Kobe Bryant who was his typically impressive self with points on for shooting to go with four assists and five rebounds in the Lakers rout Pau Gasol points eight assists and eight rebounds flirted with a triple double of his own while helping grease the wheels of L A s offense Ramon Sessions had one of his better nights for the Lakers scoring points and dishing five assists The rest of the series wouldn t be as easy as it took L A seven games to vanquish Denver before falling against the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference semifinals
