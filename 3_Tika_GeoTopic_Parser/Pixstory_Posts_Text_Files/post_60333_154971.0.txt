The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is currently leading the government at the Centre, has been accused of "destroying" the Constitution and "weakening" autonomous bodies, according to Mallikarjun Kharge, a candidate for the Congress party's presidential nomination. Kharge listed the BJP as the most significant challenge facing his party on Wednesday.
In an interview with reporters in Bhopal, Mr. Kharge stated that he believes in collective leadership and that, if elected president, he will engage both Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, the party's leaders, on organisational issues.
When asked who the Congress would nominate for prime minister if he were elected party leader, he chose not to directly respond and instead referenced a phrase from his native Karnataka that goes, "If you survive on one festival, then you will dance on another event."
Elections for the organisation are why I'm here. All of these things will be seen later, the Rajya Sabha MP stated.
The veteran Congressman insisted he is running for the top party position in order to preserve the nation's Constitution and democracy.
