While Social media has allowed us to connect worldwide and expand our horizons in all aspects I agree that there is a flip side to social media We don t realize the power social media has on us as individuals communities and nations Every single data and action of ours is being evaluated and scrutinized Due to this evaluation the algorithm suggested us similar content to what we browse Apart from getting education and job opportunities online Love is also one aspect people look for online Love Guaranteed is a rom com movie released in that focused on how social media controlled love lives This romantic comedy follows an attorney and her client who alleges that a dating service promises to deceive He presents himself as proof having gone on a thousand dates and failed to find love It s a sweet comforting movie but the depth of dating apps and social media controls people s love lives to a point where people get lost in the sea of social media
