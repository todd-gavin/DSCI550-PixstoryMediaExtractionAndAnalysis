One study indicated that one in five vervet monkeys now prefer alcohol to water and that vervet monkeys brought to the Caribbean spent years developing a dependence on the ethanol in fermented sugar cane The drunken monkey hypothesis which holds that humans acquired our propensity for alcohol from our primate ancestors is supported by the fact that spider monkeys regularly devour fermenting fruit Many animal behavior scientists claim that drinking alcohol is a habit that chimpanzees and monkeys engage in pretty frequently And when they do they experience the same effects of being intoxicated that we do They play more they are louder and when they consume too much alcohol they pass out However some scientists claim it s because of the nutritional reward from the fermented fruits that makes them enjoy them But who knows In fact Charles Darwin wrote in The Descent of Man that many kinds of monkeys have a strong taste for spirituous liquors Source
