Daksum is a lovely picnic spot in Jammu and Kashmir situated at an elevation of metres above sea level roughly kilometres south east of Anantnag It is one of the most notable unexplored places in Kashmir With evergreen forests sparkling streams and secret grassy meadows all set against the symphonic backdrop of the raging Bringhi River it is a trekker s heaven With its surrounding evergreen forests gurgling streams and remote grassy meadows Daksum is a trekkers paradise Its only company comes from the sporadic shepherd tending his sheep and the sound of the rushing Bringhi river
