Let me come to my relationship with Syed Ali Shah Geelani, which became controversial due to various reasons. A lot of people didn’t know what was common between him and me. They didn't realise that I am a doctor, and basically a healer.

My job is to make things better for those who are in need in whatever form, maybe sometimes something as small as giving an advice that is not even linked to your field, or how to go about their medical problems, or anything related to their health and supposed to make a difference.

If I am able to do that then I am being truthful to who I am. And that is what gives me peace of mind.

Geelani approached me as an oncologist since he was suffering from an oncological malignancy. I have an ability to compartmentalise things, which means if I do not agree with your political philosophy, it doesn’t taint your picture in my mind. I am willing to consider you for your other virtues.

I am willing to entertain and understand that you are also like me, made up of many components. You may have a religious philosophy. I don't know how much you have succumbed to religion in your life, what place you have given to it and how much you let it influence the other things. These are the decisions that you take, but there are other objective things as in who you are as a human being.

How much evolved are you mentally? Do you have compassion? Do you have the courtesy? Are you jealous? Are you willing to not use hate? How big is your ego? Because these are what forms your personality.

If you have a political philosophy and believe that ‘Kashmir Banega Pakistan (Kashmir will merge with Pakistan)’ because of the fact that it is an Islamic country, and that is what Kashmir should have been, and, therefore, religion is important, in fact is all pervading in life, and that it should overpower all the other decisions, then that is one aspect of you. I have nothing to do with that.

To be continued....
