The Red Devils had their poorest Premier League result in 2021-22, and another summer of
upheaval is on the way at Old Trafford.

David de Gea believes Manchester United can develop towards a brighter future under new
manager Erik ten Hag and advises anyone who does not believe this to "simply go."

Following the club's lowest Premier League result, the Red Devils will undergo yet another
summer of upheaval.

There will be plenty of comings and goings, with Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard, and Juan Mata all
heading for free agency, and De Gea has cautioned that any who are not willing to give their all
should leave as well.

"It's the same emotion," he told MUTV. We were sloppy, we lost several simple balls around our box, it's hard to win games at the level we've showed in the previous three or four months.

"All I want to do now is be optimistic and forget about this season." The fact that the new manager was in the stands was a good omen.

I'm hoping things will improve for next season,
but that is already in the past. We all know how horrible this season has been for everyone.

"Those who don't want to remain should leave, and those who do want to stay and fight for the
club should have a nice break over the summer, prepare ourselves mentally and physically, and
be ready to battle again next season."

The Red Devils, having struggled for consistency, stumbled over the line in 2021-22 with a 1-0
defeat away at Crystal Palace. They hung on to sixth spot and qualification for the Europa
League, but were a long way back from the Champions League places.

The team that started the season under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and concluded it under interim
manager Ralf Rangnick finished 13 points behind fourth-placed Tottenham.

They only managed 58 points from 38 games, their lowest total in the Premier League history,
with only 16 victories and 12 losses, and a goal difference of zero.
