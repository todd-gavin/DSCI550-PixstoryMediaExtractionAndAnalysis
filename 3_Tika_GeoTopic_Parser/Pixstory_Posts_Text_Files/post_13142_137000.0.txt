Five members of the British Parliament, including the House of Commons and Lords of this country, published the report "Situation of Hazaras in Afghanistan" and said that the risk of genocide of Hazaras by ISIS and Taliban has increased in recent months. According to this report, millennials have been the target of the most targeted attacks in the first half of 2022.
The "Situation of Hazaras in Afghanistan" report, which was published on Sunday, 13 Sabla, has analyzed the targeted attacks against Afghan Hazaras in 2021.
 "The Hazaras in Afghanistan, as a religious and ethnic minority, are at serious risk of genocide by the Taliban and the Khorasan branch of ISIS."
This report calls on all governments to act as members of the UN Genocide Convention to protect millennials and prevent the possible genocide of this ethnic and religious minority.
Millennials have been subject to targeted attacks and discrimination for years, but in the last twenty years, they have made achievements in the field of fighting discrimination, isolation and deprivation.
In the first half of 2022, hundreds of members of the Hazara community have been killed and injured as a result of targeted attacks on schools, places of worship and other centers.
The report adds that the attack on this ethnic minority will continue until the perpetrators of the attack against the Hazaras have immunity and are not held accountable for their "criminal acts".
