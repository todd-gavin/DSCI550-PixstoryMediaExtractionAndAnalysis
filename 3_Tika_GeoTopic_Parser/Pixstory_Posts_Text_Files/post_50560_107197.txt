The golden blood type or Rh null blood group contains no Rh antigens proteins on the red blood cells RBCs This is the rarest blood group in the world with less than individuals having this blood group Golden blood can be donated Because of the absence of antigens on RBCs a person with Rh null blood is considered to be a universal donor and this blood can be donated to anyone with rare blood types within the Rh systems This blood is excellent for transfusion because it lacks common antigens and it can be accepted by anyone who needs a transfusion without the risk of a blood transfusion reaction However due to its rarity it gets extremely difficult to find this type Conversely Rh null is usually not so good for the people who have it If they ever require a blood transfusion receiving any blood that does have the Rh antigen may inevitably cause a transfusion reaction
