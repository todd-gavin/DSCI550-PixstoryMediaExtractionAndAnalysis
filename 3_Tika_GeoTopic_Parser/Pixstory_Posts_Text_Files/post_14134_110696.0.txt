We are living in an age in which football supporters are hungry — ravenous even — for any titbit of information about who their club might be signing. A new season is approaching. The transfer window is open and everybody wants to know how the Premier League teams, in particular, intend to splurge their money as they attempt to improve.

But could it be that one of the smartest pieces of business this summer might involve going after the guy who, quietly, and largely out of view, made Liverpool such formidable opponents to Manchester City? His name is Michael Edwards and, in the parlance of the sport, he has become available on a free transfer. He would be some signing.
