Every character from JK Rowling s Harry Potter series is a wonder in themselves and Sirius Black is the one that stands out the most for me Arriving only in the Third book and having an entire book revolving around him is enough to send the message to the reader about the importance of his character Being Harry s godfather his fathers best friend and being wrongfully imprisoned in Azkaban for years his humane and caring nature for his friends and Harry shows the wonder of a person he is Being brought up in traditional very orthodox and in a pureblood family he outgrows and unlearns the beliefs taught to him by his family and goes on to stand up for the right cause even if it means going against everything he s taught Being locked up in prison for years and later in his childhood house for almost a year his frustation and moments where his sanity slips was something not understood much before but after Covid and the lockdown it s something many of us can understand His moments of mistakes ill behavior at school moments of outbursts and unadulterated pure love for his friends his chosen family is what makes him human
