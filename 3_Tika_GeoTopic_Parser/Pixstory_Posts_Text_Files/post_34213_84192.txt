In the post-match conference, the Venezia coach Paolo Zanetti commented on his team&#39;s defeat in the Veneto derby against Hellas Verona. they teach us the importance of concreteness When the game is given away, it was our fault that it put me on a bad track that made me make tough choices because I fielded all the weapons I had, unbalancing the team, a risk I had to take we scored a goal but then we conceded the third after yet another turnover in the middle I didn&#39;t like the attitude in the second half I take responsibility for that the lads have to do something different to stay in this category I&#39;m especially sorry for the fans i derbies must be won and instead we both lost them we are indebted to them The problem that we encountered two teams against whom if you play short they eat you up and start over Again today their game was like this In these games we have been led to have the need to don&#39;t play too short which, however, depends a lot on Vacca&#39;s presence This defeat must not weigh more than the others We&#39;ve been through so many difficult moments we&#39;re entering the hottest phase so we don&#39;t have time to feel sorry for ourselves We have to work hard and believe in what we do The matches they are different we are in a difficult position but one that still allows us to be masters of our destiny Whoever believes it behind us I don&#39;t see why we shouldn&#39;t do it
