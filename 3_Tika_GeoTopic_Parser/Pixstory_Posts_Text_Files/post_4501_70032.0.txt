I’ve talked about this in a previous post too some months ago about Covid and how the virus scared me for a lifetime. I was so freaking scared that I was afraid to step out of my room to get fresh air. It was so bad that my parents had to intervene and forcefully take me on our terrace to get sunlight and fresh air because my health was declining due to other reasons.

My fear was genuine and understandable because Covid was deadly and had taken lives of hundreds of thousands of people around the globe.

More than two years has passed by but Covid is still going strong, mutating to thrive and create chaos. From Delta to the newest variant, Omicron— which is highly infectious and spreading way faster than any of the earlier variants. 

When Omicron was first found in South Africa, and started spreading its way through Europe, everyone had questions about it— if it was life threatening or not. Different theories and assumptions were circulating on the internet. Some said it was mild and won’t harm but others said it could be dangerous. Then the news of first death from omicron came and that established the fact that yeah, don’t take omicron lightly because it could be dangerous. 

Then finally we had some researches which told us to take measures, social distance because it’s dangerous and highly infectious but we could tackle it if we just follow Covid guidelines. 

New Year came and although omicron was spreading way faster in Delhi, I wasn’t that concerned about it after all my family and I were at home and fully vaccinated (except my brother whose vaccine was scheduled to be done under the 15-18 age group vaccination drive to begin on 3rd Jan 2022) so the fear I had of Covid somehow subsided after getting my vaccination done.

But who knew my new year will start with omicron gate crashing my life.
