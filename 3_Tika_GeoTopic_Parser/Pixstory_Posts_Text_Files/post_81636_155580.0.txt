Germany secured qualification to the quarterfinals of the U17 World Cup with a 6-goal demolition of Chile in today’s Group B clash at Goa’s Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. Captain Jella Vait opened the scoring in the 20th minute after Chile failed to clear from a set piece. Three minutes later Chilean keeper Catalina Alvarado ceded gave the ball away from a goal-kick and allowed Alara Sehitler to double the lead from outside the box. A brilliant through ball by Sehitler was then finished by Mara Alber and the Germans went into the break 3 goals to the good. Near the hour mark, Marie Steiner was adjudged to have been fouled in the penalty box; she converted the resultant penalty to put her side 4 up. The fifth goal came less than a minute later as keeper Alvarado fumbled the ball and had to watch it roll into the goal off a touch from Loreen Bender. The rest of the match was largely uneventful. Laila Portella capped the dominant display by slotting in the sixth in the 95th minute. 
Chile had gone into the game hopeful of securing a result that would solidify their chances to qualify for the next round. A resounding defeat has dealt a blow to this. Today’s result has confirmed Germany’s qualification and has set up a must-win encounter for Chile against Nigeria on Matchday 3. Nigeria’s superior goal difference after a 4-0 win against New Zealand means that the Flamingos can qualify by avoiding defeat in the match. Nigeria had only lost to Germany by a one-goal margin in the first game. Germany is likely to secure the top spot in the group no matter how they fare against New Zealand. Avoiding defeat would be enough to mathematically secure it as well.
