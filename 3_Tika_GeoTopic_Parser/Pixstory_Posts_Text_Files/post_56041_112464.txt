Days BY PHILIP LARKIN What are the days for Days are where we live They come they wake us Time and time over They are to be happy in Where can we live but days Ah solving that question Brings the priest and the doctor In their long coats Running over the fields Days by Philip Larkin is a beautiful poem that contemplates life in the poet s typical fashion He asks the reader to consider What are days for This is one of his least lengthy and beguilingly simple at first but shred it back and you ll soon see some of Larkin s trademark themes life death the universe it s all in there It is a short and enigmatic poem there is no story and no characters simply a brief contemplation on the significance of life The tone is informal and the language is available which is again typical of Larkin who wanted to take poetry from the litterati and give it back to the masses Days was published in The Whitsun Weddings published by Faber and Faber in and preceded by his collection The Less Deceived Larkin is known as one of Britain s most famous post war poets and many of his poems in both these anthologies deal with themes of existential angst and the futility of life
