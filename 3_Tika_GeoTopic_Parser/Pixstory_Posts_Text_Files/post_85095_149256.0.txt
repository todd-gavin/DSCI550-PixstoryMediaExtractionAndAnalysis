3 Lautaro Mart√≠nez
Martinez, another Argentine striker who has shone at Inter, had a slow beginning to his career and, despite being a hitter, he could rarely score goals. But Martinez finally grew instature and became a clinical striker for Inter, with his best season coming in 2021, when he netted 25 goals in 45 matches. Martinez is in his 20s and has already established himself,and if he continues to improve in front of goal, he could become the club's leading scorer.
2 Christian Vieri
Vieri scored goals with ease and was a prolific striker for decades. He was a fan favourite and was regarded as one of the best strikers in Europe, making him the world's most expensive player in 1999. When Inter paid 45 million euros for him, many fans believed hewas a waste of funds and that he would not score many goals, but the famous Italian striker hit the ground running when he made his debut, and Inter were the only club where he spent the majority of his playing career. Vieri scored 123 goals in 190 games, winning several individual awards.
1 Ronaldo
Only a few strikers had the striking elements that Ronaldo imbued, and he was not only a goal scoring machine but also a great dribbler and playmaker. He tormented defenders and goalkeepers; once he picked up pace with the ball, it was impossible to catch him; as a result, he was hard-tackled by many defenders, resulting in recurring injuries.
He would have won the most coveted Europea trophy of his career if it hadn't been for all of his adversity during his playing career. Inter were fortunate to have him, and he scored 59 goals in 99 appearances.
