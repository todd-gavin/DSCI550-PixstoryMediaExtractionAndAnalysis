Fascinating life story of renowned criminal lawyer Ramesh Gupta in his own words. Here is part 4….


Simultaneously I was also working as a JRO in the planning commission. During that tenure, I developed a keen interest in photography. I completed my LLB and gave my resignation from the post of JRO. 

There were no phones during that time so I called my father to inform him about my resignation with the landline phone. I addressed my father as Bhai Ji. I told him that I had resigned and he said, “ab chore di hai to bhagwan bhali hi karenge” (If you have left your job now so God will do good only). And for the first time in my life, I went to the Gauri-Shankar temple and prayed. After that I visited my family for their blessings.

I gave my resignation on March 23, 1975, which got accepted on March 31. Then one of my relatives introduced me to Mr R.N. Mittal who lived in Satyaniketan at that time. He was a lawyer in Palam. I started working with him from the next day onwards and on April 9, I was registered as a lawyer. 

I had no permanent place to live. As a JRO, my salary was around 300 rupees. However, as I developed an interest in photography, I started earning around 800-1000 rupees by that. I was financially stable even after I left my job. Because I was able to afford the rent of a two-room house, I had no fear of losing accommodation even after leaving my government job. 

Government jobs did have their own perks but I thought that if I continue doing this job, there will be no excitement in my life. I wanted to do more than that clerical job. I thought that if I failed at law, I would pursue photography because I had decent earnings by clicking pictures. 

I was sure about my photography skills. My acquired interest in photography had its own story.
