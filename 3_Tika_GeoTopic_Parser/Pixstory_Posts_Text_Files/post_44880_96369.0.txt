Jordan Henderson

Under Henderson's captaincy, Salah made his Liverpool debut. Salah was instrumental in
Liverpool's title success in the 2019-20 season, becoming the first-ever Liverpool captain to win
the Premier League.

Dejan Lovren

During Salah's debut game, Lovren was one of the center-backs. Off the field, both players
would become great friends in the ensuing years. In the summer of 2020, the Croatian defender
departed Liverpool for Zenit St. Petersburg in Russia.

Joel Matip

Matip, who is still with Liverpool and plays a key role in Klopp's team, was the other center-back
for the Watford encounter.

Alberto Moreno

Moreno, a Spaniard, was Liverpool's left-back against Watford. He departed the club in the
summer of 2019 and is presently at Villarreal in La Liga.

Trent Alexander-Arnold

Alexander-Arnold was Liverpool's right-back when Salah made his debut against Watford. Over
the years, the Liverpool native has established himself as a key member of the Reds' squad.

Simon Mignolet

For the Watford encounter, Liverpool's goalkeeper was Mignolet, who had surrendered three
goals as the Reds were held to a 3-3 tie.

Salah's former Roma colleague Alisson Becker was
still a season away from joining the club. Mignot is now a member of Club Brugge in Belgium.

Substitutes:

Salah was pulled off after 86 minutes in his debut. Klopp used as many as three substitutes, and
the players who came off the bench were Divock Origi, Joe Gomez, and James Milner, all of
whom are still with Liverpool FC.
