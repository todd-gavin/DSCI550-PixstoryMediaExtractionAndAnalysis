Let s face it almost everything and anything ever pales in comparison to mac n cheese A bowl of steaming noodles topped with cheese sauce is incomparable to anything else Yes ANYTHING ELSE As Gina says humans will always prevail in a conflict between macaroni and cheese and people Each and every time Because mac n cheese can be relied upon We Americans have an intrinsic belief that a box of Kraft or Velveeta or a homemade mac and cheese meal will be incredibly comforting a cure for anything that may otherwise wreck our life It is good for any day Mac n cheese fills the void that a bad day can create With melted cheese And with butter and milk and bread crumbs Moreover even the worst bowl of mac n cheese is almost always delicious You cannot really go wrong with man n cheese because the ingredients are so stupid simple Sure reheated mac is slightly less sublime and the texture is almost disturbing but considering that cheese has gone through hell and back you really can t complain
