Bosnia and Herzegovina & Romania will be looking to pick up the 3 points after failing to do so in their opening fixtures of the UEFA Nations League campaign in League B Group 3.

Bosnia drew 1 - 1 to Finland while Romania were beaten by Montenegro. 

Bosnia find themselves in extremely poor form, with just three wins in two years. They will need to play a lot better this season in hopes of achieving any success. 

Romania are doing a lot better, with 7 unbeaten in 10 matches with the number of goals conceded going down than historic trends.
