Tomorrow is also based on the webtoon of the same name . 
A beautiful story of finding and loving yourself. It is a story of 3 grim reapers who try and help people who are suicidal. They seek out people who are suffering mentally but are unable to get help . In the process each of the 3 grim reapers also resolve their own inner conflicts and problems. 
It does great job of shedding light on the topic of mental health.
