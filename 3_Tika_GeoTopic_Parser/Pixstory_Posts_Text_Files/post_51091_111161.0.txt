Hot tea, check. Pakodas, check. Cozy environment, check. When you have them all, there's no better way to enjoy the monsoons. Nothing accompanies rain better than the aroma of masala chai and some fried stuff. ☕️

There's something in the air every year in end of june that makes us Indians crave the indigenous deep-fried delights called pakoras. It doesn't matter if it's a drizzle or pouring rain, that single drop of water splashing on dry ground just makes our hearts scream out for a large plate of pakoras.

It doesn't matter if the pakora we love most is made of potatoes, cabbage, chillies or chicken, there isn't a single household in this nation of foodies that hasn't had a little pakora party at some point of time or the other. This weather just adds to the romance of pakora and chai, and there aren't many who can resist these crunchy fritters.
