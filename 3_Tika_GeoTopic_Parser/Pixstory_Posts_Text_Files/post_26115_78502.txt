After reading that word I m sure you feel different you thought about the smile of your beautiful mom No matter how much you try to find happiness in loads of things but the happiness that a mother will give you is the most precious A lot better than the others She is the one who stops your cry as soon as she wraps you in her warmth A hug that feels like no other and the one we need and we always will need Everytime you won everytime you lose she kept on loving you Because she knew you ll fail sometimes and it s going to be alright Sharing your secrets talking about friends laughing on stupid jokes When you look at her you really feel what true love is like She is by your side and she is always going to be She is someone who lose herself just to see you safe and happy When she says something good about you she really means it If you see her in pain try your best to make her smile Don t you let those eyes go away which always watched you shine
