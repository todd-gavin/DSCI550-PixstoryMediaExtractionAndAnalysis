According to Official advisors, the Climate Change Committee says the government's current insulation policy is "shocking". It points out that the consumers are paying £40 extra a year on bills because of prior cuts to the home renovation program.

It isn't a fair situation for the poorer families and students in the UK. The committee, also known as the CCC, is an autonomous body advising on climate policy. This report is an annual review of progress for MPs.

It does praise ministers on two issues: it says the government’s renewable energy program will save people £125 a year on bills by 2030.

And it compliments ministers on facilitating electric cars – even though it says more charge points and more electric vans are required.

In response to the report, the government noted that over the past three decades the UK had driven down emissions more rapidly than any other G7 country and that it had clear plans to go further.


The committee agrees that carbon-cutting policies are now in place for most areas of the economy – but it says there’s "scant evidence" that these goals will be delivered.

And it instructs that ministers need a backup plan, including measures they may prefer to avoid such as asking the public to change behavior by eating less meat and flying less.
