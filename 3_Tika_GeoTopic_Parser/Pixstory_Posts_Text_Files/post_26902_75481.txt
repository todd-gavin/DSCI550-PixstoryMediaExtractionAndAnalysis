Nigo&#39;s long awaited debut at the top of Kenzo took place yesterday In the same place years ago there was the first fashion show of the Japanese brand yesterday another baptism took place I believe that many people do not understand or underestimate what Kenzo has represented for modern clothing It is precisely on this aspect that my journey at the helm of the brand will focus These are the words of the new creative director who presented an unexpected collection that takes up the first Kenzo that year influenced by the French style A collection made up of many floral and folk prints lots of jeans and tweed jackets kimonos revisited to be worn over college-style bomber shirts and ironic cartoon-like details To Pharrell Williams, a friend of the designer, the collection and the atmosphere are reminiscent of a Wes Anderson film
