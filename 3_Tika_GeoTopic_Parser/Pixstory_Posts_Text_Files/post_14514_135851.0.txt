Study finds that smoking can damage the heart structure 
Every year around 8 million of lives are claimed due to one's own tobacco usage which includes smoking. 
And tobacco usage not only affects one's lungs alone, but it also effects the hearts structure. 
Previous research has also shown that smoking has a negative impact on a person's blood vessels, more than 30% kf the deaths are due to coronary heart disease which happens due to active smoking or secondhand hand smoke exposure. 
Those who smoke has a double chance of getting heart attack and have triple chance of risk for stroke. 
Researchers from Herlev and Genotofte hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark, found the evidence that suggests that smoking does not only impact a person's blood vessels but it also weakens the structure of the heart and also it impacts its functioning. 
Smoking and heart damage 
Dr. Eva Holt of Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark, lead author of this study, said that, “We know that smoking causes coronary artery disease and heart failure". 
“But the aim of this study was to investigate if smoking had an independent effect on cardiac structure and function in a large general population without known heart disease,” she specified. 
“We found that current smoking and accumulated pack-years were associated with worsening of the structure and function of the left heart chamberTrusted Source — the most important part of the heart,” Dr. Holt says. “Furthermore, we found that over a 10-year period, those who continued smoking developed thicker, heavier and weaker hearts that were less able to pump blood compared to never smokers and those who quit during that time.”
