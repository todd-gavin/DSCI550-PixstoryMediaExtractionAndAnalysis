Klay Thompson has looked very good since his return on Jan. 9, but he had yet to have that signature late-game eruption that became so familiar before his 31-month absence.

In the Warriors' thrilling 117-115 win over the Los Angeles Lakers at Chase Center on Saturday night, Thompson went off in the fourth quarter, helping Golden State improve to 42-15.

Thompson entered the final period with a respectable 17 points, but in the fourth quarter alone, he dropped in a staggering 16 points, including several clutch 3-pointers near the end of regulation.

For the first time this season, Thompson went over 30 points, finishing with 33 on 12-of-22 shooting from the field and 5-of-9 from 3-point range. He added five rebounds and was a plus-10 in 30 minutes.

This was a vintage Klay performance and the Warriors needed every single one of those points to hold off LeBron James and the Lakers.
