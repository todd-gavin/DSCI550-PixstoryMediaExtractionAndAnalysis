Women s rights are exceptionally weak in this country now When we can bear children it is our right to decide whether or not to and never be forced Stop reducing women as child bearers and nothing more Don t we have the same individuality as men Shouldn t we be able to choose freely like men What is the need for men to make decisions for women So Mr Alito says that the Constitution doesn t mention abortion as a right So is he saying that the US Constitution is negating the rights of women and making it to the state to decide Abortion is not deeply rooted in the nation s tradition and history What excuse is this Earlier American men did oppress women and abused them so do we have to follow the same Racism Do we have to promote it too How are we supposed to bear this savagery America is a nation of those who wanted liberty America chooses freedom of an individual and equality over anything else CRIMINALISING ABORTION DOES NOT STOP ABORTIONS IT JUST MAKES ABORTION LESS SAFE Deaths and injuries from unsafe abortions are preventable Yet such deaths are common where access to safe abortion is limited or prohibited Criminalisation and restrictive laws on abortion prevent healthcare providers from doing their job properly and from giving the best care options for their patients in line with good medical practice and their professional ethical responsibilities It is not only cisgender women and girls who may need access to abortion services but also intersex people transgender men and boys and people with other gender identities who have the reproductive capacity to become pregnant Most importantly the denial of medical services including reproductive health services that only certain individuals need is pure discrimination For everyone babies might not be an option They would have suffered rape don t wish to have children happened by accident and the reasons are numerous Whatever it may be it is their choice and adoption or anything else doesn t matter because pain is theirs And yes first ensure equal rights for the ones who were born before talking about the unborn
