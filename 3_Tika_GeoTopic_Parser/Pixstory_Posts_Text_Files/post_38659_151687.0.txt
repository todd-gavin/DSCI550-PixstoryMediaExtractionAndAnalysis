Scout Report-Josip Juranovic
Comparison 
We have compared the Croat with Aaron Wan Bissaka. we can see that Aaron ranks well on the defensive side of the game, while Josip is good on the offensive side. 
Verdict
With few clubs vying for his signature, expect some movements in the January transfer window. Though United’s main priority is Sergino Dest, as ETH would like to be rekindled with his old ex-Ajax man if the Croat can continue his performance, expect United to make a move. Due to his versatility, he can give competition in the left-back position. Watch this space.
