Happy U.S. - India Dosti Month
Happy #DostiMonth! The U.S. Senate designated September 30th as "U.S.-India Partnership Day," recognizing the contribution of the two countries to one another and a relationship that continues to define the 21st century.
Tune in every Friday throughout September as we celebrate and highlight the strong people-to-people ties between Indians and Americans. #USIndiaDosti
