The famous HBO show Euphoria is the latest drama to focus on the Gen-Z experience. The Zendaya-starring programme, which follows in the footsteps of Riverdale and 13 Reasons Why, focuses on teenage angst as its characters negotiate sex, drugs, and friendships in the social media age. 

The show's accuracy as a representation of modern-day youth, however, is debatable. Teens from all over the world and weighed in their opinions and some rightly say that it is unrealistic and uses problems of real world for aesthetics.

When it comes to the problems that are occurring in 2019, the show excels at checking the boxes, but when it comes down to it, it tries a little too hard to be relatable. They're dealing with a lot of difficult material that needs to be talked about, so I applaud them for that, but they're also normalising it and making it look like all of these issues are happening in one person's world. 

A viewer brought up the argument how in overall, the show comes across as voyeuristic, attempting far too hard to convert real, important habits into entertainment for a hungry audience seeking aesthetics. It's easy to call this programme relatable for some individuals, but is it actually just that at some point?
