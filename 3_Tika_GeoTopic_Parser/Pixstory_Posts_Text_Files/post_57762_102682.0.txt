We all know Disney and Pixar are known for how they get to us, touch our hearts and make us feel too many emotions. Every movie released by these production houses has had an element, while focusing on which, we get to learn about the mental processes and states of mind of the characters. They all focus on various situations that get to us, and show how we work through them, and how we keep moving forward. "Inside Out" was a fabulously emotional movie putting forth the complex image inside a teenager's state of mind dealing with moving homes, adapting to new places, people and activities, adjusting with personal changes with age while understanding the role of parents in the changing environment. It shows you how your feelings can get and keep you down, but how through memories of sweeter, purer and safer moments can help you get through that funk, those times where you feel all things negative. It tells us we're going to have positive and negative moments, but we have to remember to not let either get to us too much, that we go overboard and lose ourselves, lose touch with what is right and what is good and safe. It also shows how people, imaginary and/or real, can and do help us get through life and how we should be careful yet be hopeful enough to continue living this wondrous present.
