Hello Everyone! Good Morning
I would like to share few words about my hometown and what changes I would like to do in my hometown.
I am from Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh.
With the development of my hometown in the past few years, the population is expanding very fast. The city is expiriencing not only a higher birthrate than ever, but also waves of immigration. The streets in the city are crowed or even jamed during the rush hours. If I could change one thing about my hometown, I would develop an advanced public traffic system. 
In order to hold such an exploding population, the city has extended miles by miles without much plan. It is common for people to travel from different  parts of the city to go to work everyday. They have to spend three hours or more on the way they go to work and come home. Eight hours work is a heavy burden, while people have to spend hours before and after the work. A subway running through or around the city can solve the problem. People could live further away from the downtown without worrying about spending too much time on the way.
Some people buy their own car or take a taxi to work everyday. It’s really expensive for most of the people in the city. They can’t afford paying so much on traffic fares. Many civil engineering experts advocate that sharing a public traffic system is the most efficient way. People could reduce their fares a lot by using the public traffic system, and they can spend the money on some other things.
