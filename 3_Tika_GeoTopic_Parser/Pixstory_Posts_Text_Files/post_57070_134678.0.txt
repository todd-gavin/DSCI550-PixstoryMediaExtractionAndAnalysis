There are some critical findings from the study, although it did not specify any time frame for melting the sheets and rising sea levels.
A report from the National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration has found that if the sea levelÂ  "along the U.S. coasts rose by an average of 10 to 12 inches by 2050, the most destructive floods would take place five times as often, and moderate floods would become ten times as frequent."
Developing countries and low-lying islands are more vulnerable to this.
Greenland ice sheet is one of the largest masses; if it melts entirely, the sea levels will rise to more than 20 feet.
Jason Box, the study's lead author and a professor at the National Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS), said, "When we take the extreme melt year 2012 and take it as a hypothetical average constant climate later this century, the committed mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet more than doubles to 78 cm or over 30 inches by 2100."
The study hints at the clear threat that will fall upon people and the entire nation.
