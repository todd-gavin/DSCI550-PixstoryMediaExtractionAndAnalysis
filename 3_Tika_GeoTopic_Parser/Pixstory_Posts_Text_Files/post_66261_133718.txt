 Fast Furious was absolutely another brilliant film from the franchise Paul Walker was absolutely amazing as always he s one of my favourite actors and he will always be missed Rest In Piece Paul Walker Amazing car races in the film and alot of action as aways in these types of film s If you like Action Car races and Drama then The Fast And The Furious movies are differently for you The second movie in the Fast And Furious Franchise see s the return of Paul Walker as disgraced Cop Brian O connor Fellow co star from the original movie Vin Diesel didn t return for Part The movie see s O connor on the run after the end of the original movie and when finally arrested given a choice Go to Prison or go undercover again and take down a Drug Lord This movie see s the first appearance of Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pearce who would be a prominent feature in the Franchise Fast Furious is a movie that is pretty much forgotten and overlooked in the series The much maligned Part is either loved or hated but atleast it s remembered something that Part isn t With some terrific action sequences and more fast cars and furious stunts Fast Furious is an unapologetic full throttle adventure that is more remembered for Vin Diesel not returning than anything else And that s a shame there is plenty to enjoy in this entertaining second part in the Franchise
