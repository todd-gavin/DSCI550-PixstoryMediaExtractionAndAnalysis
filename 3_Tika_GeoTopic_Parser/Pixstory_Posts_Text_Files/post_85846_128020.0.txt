New Delhi: The BJP has launched a social media campaign -- 'Desh ki Badli Soch' (country's mindset has changed) -- to project Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a favourable light by comparing his Independence Day speeches with those of his Congress predecessors.

The campaign was launched right after the telecast of documentary titled 'Lal Quiley se Goonj' by Network18 channels and Republic TV and Republic Bharat. The show was hosted by Anupam Kher and produced by Delhi-based Wide Angle Films.

The show's clippings have been extensively used in the BJP's 'Desh ki Badli Soch' campaign.

According to the sources, various other channels were approached by the BJP to simulcast the show but all the channels except Republic channels declined.

"The way the party was approaching all the channels for the simulcast of a show owned by their competition and the campaign was already in place, it is clear that it was a party-sponsored programme," sources told NewsDrum.

On Tuesday night, the party shared on its Twitter handle many graphics quoting parts of speeches made by Modi and his predecessors Manmohan Singh, Rajiv Gandhi, Indira Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru.

One such tweet alleged that Nehru did not pay tribute to fallen soldiers in his 1963 speech, which came after the 1962 war with China. It noted that Modi in his 2020 address remembered those who made the supreme sacrifice in the conflict with Chinese forces in Ladakh.

Sharing a clip from Singh's addresses in 2008 and 2009 lauding prime ministers from the Nehru-Gandhi family, the BJP accused him of "remembering selective idols and appeasing a family". The party contrasted it with Modi's 2014 speech in which he said the country has reached where it is due to the contributions of all its government heads.
