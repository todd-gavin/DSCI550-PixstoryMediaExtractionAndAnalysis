I love everything about crinkle cookies; the way they just melt in your mouth, the subtle-but-spectacular crack as you bite into them, and the undeniably addictive fudgy center.

The classic chocolate crinkle cookie is already in a league of its own, but when I first tried an orange chocolate crinkle cookie, my mind was blown! The way the tangy orange gave way to the warmth of the chocolate, right then I knew I wouldn’t be making these cookies any other way.

And if you’re a fiend for a fudgy cookie like I am, then you’ll appreciate the addition of almond flour for an extra soft center. Honestly, I don’t see how this cookie could get any better!
