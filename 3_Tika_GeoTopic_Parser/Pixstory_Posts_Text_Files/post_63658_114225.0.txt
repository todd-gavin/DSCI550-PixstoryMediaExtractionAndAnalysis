Forming essentially the entire rhythm section of a song, a riff is the most identifiable section of any rock or metal song. Riffs are in essence repeated chord progressions that basically form the structure of the whole song and can vary in composition, from being simple to complex, but whether or not a riff is memorable or not is the key to writing a good riff. There are thousands of great riffs existing in the world of rock and metal, but few have ever managed to be so good so as to make the listener swoon. We often are quick to single out the greats among the guitar world for their technical skill, but often forget to give them the admiration they deserve for their talent in writing crazy riffs that makes us, as listeners, go crazy.
