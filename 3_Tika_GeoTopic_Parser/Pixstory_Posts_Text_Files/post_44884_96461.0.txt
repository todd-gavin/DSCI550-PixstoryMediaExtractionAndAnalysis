The game versus Salford City in League Two was called off in the 79th minute owing to a raging protest on the pitch at Boundary Park.

As the Latics stumbled to a loss that clinched their historic relegation to the National League, enraged Oldham Athletic fans demonstrated their displeasure with a late pitch invasion.

The match was abandoned in the 79th minute with the team down 2-1 against Salford City, a score that was confirmed behind closed doors later on Saturday to seal their fate.

Oldham, one of the Premier League's founding members in 1992-93, will become the first side from the division to be relegated to the non-league competition if their relegation is confirmed.

The club's relegation to the fifth flight brings to a close a three-decade slide from the top of English football.

Oldham were promoted to Division One for the first time in 68 years in 1991-92, in time for the penultimate season of the old English league system, and remained there until the establishment of the Premier League the following year.

The Latics' best hour came in the 1993-94 FA Cup semi-final, when only a last-minute Mark Hughes equalizer kept them from defeating Manchester United and reaching the final at Wembley.

However, they had faced relegation in the Premier League and were relegated to Division One in the same season as their FA Cup triumphs, kicking off a lengthy period of decline.

In 1996-97, Oldham were relegated to Division Two, and in 2017-18, they were relegated to League Two, the lowest level they have played since the early 1970s.
