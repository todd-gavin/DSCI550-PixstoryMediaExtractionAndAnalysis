We might have commonly heard the advice of reducing red meat as it could have serious health consequences on the cardiovascular system which comes from the high levels of saturated fats in the meat whi h increases blood cholesterol levels But a new study shows us that not only red meat but the chemicals produced in the body to digest red meat could also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease The health data from the Cardiovascular Health Study was used by the researchers It was compiled in and And altogether there was adults that was recruited for the original study The participants who took part in the study were free of cardiovascular disease at the start of the study and they lived in one of the four communities Sacramento California Hagerstown Maryland Winston Salem North Carolina and Pittsburgh Pennsylvania Two levels of questionnaire took place along with fasting blood samples were collected and the researchers tested these for gut microbiome previously associated with red meat including Trimethylamine N oxide TMAO The researchers found that Higher intakes of unprocessed red meats and the total animal source foods were linked with a higher incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ASCVD when the median follow up up of years was happening Intake of fish poultry and eggs was not associated with ASCVD Meng Wang PhD first co author of the study and a post doctoral fellow at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University and Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute said that Eating more meat especially red meat and processed meat is linked to higher risk of cardiovascular disease even later in life Metabolites generated by our gut microbes from nutrients found in red meat as well as blood sugar and general inflammation appear to explain much of this elevated risk more so than blood cholesterol or blood pressure effects she added Components in red meat like L carnitine and heme iron may play a more important role in health than saturated fat and cholesterol and should be studied further Sources Healthline
