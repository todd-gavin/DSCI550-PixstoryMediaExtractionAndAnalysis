The ad had been created to promote the wide variety of body shapes that its sports bras are designed for but the explicit nudity and the fact that children could see the images fell foul of UK rules Soon after the advert was released objections were raised by certain people online Now reports stated that the Advertising Standards Agency found all three versions objectionable and could cause widespread offence and hence decided to ban them The ads were a problem due to sexualising women and reducing them to body parts The advertising watchdog received complaints that the advert s nudity was gratuitous and objectified women by sexualising them and reducing them to body parts Some people had contacted them asking whether the posters were appropriate to be on display where children could see them Twitter also said the post had been reported by some users but was not found to be in breach of its terms of service A spokesperson for Adidas UK said that it stood proudly behind its website s message that it continued to display The first campaign was posted in February with the text We believe women s breasts in all shapes and sizes deserve support and comfort This is why our new sports bra range contains styles so that everyone can find the right fit for them The two posters showed similar cropped images of and women and stated The reasons we didn t make just one new sports bra
