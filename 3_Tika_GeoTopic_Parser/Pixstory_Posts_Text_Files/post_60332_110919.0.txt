Just one year after his disastrous transfer from Italy to the Premier League club, Romelu Lukaku completed a season-long loan move from Chelsea and returned to Inter Milan. After Chelsea agreed to a rumoured deal, Lukaku will be reunited with his former supporters at the San Siro. According to the deal, Inter will pay an initial eight million euros plus a possible three million in bonuses for the loan, and Chelsea will pay the remaining four million euros. A "season-long loan deal" was confirmed in a statement by the London club.

Lukaku said "we're back baby" while speaking to chairman Steven Zhang on the roof of the club's headquarters in a video that Inter shared on its social media accounts to announce his return.

The 29-year-old, who reportedly took a wage cut to 8.5 million euros for the upcoming season, will once again be in charge of Inter's assault as they aim to win back the Serie A championship.


After scoring 64 goals in 95 games and leading Inter to their first Serie A championship in more than ten years in 2021, he won over Inter's fans during his two years there, breaking Juventus' dominance of Italian football and ending an 11-year drought.
