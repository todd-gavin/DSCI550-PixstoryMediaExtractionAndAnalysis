The Doors were an American rock band that formed in Los Angeles in 1965, with Jim Morrison on vocals, Ray Manzarek on keyboards, Robby Krieger on guitar, and John Densmore on drums. Morrison's songs and voice, as well as his chaotic stage presence, made them one of the most controversial and influential rock acts of the 1960s, and the group is largely considered as an integral component of the era's counterculture. 

The Doors of Perception is the title of Aldous Huxley's book, which is itself a reference to a statement by William Blake. The Doors, with Morrison, released six albums in five years after signing with Elektra Records in 1966, several of which are considered among the greatest of all time, including their self-titled debut.

The Doors played their most controversial concert of their career on March 1, 1969, at the Dinner Key Auditorium in Miami's Coconut Grove district, a performance that nearly "derailed the band." On that scorching night, the auditorium was a converted seaplane hangar with no air conditioning, and the promoter had removed the chairs to increase ticket sales. 

Morrison had been drinking all day and had missed his Miami connections. The show was over an hour late by the time he arrived, intoxicated. The raucous audience of 12,000, crammed into a venue intended for 7,000, was treated to excessive silences in Morrison's singing, which stretched the music from the start. Morrison had recently seen a performance by an experimental theater group the Living Theatre and was inspired by their "antagonistic" style of performance art.

Morrison taunted the crowd with messages of both love and hate, saying, "Love me. I can't take it no more without no good love. I want some lovin'. Ain't nobody gonna love my a**?" and alternately, "You're all a bunch of f** idiots!" and screaming "What are you gonna do about it?" over and over again.
