Will technology change the equation Are we on the path of advancement for a better tomorrow or destruction of what is left Today the possibilities of going beyond limited identities are much bigger than ever because technology has made geographies porous And in the attempt to bring all at once and have nothing that has to be done is it just merely a device a technology that can overcome the sufferings of mankind or something even more dangerous that we are heading to These views become prime when applied science is involved in well being Empowering people to take better care of themselves by monitoring their health via health trackers and sensors has given technology a large control over their lives With AI Artificial Intelligence algorithms nothing seems implausible be it designing treatment plans and routes for drug virtual reality teaching and training surgeons or Genomic Sequencing to know your identity and future Nanotechnology invades every core of the body for treatment These advances have made life better but have taken human space Use in health care has brought sufferings down but in another field they are heading to a chaotic situation It is creating a total machine based workspace leaving no room for real interactions let alone making human skill invaluable And leading to change the very basis of lives from engineering the genetics of species to designing babies All this to bring the most advanced species of the planet to lethargy The dangers of new technology are often unexpected and therefore unforeseen They are hidden because of the very positive aspects of the new science but they are placing the advanced civilizations in danger of a sudden and total collapse Mankind needs to understand its function otherwise it won t take long for the equation to change It is well said that technology is a great servant but a dangerous master Enhancement can never be a problem once we understand that we are conscious enough to hold on and make a change
