You guys already know how much love Micalea and her writing and this one did not disappoint 1 literally speed through this book in 2 HOURS it was that amazing. This is definitely one of her less emotional and heavy books but still so good nevertheless. BBBH is a college sports romance, second chance, enemies to lovers romance about Mascen and Aurora (rory). The angst, the chemistry, the tension is *chefs kiss*. Rory and Mascen have THE best banter and swoon every time they refer back to their childhood. This is the reason why I love childhood best friends to lovers Mascen is literally the definition of lovable asshole and although he is a bit of a jerk in the beginning, he definitely makes up for it in the end because that man would do anything for Rory. So where is my Mascen!!??
I love love love the importance of friendships in this book & how everyone is like one big family. already know this series is going to have a special place in my heart and can't wait to read Cole's book next!! Broken Boys Can't Love, the next book in this series comes out in less than 3 weeks and I'm BEYOND excited (manifesting an arc everyday)
Tropes:
- childhood best friends to enemies to lovers
