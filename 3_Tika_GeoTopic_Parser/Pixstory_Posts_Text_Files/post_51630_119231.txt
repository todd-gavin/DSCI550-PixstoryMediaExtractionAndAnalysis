Letting someone go sometimes becomes the most difficult thing Yesterday i went to the New delhi Railway Station to See off my mother as she was going out side the town She went due to some Construction related work But as being a son it is so hard for me stay away from my mother Everytime i go back to home from work i always search for her but today when i went back and she was not there i missed her a lot Just her presence is enough to make the house feel like home and without her everything feels like sorrow Just her voice is enough to make me smile and as for now i can just talk to her on calls Those sweet scolds those little fights we do watching tv together eating taking till late nights I will miss them until she come back home The moment when she was entering in the train and we settled up her luggage My heart was just wishing about her safety After a moment we came out the train The train make a honk sound which made me felt goosebumps and the train started moving I couldn t control myself cause i didn t wanted her to go away from me My eyes were filled with tears but i didn t let anyone to notice Her eyes were also filled with tears and she was also hiding it We both knew about this but we kept each others secret The train went by and i was stood there for a while till the train got disappeared from my view Just wanna say this to her that I love you every day And now I will miss you every day till you come back home
