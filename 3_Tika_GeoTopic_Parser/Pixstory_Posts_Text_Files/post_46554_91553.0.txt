Judging a movie on the basis of the book it is adapted from is like judging a fish on its ability to climb a tree. 

I firmly believe that books and movies are two completely different domains and there is no comparison between them. As Stephen King said, they are like apples and oranges. Both are fruits but taste completely different. If you eat one expecting the taste of other you are bound to be disappointed. 

If we go into the logistics, it is practically impossible to have the exact replica of a book on screen. Firstly, time constraints. Authors have no restrictions when it comes to number of pages in the novel. But it is different for filmmakers. 
People will lose interest if a movie is too long. And at the end of the day, every movie’s primary motive is to earn money. 
In novels, one of two chapters might be boring but we don’t drop the novel because of them. Movies, on the other hand, are supposed to keep people engaged constantly! Then how does one not leave our irrelevant details?

Secondly, we often forget that the novel is the vision of author and the movie is the vision of director. Both of them have their own creativities and interpretations. Then how is it fair to compare them? 

Therefore, according to me, please eat apples and oranges. Enjoy them both but don’t compare!
