We also had Pandit Prem Nath Shastri one of the most well read people of his time who actually invented the Kashmiri Pandit Vijyeshwar Panchang which over the years has become one of the most important guides for the Kashmiri Pandits in their day to day socio religious rituals His Jantri calendar is followed even today Kashmiri Pandits from across the world do things according to that Every year a new Jantri comes out because it changes So when it changes everything changes and Shastriji was our kulguru family guru and he would come for heraths and do all the prayers and rituals I still remember that graceful man tall slim good looking He had a nice very decent and elegant demeanour about him He was a very learned person and not the regular gurus that you come across these days And he obviously had Shaivite tendencies and also knew Swami Lakshman Joo who then was the only Shaivite living saint These are remembrances from my childhood Here I would also like to mention that I was a little bit of a macho man and hung around with young macho boys of my area and small gangs of the yesteryears Wazir Bagh and Jawahar Nagar was one gang and the Sarai Bala was another Both would fight with each other Occasionally I would get drawn into that I did a little bit of this a little bit of that a little bit of everything To the utmost surprise of my teachers they never expected me to get the marks I would get Because they never knew that after whatever I did on the streets in the day I would read in the night and make sure I got my marks It was always about saving my skin My mantra was simple If I wanted the kind of lifestyle and get away with the kind of things that I was doing while growing up like go to movies travel have all vices that children had I mean smoking hang out with friends and party then I had to make sure that I got my marks right
