The tajmahal, it is one of the seven wonders in the world and also known as symbol of love which I have been knowing since my kinder garden and always dreamed of to visit once in a life.Â  Week ago I got a chance to make a single day trip to visit Taj Mahal and believe me it is much more beautiful then images.
