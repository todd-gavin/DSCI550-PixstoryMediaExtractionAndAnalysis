sky! your beautiful color
The color of blue days
A star in the sky
I love you dearly
The weather is snowing and raining
Abundant greens
You give light, moonlight
Let the sun warm the world.....
sky !your beautiful color
The color of your days is blue...

 I was a student in the third grade of school. My teacher gave me homework to write a poem or an article about any topic of my choice. I wrote this poem that day describing the beautiful sky of my country.
Today, my father found this among his memory notebooks. I cried when I saw it, it was painful, it reminded me of the past days, how much I was enjoying school as a child.
I read it twice and again, let us take the freedom and independence that we desire again

ðŸ“ŒThe original of this poem, I was written in Farsi, but I translated it into English
