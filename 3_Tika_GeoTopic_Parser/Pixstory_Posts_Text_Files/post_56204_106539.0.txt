6300 tonnes of 8,300 million tonnes of virgin plastic produced up to the end of 2015 have been discarded.
‌
‌Plastic waste is still with us in the landfills and polluting the environment. Microplastics have been found in Antarctic sea ice, in the guts of animals that live in the deepest ocean trenches, and in drinking water around the world.
‌
‌ Plastic waste is now so substantial that researchers have indicated it could be used as a geological indicator of the Anthropocene.
‌
‌Humans have been using plastic-like materials, such as shellac – made from a resin emitted by lac insects – for thousands of years. But plastics, as we know them today, are a 20th Century invention: Bakelite, the first plastic made from fossil fuels, was invented in 1907. If it continues at this rate, plastic could account for 20% of oil production by 2050.

Today, the packaging industry is by far the biggest user of virgin plastic. But we also use plastic in tons of longer-lasting ways too: it's in our buildings, transport, and other vital infrastructure, not to refer to our furniture, appliances, TVs, carpets, phones, clothes, and countless other everyday objects.

Research by UK waste deduction charity WRAP found that plastic packaging extended the shelf life of broccoli by a week when kept in the fridge, and bananas by 1.8 days at room temperature – though for apples, cucumber, and potatoes, the plastic made no disparity. The research found that food waste could even be lessened by selling fruit and veg lose, as it allowed people to buy only what they needed.

All this means a world entirely without plastic is unrealistic. But we have to find out a way, imagine a future without plastic so that we can find a sustainable way to live with it.
