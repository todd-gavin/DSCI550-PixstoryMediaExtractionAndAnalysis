LOCAL NATIVE today , a cute cafe in Hudson lane ( North Delhi) . 

₹ 600 for two (approx)
Continental, American, Fast Food

Tried out veg sliders 3 in 1 🍔, Classic Mexican pizza 🍕, Pink sauce pasta and watermelon mojito 🥤 they all were super yummy . 

I would definitely recommend this cafe to a person who loves to go cute and aesthetic cafes out there also they are having teddy bear and floral theme in the cafe and they have games to play and books to read out there which makes it more interesting and fun to chill out with friends. 🥳🤩
Overall it is a 10/10 cafe according to me.
