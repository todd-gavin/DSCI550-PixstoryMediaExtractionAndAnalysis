Cricket is religiously followed in India. Every youngster who plays cricket in the country dreams of donning the blue jersey of the Indian cricket team. 

But with cut-throat competition and limited opportunities  only a select few can make it to the top. 

Hence, a lot of Indian players who have played cricket in India at the age-group level or for their respective teams move out of India to find opportunities to play in international cricket. 

In recent times, this trend has been on the rise. The likes of 2012 U-19 World Cup winning captain Unmukt Chand and his teammate from that team Smit Patel have moved to the United States of America after retiring from India cricket. 

They will be eligible to play for the USA national team in due course of time. Right now they are part of the USA's Minor League Cricket. 

Let us look at the 5 Indian origin players who have already played for the US in international cricket. 

Jasdeep Singh 

Jasdeep was born in Queens, New York in 1993, but spent ten years in Punjab before his family moved back to the United States when he was thirteen. 

They moved to New Jersey this time, and he made his international debut for the US in 2015, at the ICC Americas Division One Twenty20 tournament in Indianapolis, after years of league cricket. 

The 29-year-old right-arm medium pacer only appeared in one game, going wicketless. 

Jasdeep's international career has been hampered by recurring knee injuries. He has taken six wickets in six ODIs and seven wickets in four T20Is since returning to the squad in an ODI against Papua New Guinea in 2019.
