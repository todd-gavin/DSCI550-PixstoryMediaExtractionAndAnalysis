Gender-based pay disparity doesn’t only exist in the corporate sector or in the minds of the second sex. Gender pay gap is real and nobody is spared regardless of which industry they come from. When one gender is paid less than the other, despite doing the same (or even more) work, no form of reasoning to justify it seems acceptable.😱

Even the Bollywood industry hasn’t been spared from this evil, so, obviously, it isn’t every day that we come across female actors who earn more than their male counterparts in a movie. ✅👍
