Yes, I know it sounds like a bubble gum brand but itâ€™s not. 

Officials with the Hubble Space Telescope program have some new science to share on Wednesday (March 30).

A NASA statement promises "one for the record books" and an "exciting new observation" from the nearly 32-year-old telescope. 

Space.com reported that given that the Hubble Space Telescope's work ranges from exoplanets to galaxies to tracking the expansion of the universe, guessing what that finding might be is difficult. (The multiobservatory team won the Nobel Prize for that last bit.) 

Only that the "Hubble result not only extends our understanding of the cosmos, but also opens an interesting field of inquiry for Hubble's future work with NASA's newly-launched James Webb Space Telescope," according to NASA. 

Webb was launched on December 25 and is currently aligning its instruments and mirrors in preparation for observational work to begin in June. Hubble is getting ready to mark the 25th anniversary of its launch from the space shuttle Discovery on April 25, 1990.

Hubble's decades of observations are functioning as a wayfinder for the freshly launched Webb telescope, according to scientists from the Webb telescope team. 

Although Webb is promoted as Hubble's replacement, NASA officials have stated that Hubble will stay active at least into the 2020s. Hubble, on the other hand, had a problem in October 2021 that took its sensors offline for several weeks, but it was back up in December. In July 2021, the observatory also recovered from a major malfunction. 

Hubble used to be serviced every few years by astronauts aboard the space shuttle, but that work ended when the space shuttle programme ended in 2011. Hubble's last servicing mission took place in 2009.
