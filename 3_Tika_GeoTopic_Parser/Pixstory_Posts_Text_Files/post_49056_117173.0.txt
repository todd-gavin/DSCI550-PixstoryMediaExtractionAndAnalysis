A lot of non-vegans argue that cows cannot feel pain. Which is, let's be honest, kind of bull.. (pun intended!). Cows are sentient animals that respond to pain just like humans or other animals do.

Cows have sentiments and are capable of expressing strong feelings. The majority of studies have focused on a simple categorization of bovine emotion, categorising experiences into "good" and "negative" categories and grading intensity from "weak" to "strong." This method, however, oversimplifies the complexities of cow emotions. Cows react differently to diverse negative and positive stimuli, implying that their psychological reactions are more complex than negative or good feelings.

Emotional contagion and emotional buffering are also used by cows to show collective emotional activity. Emotional contagion happens when one disturbed cow causes the rest of the herd to become anxious as well. Emotional buffering occurs when a calm cow assists in the stabilisation and de-stressing of others. This behaviour demonstrates how cows' emotions are social in nature. Physically and psychologically, they rely on one another, as do all group animals.

There have also been some fascinating discoveries on cows' complicated emotions. Researchers discovered that cows were more excited when they handed themselves an award rather than being given one after finishing a task in one experiment. The study's authors theorised that the cows' higher emotional arousal was due to the personal satisfaction they felt after improving at the job. If this is true, cows' self-awareness is very astounding, and it has ramifications for their emotional intelligence.
