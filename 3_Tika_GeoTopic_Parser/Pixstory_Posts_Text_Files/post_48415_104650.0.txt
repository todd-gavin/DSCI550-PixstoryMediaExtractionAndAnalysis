A federal court in Georgia ruled that employers who categorically prohibit gender-affirming medical care from health insurance coverage infringe federal law.

Anna Lange, a transgender woman and sheriff’s deputy in Houston County, Georgia, sued in 2019 after she was denied coverage for vaginoplasty in November 2018.

Since 1998, The Sheriff's Office provides health care coverage to workers through the county plan. It excluded coverage for talk therapy related to gender dysphoria, gender-affirming hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries.

Chief Judge Marc Treadwell, of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia, wrote in the opinion that the exclusion "plainly segregates because of transgender status," and as a result violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a federal law that restricts employment discrimination based on race, sex, religion, national origin and other protected categories.

He pointed to evidence that showed Houston County's health care plan, provided through Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, would provide hormone therapy for menopause and surgery for breast cancer, but it would not provide the same methods as a treatment for gender dysphoria.

A report last year from the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, found that many transgender people report confronting insurance obstacles to care. Forty per cent of transgender respondents — and 56 per cent of trans respondents of colour — said their health insurance companies refuted coverage for gender-affirming care, which comprises treatments like hormones and surgery. 

State laws regulating coverage for transition-related care differ widely. In the last year, some Republican state leaders have attempted to lessen access to gender-affirming medical care in other ways.
