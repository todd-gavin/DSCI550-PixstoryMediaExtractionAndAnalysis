Boris Johnson is facing mounting pressure for a confidence vote in his leadership as day by day those who submit letters of no confidence are in an increase. 
‌
‌On Monday, the first day of the parliamentary recess, four other MPs called on Johnson to resign or call a vote on himself, including Jeremy Wright, a former attorney general.
‌
‌According to the Guardian, many Tory MPs said that they believed the Several Tory limit of 54letters revoking support for Johnson was being crossed or may have already been crossed.  

At least 30 MPs have said the prime minister should resign or call a confidence vote but not all have verified they have submitted a letter.

Dominic Cummings meanwhile has also accused Sue Gray of not properly investigating the alleged “Abba party” in Boris Johnson’s flat during the lockdown, saying the music was so loud that dozens of people working in the office downstairs could hear it.

The former cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom criticised Johnson’s “failure of leadership". She conveyed that MPs would decide on how best to restore confidence.


“I, therefore, agree with Sue Gray’s conclusions that there have been significant failures of leadership, both political and official, in No 10 and the Cabinet Office,” she wrote.


Many MPs fear that people have lost confidence in Conservative Party and with Johnson in the leadership, it will be difficult to restore the faith in people. This one incident has made people fed up with the party.
