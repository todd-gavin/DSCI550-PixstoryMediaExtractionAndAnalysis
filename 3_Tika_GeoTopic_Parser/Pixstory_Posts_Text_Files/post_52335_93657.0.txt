Cultural humility is a modest and courteous attitude toward people from different cultures that encourages people to question their own cultural prejudices, recognise that they cannot possibly know everything about other cultures, and view learning about other cultures as a lifelong aim and process.

Due to the limits of cultural competence, cultural humility was formed. After acquiring some cultural generalisations, some professions, such as social workers, medical professionals, or educators, thought they were culturally competent. Cultural humility emphasises active engagement in order to learn about the personal, cultural experiences of a patient or customer.
