Happy Menstrual Hygiene Day to all the  menstruators!
Every year this day is celebrated on 28 May  to highlight the importance of good menstrual hygiene management at a global level. 
I will like to share a few general but crucial hygiene tips on this day-
1. Change the used sanitary product regularly
2. Dispose the used product in a proper way
3. Shower regularly
4. Keep your vaginal area clean
5. Keep track of your cycle
6. Donâ€™t listen to myths and consult a gynaecologist if witnessing anything abnormal

Stay healthy! Stay Safe!
