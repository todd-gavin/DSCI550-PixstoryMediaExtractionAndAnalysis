‌It's been more than a month since a country is been attacked for personal interests; destroying its people, heritage and culture.
‌
‌This is the 21st century and we are facing war in addition to a pandemic. Where are the peace organizations, world nations who control them? I am agitated as a human by the injustices faced by my fellow beings. Yes, I have the privilege to sit at home and relax and share my opinions when thousands of humans live in the fear of death. What did they do? Why do they have to endure this? 
‌ 
‌While Ukraine's parliament was asking for help on Capitol Hill, a siren wailed from one of the bags of the Ukrainian member. One of them reached out and said "This is the air raid alarm in the community where my son is staying right now,” she said at a press conference this week after meeting with members of Congress. “I need you all to hear that.”
‌
‌This is the terrible condition of war-torn Ukraine. They were asking for military aid and imposing harsh economic restrictions on Russia. I say, stop this game, whatever game the nations are playing. Put immediate measures to stop the war and help the citizens, rebuild the land, and purify the resources.
‌
‌Biden did announce that the U.S. will spend another $500 million in direct aid to Ukraine as the Russian invasion continues but I am hoping for the president to soon announce that the war ended. The US is capable of stopping the war; other nations please join the hands. End this atrocity and punish those responsible for the crime.
