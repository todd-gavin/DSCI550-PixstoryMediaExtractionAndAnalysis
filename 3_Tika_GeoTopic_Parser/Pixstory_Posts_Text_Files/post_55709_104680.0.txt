Climate change and the economy are two of Australia's new left-of-center government's major issues. VOA News reported that after the counting of postal votes, Labor has gained enough seats to create a majority government over two weeks after the May 21 election. In addition, there are a record amount of women in the Cabinet. 

“This is far more representative than any government party room has ever been in our history. We are making progress,” said Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.

The 23-member Cabinet includes ten women. Analysts believe the nominations will help to improve gender parity in Australia's traditionally male-dominated political culture. 

Anika Wells, the new minister for Aged Care and Sport, said she’s ready for the task ahead. “I feel very honored that I have been given such a big reform task to do in the Albanese Labor government and I’m really looking forward to getting started.”

According to Stewart Jackson, a senior lecturer in the University of Sydney's department of government and international affairs, the government's main domestic focus will be managing the economy.

Let’s see if this new government delivers its promises!
