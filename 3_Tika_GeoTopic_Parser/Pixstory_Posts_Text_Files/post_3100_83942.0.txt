President Joe Biden has nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson, making her the first Black woman to serve at the apex court. If confirmed, she will succeed retiring Justice Stephen Breyer at the Supreme Court.

Jackson, 51, the federal appeals court judge, has once cleared the Senate confirmation process last year. There are already reports in the media that It would be difficult for the Republicans to oppose her nomination to the Supreme Court virulently as she had a relatively smooth ride last time. Jackson has been one of the front-runners in the potential nominees' lists that have been doing the rounds in the media.

Jackson went to Harvard University and graduated in 1992 after which she completed her law from the same place in 1996. She did clerkship at the US Supreme Court and was selected by Justice Stephen Breyer, whose seat she is nominated to fill now. Clerkship is considered an important stint for future justices. Several people who were nominated to the Supreme Court have done their clerkship under associate and chief justices.

Jackson for long has been speculated as potential Supreme Court nominee. But it will not change the Supreme Court's conservative tilt as she will be replacing liberal judge Justice Breyer. The conservative tilt of the court is overwhelming at 6-3. 

Some Republican senators who had supported her in the past may not do so now, but some have made cautious welcome. For instance, Susan Collins of Maine or Mitt Romney of Utah have described Jackson as "experienced" and praised her education and career.

She has support from liberal advocates even before she was nominated. NBC News reported that the progressive groups preferred candidate, without actually naming anyone, in a letter to the president was in fact Jackson.
