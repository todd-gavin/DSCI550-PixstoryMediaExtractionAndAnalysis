How to Play Kanche (Marbles)
There is nothing complex about this game and the rules are simple just keep the marbles inside a drawn circle and from a distance try to hit as many marbles as possible in your turn.
The number of marbles you hit will be yours and you can continue to hit until you miss your shot.

But sometimes it becomes a challenge to see who gets more marbles and in my childhood, it was like a big thing to have the maximum number of marbles that we won.
