Chinar locally know as bouin in kashmir is a majestic tree, is renowned for its age, splendour, cool shade, and regal aspect. The tree can grow up to 30 metres tall and have a girth of more than 12 metres. The bark is greyish, and the leaves are borne alternately on the stem. The leaves are firmly 5-7 lobed, 12â€“20 cm long, and palmate or maple-like with long stalks. Flowers have broad, spherical crowns, are monoecious, and unisexual.
The Chinar trees have played a significant role in Kashmir's scenery for millennia and are significant historically. The oldest Chinar in Kashmir, which is believed to be close to 600 years old, is supposed to have been planted in 1374. It is situated in Kashmir's Budgam area and is 14.78 metres high. Mughal emperors like Akbar, Noor-ud-Din Muhammad Jahangir, and even Aurangzeb loved the tree. Even the "royal tree" has been used to describe it. The great Emperor Akbar is said to have planted more than 1,200 Chinar trees after conquering Kashmir in 1586. There is a tiny Chinar Island on Dal Lake that goes by the name of "Char Chinar."The four Chinar trees that are planted there are the source of the island's name. These four trees were built by Emperor Jahangir so that their shadows would always fall on the island. They rank among the most well-liked tourist locations in Kashmir. 
The beauty of the Chinar tree is astounding. Kashmir would be lacking without it because it is a significant part of Kashmir's extensive history.
