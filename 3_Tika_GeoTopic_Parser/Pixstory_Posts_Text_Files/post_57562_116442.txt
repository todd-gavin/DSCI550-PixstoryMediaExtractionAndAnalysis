I don t think parents praise their children excessively I mean they know the right thing to do when it comes to taking care of their child or making them confident When would the parents mostly praise their children Obviously when they do something where commending their work is worthwhile But of course it is not on things they don t do correctly and what s wrong in doing so at times when their children have done a great job Instead praising would boost good feelings and increase motivation it would also inspire children to become more cooperative persistent and hardworking as when they receive praise for their work it will motivate them to do the task again with the same sincerity and dedication Children are more likely to repeat behaviour that earns praise or encouragement This means you can use praise and motivation to change challenging behaviour and replace it with desirable behaviour I think the way traditional thinkers talked about praising was inaccurate They thought being stern or strict would make the children more focused or dedicated to their goals But we all need to be praised for what we do it psychologically impacts your brain Children not applauded for their work often tend to feel demotivated which would not bring in them the needed drive to complete their tasks Besides giving positive feedback would make them happier instead of narcissistic
