Being home is a feeling of comfort, security and warmth. These feelings complete the idea of home. Now these feelings can be different from oneâ€™s perspective to another. When it comes to me the atmosphere created around me by my family makes me feel like home. I have a family of six which includes my parents, my sister and my two dogs, and yes my dogs are like my family to me. Ever since the lock-down started, me and my family have spent a lot more time with each other than we used to before and surprisingly I never got bored the whole time at all. Most of my friends were complaining about the inconvenience of living with their families, but I was just having a good time. I have freedom of expression at home as well. I'm free to talk about anything and share my ideas with my family, it is very entertaining and comforting at the same time. My latest addition to my family is also very entertaining, my two dogs are named Elf and Elvis. Having them has been a very blissful experience. We take the responsibility of the pets equally as a family which makes it more rewarding and more therapeutic for us. All these things make me feel home, at any location.
