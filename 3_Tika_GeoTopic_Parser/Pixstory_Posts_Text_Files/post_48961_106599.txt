To get control of the elephant the handlers must break it which entails separating the elephant from its mother tying the infant down with rope and thrashing it with bullhooks Even in the absence of physical abuse the separation of a mother and her child is exceedingly traumatic All of the elephants in the family group adore babies but their mothers are especially fond of them Elephants almost seem to celebrate the birth of their young by making a lot of vocalisations and paying attention to them Like you said elephants have great memory and being separated from their mother and baby at such a young age is likely to traumatise the elephant for the rest of its life A number of elephants have been rescued from industries such as logging and their carers need to make a living in order to feed and care for them However the number of elephants poached from the wild has increased in order to meet the growing demand for rides and entertainment in the tourism industry Most elephants that are used for riding any other type of entertainment suffer long term physical damage to their feet backs legs and trunks They are massive but their bones especially the spine are not designed for carrying so much load of logs or humans If you love elephants don t ride them
