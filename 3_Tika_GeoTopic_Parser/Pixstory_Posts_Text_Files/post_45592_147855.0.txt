It has been reported that Jeff Fahey will join the cast of Kevin Costner's upcoming western epic Horizon, which has been shooting in Utah since last month. The cast is already an all-star group. Deadline has the casting news. Although Fahey will be involved in the movie, little is known about the character he will play at this time. Collider reported that the movie, which Costner has referred to as his passion project, will chronicle the expansion into the American West and will follow a group of characters over a 15-year period before, during, and after the American Civil War. The narrative will chronicle the intrigue, danger, and difficulties encountered throughout settlement of the West, through the constant barrage of natural elements, confrontations with indigenous people, and the obstacles that living on the land brought. It will put a spotlight on both the determination and ruthlessness of the people who set out to settle the West.Are you looking forward to it?
