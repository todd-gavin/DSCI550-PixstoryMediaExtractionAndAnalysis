The evolution of photovoltaic technologies and emerging optoelectronics is accompanied by the development of new synthetic materials also on the nanometric scale. Among these, the colloidal nanocrystals of inorganic semiconductors attract considerable interest thanks to their optical and electrical properties and the prospect of low-cost synthetic processes. group of researchers from the Cnr Nanotec Institute of Nanotechnology in Lecce and the Cnr Ic Institute of Crystallography in Bari of the National Research Council together with colleagues from the University of Salento and the IIT Italian Institute of Technology have developed an innovative method of chemical synthesis which allows to obtain an unexplored class of nanomaterials called bismuth calcohalides These nanomaterials compliant with the EU Directive which places restrictions on the use of hazardous substances RoHS have proved to be very stable and efficient in absorbing sunlight We candidate them as a promising alternative to the widely used lead-containing semiconductors The results of the research are published in Angewandte Chemie and are the subject of a patent application. Our synthesis method has proved to be reliable and versatile, allowing us to explore the class of bismuth chalcohalides and to prepare pure nanocrystals, explains Danila Quarta of Cnr Nanotec, author of the research. nanocrystals of bismuth calcohalide have been used for the formulation of photoactive inks with which electrodes capable of converting sunlight into electric current have been made, thus opening up the possibility of manufacturing photoelectrochemical and optoelectronic photovoltaic devices in a simple and relatively cheap way. a line of research that opens up new opportunities to be explored Our ultimate goal is to help offer a new perspective for the conversion of solar energy with low environmental impact
