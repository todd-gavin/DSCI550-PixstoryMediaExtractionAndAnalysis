After a dissapointing year from Bollywood, fans are very excited for 2023 as many A list starrer films are set to be released in that year . While everyone is talking about Srk vs Salman and how will the films work ? But I am interested is a different thing . 

Action movies and stunts are always associated with Bollywood actors not actresses . Producers and Directors dont give them these roles as they believe masses will not resonate with them . But Zoya ' s character in Tiger and Tiger Zinda has proved them  wrong . Fans truly loved her and the song 'tera noor ' . From the announcement trailer and posters  of Pathan and Tiger 3  we can hope that both Deepika and Katrina will play characters that are involved in action scenes . I am really looking forward to it .I wish that  after a long time Bollywood can  gives us heroines that can pack punches too .
