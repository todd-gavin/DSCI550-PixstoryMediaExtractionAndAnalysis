Bed in Summer
BY ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON

In winter I get up at night
And dress by yellow candle-light.
In summer, quite the other way,
I have to go to bed by day.

I have to go to bed and see
The birds still hopping on the tree,
Ovr hear the grown-up people's feet
Still going past me in the street.

And does it not seem hard to you,
When all the sky is clear and blue,
And I should like so much to play,
To have to go to bed by day?

Robert Louis Stevenson was a Scottish novelist, essayist, poet, and travel writer. He is best known for works such as Treasure Island, Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Kidnapped, and A Child's Garden of Verses. The poem talks about How the weather in England can be confusing for children who have to follow strict rules on bedtime. The child in a poem needs freedom like grown-up people and the birds in the trees whose sounds the child can hear evidently.  'Bed In Summer' is a simple poem about someone who finds that by getting up at sunrise and going to bed before sunset they miss out on so much because of the changing nature of the seasons. By keeping a standard 'ABAB - CDCD' rhyming signature, it is a very innocent poem that evokes childhood.
