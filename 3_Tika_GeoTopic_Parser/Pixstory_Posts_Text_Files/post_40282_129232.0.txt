I often heard about signs of trauma for children and you must have heard about it too but today let's talk about it ! Ofcourse i don't expect any children to be reading this but i do think many parents , guardians , and siblings to be ! ‚úÖüß†

The thing about children is that they aren't too natural at voicing out how they truly feel . They often don't have the vocabulary or ability to talk about their emotions , and many times they don't actually know what they're feeling and why . Which is why when it comes to trauma and even PTSD ( Post traumatic stress disorder ) , or any other serious mental health condition , we have to look at things like there behaviour ! ü§î

Signs of Trauma in children ;

1 Suddenly acquiring new fears and phobias that they didn't have before .

2 Separation anxiety - when a child becomes overwhelmed with anxiety if their parents are not around .

3 More frequent sleep disturbance and vivid nightmares .

4 Closing themselves off from people , suddenly being very quiet when they were lively and cheerful before .

5 Losing interest in the activities they once used to enjoy .

6 Anger and irritability ,  lashing out at people , destroying objects . For a child with trauma , this is often the only way thry can express themselves and relieve their pain .

7 Physical complaints EG - Stomachache , headache , other pains that seem to have no other cause .

8 Spacing out even during engaging activities . This could be a sign of dissociation of derealization .

Please take that seriously ! Having these signs alone does not immediately mean that a child has trauma or PTSD , but it indicates that something is off that warrants your attention . ‚úÖüß†

Please don't ignore these signs , especially if you see any child with these . Untreated childhood trauma and anxiety often leads to disorders further down the road , so it's always better to clear them up now ! ‚ù§Ô∏èüß†
