Through his Instagram stories, Kim Taehyung shared how he has fun with the app’s filters and showed a series of videos while listening to J-Hope’s new album in the background.

On the other hand, the idol fell in love with his innocent tenderness as he tried out a filter where his face was completely erased and was replaced by different emoticons, such as “😀” making his followers fall even more in love with his innocent cuteness.
The 26 year old fell in love even more when he used a filter where his face appeared full of glitter next to the ears and nose of a puppy, touching fans with his serious expression while using the filter.
