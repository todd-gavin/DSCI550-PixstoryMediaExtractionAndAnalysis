Read the below paper in Lancet which says mental health studies might be overestimating the effects of Covid The COVID Mental Disorders Collaborators conclude that throughout the pandemic led to a increase in cases of major depressive disorders and increase in cases of anxiety disorders globally However we propose that these prevalence estimates are likely to be substantially inflated Decades of trauma research has shown that for most people negative life events such as bereavement or disaster exposure are typically followed by resilience minimal effect on symptoms of anxiety or depression or both or recovery initial short term increase in symptoms of anxiety or depression or both followed by recovery This pattern matches what large scale studies and reviews have found in the context of COVID In a meta analysis of longitudinal cohort studies there was an acute increase in mental health symptoms at the pandemic onset Symptoms declined significantly over time and were indistinguishable from prepandemic symptom profiles within a few months of the outbreak Psychological adaptation matters in the context of the collaborators study because the authors estimates of the COVID impact are based on studies done primarily during the very early phase of the pandemic data collection for of studies occurred primarily between March and May appendix At that time symptoms of anxiety or depression were at their most severe and probably represented an acute reaction to an unexpected and unknown emerging crisis The authors then extrapolated from those immediate reactions to infer how SARS CoV infection rates and human mobility affected mental health throughout However a failure to take into account the short lived nature of changes in mental health symptoms during the pandemic and the potentially diminishing relationship between indicators of COVID impact and anxiety or depression throughout means that prevalence estimates might be grossly overestimated in the collaborators study
