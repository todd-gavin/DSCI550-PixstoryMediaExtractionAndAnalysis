Suryakumar Yadav has been ruled out of the upcoming Twenty20 Internationals against Sri Lanka. He was spotted at India's practice session in Lucknow on Tuesday but the 31-year-old batsman has suffered a hairline fracture on his hand and been declared unfit for the white-ball series.

Suryakumar was injured while fielding in the third T20I against West Indies. He was awarded Player of the Series in the T20Is against West Indies. Suryakumar is the second Indian player to be out of the Sri Lanka T20I series. Deepak Chahar has also been ruled out of the upcoming games in Lucknow and Dharamsala after picking up a hamstring injury in the last match.

After dismissing the West Indies openers in the run chase, Chahar limped off the field holding his hamstring without completing his second over. 

The BCCI are not expected to name a replacement considering India have already been bolstered by the return of Jasprit Bumrah for this series. The newly appointed Vice captain is returning after a break. Apart from the 28-year-old, India also have Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Avesh Khan, Mohammed Siraj and Harshal Patel in the squad.

Above all, a replacement for either player at this stage will not be possible given the bio-security protocols. Consequently, this leaves India with a 16-member squad for the three white-ball games.

After the first game on February 24, the next two T20Is will be played in Dharamsala on February 26 and 27.

Now that Suryakumar Yadav has been ruled out of the series alongside Deepak Chahar due to injuries, Venkatesh will assume added responsibility when it comes to batting in the back 10.
Sanju Samson has also been drafted into the squad and it would be interesting to see whether the management gives him a go in the playing XI.
Spinner Ravi Bishnoi also impressed in his maiden T20I series and he will look to march ahead with the same momentum.
