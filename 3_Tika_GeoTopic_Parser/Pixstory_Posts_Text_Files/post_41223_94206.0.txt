As a child, Easter Weekend meant lots and lots of candies for me. My parents used to organise an elaborate Easter egg hunt for me and my siblings in our back garden. My dad even used to dress up as Easter bunny to give us clues. Each egg we found was filled with candy to the brim. As I grew up, I learned about the true meaning of Easter and always wondered where do the candy eggs and bunny fit into this. If you have wondered about the same, here is your answer!

Easter is a Christian event that commemorates the belief in Jesus Christ's resurrection. The event is claimed to have occurred three days after Jesus was crucified by the Romans and died in around 30 A.D., according to the New Testament of the Bible. 

The holiday culminates the "Passion of Christ," a series of events and holidays that begin with Lent—a 40-day period of fasting, prayer, and sacrifice—and conclude with Holy Week, which includes Holy Thursday , Good Friday, and Easter Sunday. 

Although Easter is a Christian celebration with deep theological importance, many of the traditions linked with it stretch back to pre-Christian, pagan origins. One of these is Easter Eggs. 

There are many Easter traditions that can be traced back to non-Christian and even pagan or non-religious festivals, regardless of faith. Many non-Christians prefer to follow these customs while mostly ignoring the religious parts of the holiday. 

Easter eggs and related games such as egg rolling and egg decorating are examples of non-religious Easter traditions. 

In some pre-Christian pagan beliefs, eggs were thought to signify fertility and childbirth. Easter egg decorating may have evolved as a tribute to the theological significance of Easter, namely, Jesus' resurrection or rebirth. 

Easter egg "hunts," in which decorated eggs are concealed, are very popular among many people, especially youngsters.
