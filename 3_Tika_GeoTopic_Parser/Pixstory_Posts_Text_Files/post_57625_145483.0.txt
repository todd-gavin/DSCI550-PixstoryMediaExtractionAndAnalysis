As human beings, we have the ingrained sense of being critical about anything or everything.
It is a part of thinking or exchanging discourses and never ends.
But very often and mistakenly, criticism is taken as a derogatory term used to traduce or disparage the work of someone.
Although it isn't true, as much as appreciation bolsters someone's confidence and ability to work hard, criticism similarly forces them to improve their abilities.
The difference is how far one can go to choose to be critical in a rational and humble way than to act straightforward and rude to humiliate the work.
If taken positively, criticism can do wonders and hence become a form of communication that aims to give feedback in a constructive manner.
Well, it takes a lot actually to comprehend the subtleties of criticism.
For most people, it is not easy to accept the words that they try to correct or help them; they don't take it as an opportunity to learn more; instead, it becomes a point of rivalry that only creates a competition of letting the critic down.
