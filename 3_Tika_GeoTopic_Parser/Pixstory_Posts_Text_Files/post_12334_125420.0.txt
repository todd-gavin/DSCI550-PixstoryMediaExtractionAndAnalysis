Primary Progressive Aphasia is a kind kf dementia which is mainly characterized with loss of language function. Usually we associate dementia with me.ory loss, but memory in people with PPA is generally not afftered till the later stages. 

The loss of speech skills starts of subtly before it progress to a complete state of inability to speak. As the condition keeps on progressing and it starts to resemble like other dementias and changes in the personality, memory, judgement and attention and then it affects movement and swallowing can be eventually seen among the patients. 

PPA is commonly seen among late middle aged people and it can be easy onset dementia. 

Each person is unique and so the age of onset will also differ from patient to patient, however, as the condition progresses, someone may live for over a decade after the diagnosis and can maintain high level of independence for many years. 

Many researches are ongoing as scientists are trying tk find why there can be so much of difference between individuals with PPA. 

10% of PPA cases can be genetic and this means that's “a specific faulty gene might be causing these problems, but this is only the case for a small minority of people with PPA,” says Chris Hardy, PhD, a senior research fellow at the Dementia Research Centre at the University College London Queen Square Institute of Neurology.
