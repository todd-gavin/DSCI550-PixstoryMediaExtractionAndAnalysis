Nothing beats the sound of your favourite song playing in the background it just goes into your head and body and makes you move Or perhaps it transports you to a faraway place and time where you remain in a hazy remembrance of days past and people who are no longer alive Some of our favourite songs can bring us out of despair and anxiety making an otherwise awful day seem a little less terrible World Music Day honours the effect of music in all of its forms on the world and the human spirit The best part about celebrating World Music Day is that it is absolutely free You can participate for free and bring the whole family along no matter what style of music you enjoy It s the ideal time to learn a new instrument or listen to songs you wouldn t ordinarily include on your playlist Every sort of musician can celebrate World Music Day with friends family and even strangers whether they are young elderly new or seasoned professionals The first World Music Day was held in France several decades ago In France s Ministry of Culture devised a brilliant plan to honour the wonders of music They wanted free live music to be accessible to everyone regardless of skin color or background Normally tickets to music festivals must be purchased however this is not the case with World Music Day Spend the day listening to all of your old faves and if you re really feeling adventurous start searching YouTube for music from foreign cultures You can start with Finnish and Hungarian music then move on to Italian and Mongolian folk music It s easier than ever to explore the wide variety of musical experiences the globe has to offer and you can do it all from the comfort of your own home thanks to resources like these Of course you could always pick up an instrument and join the choir as a performer
