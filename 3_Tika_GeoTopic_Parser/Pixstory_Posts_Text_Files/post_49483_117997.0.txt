When you consider a child's day in a traditional classroom, you'll see that they attend lessons where speaking is only permitted when it pertains to the subject at hand and that the breaks between classes are so short that most kids can hardly say "hi" to their friends while attempting to avoid being late. When I was a kid, we were scolded by our teacher at lunchtime into silence with them threatening us to cancel our 15-minute outside playtime.

Homeschooling does not always involve attending classes at home. Numerous settings exist for education. Several families are brought together for teaching, playing, and conversations in co-ops, allowing students to interact completely with other social groupings. Homeschooling can be community learning. It is a lot less toxic and a lot more effective. Kids get more time to socialize than not.

I agree, homeschooling should not be limited to keeping your kids inside your house. That could have adverse effects on both their mental and physical health but if done well, it is pretty much better than brick and mortar schooling.
