The Liberal government’s Online Streaming Act claims to level the playing field between Canadian broadcasters and online streaming companies. But it could do more.

Black, Indigenous and racialized people — particularly women — are underrepresented both on the screen and behind the scenes. When they are represented it tends to be in superficial and stereotypical ways.

While some Black, Indigenous and racialized groups strongly support the bill, some are calling for more: from full funding and support for Black-owned and Indigenous media to requirements to consult with Indigenous, Black and racialized communities.

Current pressing problems
Broadcasting in Canada was founded in response to concerns about American cultural imperialism, but also as a settler nation-building project that established outposts of Canadian cultural imperialism across Canada and in the North.

The Community Media Advocacy Centre, a non-profit organization interested in the future of community and Indigenous media has long called out racism across Canadian broadcasting. In 2017 and 2018 the organization wrote to the Governor General, prime minister and heritage minister raising concerns about systemic racism and a “lack of representation of Indigenous and racialized people on the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission [CRTC].”

Critics of the Online Streaming Act, like Michael Geist, the Canada Research Chair in internet and e-commerce law, are concerned about how it could be used to regulate online content in the future.

While these concerns are valid, the act must confront a pressing and long-standing problem: the imbalances across Canadian broadcasting for Black, Indigenous and racialized people.
