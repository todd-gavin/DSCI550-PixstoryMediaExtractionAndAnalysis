The history of the Indian women's hockey team is not as bright as the men's. It might not have been able to climb the podium at the Tokyo Olympics last year, but the girls made their name among the top teams in the world with their scintillating performance. As a result of this change in the team, the Savita Poonia-led Indian team is expected to climb the podium in the FIH Women's Hockey World Cup starting in the Netherlands and Spain. Sjoerd Marin, who was the coach of the team till the Tokyo Olympics, definitely deserves credit for this transition in the Indian team. He honed the skills of the players of the team and built the belief that they can dominate and beat any team in the world.

We all know that the Indian women's hockey team in the name of success has 4th place in the 1982 Moscow Olympics, 4th place in the 1974 Tehran World Cup, and a Gold medal in the 1982 Asian Games apart from some Asia Cup successes. Until the time of the Tehran World Cup, women's hockey was not very popular with the rest of the countries and not all countries participated in the Moscow Olympics.

At the same time, the 1982 Asian Games had the advantage of being organized at home. In a sense, the fourth-place finish at last year's Tokyo Olympics is more important than all other accomplishments. Our team lost 3-4 after a tough fight to England in the bronze medal match in Tokyo, our players were in tears for not winning a medal. At that time Marin had saidâ€”" I cannot wipe your tears, but here I am also proud of your defeat because you have won a lot apart from medals and inspired and made the whole country proud". Marin has a point in this because it is from here that Indian women's hockey has got a new birth. This was realized by the team recently, by participating in the FIH Pro League for the first time. In this, the Indian team has secured third place with wins against Netherlands, Germany, Spain besides Argentina.
