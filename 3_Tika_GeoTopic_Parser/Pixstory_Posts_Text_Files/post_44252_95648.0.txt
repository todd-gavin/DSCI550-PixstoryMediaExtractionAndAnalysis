The Tottenham Hotspur stadium has become just the place for long term renewals as young
midfielder Oliver Skipp follows the footsteps of some of Spurs' greater, more experienced
stars. The likes of Heung Min Son and Hugo Lloris have already sighed new deals with the
club this season, although Harry Kane is expected to depart in the summer.

Skipp made his breakthrough into Spurs' first team earlier in the season, playing as a midfielder alongside Pierre-Emile Højbjerg before his injury. The injury has kept him out for a
considerable period, having last played versus Chelsea on January 23 — missing 13 games
in all competitions since. 

January acquisition Rodrigo Bentancur has taken his role in
Conte's first team ever since. The 21 year-old is said to have gotten many talking even whilst
on loan with Norwich City a couple seasons ago.

Moreover, Conte was said to be impressed of the midfielder's timely breakthrough into the
first team. His attributes, both physical and technical were highly in accordance with a box to
box presence Conte's starting lineups would normally feature. No wonder the Italian was
upset upon the injury, suggesting that the backroom staff must do better to bring the
Englishman back before the season ends.

The pelvic injury (pubis symphysis) is an injury most likely incurred through heavy workload
and intense training. Conte can be a demanding manager, but Skipp's potential mustn't go
unnoticed. 

He's appeared in 85 games across just two seasons so far, with 10 of those caps
coming for the England U21's. The contract, that keeps him in North London up until 2027
will likely ensure Daniel Levy of one of the club's pillars for the project that is to come.
