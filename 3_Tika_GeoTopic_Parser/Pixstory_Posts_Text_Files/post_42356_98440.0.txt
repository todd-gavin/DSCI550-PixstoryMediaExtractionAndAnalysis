What Real Madrid did today on the pitch was pure magic, I still can’t believe what happened because Real Madrid made a comeback in the 90th minute when they were trailing a match by 0-1 and to qualify for the final of the UEFA Champions League, they needed at least two goals in next 6 minutes and then the magic happened.

A 21 years old wonder kid, Rodrygo came on the pitch in the 68th minute of the match and he took only 23 minutes to destroy Manchester City from the core as he successfully made a comeback after scoring two goals in 90th and 91st minute and set the stage for the remaining match.

After that, extra time started and one thing was missing from the whole match which was the goal of Karim Benzema because of the foul by Manchester City player, Ruben Dias on Karim Benzema, Real Madrid got the penalty and Karim Benzema scored that penalty in 95th minute and now, Real Madrid was leading the match against Manchester City.

After that, Real Madrid played like the champions, and the confidence of Carlo Ancelotti was in seven heavens and we got proof of that when he substituted Karim Benzema and bring Dani Ceballos onto the pitch in the 104th minute.

The final of the UEFA Champions League will be played between Real Madrid and Liverpool on 29th May 2022 in Paris, and as a Real Madrid fan, I want my team to win but Liverpool is a team to beat this season, and both the teams have an equal chance against them.

One last thing I want to say that, 

“Win, lose or tie, Hala Madrid till I die”
“Hasta el final, Vamos Real”
