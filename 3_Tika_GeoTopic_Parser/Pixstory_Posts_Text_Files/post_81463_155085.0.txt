It was all eyes on Martin Odegaard as he returned to Norway for his first game in club football since leaving Stromgodset for Real Madrid back in 2015.Still only 23, Martin was just 13 when he made his first team debut in a friendly, and he played a league game against Bodo/Glimt when he was 15.Now the captain of his country, and one of Europe’s foremost No. 10s, he comes back to Norway as Arsenal skipper too, playing what he believes is the best football of his career.Before our UEL game, Martin faced the media.𝐎𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐧 𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐩𝐢𝐭𝐜𝐡...I think the biggest mistake we can make is to talk too much about the pitch, the weather or whatever. The most important thing is just to come here and win the game, that’s all that matters. We are not going to focus too much on the pitch, obviously it’s different and we have to adjust a little bit but it’s still football, it’s still the same rules and we are going to go out to win the game.𝐎𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐝𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐩𝐢𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐲𝐞𝐚𝐫 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐭…I think it’s just us becoming better as a team. We all understand what Mikel wants from us, even more. We work hard every day to improve and everyone understands the system and the style. We are working hard to improve on the pitch and of course we have brought some new players in who have got a lot of qualities. I think the main thing is the work we do every day at the training pitch, how we improve and how we work.𝐎𝐧 𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐦𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐦𝐚𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐛 𝐝𝐞𝐛𝐮𝐭 𝟏𝟎 𝐲𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐬 𝐚𝐠𝐨 𝐢𝐧 𝐍𝐨𝐫𝐰𝐚𝐲…Yeah, I remember it well. I was a kid, I feel young today but that was about eight, ten years ago so I was a kid. It was a good time obviously, I was playing football, having fun, enjoying life doing what I love. It was a great time, everything went really quick but I enjoyed it.
