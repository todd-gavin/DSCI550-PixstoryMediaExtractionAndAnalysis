Or should I say clubbing fit check This was the first time I ever wore corset and it was a little risky ngl you need to adjust it a little if you dance in clubs like an animal just as I do the top was pretty revealing and bold in itself so i just carried a plain black bag and black pants to mute it out a little bit but i felt that something was missing so I added a belt chain to my pants and i was happy with the look I layered some necklaces and some bracelets because what are we living fir if not accessorising I loved this outfit man one of my friends said too many chains looking at the bag and the necklace and the belt chain but he said that you re killing it
