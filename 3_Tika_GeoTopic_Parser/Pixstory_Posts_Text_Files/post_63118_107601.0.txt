"I make humorous videos for a living," says internet influencer Dolly Singh in her Instagram bio. 

Because she never portrays herself as perfect and flawless, her content goes viral. Dolly's videos are based on the everyday, boring, and familiar experiences that we all have. 
The digital creator recently appeared in the Netflix series Bhaag Beanie Bhaag as Kapi Kapadia, the protagonist's (Swara Bhaskar) best friend.
