Today is birth anniversary of Shamshad Begum. 
She had a distinctive style and was in early 1950s the highest paid singer. 
Besides singing for heroines she also sang for  Shammi Kapoor (Bluff Master, 1963), Mehmood (Johar Mehmood in Hong Kong, 1971) and Biswajeet (Kismat, 1968). It did not matter to her that she sang the item song Ek do teen (Awara, 1951) after doing all the heroine numbers for Raj Kapoor in Aag.
OP Nayyar was very fond of using her voice and likened her vocals to the resonance of a brand new silver coin. There is pain in Ek tera sahara (Shama, 1946), innocence in Main to Odhun (Humayun, 1945), sorrow in Pee ke ghar aaj pyaari dulhaniya chali (Mother India, 1957), joy in Mere piya gaye Rangoon, wonder in the multilingual Ye duniya roop ki chor (Shabnam, 1949), mirth in Aana meri jaan Sunday ke Sunday (Shehnai, 1947) and romance in Chandni banke aayi hai bahar (Dulari, 1949) and Chaman mein rehke veerana mera dil hota jata hai (Deedar, 1951). Till today wedding bands play her unforgettable bride farewell song Chhod babul ka ghar. â€ƒSaiyan dil mein aana re, Leke pehla pehla pyar and Kajra mohabbat wala are still hummed.
