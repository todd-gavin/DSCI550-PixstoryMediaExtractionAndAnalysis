When it comes to the K-Drama industry, it seems like there are so many amazing actors and actresses coming into the scene and making their mark by starring in some of the hottest K-Dramas around. Yet, it doesn’t mean netizens have forgotten about the veterans of the industry.

One of those is Lee Min Ho…
Lee Min Ho has been acting for almost 20 years and gained attention for roles in iconic K-Dramas such as Boys Over Flowers, The Heirs, and The King: Eternal Monarch.
Another one is actress Son Hye Kyo.

Making her first appearance as a walk on character in 1995, the actress has just grown in fame and popularity, shining in shows such as Full House and Descendants Of The Sun.

After years of both Song Hye Kyo and Lee Min Ho starring in K-Dramas and never meeting, despite rumors of their relationship, netizens have finally seen the two interacting… all the way in New York.

Both Song Hye Kyo and Lee Min Ho recently departed from Incheon Airport to make their way to New York for the city’s upcoming fashion week. As expected, they both shined with their visuals and personality when leaving.

Well, it seems like two of the biggest actors in the K-Drama industry finally met up when they were sat next to each other at the Fendi show in New York. The two looked absolutely amazing at the show, chanelling a more simplistic look.

In a photo posted by Elle Singapore, the duo look like a visual masterpiece stood next to each other and between them, there is nearly 50 years of experience in the Korean television and film industry.

Luckily, it seems like photographers and accounts from those attending the same event didn’t want netizens to miss out on all the content. Throughout the event, pictures were shared of the duo, and it was a dream come true for fans to see the dubbed “Hallyu King and Queen” finally in one shot together.
