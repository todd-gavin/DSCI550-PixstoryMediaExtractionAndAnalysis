Jakey was 12 years old when he fled Afghanistan. Traveling by foot, he spent a year moving across Afghanistan into Pakistan, then Iran, Turkey and Bulgaria, until finally settling in Serbia.

Recalling his difficult journey, Jakey said, "When I first arrived I was scared and tired. I didn’t have anybody." 

Jakey's five brothers and two sisters remained in Afghanistan. "It's a really difficult situation [in Afghanistan] for boys that are 15 or 16," he said. "They [armed groups] can just come and say you need to be a soldier. If you say no, they can kill you."

At the temporary refugee settlement where he was staying with other unaccompanied minors, Save the Children provided Jakey with assistance. "Now I know some people here," said Jakey, referring to, among others, Amila*, his Save the Children legal guardian.
