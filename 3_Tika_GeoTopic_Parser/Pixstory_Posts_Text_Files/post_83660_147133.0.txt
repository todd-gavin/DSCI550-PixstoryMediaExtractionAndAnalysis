OK, here's how you know you'll be happy in your relationship. And, in my opinion, it is criminally underrated. And it comes from the German poet Rilke, who says that being in a happy relationship, like a sign of a good relationship, is that you essentially become introverts together. He puts it more poetically: true love is when two solitudes meet and guard each other's solitudes.
And it's perfect, right? Because being happy and in love means you don't need to be anywhere else. You don't need other people to entertain you. It's as if you've created your own world. You could literally just enjoy each other's company, like having a meal in the other person's presence and the food tastes better. Or you watch a movie together and the lines are funnier. Because you've created a cave in which only your love exists, life suddenly appears brighter and more rich. You become mutual best friends and are introverted in your love.
Two solitudes guarding each other, that's a sign of happiness.
