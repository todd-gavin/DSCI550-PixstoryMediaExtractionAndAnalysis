Last Friday, the United States Supreme Court overturned its Roe v. Wade decision, effectively making abortion a states’ rights issue, and giving more autonomy to cishet white men over our bodies. 

The decision was immediately applauded by many Christians across the country, as their God tells them to harass and make every woman's life Miserable. 

But many people on twitter posed the question, what about the other religions???? 

HEART, a non-profit Muslim women’s group with staffers in the D.C. area, agreed with that assertion online.

The organization posted a statement online that claimed reproductive justice is inherently Islamic.

“We will always assert that Muslims have the freedom to make decisions over [their] own bodies”, HEART’s statement reads.

Sheila Katz serves as CEO of the National Council of Jewish Women and says her organization has already raised over $225,000 for its fund for abortion access.

“Abortion is permitted and sometimes required in Jewish tradition when the mother or pregnant person's life is at risk,” she said.

Katz said the Supreme Court’s decision violates the religious freedom of Jewish people in America.

Once again, America has showed the world that to them religious freedom means only Christianity's freedom. And to the politicians nothing else matters except who is willing to cast a vote for them
