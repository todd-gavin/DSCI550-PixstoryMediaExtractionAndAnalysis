Besides Hindi, the iconic singer also sang in Marathi, Bengali and other regional languages. She was honoured with the Bharat Ratna, Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan and Dadasaheb Phalke Award as well as several National and Filmfare Awards. Mangeshkar’s last complete album was for the 2004 Bollywood release Veer-Zaara.


Mangeshkar, who was awarded the Bharat Ratna, the nation’s highest civilian award, in 2001, died of post-Covid-19 complications at 8.12am Sunday.


My deepest condolences to 'The Nightingale Of India'.
