Giorgio Chiellini s time in Turin has been something of a long standing fairytale The Italian has along with several of his teammates formed the eternal Old guard of Italy s footballing legacy Others came and left but Chiellini s time at the club is yet to come to a close His agent Davide Lippi was recently quizzed about links to a possible MLS move in the summer MLS We are talking about an athlete known worldwide I don t know where he could go but he won t lack offers It takes time and patience to make decisions with these kinds of players He told Sky Sports Italia as reported by Football Italia At Giorgio Chiellini is no longer at the peak of his powers He does however instill calm and is a figurative leader in the locker room Last summer s European Championship showed just how potent and decisive he can be Along with the likes of Bonucci Buffon Andrea Pirlo and Andrea Barzagli before that he formed one of Juventus iconic old guards to have represented the national team for so long I enjoy the days I am happy and serene I must understand and evaluate many things I think about the games in the meantime and I enjoy them Chiellini has options but his decision will take time processing I ve known Davide since we have a close bond and we ve grown together I ve never thought about putting our rapport in doubt and after years we are still here The defender is out of contract in the summer of with no participation in the national team for the foreseeable future His contract extension was partly to see him represent his nation at this year s World Cup With that out of the picture it leaves him with very little to look forward to in Turin
