Unlike many motion pictures this one continually builds to its conclusion It starts out as the story of a small job then evolves into a search for the dreaded Keyser Soze a legendary criminal of such viciousness that even hardened men like Keaton think twice before crossing him The Usual Suspects moves towards its inevitable finale Soze s shadowy presence becomes increasingly more dangerous and important and we get the sense that those who think they hold the cards actually have the weakest hands In the way it folds its various elements into a single resolution which the viewer will be able to guess beforehand Singer s film can be accused of toying with the audience However at times like this when the person tugging the strings is adept at his craft being toyed with can be a worthwhile experience The Usual Suspects stands out from the genre and forms a unique space for itself
