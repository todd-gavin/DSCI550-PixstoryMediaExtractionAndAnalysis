Lavender oil

Analgesic, antifungal, and antibacterial properties are found in lavender. Lavender has a distinct and strong scent that can help repel mosquitos. Lavender oil is extracted from crushing lavender flowers. 

Citronella oil

An essential oil commonly used outdoors that repels mosquitoes is citronella. It is a common ingredient in insect repellents and is made from a combination of herbs. Citronella candles can offer up to 50% more protection when used outside.

Tea tree oil

The antibacterial, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory qualities of this oil are well recognised. Studies, however, also imply that tea tree oil might work well as an insect repellent. Tea tree oil-based repellents are efficient against mosquitoes, bush flies, and biting midges, according to field tests.

Neem oil

In Ethiopia, a 2015 study on the efficacy of neem oil discovered that it provided more than 70% protection for three hours.

Due to its potential for causing skin irritation, neem oil is not recommended as a topical repellent.

Geraniol

Geraniol is a type of alcohol used as a fragrance or flavor. It’s from plant oils like citronella, lemongrass, and rose. As an ingredient in mosquito repellent, it’s known to be effective for 2 to 4 hours, depending on the species.
