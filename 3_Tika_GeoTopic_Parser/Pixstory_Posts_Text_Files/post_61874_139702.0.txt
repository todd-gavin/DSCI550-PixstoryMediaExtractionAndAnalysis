Hours after a video of singer-actor Harry Styles allegedly spitting on actor Chris Pine emerged online, a representative of Chris dismissed the claims and called it a ridiculous story. The incident took place at the Venice Film Festival premiere of Don't Worry Darling when Harry took a seat next to Chris.
In the video clip, as Harry came to take his seat, he seemed to lean towards Chris Pine and 'spit' on his lap. People on social media were convinced of Harry's action after Chris, who was clapping, stopped midway, smiled and looked down at his lap. He then grabbed his sunglasses and kept smiling. Harry sat down and waved at the audience before checking his phone.
Now, speaking to Variety, Chris' representative said, “This is a ridiculous story — a complete fabrication and the result of an odd online illusion that is clearly deceiving and allows for foolish speculation. Just to be clear, Harry Styles did not spit on Chris Pine. There is nothing but respect between these two men and any suggestion otherwise is a blatant attempt to create drama that simply does not exist.”
Twitter users had fun with this little tidbit, one user went as far as to say, that "Harry Styles will never spit, as he is a swallower"
