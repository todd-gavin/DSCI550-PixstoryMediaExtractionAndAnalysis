Hi Readers.
So basically,
I found 2 reasons for which people want to buy a Smartwatch.
1. It's Looks & Appearance
2. It'll make life Smarter & productive.

Now, reasons for which you should not buy a Smartwatch are:
1. It's more distracting
2. It's dependent on Smartphones
Something dependent on other thing the how can you define that as Smart.
3. It's Features are useless (somewhat)
4. You can Invest that money somewhere better.

I tried to make a video on this here is the link.
