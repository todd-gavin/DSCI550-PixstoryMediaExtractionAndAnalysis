 For a long time we have been discussing global warming and ozone air depletion It is even dealt with clarity in schools still the climate change and rising temperature have only gotten worse Humans are ignoring the red flags to an ultimate doom The scientific field has been talking for years now that humans are responsible for this climate change Is there a decrease in vehicles Environmental friendly methods are so expensive that no one wants to implement them Many gases are produced by humans by burning fossil fuels which create a greenhouse effect that traps heat and causes global warming Due to the increase in temperature people depend on air conditioners again creating a cycle of emitting toxic gases Methane is heightening in the atmosphere due to agriculture and fossil fuel production traps times as much heat as CO for the first years it is in the atmosphere and is responsible for about one fifth of global warming since Nitrous oxide primarily discharged through agricultural practices traps times as much heat as CO Over the th century as the concentrations of CO CH and NO increased in the atmosphere due to human activity the earth warmed by approximately F We cannot stop the agricultural industry instead we need to find safer alternatives or balance the level of gases in the atmosphere the extreme increase in the levels of Co is the act of humans Scripps Institution of Oceanology explained that the extreme speed at which carbon dioxide concentrations are increasing is unusual An increase of parts per million might have needed years or more to come to pass during ancient climate change events Does this point out how damaging humans are to the environment When are we going to stop harming the environment and start to think about a sustainable future
