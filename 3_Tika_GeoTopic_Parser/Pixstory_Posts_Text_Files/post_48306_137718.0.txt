Symptoms and signs of STD might arise in a matter of days or weeks, but they can also take months or even years to appear. While unprotected sex always increases the chance of getting an STD, condoms are particularly effective at reducing its transmission when used appropriately. Symptoms of an STD aren’t always visible. It is possible to have an STD and not be aware of it. In case you think you might have one depending on the STD warning signs, visit a sexual health clinic or your doctor for STI testing and treatment.
The duration between being exposed to an STI and experiencing symptoms varies depending on the disease. The most common STIs and their incubation periods are listed below:
*1) Chlamydia* - It takes between one and three weeks after you’ve been exposed to chlamydia for symptoms to appear. They are usually mild and short-lived.
*2) Gonorrhea* - The earliest signs of gonorrhea usually develop within 10 days of exposure. Some people, on the other hand, may be infected for months before showing signs or symptoms.
*3) Genital Herpes* - Symptoms can occur after 4 to 7 days, but they may not start for months or years. 
*4) Trichomoniasis* - Symptoms of trichomoniasis can emerge anywhere from five to twenty-eight days after exposure and range from minor discomfort to severe inflammation.
*5) HIV* - After 2 to 6 weeks, the first symptoms may appear. it lasts for about a week or two in the people who show the symptoms. 
*6) Syphilis* - Symptoms often develop after 2 to 3 weeks, however, they can appear sooner 
or later. 
*7) Genital Warts* - Symptoms of genital warts can occur anywhere from three weeks to months or even years following contact with the virus that causes them. 
*8) Scabies* - If you’ve never had scabies before, it can take up to 6 weeks for symptoms to show. If you’ve had scabies before, it could take as little as four days. 
If you have an STD, whether it’s bacterial, viral, or parasitic, getting treatment can help you avoid long-term health consequences.
