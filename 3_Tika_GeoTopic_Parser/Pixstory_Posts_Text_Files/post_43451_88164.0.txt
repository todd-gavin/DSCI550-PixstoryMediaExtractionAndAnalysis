Amazon.com Inc. announced the completion of its $8.5 billion acquisition of film studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer after regulators declined to challenge the deal, securing the company's largest acquisition in five years.

The closing, announced Thursday in a statement on the company's website, is the latest deal approved by a U.S. technology behemoth despite criticism that the companies have been able to gobble up smaller firms with little pushback from competition regulators.

The MGM deal was approved by European Union regulators on Tuesday after they determined it posed no competition issues. In the United States, the deadline for the Federal Trade Commission to file a challenge to the deal before it closed passed without the agency taking any action.
