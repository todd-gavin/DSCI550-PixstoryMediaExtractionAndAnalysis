It was now in the air Barcelona will not renew Dani Alves&#39; contract Thus ends the love story between the Blaugrana and the Brazilian full-back a page full of trophies and plays always on that right wing Dear Cul yes the time has come for our goodbye I dedicated more years at this club in these colors in this house but like everything in life the years go by the streets change They tried to fire me but they failed You can&#39;t imagine how resilient I am It was many years before football and the life that they always give something back to those who respect them decide to give me the opportunity to come back here to say hello I don&#39;t want to say goodbye without first thanking everyone behind the spotlight that makes our world perfect Thanks Thanks also to the staff who allowed me to return to this club and to be able to wear this wonderful shirt again you don&#39;t know how happy you have made me I hope you miss my craziness and my daily happiness If all goes well who will stay at the Bar to change the history of the club We won triplete sextete titles together a great golden book is written A very beautiful cycle closes but another even more demanding one opens May the world never forget one thing A lion even for years still a good crazy leonnn Forever Forza Bar a
