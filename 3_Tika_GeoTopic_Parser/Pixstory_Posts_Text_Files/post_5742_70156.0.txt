Climate change hotspots of the country have been mapped by the Indian State of Forest Report (ISFR) in three future time scenarios of 2030, 2050 and 2085.

Ladakh, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand are projected to witness the highest temperature increase whereas Andaman & Nicobar Islands, West Bengal, Goa, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh may face least temperature rise over these short, medium and long time periods.

The report also showcase that Northeastern coast & upper Malabar coast are most likely to have highest increase in rainfall whereas Andhra Pradesh, Sikkim and north western parts of the country such as ladakh, Jammu & Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh are projected to have the least increase and maybe some decline as well in rainfall over the years.
