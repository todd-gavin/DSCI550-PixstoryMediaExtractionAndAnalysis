Snakes and Ladders was firsr played in Ancient India. It was very popular by the name of Moksha Patamu and was invented by Hindu Spiritual teachers. The game was called "Leela" - and reflected the Hinduism consciousness around everyday life. Another name for it was the ladder to salvation, the game then made its perilous journey to Victorian England where a newer version was introduced by John Jacques in 1892. It also made its way into the USA by game inventor Milton Bradley in 1943. It was then given the name Snakes and ladders.
The children in India played the game the most because it was part of their education to know the effects of good deeds as opposed to bad deeds. The ladders represent values such as kindness; faith, humility and the snakes are the bad omen, which represent bad luck, anger, murder etc. The moral of the game is that a person can attain salvation through performing righteous good deeds whereas the evil ones which are the snakes takes rebirth in lower forms of life.
The last number on the board, which is 100, represents the Salvation. The aim of the game is to reach the number 100 on the snakes and ladders board. The original game had fewer snakes and smaller ladders. Now the influence of ‘Bad’ and get successful quickly has changed the face of the Board.
