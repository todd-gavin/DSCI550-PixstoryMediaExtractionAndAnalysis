The World Cup 2022 Golden Boot race is set to be one of the best in years, as some of the game's biggest goal threats strut their stuff on the biggest stage.
As well as hoping to fire their respective nations to success out in Qatar, the world's best strikers will be vying to claim individual honours as the tournament's top scorer.
Harry Kane is the bookies' favourite to win the World Cup 2022 Golden Boot for the second tournament running – something no one's ever done – but he's bound to face stiff competition.
Harry Kane (England)
With six goals – including a brace in England's dramatic 2-1 over Tunisia and a hat-trick in the 6-0 thrashing of Panama – Harry Kane scooped the Golden Boot at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
Kylian Mbappe (France)
Voted Best Young Player for years ago, Kylian Mbappe netted four times as he lit up his first-ever World Cup while still only 19.
The lightning-quick PSG star averages close to a goal every other game for his country and has finished as Ligue 1 top scorer in each of the last four seasons.
Neymar ( Brazil )
As always, the big question with Neymar is can he stay fit? If he does, Brazil's biggest star has a brilliant chance of bettering his previous World Cup best of four goals on home soil in 2014.
The 30-year-old has enjoyed a fine early season for PSG and is ready to spearhead spearhead his country's attack as the Selecao chase their first World Cup triumph since 2002.
Lionel Messi (Argentina)
With 86 goals in 162 caps, Lionel Messi isn't nearly as prolific for Argentina as he is at club level – but we reckon that's still a pretty impressive return.
Given that he'll be 39 by the time the 2026 World Cup comes around, this could well be the arguable GOAT's last chance to become a world champion – and imagine if he did it as top scorer, too...
Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal)
No one in the history of international football has scored more goals than Cristiano Ronaldo's – who's been on target 117 times for the country he captains.
