The Guardian reported that reducing the cost of living and fixing the aged care system are voters’ two top priorities for the 2022 federal election, according to a new Australian National University poll.

The survey of more than 3,500 people found those two issues transcended the political divide with more than 60% nominating them as top priorities, ranking ahead of issues of more concern to Coalition voters, including defence against terrorist attacks and reducing crime.

A majority of voters also nominated strengthening the nation’s economy (54.4%), reducing the cost of healthcare (53.5%) and dealing with global climate change (52.8%) as top priorities for the federal government.

The findings come as Labor prepares to enter the final fortnight of the campaign with a negative ad spree targeting Scott Morrison’s handling of the economy.

The new ad, launched on Thursday evening, notes the Coalition “doubled our debt even before Covid” and that companies with rising revenues received $19.7bn of jobkeeper wage subsidies, which it says is “one of the reasons our debt has now tripled”.

“Some of that money could’ve gone to making your life a bit easier,” it said. “[Morrison] says he’s good with money, but that really doesn’t add up.”
