Are you getting enough protein in your diet? While you may watch your calories, sugar and salt intake, you should also make sure you are ingesting enough protein. It plays a key role in the creation and maintenance of every cell in our bodies. It fuels our cells and powers our bodies.

Why your body needs protein

1. Build. Protein is an important building block of bones, muscles, cartilage and skin.

2. Repair. Your body uses it to build and repair tissue.

3. Oxygenate. Red blood cells contain a protein compound that carries oxygen throughout the body. 

4. Digest. About half the dietary protein that you consume each day goes into making enzymes, which aids in digesting food, and making new cells and body chemicals.

5. Regulate. Protein plays an important role in hormone regulation, especially during the transformation and development of cells during puberty.
