You'll want to look for moisturizers that contain natural ingredients like oats, wheatgrass, chamomile, or honey. Chemically, you're gonna need to look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid and squalene. Hyaluronic acid helps lock in moisture, while squalene helps to keep the skin's barrier intact.
You can also consider moisturizers with antioxidants like vitamin E or pro-vitamin B5. These ingredients help protect the skin from damage caused by free radicals.
These ingredients are effective at restoring moisture and protecting against dryness because they help restore the skin's barrier function. 
Another important consideration is the texture of a moisturizer. You want something that's light enough so it doesn't feel heavy or oily on your skin, but thick enough so it provides long-lasting hydration. Many moisturizers contain antioxidants to boost protection against the signs of aging, like I mentioned above, pay heed to that.
