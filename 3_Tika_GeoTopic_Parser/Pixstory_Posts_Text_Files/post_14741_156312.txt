Researchers are still learning about what happens in the brain during microsleep But a study from sheds light on the brain mechanisms at work In the experiment people awake for a grueling hours had their brain activity monitored after entering a dark fMRI machine When participants briefly drifted into microsleep researchers observed that the brain s thalamus became less active This part of the brain regulates the sleep wake cycle and acts as a sensory gatekeeper sending incoming information to other parts of the brain for processing But surprisingly during these moments of microsleep activity in parts of the brain responsible for paying attention ramped up Activation in these regions are likely our brain s way of staying awake and preventing us from fully succumbing to the urge to sleep And it might explain why many people can still perform tasks in auto pilot mode even though a key part of their brain is asleep
