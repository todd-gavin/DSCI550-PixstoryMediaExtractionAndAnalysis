Kubra Khademi an artist from Afghanistan sewed a piece of khaki colored cloth which is known as a global symbol of military goods for soldiers with gold thread in an artwork at the Avignon Festival in France titled From Armour to Vest She says that she tried to question the violence of war with this artwork The Avignon Festival is an annual art festival that takes place every summer in July in the courtyard of the Papal Palaces and other parts of the city of Avignon This festival is one of the oldest festivals in France and one of the biggest festivals in the world In an interview with France channel Mrs Khademi said about her artistic performance that after the fall of Kabul I saw pictures from the airfield where American soldiers abandoned their military goods boots and uniforms and left Afghanistan and this is the main idea I was shaped for this performance In explaining this artwork she said that after the fall of Kabul she decided to sew these military vests together with a golden needle According to the artist himself every needle that is pulled out with the thread is the end point for violence According to Kubra Khademi weapons are responsible for war and violence The golden thread that connects the vests is reminiscent of tailoring an occupation mostly reserved for women who only have access to traditional arts and are immune from the judgmental gaze of outsiders For the artist sewing is therapeutic It promises to build something new So she gives hope that after the war in the time of peace women will have space to think about a free and equal life with men In response to the question why his performance of Armour was unacceptable to many the artist said that the patriarchy in Afghanistan seeks to suppress women as much as possible With these words we women fought to get our rights as far as we can get our rights In this controversy her work was problematic for men who thought that women should have some freedom
