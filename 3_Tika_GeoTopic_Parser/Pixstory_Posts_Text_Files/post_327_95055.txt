As a self described free speech absolutist Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk s attempts to seize Twitter while riding on a free speech wave echo the arguments used by the powerful right when they get agitated about being called out for their transphobia While the United States associates itself as the beacon of free speech it forgets to mention the terms and conditions that apply from the Don t Say Gay bills to the books banning LGBTQI and race related books free speech only applies when it conserves the white heteropatriarchal status quo Musk is infamous for using his platform to mock transgender people and for using irrelevant remarks to silence anyone who calls him out Twitter is already a thriving space for influential figures who can attack transgender people without being held accountable by the platform scroll down JK Rowling s feed and you ll find plenty of evidence to back my argument It s easy to use free speech as a euphemism for hate when you couldn t care about the concrete harm and violence that it translates into beyond the screen What will a social media platform like Twitter reflect if it is governed by someone who s actions endorse hate
