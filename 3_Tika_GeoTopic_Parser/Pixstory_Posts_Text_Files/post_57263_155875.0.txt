Parent-child interaction therapy is another way to treat SAD. It has three main treatment phases:
Child-directed interaction (CDI), which focuses on improving the quality of the parent-child relationship. It involves warmth, attention, and praise. These help strengthen a child’s feeling of safety.
Bravery-directed interaction (BDI), which educates parents about why their child feels anxiety. Your child’s therapist will develop a bravery ladder. The ladder shows situations that cause anxious feelings. It establishes rewards for positive reactions.
Parent-directed interaction (PDI), which teaches parents to communicate clearly with their child. This helps to manage poor behavior.
