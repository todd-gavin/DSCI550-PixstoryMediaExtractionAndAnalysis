On April 2, CrPC Section 144 was imposed in Rajasthan’s Karauli district after stones were pelted during a ‘Shobha Yatra’ procession that day. The Quint reported that the police have arrested 46 people and detained seven others after communal clashes led to arson — shops and vehicles were set ablaze — and injured over two dozen people.

Two days later, a 12-second clip was widely shared on social media. The video shows men waving saffron flags and dancing in front of a mosque. One among the crowd can be seen raising a saffron flag atop the mosque. The video has been linked to the communal violence in Karauli. A viral claim, while celebrating the incident, suggested that “Meenas and Gujjars raised Bajrang Dal’s flag at the mosque where stones were pelted in Karauli”.

BJP leader Sujit Kumar made the same claim on Facebook without posting the video.

Several Facebook users also made the same claim on various pro-BJP groups such as —We support Arnab goswami sir, mahakaleshwar Temple Ujjain, � MISSION हिंदूराष्ट्र में अपने 100 मित्रों को जोड़ें �, 🚩 सनातनी योद्धा🚩நித்திய போர்வீரன்🚩शाश्वत योद्धा🚩, Kangna ranaut, and Modi Yogi.

Journalist Rana Ayyub posted the video on Instagram as an incident from Karauli. Her video gained over 3.5 lakh views.

Incident from UP
District Collector and Magistrate of Karauli Rajendra Singh said that the video viral on social media is not from Karauli. A tweet was posted from the Twitter handle of the DM, stating that “strict action” will be taken against those spreading rumours.

Activist Sayyad Uzma Parveen tweeted that the video is from Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur. She later posted images of the mosque and wrote that it is located in Gahmar.

A comparison of the mosque seen in the viral video with the pictures of the mosque shared by Uzma establishes that they are the same.
