French club Paris Saint-Germain have announced the launch of an exclusive NFT video auction and real-life experience to celebrate Leo Messi's seventh Ballon d'Or -  the first ever won by a player in a PSG shirt. 

The NFT "Ballon d'Or #7" will showcase exclusive footage and animations of Leo Messi's arrival in Paris, his first steps in the Rouge & Bleu, his first goal at the Parc des Princes, his seventh Ballon d'Or and much more, immortalised for the first time in digital format.

NFTs are one-of-a-kind items with digital certificates of authenticity. Your authentic, verifiable NFTs are stored on the Blockchain, a secure and transparent digital ledger. Buying and owning an NFT means you have a certificate of ownership. 

According to https://psgballondor7.com, millions of NFT and sports fans around the globe can register to take part in a unique one-week auction. Starting Tuesday 3 May, fans can bid on an exclusive customised video NFT created by PSG, which includes an overnight stay in Paris and an exclusive up-close experience with Paris Saint-Germain players.

Paris Saint-Germain’s Chief Brand Officer Fabien Allègre commented on the launch by saying, "PSG is proud to continue its work on NFT by launching a second piece of artwork, following the successful launch of Lucky Buddy NFT a year ago. The 'Golden Ball #7' NFT is the result of a unique and exclusive collaboration with the Ballon d'Or. Together we have gone one step further and created a comprehensive piece that combines a dynamic and personalised digital artwork with an exclusive real-life experience. This is a way to showcase the Ballon d'Or in an original way. This customised NFT video will be one of the most engaging pieces ever created in the world of sport.”
