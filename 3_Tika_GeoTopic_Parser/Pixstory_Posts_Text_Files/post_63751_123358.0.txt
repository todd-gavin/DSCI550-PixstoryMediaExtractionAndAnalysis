Call Of Duty’s upcoming juggernaught first person shooter Modern Warfare 2, just unveiled its F1 inspired map based on the Marina Bay Circuit in Singapore. The Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer beta will run from September 16 (10 AM PT) to September 17 for players who pre-order the game on PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5.
 
This will be followed by an open beta on PlayStation platforms which runs from September 18 to 20.
The multiplayer beta has multiple phases that will be rolled out over time. The second part will be an open beta that runs from September 22 to 23. This will be available to all PlayStation players, as well as Xbox and PC players who have pre-ordered the game.
 
Finally, the open beta will become available to gamers across all supported platforms between September 24 and September 26. Another point to note, is that PlayStation Plus will not be required to take part in the beta on PlayStation platforms, but Xbox Live Gold will be required if players wish to check it out on an Xbox platform.
 
 
The developers at Infinity Ward have further said that the beta includes a “robust multiplayer experience going beyond the Core 6v6 experience with a variety of meticulously designed maps of various sizes, and an equally impressive set of Modes, Progression experiences, and other aspects that will be more thoroughly revealed at Call of Duty: Next.”
 
Playing the beta also provides in-game rewards for the full game when it launches. If you pre-ordered the Vault Edition, then all of the Red Team 141 Operators and the FJX Cinder Weapon Vault will be available to use in the beta. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is slated for launch on October 28th, and will be available on  PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 will release later this year and will receive new details at September’s showcase.
