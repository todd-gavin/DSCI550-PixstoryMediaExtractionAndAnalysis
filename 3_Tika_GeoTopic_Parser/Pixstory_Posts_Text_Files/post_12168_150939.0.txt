Statue of Unity  - The world's largest  statue ....
The most significant creation in recent times, It rises 54 metres (177 ft) higher.

The 182-metre tall Statue of Unity-twice the size of the Statue of Liberty-will is the world’s tallest statue once it’s ready, a sheer marvel of engineering being pieced together by an army of over 3,000 workers, including 300 engineers from infrastructure major Larsen & Toubro (L&T).
