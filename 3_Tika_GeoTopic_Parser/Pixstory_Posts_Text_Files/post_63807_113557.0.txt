Since its release in 1977, Star Wars has been watched throughout the world. A galaxy full of intriguing concepts, creatures, history etc, Star Wars is a universe of its own with so much material to adapt from, that there can almost never be any shortage of material to adapt from.
 
In the 70s and early 80s we had the original trilogy which had a simple story of a rebellion fighting off an evil tyrannical empire, while later George Lucas greatly expanded on the lore with the divisive prequel trilogy. While the originals featured better film making and directing, the prequels featured a far superior storyline with an albeit flawed execution due to Lucas’s bad dialogue and over reliance on green screen technology.
 
While the prequels ( ep 1-3) were heavily trolled initially, time has been kind to them as they have come to be cherished by a big chunk of the Star Wars fandom, some of which also include its ardent haters, thanks to The Clone Wars show which vastly explored various facets of the Clone Wars, from its various battles, the clones, the flaws of the Jedi and all the incidents which made it possible for the Emperor to execute Order 66.
 
 
Upon the beloved franchise’s purchase by Disney in 2012, the dark times began . Unfortunately, Star Wars was turned from a magical and beautiful space opera into a propaganda machine full of forced feminism and lectures on racism, equality and whatnot, complete with an invincible Mary Sue of a protagonist, useless antagonists, creative bankruptcy, a messed up storyline which messes with all the original lore and ultimately wasted potential.
