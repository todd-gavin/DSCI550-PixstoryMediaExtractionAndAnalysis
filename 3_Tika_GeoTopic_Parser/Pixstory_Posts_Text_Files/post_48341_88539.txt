 Times are changing This is a sentence I have heard countless times in my life as a black woman People around me act like racism is a thing of past and we are living in an utopic America where black woman are not the double victims of patriarchy and racism But unfortunately history is testimony to the fact that the anti racist movement only includes men Even during the black history month wherein contributions of black people to landmark inventions is lauded black women are conveniently ignored For instance the Guardian talks about how initially only white women were admitted to the women s army corps which was created by President Franklin D Roosevelt in However following a push from the first lady Eleanor Roosevelt and civil rights leader Dr Mary McLeod Bethune Black women were eventually admitted But even after this did black women got treated fairly Alas no According to the US Army Center of Military History the women encountered racist and sexist treatment including hostility and stories impugning their character propagated by both white and Black male soldiers who disliked the fact that Black women were allowed in the army At one point a general chastised Maj Charity Adams the unit commander of an army and threatened to delegate her leadership to a white officer Adams allegedly replied Over my dead body sir And after so many years they are getting the credit they deserve The only all Black all female second world war battalion will be awarded the congressional gold medal after Joe Biden signed a bipartisan bill on Monday to honor the women s efforts But in my opinion it is still not soon enough Instead of lauding this move we should be questioning as to why it took so much time
