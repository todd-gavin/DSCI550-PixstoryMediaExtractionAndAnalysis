Weekends Simply means having fun dressing up doing parties and much more Today i dressed up myself in this Lemon Yellow Off shoulders Frock I m not a fan of frock dresses so i was bit confused about this dress but then i thought let s give it a try This fit turned out soo beautiful When i saw myself in mirror i was like Ohh wow not bad And with my go to hairstyle Straight open hair i felt like a doll with pretty white hair pin A shoe has much more to offer than just to walk So i paired up my frock with white shoes and i guess it s perfect Surely gonna buy more frock dresses now Went out today for a movie with my friends to spend my weekend and i had a great time What do you think about my outfit Tell me in notes
