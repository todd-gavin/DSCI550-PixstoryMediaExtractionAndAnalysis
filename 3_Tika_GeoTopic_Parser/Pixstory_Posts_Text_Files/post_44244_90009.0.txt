#3.  Francis Jeffers

Francis Jeffers joined Arsenal from Everton for £8 million in the summer of 2001, and Arsene Wenger notoriously described him as his "fox in the box," essentially hoping he'd become the club's latest goal-poacher. Unfortunately, injuries cut short his tenure at Highbury, and he never reached his full potential.

His first season at Arsenal saw him make just 10 appearances in all competitions, scoring just two goals, as he struggled to get into the first squad due to the form of fellow forwards Thierry Henry and Sylvain Wiltord.


#2.  Shkodran Mustafi

Shkodran Mustafi of Germany is still at Arsenal at the time of writing, and it's not out of the question that he may turn his career around there, but right now it looks about as likely as the Gunners winning the Champions League this season - and they aren't even in the competition.

Mustafi – who joined Arsenal for a colossal £35 million from Valencia in the summer of 2016 – was intended to shore up the Gunners' shaky defence, but although doing well in his first season, staying undefeated in his first 18 games for the club, he was exposed soon after.


#1.  Amaury Bischoff

Arsenal fans should have been alarmed when manager Arsene Wenger labelled the signing of Franco-Portuguese midfielder Amaury Bischoff as a "talent gamble" due to his poor injury record in 2008, but why the Gunners were interested in the then-21-year-old remains a mystery.

His stint at the Emirates turned out to be a complete waste of time; he only played roughly 25 Premier League minutes after replacing Theo Walcott in a win over Portsmouth, and was discreetly released after his one-year contract with the club expired in the summer of 2009. He's since indicated that he has no regrets regarding his time at Arsenal, which is at least one bright spot in the scenario.
