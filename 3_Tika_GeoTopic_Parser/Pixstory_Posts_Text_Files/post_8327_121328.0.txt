It must be only yesterday that most of the people in India got to know about a sport named "Lawn Bowls" when the team reached their first ever finals in the games history, and today the Indian women have won the historic gold for the country in the not-so-popular sport by beating 3 times Commonwealth Champions South Africa 17-10 in a thriller.
The 15 ends (rounds)match started in India's favour but then the former Champions South Africa came back strongly halfway through the match. The game post the equaliser after End- 12 quickly turned into India's favour again with a brilliant strategy coupled with a much-needed stroke of luck.
The final throw made all the four Indian players jump in joy knowing that they have not only brought gold to their country but along with that a new sport as well.
Considering the girls didn't even get the needed resources, time and space to practice much before the games, this medal has brought hopes not just to India but to every sportsperson around the world who struggles all their life to compete and win at the highest level in the absence of any support system.
