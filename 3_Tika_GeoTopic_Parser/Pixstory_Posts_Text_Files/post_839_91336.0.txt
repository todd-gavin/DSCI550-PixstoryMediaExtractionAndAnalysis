This I found really cool. Nor will any of you be surprised as to why Italian chef Valerio Braschi's bizarre fine dining creations -- including a toothpaste tube full of lasagna -- are causing such a stir in Rome.,

Braschi, 24, has been pushing the boundaries of classic cuisine atÂ Ristorante 1978, a Michelin Guide-listed venue in the Italian capital's chic Trieste Salario district, in the hope of surprising diners, treating them to new taste sensations and confounding their expectations.

"My desire to experiment with daring new flavors and concoctions by creating new combinations is infinite, there are no boundaries in cuisine and I believe you must be open to everything," Braschi tells CNN

Way to go, er eat, I must say.  And please do share some of your favourite dining creations.
