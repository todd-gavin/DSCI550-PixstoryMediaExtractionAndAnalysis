Breastfeeding positions

Before you breastfeed your baby, have a drink beside you – something thirst quenching like a big glass of water. There are a few different breastfeeding positions you can try, these are 3 of the most popular:

1 Cradle hold

This is the probably the most popular breastfeeding position. However, if you've had a caesarean, this may be uncomfortable as your baby lies across your tummy near the scar (try lying on your side or the rugby hold instead). For the cradle hold, sit in a comfy chair with arm rests, or a bed with cushions or pillows around you.

1 Lie your baby across your lap, facing you.

2 Place your baby's head on your forearm – nose towards your nipple. Your hand should support the length of their body.

3 Place your baby's lower arm under yours.

4 Check to make sure your baby's ear, shoulder and hip are in a straight line.


2 Lying on your side

This is a good position if you've had a caesarean or difficult delivery, or if you're breastfeeding in the middle of the night . 

1 Start by getting comfy lying on your side. Your baby lies facing you, so you are tummy to tummy. Check to make sure your baby's ear, shoulder and hip are in a straight line – not twisted.

2 Put some cushions or pillows behind you for support. A rolled up baby blanket placed behind your baby will help support them - remember to remove it after you have finished feeding. If you've got a pillow under your head, make sure it's not too close to your baby's head or face.

3 Tuck the arm you're lying on under your head or pillow (ensuring your baby's position isn't altered by the pillow) and use your free arm to support and guide your baby's head to your breast.

3 Laid-back nursing

Laid-back breastfeeding, also known as "biological nursing", is when you lie back in a comfortable semi-reclined position on a comfy sofa or bed.
