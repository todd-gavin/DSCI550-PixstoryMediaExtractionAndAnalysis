Growing up in the hills of Uttarakhand, delicious, organic produce cultivated in the mountains was a staple in Babita Bhatt’s house. So when she moved to Delhi, the low-grade produce and non-availability of a steady, reliable supply of organic produce hit her hard. “For instance, the store-bought barnyard millet was polished white and tasteless, unlike the one in the hills which were unpolished and delicious. The city vegetables and fruits also lacked luster, texture, and taste,” she says. After her daughter was born, she decided to move back to Dehradun.

When she started out, Bhatt was looking for millets and maize that would be good for her baby. But her search came a cropper in the city. Her childhood in Garhwal had equipped her with an understanding of what real organic produce is. The polished hybrid grains found in the city just did not make the cut. From the look to the taste of the produce, everything seemed artificial and laden with chemicals. Her need for food that she used to eat during her childhood, led her to associate herself with organic farmers, first as a consumer and later as an entrepreneur.

Today, through her homegrown brand, Bhatt is working on #Back2Roots (B2R) model motto. This model harnesses traditional knowledge of agriculture, forms community partnerships, imparts training, creates a robust supply chain, and improves incomes by the guaranteed buyback. This entrepreneur has formed successful partnerships with a network of more than 2,200 farmers across Uttarakhand and the North East, as also partnerships with several grassroots NGOs. “Agriculture in the Himalayan region has always been a great source of health and nutrition. Also, the changing lifestyle in urban India has created a huge demand for pure and organic products from the Himalayan region,” says Bhatt.
