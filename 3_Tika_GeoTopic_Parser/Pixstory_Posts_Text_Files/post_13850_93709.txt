Nobody came forward to back them The police and the administration allowed them inside the stadium rather grudgingly The media preferred to blackout their activities completely Yet they were there a bunch of young boys and girls reached Kolkata s Salt Lake Stadium hours before the match started and stayed throughout As ATK Mohun Bagan routed Sri Lanka s Blue Stars in the AFC Cup a section of the fans in the stands shouted relentlessly demanding the removal of the word ATK from the current official name of the year old club They want the football team to go back to their old name of Mohun Bagan AC which was changed to ATK Mohun Bagan a couple of seasons ago after per cent of the public club s shares were handed over to ISL franchise ATK owner to Sanjiv Goenka and it was announced the two clubs had officially merged Goenka is a business tycoon one of eastern metropolis richest powerful and influential persons Mohun Bagan have millions of fans spread all over the world Many of them are dead against the so called merger and feel the move was initiated for the benefit of a handful of people within the club administration who feared losing their positions unless the merger was approved The merger some members alleged was done in the most mysterious manner keeping the eight thousand odd members in complete dark But members could do little as rich and powerful joined hands to safeguard their own interest Nevertheless a good number of fans displayed banners in the AFC Cup tie at Salt Lake Stadium that read different slogans like We are supporters not your customers Keep the years old legacy intact Mariners are rich with our history and emotion you can t afford them Remove ATK Bring back Mohun Bagan etc This could hardly create a stir as the local media for reasons best known to them only decided to ignore the sentiments of the fans But can the fans keep up the pressure and continue their agitations The coming season in Kolkata will be interesting to watch out for
