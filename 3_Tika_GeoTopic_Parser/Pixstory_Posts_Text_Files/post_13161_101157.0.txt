Why aren't our 20-year-old politicians ashamed? Do not confess and do not want an excuse? Because they do not see themselves and their people as deserving more than this, it was not something that did not exist. Why are you ashamed of it? Because they come from a culture and a country that is very interested in making human beings miserable and producing wounded, suffering, needy, helpless and destitute human beings, that is, less deserving human versions. If this is not the case, check your heart, how many, which ethnic groups, followers of which religions, speakers of which languages, etc. you want to be poor and helpless. You will find a large number, when we collect the curses of all our compatriots, there is no one who is not hated, there is no group whose absence is not desired, and this is the general result of public misery, humiliation and misery.
