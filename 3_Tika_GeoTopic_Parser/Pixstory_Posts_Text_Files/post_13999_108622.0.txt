When Andy Dufresne tries to help the captain avoid paying taxes, Red speculates, "Perhaps he did it to feel normal." Norton had prioritised the importance of items over all else, threatening to destroy Andy's library. Norton, on the other hand, never realised that Andy was more concerned with doing things than with attaining goals. Most of us aspire to greatness, and many films inspire us to do so. This is a film that teaches the world that doing basic things keeps the world moving forward. That implied emotional connection was incredible. The majority of us feel horrible since we have never felt happy for whatever we have done. This film taught us that doing good is more important than doing well.
