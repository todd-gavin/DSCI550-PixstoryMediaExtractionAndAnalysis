Magic Johnson's announcement of his departure from the NBA was one of the biggest moments in the league's history. 

As per Essentially Sports, this happened after the Lakers legend's HIV test resulted in positivity. NBA great Michael Jordan was among the millions of people who were stunned by his news, which made headlines all around the world. 

The legendary Bulls player discussed in an interview how he felt when Magic made the announcement. The six-time NBA champion claimed that while making the news while driving home, he nearly ran off the road. 

Jordan also called Magic, who was more composed than Jordan. Johnson admitted that some insurance policies obliged him to have HIV testing when asked if he had undergone any.

Interestingly enough, MJ felt that Magic wasn’t only the promiscuous athlete in the league. Jordan said, “One of your prime personalities has gone public and said he got it through promiscuity. He wasn’t the only promiscuous athlete. I’m pretty sure he won’t be the last.”

Johnson was diagnosed with HIV prior to the 1991-92 season, which forced him to re-think his future. In a public statement, Johnson announced that he will be retiring. However, he made a phenomenal comeback as he led the 1992 Dream Team to the gold medal during the Barcelona Olympics.
