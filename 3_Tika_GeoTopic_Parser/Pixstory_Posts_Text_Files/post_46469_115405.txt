It is rightly said that if you have it at your home you are more likely to eat it So better be mindful when doing grocery shopping rules I follow I always make a list before going so that I don t end up buying stuff that I don t need Specially something to munch on to I always buy only basic groceries like rice flour nuts green tea seeds coffee makhanas pulses legumes etc You will not even find a packet of biscuit at my place I always make sure I read the ingredient list before buying anything from the store If it has any latent items which could be unhealthy I don t take it For example low fat namkeens It is a marketing gimmick and nothing else There s nothing low fat about that namkeen Try and be aware of what you are putting inside your body If I feel like having nachos or a chocolate I only get it the day I want to have it I never store it at my place These things really helped me Thank me later and make sure you are buying healthy groceries let me know in notes below that do you face issues while buying groceries due to different demands of family members
