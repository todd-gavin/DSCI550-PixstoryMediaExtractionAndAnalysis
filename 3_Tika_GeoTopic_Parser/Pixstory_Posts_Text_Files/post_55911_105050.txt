 It might be an irony that nuclear plants are safe for the same reason nuclear weapons are hazardous Fuel uranium is used in powerplants as well as a raw material for bombs This can create one million times more heat per its mass than its fossil fuel and gunpowder counterparts Since nuclear plants produce heat without fire they emit no air pollution in the form of smoke According to WHO the smoke from burning fossil fuels and biomass affects the premature deaths of seven million people per year according to the World Health Organization When we talk about incidents we have to remember that plants release very small amounts of radioactive matter in most cases they are built maximum safe to avoid any kind of explosion Moreover it requires fewer land resources than renewable power plants Wind and solar are coming down in cost they re expanding their deployment and that s great but it s not sufficient to get us to deep decarbonization and a bigger transition away from fossil fuels nuclear energy is reliable it s cheap and it s low carbon Nuclear has been this really big risky costly project in the past It has changed and feeble minds can t accept these changes
