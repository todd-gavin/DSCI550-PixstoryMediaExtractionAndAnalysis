This Rome Masters edition is proving to be a negative tournament for Italy In addition to Fabio Fognini and net of the absences of Berrettini and Musetti, the only other blue to reach the second round is Jannik Sinner who got rid of the Spaniard Pedro Martinez last night and who tonight he will face Fognini himself in the round of 32 The good news that necessarily at least one Italian will be in the round of 16 The bad news is that the contingent will get even thinner Yesterday in fact the courageous year-old Nardi was eliminated who lost against a top ten player like Norrie and the last two blues in the draw Jasmine Paolini demolished by the Swiss Teichman for and Lucia Bronzetti perhaps the most in shape of the blues eliminated by the Colombian Osorio Serrano
