The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan a year ago, while their government was overthrown nearly 20 years ago following the attack of the United States and its allies. ‎
During the past year, the people of Afghanistan have struggled with the consequences of the return of the Taliban, which brought their country to the brink of disaster in many ways. Afghanistan's economy was deprived of international aid after the Taliban entered Kabul. Millions of Afghans no longer have the possibility of providing their daily food and almost the entire population of Afghanistan lives in poverty. ‎
Although Taliban officials last year spoke of a more balanced approach compared to the first period of their government, the experience of the past 12 months has shown that the Taliban have not changed in two decades away from power. ‎
Opposing the achievements of Afghan women and ignoring their rights, creating restrictions on the media and a suffocating atmosphere were the main features of a year of the Taliban's reappearance in Afghanistan.
