We are a toxic generation that doesn t know how to build genuine relationships We end up throwing lines like I don t owe anyone anything You do owe people something you owe those you offended an apology You owe those who gave you support gratitude And you owe those you disrespect respect Accounting is a personal act of integrity and moral principles over what the trends and society say We will forever live in a broken society until we learn to take responsibility for our actions that impact other people s lives negatively
