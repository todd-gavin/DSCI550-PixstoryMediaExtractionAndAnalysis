More in the tank journalism from Big Media…


CNN headline last night said: FBI Raids Trump Home, etc. I remember it very clearly. This morning it’s: FBI Executes Search Warrant. 

They’ve gotta be careful, don’t they. Even they realize this could hand Trump the election. 

Media has done a great job recently of circling the messaging wagons. “Whopping” jobs report, declare two pubs at the same exact time. Jan 6 riots by idiots taking selfies = “bloody insurrection.” Violent looting and burning and literal takeovers of sections of major American cities were “mostly peaceful.”

It was just a search warrant execution, you guys, not a raid like we said all night before we got calls from the White House screaming at us to tone it down.
