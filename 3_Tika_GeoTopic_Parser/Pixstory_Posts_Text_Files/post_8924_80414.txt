These are the exact words I want to tell to all the patriarchal forces who have nothing good to do except bossing around being misogynist I also have something to tell to all the so called feminist who have given it to patriarchy consciously or unconsciously You need to go back and reread the definition of feminism Do you really think that all those men who are shouting behind their Twitter accounts calling for hijabban really mean to empower Muslim women Don t you think they will not come after you and shame you if you chose to wear a bikini someday Well I know all the controversy behind the hijabban is deep rooted to Islamophobia but don t let this hate for Muslims knock you down sometime later because the patriarchy and misogyny will come after you as well to decide who you can marry what you can cook what you can reproduce and more importantly how you should be treated For all those men who are putting an ignorant argument in support of hijabban and claiming that Afghan women are fighting against Hijab in Afghanistan because the Taliban are forcing them to wear it I have something to tell you so listen clear and loud We aren t fighting against hijab with the Taliban we are fighting against patriarchy who is dictating us what to wear and what not to wear I see no difference between the men behind their Twitter handles advocating for a hijabban in India and the Taliban in Afghanistan both are misogynist and highly patriarchal Be it a Muslim women a Hindu women a Christian women or any women from any background and ethnicity they should have the right to choose for themselves It should be their choice to wear a bikini or a burkha Those women who support the hijabban in India or any part of the world have already lost the plot to patriarchy and hate
