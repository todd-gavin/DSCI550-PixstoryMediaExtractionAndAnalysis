In a previous interview at the end of "Extraordinary Attorney Woo", Kang Tae Oh said, 'A lot of my 2/6 acquaintances told me, 'I wish you could do more before going.' But still can't believe I'm going to the military." Ahead of his military duty, Kang Tae Oh drew attention by mentioning Seo Kang Joon, an active-duty soldier. Seo Kang Joon enlisted last November and received a commendation from the division commander for his outstanding performance at the boot camp.
When asked if he received any advice from Seo Kang Joon, Kang Tae Oh said, "Rather than giving me advice, Kang Joon hyung said that he became a corporal. I thought his enlistment was already halfway through so I asked, 'Are you already a corporal?' and got scolded." Kang Tae Oh added, "He also told me, 'A day here feels like a year", adding to the laughter.
