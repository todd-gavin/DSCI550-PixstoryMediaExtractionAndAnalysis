She’s now a wife , right ? Of course , her consent is applicable 24 hours of the day and 365 days of the year ! 

It’s 2022 and India remains one of 36 countries where it is not a crime for a man to rape a woman — as long as they are married . But why ? For this we first have to understand what is martial rape ?? Marital rape is the act of sexual intercourse with one's spouse without the other spouse's consent .

Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code , which classifies rape as a crime , contains exception . If a male engages in sexual activity with a woman either against or without her agreement , or if she is a minor , he has committed rape . (In India 18 is the minimum age for permission to be legal.)  Exception 2 to Section 375 exempts unwelcome sex with a wife above the age of fifteen from this definition of rape , making it OK for men to rape women over the age of fifteen who also happen to be their spouses !

Rape is rape , and rape is a crime . So, what’s holding India , a society , that suppresses women’s voices or a culture where marriage and family , still hold utmost significance as the building blocks of society !

Undoubtedly , not making marital rape crime in India is a message to the entire women community of India that after she gets married , her body is her husband’s property and her own right , her own agency and her own autonomy over her body ceases to exist .

A woman can file case under other provisions of the Indian Penal Code , such as cruelty , and could also file for a divorce but cannot file case against marital rape ! Shame ! 

Husband's should understand this - A no means no ! Marriage does not mean that the woman is all time ready , willing and consenting [for sex] . 

Marital Rape is not acceptable and Should be considered as crime ! ❌
