this series has been a roller coaster. the first book was amazing, a real high point, followed by a somewhat surprising (disappointing for many readers) filler of a sequel. but i was optimistic that this conclusion would pull the story back together again.

i cant technically say this is also a filler because its the last book, but it definitely has that feel for the bulk of it. i honestly dont know why this series wasnt kept as a duology. adding another book made the last two feel stretched out too thin and suffer content-wise. how it should have been: the last 1/3 of ‘blood & honey’ plus the first 1/3 and last 1/3 of ‘gods & monsters.’ it would have been a great conclusion like that!

i think readers who are fan of the story just for the story/world/characters sake wont mind another journey book though. i also think readers who were upset with how things were left at the end of the previous book will find some closure and relief - i know i did! i think thats why im not rating this a lot lower, because i was quite satisfied with how the story does resolve.

overall, this isnt a bad book. i just feel the story unfortunately suffered in general for being drawn out too long.
