Short-term fixes for sleepiness can cut down on microsleep. Try these tips when you feel drowsy:
👉Stop continuing the work you are doing.
It only takes about half an hour for monotony to affect your alertness. A break to get up and move around is especially helpful.
👉Power nap can be the best solution for this.
 Sometimes you can't work your way through your sleepiness. Sleeping for 20 minutes or so can help. Set an alarm if you have trouble waking up.
👉Start Talking to someone.
 Conversation wakes up the brain cells. Also, talking speeds up breathing and pumps extra oxygen into the bloodstream.
👉Have some caffeine.
 Allow about 30 minutes for it to kick in. And try not to consume it too close to bedtime.
