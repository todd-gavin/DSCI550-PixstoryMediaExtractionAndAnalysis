How far President Vladimir Putin will push ahead with the war campaign? 
His demands are there for everyone to see.  But there is no immediate threat to Russia's Baltic neighbours, but Nato has bolstered their defences just in case.

One clue to his war aims came in an editorial published on 26 February then deleted by state news agency Ria-Novosti in which the writer praised a new world order where Russia was restoring its pre-1991 Soviet unity, gathering the so-called Russian world of Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians (Ukrainians).

Last year, President Putin wrote a long piece describing Russians and Ukrainians as "one nation", and he has described the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991 as the "disintegration of historical Russia".

A puppet has worked out in Belarus, through long-time authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko, but in Ukraine that is quite another matter.
