Good news at Juventus because after learning of Locatelli&#39;s recovery, ready to take the field for the Italian Cup final against Inter, there is good news also regarding Luca Pellegrini&#39;s condition. The Juventus full-back has fully recovered from his injury and will therefore be regularly available to Massimiliano Allegri in view of the match against Pellegrini on Wednesday evening due to a blow to the ankle sustained in training in a clash with Alvaro Morata and is therefore back available for the left lane
