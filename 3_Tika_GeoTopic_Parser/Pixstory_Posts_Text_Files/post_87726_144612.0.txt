A day in my life is fully packed with training for my performance. It starts at 9, when I leave for practice. I train for nearly five to six hours in the range. Following this, I break for lunch and continue with physical training and hit the gym. By the time I am back home, it’s 8:30 at night. It is this kind of relentless practice that got me my first national game at 13. It was the same practice that got me into the Assam team and almost immediately into the Indian team. But to say that it doesn’t have its downside, would be a lie. This hectic schedule doesn’t give me much space for myself. Sometimes this is very isolating. I don’t have time for family and friends, but this feeling is always fleeting. Because at the end of the day, what I’ve gained is insurmountable when compared to the sacrifices I’ve had to make.After a decade in this industry, I can say with conviction that it is not just training but also the valuable lessons I’ve learned from these experiences that have helped me sustain in this field. To begin with, I’ve learned that the kind of practice that you do matters the most. They say that practice makes perfect, but I believe that the nature of your practice is the deciding factor. Doing half an hour of the right kind of training trumps six hours of doing bad quality training. I’ve also learned that how you perceive yourself is an important factor in your performance. This is something I’ve learned from the football phenomenon and my idol Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo, despite not performing well in the beginning, persisted and believed that he was one of the best players ever. And it was that belief that shaped him into one of the best players ever. If you consider yourself the best, then you can work like the best. At the end of the day, to sustain in this field, all you need is passion, persistence, and hard work.
