The colder months might be light on for sunshine but they can be a heady time for botanical fragrance We look at some of the scented plants that will warm the spirits through winter Daphne Where else to start but with Daphne odora which sports one of the strongest smelling flowers of all Spicy a bit clove like and maybe a little smoky too the flowers fragrance will not be contained Plant the evergreen shrub near a window and let the perfume waft inside The only potential downside will be the daphne s finicky ways Maximise your chances of success by choosing a shady spot with fertile well draining soil Luculia Chances are that you smell Luculia gratissima before you see it which is saying something because the flowers of this large shrub are not exactly diminutive They are big and pink and abundant And they are already in full winter swing in central Melbourne But you re unlikely to experience these intensely fragrant blooms in cooler locales because hailing from subtropical forests in the Himalayas the plant can t handle frost Boronia The most bothersome things about boronias is how very fussy they are but treat this Western Australian showstopper right and you will be rewarded with its reviving citrusy scent just when you need it most Both the brown boronia Boronia megastigma and the more delicately scented red one Boronia heterophylla start blooming in mid to late winter Like most WA plants these shrubs won t put up with anything less than perfect drainage and they also like protection from wind and hot afternoon sun slightly acidic soil and a cool root run Grow it in a pot and you can ensure all its needs are met and better still move it around so that the perfume is just where you want it Winter honeysuckle The white winter blooms of Lonicera fragrantissima might only be small but they have a knock out fragrance They look best when they appear on bare stems something that is not always possible in Victoria because this shrub only loses all its leaves in a harsh winter
