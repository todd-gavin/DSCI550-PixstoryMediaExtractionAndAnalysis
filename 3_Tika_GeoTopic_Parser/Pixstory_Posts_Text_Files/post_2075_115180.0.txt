Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was tragically assasinated at a campaign rally by an assailant armed with a handmade firearm. With a population of 126,000,000 and an estimated 377,000 firearms – or 0.3 firearms per 100 people – Japan ranks 219 out of 230 nations in terms of firearms per 100 people. In contrast, the United States has an estimated 393,000,000 guns, or 120.50 firearms per 100 persons, with a population of around 326,000,000.

Due to these stringent gun prohibitions, there are less than ten gun fatalities each year in Japan. In fact, each year there are so few murders (about 0.3 per 100,000 people) that anybody can approach the prime minister and other high-ranking officials without being searched for weapons.

In the aftermath of this tragedy, much has been said about Japan's tight gun restrictions, although this is essentially immaterial, since these rules would not have stopped this murder. The gun was said to have been homemade and constructed from metal and wood, both of which could be purchased at a shop.

As a pretext for the assassination, the gunman made outlandish assertions about Shinzo Abe's ties to various groups. This was a horrific tragedy that should never have occurred, and it was caused by a mentally ill man who felt justified in taking the life of another person.
