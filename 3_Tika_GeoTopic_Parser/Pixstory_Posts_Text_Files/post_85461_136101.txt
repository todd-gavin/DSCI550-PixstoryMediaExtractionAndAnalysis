My Arsenal transfer thoughts Date back to the end of last season it was obvious we needed a new striker midfielder and full back cover Those areas cost us dearly in our fight for top and although we don t have a crystal ball you d have thought with cover we would have got Top So going into the window for me they were the most obvious areas to address however out of the blue we sign Mr Fabio Vieira the young Porto forward came in with help from super agent Jorge Mendes m and looks a coup from Edu Then the widely reported Gabriel Jesus joined from title rivals City No but joking aside he looks to really have elevated us a level already and the m looks a bargain with every game week passing Long time target Lisandro Martinez joined Manchester United after United decided to pay double arsenals last bid of m Que the banter from United fans about him joining them over us however as quick as that banter flew in Arsenal were even quicker in bringing in Olexsander Zinchenko my signing of the summer The versatile Ukrainian fits perfectly in Mikels side and he s ability on the ball has been a joy to watch We then concentrated on outgoings the biggest being record m Nicolas Pepe leaving on loan somewhat of a dull end to a career that started with so much promise at arsenal I reported earlier in the window that Arsenal had enquired about Pedro Neto however the deal was too difficult to do late in the window We worked on Tielemans all summer and the previous winter in fact however we wouldn t pay the m that Leicester wanted Injuries to Partey and Elneny forced arsenal into finding cover for that position and turned to long time target Danilo from Brazil SHOCK however with such little time the deal was going to cost too much I reported we also had interest in Douglas Luiz we made bids on deadline day to no avail villa dug there heels in for a player looking to leave What s your thoughts
