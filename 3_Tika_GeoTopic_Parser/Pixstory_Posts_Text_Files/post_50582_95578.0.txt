I remember it was my 14th Birthday .. when I had eaten the Sizzling Brownie first time ever. It was an indeed phenomenal taste, something that I can't forget till now. I mean super soft brownie with super cool ice cream and even super awesome goodness of chocolate sauce, served hot on a sizzler plate... what more you can ask for. 
Hot sizzling brownie with super chill icecream ,one of the best combination I ever had taste.
