The body positivity movement proliferated through social media, and even now, it is apparent where people post their photos with tags, " love your body or skin", and 'every body is beautiful". 
It was not confined to social media; instead, brands and other platforms made a point to use excellent marketing strategies that can promote body positivity and bring them many customers.

In 2004, Dove, an American personal care brand, launched their " Real Beauty" campaign. Its advertisements "depicted women of varying body types and skin tones that portrayed acceptance and positivity towards their bodies. On their website, Dove presents its Dove Self-Esteem Project as a mission for "helping young people reach their full potential by delivering quality body confidence and self-esteem education". The company also partners with and raises money for eating disorder organizations."

Many other big brands supported this alternative and the idea of a positive body image.
The American women's underclothing company Aerie launched a campaign called "AerieReal", in which the company promised not to retouch or edit their models, encouraging body positivity and body acceptance despite features such as cellulite, and stretch marks, or fat rolls. 
It was all part of the movement.
