Sometime back Praful Patel the all powerful president of the All India Football Federation said he was hopeful that India could qualify for the World Cup It was a downright unwise statement and his uttering became a subject of ridicule in the social media for right reasons For a nation which rarely finish below hundred in FIFA rankings and mostly struggle to qualify for the Asian Cup it is absolutely absurd to talk about qualifying for the World Cup But understanding football had never been Patel s strong point so it wasn t surprising to find him talking such nonsense with a straight face But now the Asian Cup draw has been finalised there is every reason to hope that India would play the continental meet in China next year Given the teams India have drawn in their group they have a bright chance to make the final rounds for the second time straight having qualified before in and India would be the hosts of the group D in Kolkata in June Cambodia Afghanistan and Hong Kong are the other three teams in the group While winners of all six groups will qualify automatically the best five runners up teams will also earn their rights to travel to China Given the current FIFA rankings of the teams India are clearly the superior side Compared to India s ranking of Hong Kong Afghanistan and Cambodia are ranked below and not expected to beat the hosts at least on paper But the problem is India not always justify their ranking in international matches and secondly the lower ranked teams are not necessarily inferior sides Even India s chief coach Igor Stimac sounded cautious He reminded the fans that Afghanistan are a difficult side something India experienced during World Cup qualifiers Hong Kong have recruited lots of outstation footballers by offering them citizenship They are mostly from Brazil and could pose enough problem for India But all said and done this is perhaps the best draw from India s point of view It would be a shame on India s part to let go this opportunity
