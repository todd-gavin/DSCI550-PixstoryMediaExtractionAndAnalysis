According to a senior State Department source, the US-Australia Alliance is essential in thwarting China's growing efforts to exert influence in the Indo-Pacific. 

"Whether it's through AUKUS, the Quad, or NATO, our bilateral connections, the US-Australian relationship is going to be absolutely vital as we're confronting the multifaceted problems with China," US Department of State Counselor Derek Chollet told Sky News. 

Australia continues to be a crucial ally in containing Chinese aggressiveness in the region, according to the Biden Administration, as the new Albanese government works to repair diplomatic ties with China.

Counselor Chollet told Sky News, “We're not asking nations around the world to make a choice, we're trying to give them a choice between engaging with the PRC (People's Republic of China) and deepening their engagement with us.

"We the United States have engagement with the PRC on a range of issues. There are elements that are conflictual and there are elements on which we fundamentally disagree and there are going to be elements of the relationship where it's competitive and we welcome that competition as long as we play by the same set of rules.

"And there are elements of the relationship with the PRC that are cooperative but unfortunately that's a narrowing band of issues where we can cooperate.”
