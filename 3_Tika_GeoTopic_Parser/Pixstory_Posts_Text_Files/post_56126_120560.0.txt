What should be the age of children going to kindergarten? This is a topic for debate in Scotland! The proposal would see a kindergarten stage for three to six-year-olds, which would amount to improving early years education by 12 months. This would be followed by 6 years of primary education. 

 Toni Giugliano, the party's policy convenor, said it would have a positive impact on young children. The move would bring Scotland into line with countries such as Finland, where formal education starts at seven.

They want to focus  on the mental health  of children it seems and they are suggesting a shift in the school culture

Mr. Guigliano said it would be "fully funded" and children would not lose a year of schooling. He said: "The question is whether primary one sits with formal education or whether it sits with early years education.
"And if you listen to early years experts, parents, teachers they are very clear that no four or five-year-old should be subjected to the pressures of the formal school system."

Education is an important part for anyone only aspect to remember is that each child is different and their development starts at different ages. The Kindergarten stage should only handle light topics which include speech and physical activities that are beneficial to children. Later the shift can be the primary education and this will ease children with the formal education. Education should be something interesting and not a burden.
