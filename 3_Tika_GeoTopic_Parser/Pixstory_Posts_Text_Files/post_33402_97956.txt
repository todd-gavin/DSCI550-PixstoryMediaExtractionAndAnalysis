Rohtasan or Chaurasan Temple About a mile to the northeast of the Palace are the ruins of two temples One is the Rohtasan a temple of Lord Shiva Iconoclasts probably destroyed the roof and the main mandap which housed the sacred lingam Now only steps are left which lead to the temple believed to be in existence since the times of the Great Puranic King Harishchandra The domes crest the Devi Mandir The idol of the deity was missing from here though the rest of the building is in good condition The Gazetteer of Shahabad mentions that The most picturesquely situated of all these temples is the Rohtasan or the temple of Rohitaswa It stands on the edge of the precipice on a small peak at the north eastern corner of the plateauand is approached by a long flight of eighty four steps little of this temple now remains and the tower and mandapa which once formed part of it have long since disappeared The image of Rohitaswa is said to have been worshipped here until it was destroyed by the iconoclastic zeal of Aurangzib who erected a small brick mosque just behind it the latter was a wretched building which has recently been demolished Close by the temple of Rohitaswa stands the shrine sacred to his father Harish Chandra a graceful building consisting of a small pillared hall covered with five domes the image formerly worshipped here was also removed by Aurangzeb Singh Dwar The Singh Dwar is the main gate of the Fort and is located at a distance of about kms from the Fort Palace This is the only jeepable ascent to the Fort Palace The Ghat is called Kathautea Ghat owing to the peculiar shape which resembles a container The access from this point is very narrow with deep valleys on both sides of the small connecting road It is also very picturesque To be continued
