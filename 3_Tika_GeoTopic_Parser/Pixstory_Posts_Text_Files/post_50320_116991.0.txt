On the 22nd December, I left for Patna where I handed over charge of City SP, Patna to the DSP, Town, on the next day (23rd December). At the time of leaving Patna, I could not even hand over routine charge since I had to compulsorily move totally suddenly in the wee hours of the cold night of the 1st/2nd December as mentioned earlier, and now was the time to get a proper farewell from the place which had served as a home for about a year. 

After having several rounds of formal and informal farewell parties in Patna, finally, on 26th December, I left the Historic City SP Patna Residence, famous for once having been home of Sir Charles D’Oyly, for Muzaffarpur along with my wife who was then in the family way and in the very first month of the trimester, after having breakfast in order to board the Saptakranti Express which started at 12 noon. After a comfortable train journey, we reached Bagaha at about 3.30 p.m, where reaching home after a kilometre’s drive from the Railway Station, I introduced my wife to the new residence and also informed her about the impending visit of the IG and DIG on the next day as they were slated for a visit to the forests of Valmikinagar.
