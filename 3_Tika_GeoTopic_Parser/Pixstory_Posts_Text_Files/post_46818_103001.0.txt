Superior Morality
Logic often supports a needed result, 
in this article you will find how it can also be moraly acceptable.
Those questions will help you acting valuable:
Would the outcome be necessary to me?
	• On choice
	Who could have benefits or would want to manipulate me?
	• On acting
	Am i restricting someone?
Those conclusions are based on the following logical explanation of a philosophic approach.

Objective Moralism
In Philosophy theres the question about why theres no thing such as objective morality as morality has to be subjective by its nature.
The above tips are based on the exceptions i found:
Defination of doing good
	• On choice
	Behavior that would be necessary to survive even when no one manipulates the choice by restricting someone by purpose
	• On acting
	Behavior that would be necessary to fill a need without manipulating others by restricting someone by purpose

Restriction harms ones ability to express himself which leads to moraly biased action.
