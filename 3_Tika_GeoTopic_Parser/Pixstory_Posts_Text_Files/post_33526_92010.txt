In fortifications were still visible both at Naulagarh and Jaimanglagarh Naulagarh seemed to have been a well planned ancient fort the construction of which could be traced back to the Mauryan period The ruined fort as it existed was on the bank of river Bainti and it was said that there was a lake or tank inside the fort area It was surrounded by an artificial canal of water on three sides and the bed of that old moat was still then visible Such construction of forts was described by Kautilya and the same model was true for the fort at Jaimanglagarh as well It was a very well planned fort with a thick rampart within which clay balls are found in abundance It appears that both mud bricks and burnt bricks were used in the construction of the fort which seems to have been in a good condition upto a very late period The explorations convinced the team that the greater part of the rampart had been robbed off and huge pits had been created in those parts Prof Choudhary mentioned that it was very difficult to say how or when exactly the site came to be destroyed due to absence of clear correlative historical references The team opined that a scientific excavation of the site was most necessary and recommended for its declaration as a protected site Proper excavation at all these sites will surely shed more light on the history of this region which looks very promising To be continued
