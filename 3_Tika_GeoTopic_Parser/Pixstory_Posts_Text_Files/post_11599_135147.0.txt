With an already-packed schedule, you might be tempted to not prioritize your health.
Here are some tips to follow during college life
Snack (healthy foods) often
Nutritionists encourage snacking in small portions between meals to manage your appetite. There are several healthy snacks to carry to your college. Try snacking them.
Establish an eating routine.
Try to time your meals for when you are slightly hungry, rather than waiting until you are starving. Becoming too hungry will likely cause you to overeat.
Try having balanced meals.
Be sure to include at least three to four major food groups at each meal. A combination of high-quality carbohydrates, lean protein, and heart-healthy fats is necessary to ensure the optimal functioning of the body and the brain.
Increase whole grains.
Choose more whole-grain foods, whether it be whole-grain bread at the sandwich station or 100% whole-grain cereal in the morning. This is a better option and keeps you full 
Exercise portion control.
Set goals to take smaller portions and use a smaller plate. You can always go back for additional food if you are still hungry.So stay wise with these.
Re-think what you drink.
Avoid drinking extra calories in regular soda, fruit juices, high-fat or flavored milk varieties, fruit punch, lemonade, milkshakes, sweetened tea, or specialty coffee beverages.Â  It may be tempting but this is what keeps you away from being healthy.
