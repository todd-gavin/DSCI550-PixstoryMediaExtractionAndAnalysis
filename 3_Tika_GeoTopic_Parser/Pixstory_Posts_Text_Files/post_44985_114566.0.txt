Brentford FC have completed the signing of Scottish left-back Aaron Hickey from Serie A side
Bologna and it will be made official soon. The 20-year-old has already completed his Medical
tests and Fabrizio Romano has confirmed the transfer.

According to reports, Bologna will receive €22 Million (including add-ons) for Aaron Hickey and
the 5 years contract will keep him at Brentford until 2027.

Aaron Hickey is a product of Heart of Midlothian FC Youth academy. He has also played for Celtic’s U17 team but it was only in 2020 that he made his big breakthrough move to Bologna.

Hickey has played a total of 48 games for Bologna but last season (2021/22) was a significant
step up in his career as he evolved into one of Bologna’s key players. He played 36 matches in
Serie A 2021/22, scored 5 goals and provided 1 assist.

Aaron Hickey’s versatility is one of his key attributes. He is majorly a left-back but he can always
play as a central midfielder or right-back if needed.

Former Hearts Boss Craig Levein, under whom Aaron Hickey has previously played has defined
him by quoting "He's got really good defensive qualities but I don't know if he'll end up being a
full-back, he might end up going back into midfield.”

"He could be a fantastic holding midfielder with his great awareness of danger and his ability to
get out of tight situations with the ball at his feet."

The 20-year-old is considered to be one of the most promising Scottish defenders in recent
times and is highly regarded for his intelligence with the ball and his athleticism. Although it is
questionable whether Brentford manager Thomas Frank would play him regularly right from the
beginning, Aaron Hickey has all the necessary qualities to become a mainstay in the club.
