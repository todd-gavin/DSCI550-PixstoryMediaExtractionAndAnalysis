‌The credit of being the first female aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean solely belongs to Amelia Earhart. Her disappearance during a flight (1937) also caused much speculation. 
‌
‌She was one of the first pilots to support commercial air travel. She was also instrumental in the formation of The Ninety-Nines, an organization for female pilots.
‌
‌She made flying history with the first solo flight from Hawaii to California, a risky route 2,408 miles (3,875 km) long, a longer distance than that from the United States to Europe.
‌
‌She is one of the pioneers in breaking the stereotype of men flying aircraft. She was also a member of the National Woman's Party and one of the early supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment.
‌
‌During her disappearance, America mourned as they lost a feminist icon, yet cause or any traits of her was not found which lead to numerous conspiracies. Yet she leaves behind a legacy of a woman who gave wings to her dreams.
