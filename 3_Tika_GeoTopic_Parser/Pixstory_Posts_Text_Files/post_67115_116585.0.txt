.Let me be,
the shadow that follows you..
Let me accompany you everywhere. 
Let me witness all your smile.
Let me see all your grief.
Let me be,
The air around you.
Let me give you, 
My soul to breathe.
Let me feel all your 
Breathe, sweat and pain.
Let me be the soil under your feet.

Let me always feel your touch.
Let me be your soul.
So that I can always be inside your hear
