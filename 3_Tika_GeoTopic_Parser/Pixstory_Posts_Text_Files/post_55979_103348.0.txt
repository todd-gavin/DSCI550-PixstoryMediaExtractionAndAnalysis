The Cabinet Office has completely rejected the claims that Sue Gray’s Partygate report was meddled with before publication, with details of an alleged party at Boris Johnson’s Downing Street flat supposedly removed from the report. This would have further decreased his confidence in Boris.

According to The Sunday times, Senior members of Mr Johnson’s team are also contended to have put pressure on the civil servant to reduce some details and names from her report into coronavirus rule-breaking. One of the sources according to the Independent said “the entire machine fought her” once she made clear an intent to publish emails and WhatsApp messages.

Cabinet asserted that Ms Gray’s report “was impartially conducted and its contents represent the findings and conclusions of the investigation team alone”.

Earlier, a No 10 source had refuted the allegations, saying: “It is untrue that anyone on the political side saw anything in advance or sought to influence it.”

The claims come as the prime minister drives off increasing pressure to resign over the report, even after 24 of his MPs now publicly calling for his resignation. This could be out of the worry that they might lose seats during the partygate issue. The numbers are increasing day by day but I don’t think Boris Johnson will resign with this kind of support from the cabinet. Not to mention i recent survey, conducted by Opinium found that, although 51 per cent of people now believe Partygate to be a distraction from more important issues – compared to 38 per cent who said otherwise – a majority of voters still think the prime minister should resign. And the same proportion – 56 per cent – believe that Tory MPs should eliminate Mr Johnson from office. However, it is sure that people have lost confidence in Boris Johnson.
