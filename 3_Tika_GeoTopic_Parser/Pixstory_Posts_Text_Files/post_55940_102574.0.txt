‌It's been two years since Minneapolis police handcuffed George Floyd’s hands behind his back, pinned him face down on the street and strangled the life out of him.
‌George Floyd, aged 46, was being arrested on suspicion of attempting to pass a counterfeit bill at a neighbourhood convenience store. On May 25, 2020, a white police officer knelt on his neck for nine and half minutes, cutting off oxygen to his brain as he cried out “I can’t breathe", which was caught on by a bystander sparking worldwide protests by hundreds of thousands of people 
‌
‌Since then BLM occurred as a major movement have been battling for the lives of Black lives. But we all know this racism dates long back. What had happened in these years?
‌
Police reform legislation – titled the “George Floyd Justice in Policing Act” – ratified the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives in March 2021 on a largely party-line vote. The legislation was intended for at rebuilding police and community relations by establishing national operating standards for police departments, mandating data collection on police encounters and reprogramming funds for community programmes.

Black Lives Matter which was founded in 2013 and is now based in Oakland, California, has evolved from a hashtag to a global network that is building a new organisational system for the long haul. The BLM foundation raised $79m in revenue after Floyd’s death in the 12 months from June 2020 to June 2021 and had $42m in assets, according to its IRS Form 990 posted on its website.

The US Department of Justice has also opened a “pattern and practice” investigation into the department.  Yet we hear about similar incidents that question our right to live. Shouldn't we be ashamed of the world we created wherein people have to fight for the basic right to life?
