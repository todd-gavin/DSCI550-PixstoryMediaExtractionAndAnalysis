“Practice makes one perfect.” Toiling under this belief makes the process of learning so tiring. You are continuously bashing yourself, trying to reach those high standards and expectations. Or sometimes it may even make you give up. 
But if you work under the belief that practice makes improvement, it makes learning fun and imformative. This makes you focus solely on learning and you are satisfied and always ready to learn 
more. 
Keeping this in mind, I practiced my water colour. I’m nowhere near perfection, but I’m improving and that’s all that matters. This is my latest piece.
