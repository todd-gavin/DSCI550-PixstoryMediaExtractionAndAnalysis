Antony Vaccarello creative director of the French brand amazed everyone with a different collection from the aesthetics to which he had accustomed us From crotchless miniskirts to low-cut tops and maitresse chic latex trousers we suddenly moved on to a story made of structured maxi coats long and sober tailored dresses and petticoats and huge furs Looking at the photos of the collection it seems like attending a Gucci show from the early 2000s when Tom Ford changed the rules of the game and brought excitement to fashion But twenty years later these codes no longer work as much as they did then because the times women and the way of perceiving bodies thanks to changed God A beautiful collection inspired somehow by the anarchist poet Nancy Cunard who, however, seems to have come out of the brand&#39;s archives Very YSL but very little contemporary
