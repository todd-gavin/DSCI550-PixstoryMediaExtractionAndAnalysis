What's the test for PCOS ?💉💊🌡️
How do you find our if you are PCOS/PCOD positive? 
Well, it's a three step test:
1. Analysing your hormones (through blood test)
2. Doing an ultrasound to look at your ovaries (not done for younger people, as your ovaries may normally look more cystic when you are younger)
3. Analysing physical features(excessive acne, hairloss,bodyhair etc.) that might indicate PCOS
You need to have at least two of these features present to be tested positive for PCOS. An ultrasound by itself without any physical examination cannot diagnose you as PCOS positive 💁‍♀️
Either way, it's nothing to be scared or worried about. PCOS is a manageable condition that involves lifestyle changes.🏃‍♀️🥗🤸‍♀️
