Short answer:NO❌❌



Long Answer: First Avatar was phenomenal, it may had a weak story and boring characters but it had the best 3D technology in that period, so people were automatically hyped to experience it. Now, people can just watch movies through Netflix or even for free online, because back then, internet wasn't accessible to certain countries, but now, it's more accessible than ever. What I mean by that is the box office profits will go down, not a lot but enough to lose a couple of millions so the sequel will not gross as much as the first one. Secondly, the first Avatar was just okay and didn't leave an impact on our culture like titanic did in order to hype the community for the sequel and people won't care about the 3D thing like they did.
