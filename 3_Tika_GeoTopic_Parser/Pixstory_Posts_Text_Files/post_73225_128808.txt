Sometimes all we need is to be heard by someone My mid day motivation will be a little bit of self care and self attention that is talking to myself taking care of myself and doing my hobbies like singing helps a lot This is because most of the times the reason we get demotivated is because we lose hope on us Self attention helps a lot to look into oneself to keep up with the energy all along Happy Motivating
