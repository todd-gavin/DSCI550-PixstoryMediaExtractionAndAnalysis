Good first for Atalanta in this Serie A At least from the point of view of the result because the performance did not fully convince It was good to have kept the advantage and to have closed the discussion in the final but above all in the second half the Nerazzurri conceded the game of the hosts Let&#39;s see what the match data tells us Sampdoria Ball possession Shots on target Shots blocked Offside Corner Cross Dribbling Fouls drawn Yellow cards Atalanta Ball possession Shots on goal Shots blocked Offside Corner Cross Dribbling Fouls drawn Yellow cards Sampdoria wins the data on the total ball possession Gasperini&#39;s men were unable to keep up with the pace of the clubs in the second half of the match and gave up a few too many positions only to close in the final with the debut goal from newcomer Lookman The Nerazzurri were incisive in the first half by scoring shots on goal and others rejected the final figure will be further improved by the goal of La Sampdoria instead manages to go shooting only once with well-rejected conclusions La Dea is unable to push enough on the flanks and therefore the corners in the triple whistle will only be the opposite of Giampaolo&#39;s men who threw themselves into the boarding even if to no avail with crosses Little show on one side and on the other thanks to the efforts of the summer preparation still to be disposed of and the Marassi field in very bad condition Game therefore very fragmented also due to the fouls that both teams committed from the first minutes of the game The referee Dionisi sanctioned the beauty of incorrect interventions and even got yellow cards Atalanta who starts off on the right foot even if Gasperini still has a lot to ask for in these transfer market days
