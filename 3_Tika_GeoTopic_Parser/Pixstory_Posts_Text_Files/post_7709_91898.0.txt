Oscar Isaac reveals what RDJ told him when he joined Marvel. Isaac said,
"He really said that Kevin Feige is a genius and he’s a collaborator ... don’t be afraid to come in and give your ideas and give your thoughts and to be bold with your choices...I talked to him a lot ... he’s a friend already ... and also for me, the biggest inspiration, because to this day, still, that first Iron Man movie is just so good"
Another thing that Isaac spoke about how he doesn't have any contractual obligations to appear in future Marvel Projects. The actor said,
“I had heard of the golden handcuffs. That was something that I was reticent about ... We all agreed that this show is what we’re going to focus on.. If there’s any kind of future, I think it just depends on if people like it ... and if we find a story that’s worth telling”
