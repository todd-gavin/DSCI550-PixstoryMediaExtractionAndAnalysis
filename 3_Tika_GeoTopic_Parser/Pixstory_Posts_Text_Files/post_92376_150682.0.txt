Kylie’s barely-there dress is just the latest of the show-stopping looks she has brought to Paris Fashion Week.💃🏻✨️
Another night, another sexy outfit for Kylie Jenner!🍷💅🏻 The 25-year-old reality star looked every bit of glamorous as she stepped out of her Paris hotel on Sept. 29 to celebrate Paris Fashion Week.🥵🤌🏻 She donned a skin-tight, floor-length gown composed of a nude mesh shell with patches of red silk material underneath that partially covered her cleavage and below her toned tummy. 🌊💃🏻The dress featured a high neck with a drastic keyhole opening at the center of her chest that came back together with tiny clasps below and a high slit on her left leg.🤩
Kylie paired the curve-hugging gown with a red handbag 👜and nude heels👠 that nearly blended in with her manicured feet. 👣She wore a long, black wig with sweeping sidebangs and played up the drama with deep beige makeup on her eyelids and lips,👁👄👁 giving her ensemble a moody look🤌🏻😌. Kylie also gave a glimpse of the back of the barely-there dress, which showed off her voluptuous curves even more.🥰✨️
