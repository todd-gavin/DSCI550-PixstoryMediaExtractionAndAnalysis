Dutch midfielder Jackie Groenen has renewed her contract at Manchester United till 2024. 

Jackie Groenen joined Manchester United in May 2019 and became the club’s first non-British women’s player. She has been an integral part of the United side that has finished fourth in the WSL for three consecutive seasons. 

Jackie’s contract is set to expire on June 30, 2022 but the club have an option of a one-year extension which has since been exercised according to various reports. Last week, L Football Magazine reported that Juventus Women were the front runners to sign Jackie as the Oranje international reportedly wants a new experience in a different league. Back in 2018, Juventus had approached Jackie for her signature but she rejected the offer and after a year joined Casey Stoney's Red Devils after their promotion to the WSL.

In their exclusive, L Football Magazine also mentioned that Bianconeri and Jackie’s camp were close to the agreement. 

Since then, various Italian media outlets have dismissed this news. Juventus’ Head of Women’s Football - Stefano Braghin, in his interview with Tuttosport said that Juventus are pursuing a midfielder and a forward in this window. Yesterday, Juventus announced the signing of Jackies’s international teammate Lineth Beerensteyn from Bayern Munich. 

A few hours ago, Tutto Mercato journalist Mirko Di Natale reported that Juventus are set to sign another midfielder for their women’s team, which will not be Jackie Groenen as she has renewed her contract till 2024. He also said that Manchester United have already activated the extension clause in Jackie’s contract. 

Jackie is currently with the Netherlands National Team as the Oranje aim to defend their title at the UEFA Women’s Euro 2022, which kicks off in two weeks.
