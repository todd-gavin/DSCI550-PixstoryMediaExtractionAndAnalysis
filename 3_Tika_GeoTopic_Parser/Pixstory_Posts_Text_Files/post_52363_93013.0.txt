Ash Barty, an Australian tennis superstar, has revealed a surprising career change just weeks after her retirement stunned the tennis world.

She has also been linked to a return to professional sport, possibly in golf, cricket, or even the AFLW.

Last week, the 25-year-old won her first title since retiring from tennis in a local golf tournament in Brisbane.

It's why, despite previously expressing interest in a book series project, Barty's new career as an author has surprised some.
The Courier-Mail first reported that Barty's series, titled 'Little Ash,' will be based on the three-time grand slam champion's real-life experiences on and off the tennis court.

The six-book Little Ash series, written and illustrated with First Nations artists Jasmin McGaughey and Jade Goodwin, will be available for purchase in July.

HarperCollins is already promoting the book.
