What are your  healthy on the go options ?

Answer
Always fruits and nuts/seeds . 
You can also have commercially prepared things like daal chawal, South India food or a dhokla. 
I don’t recommend salad unless it’s a branded one as cleaning veggies is a problem. 
You can also get your “happy food” and balance it later unless you are not cheating on your food sensitivities. 
Otherwise carry your own food
