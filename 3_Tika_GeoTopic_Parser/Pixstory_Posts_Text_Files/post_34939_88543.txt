Incredible one-two for Ferrari in the first grand prix of the year in Bahrain Leclerc first and Sainz second gave immense joy to the fans of the Reds which hadn&#39;t happened for days and grands prix it had been a long time in fact that Ferrari hadn&#39;t had successes On the other hand the day was was open with the first two red rows with a Verstappen annoying until a few laps from the end of the race when he was forced to retire on a par with his teammate Perez out on the last lap. Green light then for the two Ferraris solo towards the finish line after a hard fought day with Red Bull I am disappointed worst case scenario we would have finished second Losing so many points painful Verstappen said at the end Grand prix winner Leclerc is in a different spirit Pole position fastest lap victory dream start and I am truly happy he declared to the Sky microphones in these terribly difficult years we thought it would be the time for redemption and it has arrived The boys did an incredible job giving us a fantastic car and everything went well even with Carlos&#39; one-two we could not have done better Alle behind the Ferraris was positioned Hamilton who exploited the failures of Red Bull otherwise he would have finished in fifth position Order of arrival Charles Leclerc Ferrari Carlos Sainz Ferrari Lewis Hamilton Mercedes George Russell Mercedes Kevin Magnussen Haas Valtteri Bottas Alfa Romeo Esteban Ocon Alpine Yuki Tsunoda Alpha Tauri Fernando Alonso Alpine Guanyu Zhou Alfa Romeo
