It is so abhorrently cruel Animals in factory farming are treated as commodities and objects to be abused Animals are capable of experiencing the same emotions as people proven by science They are capable of experiencing love and empathy In that they wish to live a happy life among their own they share the same needs as humans In their cramped quarters pigs are unable to even turn around Never will they stroll on grass or see the sun Calves are beaten to death taken away from their mothers days after they re born while their mother cries in agony and separation for weeks and months Baby chicks are ground up alive Sheep are submerged and soaked in chemicals Would you want to live your life in this manner What makes this treatment of another sentient being acceptable
