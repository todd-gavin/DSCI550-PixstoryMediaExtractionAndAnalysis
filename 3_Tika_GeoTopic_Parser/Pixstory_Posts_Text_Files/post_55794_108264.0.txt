The best candy in Australia is Freddo Frogs and Caramello Koalas!

These little chocolate frogs and koalas are made from the best of the best, Cadbury’s Milk Chocolate. They come in a range of delish flavours like strawberry, peppermint, pineapple and popping candy, too, though the plain Freddo Frog and gooey caramel Caramello Koalas are the most iconic.

Also, caramel slice ain’t too bad. 

This treat has a simple biscuit base with soft caramel filling and a thick dark chocolate top – all the ingredients for a recipe of success. It would be un-Australian for you to not indulge in one while you’re here! They’re easy to find to, with most Hot Bread shops and cheap bakeries selling them for just a couple of bucks.
