 Set the bird s wings with gold and it will never again soar in the sky Rabindranath Tagore From the ground we can see the space and infinite distance and we call that the sky We can see thousands of stars and some planets too which certainly makes it more beautiful It looks blue from the ground However this changes with sunrise and sunsets when the sky is colored in shades of red orange purple Sometimes it appears in color grey too due to nimbus clouds In reality the color of the sky is actually bluish violet which is the reflection of the huge water bodies on earth The sky is the limit when you re dreaming about something and if you have it in you then sometimes it can even be higher than the sky The blue sky holds the power to make one happy instantly Night sky is a real source of beauty The sky inspires us in many ways Besides holding ground for the heavens the sky suggests optimism dreaming peace strength and a connection with the atmosphere and the universe at large
