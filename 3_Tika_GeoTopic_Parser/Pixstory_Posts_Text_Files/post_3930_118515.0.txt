My next comfort food during the monsoons is this pasta. The sauce is the game changer, taking the pasta to a whole new level. 

I would like to call it as the gift from the pasta fairy who took me to this recipe that I came across in YouTube. 

Ever since that day I haven't tried my pasta in any other way. 

The preparation hardly takes half an hour and I really enjoy the process of making this soulful meal ❤️😋
