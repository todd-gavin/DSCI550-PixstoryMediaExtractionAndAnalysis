Back in February at the NBA trade deadline the Pelicans and the Kings were out of the playoff picture but made big moves hoping to make the NBA play-in tournament. The young Pelicans traded for 30 year old CJ McCollum and the young Kings signed 25 year old Domantas Sabonis. The moves were heavily criticized since the historical/traditional thinking says that teams who are out of the playoff picture at the deadline would be wiser to not try to win more games but should instead focus on playing young talent and simultaneously lose more games for better draft position. Teams giving up like this was uninspiring and annoyingly strategic. 

To counter this trend the NBA did two things. 1. It evened out the odds for non-playoff teams to win the top picks in the NBA draft which means teams are much less likely to have a top pick which directly correlates to their bad record. 2. The NBA created the play-in tournament which allows the 9th and 10th seeds to play against the 7th and 8th seeds in a battle for the 7th and 8th seeds in the playoffs. 

In February the Pelicans and the Kings were in a race for 9th and 10th seeds. The Kings’ moves didn’t translate into a play-in tournament showing but the Pelicans passed the Lakers and Spurs to win the 9 seed and then went on to beat the Spurs and the Clippers to sneak into the playoffs. Now the Pelicans are tied 2-2 against the #1 seeded Phoenix Suns and seem to be matching them blow for blow. 

I am sure I am not in the minority rooting for the Pelicans to upset the Suns. Everyone loves to see a Cinderella story and most of us take joy in rooting for the underdog. No one likes to see  their role models give up and especially when they are the most trained athletes in the world and have worked so hard to get to where they are. 

Hope is a good thing. It may be the greatest of all things. 

Kudos NBA.
