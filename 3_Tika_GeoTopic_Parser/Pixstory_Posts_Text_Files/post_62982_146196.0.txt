I completely support trans rights, and am an advocate of equal rights. But it also hold the truth that parents should have access to their underaged child's life. For once, to protect them and ensure they're not landing themselves in trouble.
There are a lot of times teachers inform parents about their kid's behavior, actions and issues. Then why can't the same happen now? Wouldn't it be easier for the child if they don't have to confront their parents one-on-one about it?
