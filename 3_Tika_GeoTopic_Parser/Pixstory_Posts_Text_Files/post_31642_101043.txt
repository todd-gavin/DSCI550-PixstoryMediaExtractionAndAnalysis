Jake is years old and the only openly active gay gamer in the UK He chose to come out on the eve of the day against homotransbiphobia March in memory of March the day the WHO cleared homosexuality from mental illness The boy claims he wants to finally be himself after hiding the truth for a long time to get among the professionals Now he doesn&#39;t want to go on like this anymore It makes you think that such a young boy had to hide an aspect of his person to make his way in a sporting environment since sport should be a great moment of togetherness especially in football clubs I&#39;ve thought about it for a long time and I think now is the right time I feel ready to tell my story Cos the year-old Blackpool striker decided to come out during a TV interview I want letting people know who i really am lying all this time not something i wanted to do was difficult but now i have faith in myself His gay declaration comes a week after making his first-team debut in the pros of the second division Championship English Daniels is the first professional footballer to come out as gay since Justin Fashanu&#39;s coming out over the years One wonders if coming out in is still necessary if someone still cares about a footballer&#39;s sexual orientation The truth is that Daniels&#39; gesture is important in a sexist and toxic environment like that of football and could help many kids, especially the younger ones, to feel represented in their favorite sport
