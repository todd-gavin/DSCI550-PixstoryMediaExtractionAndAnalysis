We all love momos, but did you know that they are harmful for our health? These round soft dough balls are filled with juicy veg or non-veg stuffings and are served with a spicy dip. They are the delight of all street food lovers. But momos are dangerous for health and can cause long-term damages to the body.

1. Momos are made with refined flour, treated with chemicals like Azodicarbonamide, Chlorinegas, Benzoyl Peroxide, and other bleaches. These chemicals can damage the pancreas and cause diabetes.

2. For the most part, red chillis are good for your health, that is, if they are not processed chilli powders. However, one cannot be sure about the quality used by local momo-vendors. Also, an over-consumption of spicy foods is suspected to cause bleeding hemorrhoids or piles.

3. Momos are most likely to contain mono-sodium glutamate (MSG) which not only leads to obesity but also causes a string of other health issues like nervous disorder, sweating, chest pain nausea and palpitations.

So think twice before having another plate of your favorite street food delicacy, but all in all if itâ€™s under the right balance and hygienic, you can be good to go.
