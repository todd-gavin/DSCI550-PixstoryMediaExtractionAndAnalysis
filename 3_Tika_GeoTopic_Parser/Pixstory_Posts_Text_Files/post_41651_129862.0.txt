The governing body, Cricket Australia, has established a cooperation with the government to support the growth of the sport in the neighbouring Pacific countries of Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu. 

IR reported that with this declaration, cricket joins the PacificAus Sports programme, an Australian government endeavour for sports diplomacy in the area that also includes football, netball, rugby league, and the Olympic movement. 

The "Australia-Pacific Cricket Linkages" project will permit the men's and women's teams from Papua New Guinea to compete in matches in Australia and provide coaching and training assistance. 
Indigenous Australian teams will visit Vanuatu and interact with the locals in an effort to encourage more ladies to play cricket.

I am looking forward to see how this pans out!
