The American Vogue Instagram page reported that world-renowned supermodel Gigi Hadid would donate her fashion month earnings to help civilian victims of the Russian attack in Ukraine and Palestinian victims. At first glance it would appear that Vogue copied the caption of the model without changing it but looking carefully you can see that the word Palestine has completely disappeared Gigi as well as her sister and colleague Bella have Palestinian origins from their father and have always been actively engaged in supporting the victims of the sad and shocking war with Israel to think that a magazine should also censor an act of charity in order not to offend a political portion of its readers
