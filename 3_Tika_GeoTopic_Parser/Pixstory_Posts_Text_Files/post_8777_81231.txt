Pak invasion of Kashmir The Maharaja was of the opinion that the Darbar should not be held as enough State forces for the ceremonial parade were not available All that had been left of the army in Srinagar was about four companies of the cavalry I advised otherwise being of the opinion that cancellation of the Darbar would unnecessarily create panic in the town The Darbar if held might put some heart into the local population and give them the feeling that we had sufficient strength to meet the raiders and save the city of Srinagar Eventually my advice prevailed The Maharaja took the salute in the traditional manner before a large assembly of officials non officials and leading public men on the big parade ground outside the town on Baramula Road There was not much panic in the city that day In the evening the Darbar was held in the old palace situated on the banks of the Jhelum with the usual pomp and show As usual Nazars were offered to the Maharaja Every item was gone through according to schedule without any agitation in the minds of the people attending the Darbar In my own mind I had not the least fear of the raiders making any headway as I was confident of the strength of the Dogra forces No sooner had we left the Darbar Hall and reached the Mirakadal Bridge electricity failed The city was plunged into darkness Fortunately as the palace had its own arrangement for electricity the Dussehra dinner could be continued When the guests were seated in the drawing room and were about to go to dinner I rang up the electrical engineer to find out what had happened I also rang up the power house at Mahoora where a chowkidar came on the line and told me that a wounded captain of the army had come on horseback saying The raiders have come Run away To be continued
