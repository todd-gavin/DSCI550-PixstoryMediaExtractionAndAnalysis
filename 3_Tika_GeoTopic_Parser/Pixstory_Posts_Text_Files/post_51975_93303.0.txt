I just came back home after a long time to spend the weekend with my family. Can't express how much I've been missing everyone and everything, being at home feels like heaven now.
One of the things that I missed the most was the sandwiches that my mother makes ( ABSOLUTELY THE BEST)ðŸ¥ª
She made one for me today. Let me tell you, it tasted like HEAVEN.
Don't worry as I'll be sharing the recipe with you all. Thank me Later-

1. Chop few pieces of Capsicum, Onion, Babycorn, paneer, Carrot and corn .

2. Make a balanced mix of these spices:- Black pepper, salt, chilly flakes, oregano.

3. Apply A LOT of cheese spread on both the sides of the bread(preferably brown)

4. Spread the spice mix over it.

5. Now put all the veggies deliberately and close the bread slices

6. Grill it till it turns hot and crispy and cut it in whichever form you like.

7. Your amazing sandwich is ready to eat. Make sure you have tomato sauce/ green chutney with itðŸ˜‹

But the fact is that everything turns out amazing when your mother makes it. Nobody would be able to replicate itðŸ’ž

Try this recipe and let me know how your sandwich turned out! Did it give you that homelike feeling?
