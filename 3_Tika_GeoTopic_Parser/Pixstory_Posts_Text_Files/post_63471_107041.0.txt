Nemanja Matic has penned a year deal with Roma following the completion of his free transfer move from Manchester United.

The Serbian international is said to have arrived the Italian capital Rome as he looks to undergo his medical before completing his contract with the last season’s Europa Conference League winners.

The transfer includes an option to extend for another campaign valued at £3million net salary. 

The 33-year-old international is now set to reunite with erstwhile manager Jose Mourinho whom he enjoyed a working spell with in Chelsea as the pair clinched the Premier League and League Cup in 2014/15 season.
