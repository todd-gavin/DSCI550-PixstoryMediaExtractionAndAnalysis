There s a huge gap between the teacher s and parent s relationship Parents need to understand that they can t have unrealistic expectations from their child s tutor It is not someone who will listen to their mean comments or judgements just because they re paying the schools for their child s education There should be an understanding that whatever a teacher would do it would be for the child s interest and that s what teachers care about the most otherwise why would they be teaching Moreover it s not an easy path out there A teacher s life is not confined to educating your kids they have got more to do Their work is as important as that of any other professionals who don t just work hard during their work time but even after it And this really needs to be discussed Saddling the teacher with all your child s responsibilities and then saying mean things to them would not be just disrespecting the pressure they take to teach your child but it is also unacceptable because they don t deserve it Despite the existing policies rhetoric and sentiment teachers are doing their best to provide your kids with a healthy education and environment And the least you can do as a parent is to appreciate it and instead be cooperative and not mess it with inappropriate behaviour
