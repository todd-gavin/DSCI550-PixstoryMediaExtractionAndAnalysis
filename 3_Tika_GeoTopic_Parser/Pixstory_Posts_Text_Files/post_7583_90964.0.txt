Desires that I yearn for,
Will stay with me,
No matter how absurd,
There lay my dreams,
The little wonderland,
Where everything goes merry,
My gloom sits beside me,
Let me enjoy my fallacies for a while. 

I don't remember when I lost her,
To her beliefs,
I wasn't worth her being,
I'm a passing pebble,
Easy to throw into,
The river of solitude,
I make a few leaps,
Until I'm useless and washed away.

I have believed everything,
Hence my hands are empty now,
I placed no bets,
I knew I had no chance with her,
Yet I told her everything,
So early, I was just roaming,
Wandering in someone,
Worth all I've ever been.

Tried to forget it all,
Those days of serenity,
The calm always felt addictive,
Every time so inviting,
In the end it was a trap,
Chaos erupting everywhere,
Not a path to escape from,
The river turned into hell fire real quick.

I've been forgotten before,
By everyone close to me,
For reasons I still can't fathom,
Falling for someone,
Led to this banishment,
This exile is never ending,
As my heart stays with her,
Can I even call it a separation?

She blames me for it,
I have no rights on these feelings,
They're not mine to control,
How do I question my heart
To where it wishes to be?
Always been lonely,
Now as she has sailed past me,
I'm lost in a burning Ocean of obscurity.
