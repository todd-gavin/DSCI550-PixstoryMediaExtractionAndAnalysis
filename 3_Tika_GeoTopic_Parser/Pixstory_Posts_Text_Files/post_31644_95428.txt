From today Wednesday April available on YouTube the video clip of MENTRE SPROFONDI E BRUCI single in collaboration with the Italian rock and roll duo Lovesick Duo extracted from IL SENTIMENTO PREVALENTE the latest recording work of the Bolognese singer-songwriter FRANZ CAMPI Written by Franz Campi and Davide Belviso While you sink and you burn a song wrapped in a country atmosphere inspired by David Foster Wallace&#39;s speech This is the water that David Foster Wallace gave at the Kenyon College graduation Time passes you look in the mirror and wonder Who this imposter who gets in the way And instead it&#39;s you With all the wrinkles and the rest Then maybe it&#39;s time to take stock You are besieged by a thousand urgencies the defeats have accumulated the fears have multiplied the voices of those who would like you to be different and better overlap But it is not enough to understand The most obvious realities, explains Franz, are often also the most difficult to see precisely because we have been immersed since birth like fish in water So I said to myself we need to look inside life Especially at a certain age Train myself to think again and free myself from the conventions of individualism Because there are still so many days capable of reserving splendor
