"When sorrows come, they come not single spies. But in battalions!"
One of my most favorite pieces ever written in literature. The raw truth in it makes it too relatable to all of us to just not be taken by it.
Hamlet.
One of Shakespeare's most well-known and absolutely marvellous plays. Hamlet is one of the most intricate works of literature ever written. It is impossible to fully comprehend or understand it, and thus it has different meanings for different people. In and around the royal palace – at Elsinore, a Danish city, in the late middle ages, the 14th and 15th centuries, or from 1300 to 1499 – is where the story takes place.
It is about a lot of things, but its central theme is how one young man can handle betrayal, uncertainty, bravery in the face of certain death, retaliation, disruption, challenges to faith, the disastrous effects of intrusion from outside our world, friendship, trust, arrogance and a lot more. The fact that Hamlet is largely told from his point of view makes the play extremely intriguing. Hamlet spends a lot of scenes describing the nature of the universe and himself. Nearly all of the play's characters and scenes are seen through his eyes, and even the sections that do not feature him nevertheless rely on what he has already spoken.
