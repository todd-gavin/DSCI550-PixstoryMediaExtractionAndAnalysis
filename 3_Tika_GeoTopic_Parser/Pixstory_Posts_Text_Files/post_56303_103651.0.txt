To be successful in the 2022-23 season, the Los Angeles Lakers must add 3-and-D wings. The 2022 NBA Playoffs have shown how important those types of players are, and even with superstars in LeBron James and Anthony Davis having credible shooters and defenders around them is what can get them back to contending for titles.

The upcoming NBA Draft presents a good opportunity to find players who fit that mold, but it will be a challenge for Los Angeles as they currently do not own a pick.

Regardless, the Lakers have been hosting draft workouts and one prospect who stands out as an ideal fit is Alabama’s Keon Ellis.

Ellis talked about his former Alabama teammate Herb Jones, who just had an outstanding rookie season with the New Orleans Pelicans after being taken in the second round, and believes he can bring the same kinds of things to an NBA team.

“Honestly, a lot of the things like Herb [Jones] did,” Ellis said. “Guarding the top guys and making it tough on them, spacing the floor. I do think I can be a better spaced-creator, if you will. I definitely think, kind of the same role as [Jones] to make it tough on guys, kind of the dirty work, harassing the ball and passing lanes, stuff like that. I think that will be something that I’m good at and can contribute at the next level.”

Ellis has already visited several teams but admitted that working out for the Purple and Gold was a different experience for him.

“Honestly, when I go into a workout even though most of them are pretty similar, you do kind of the same stuff, 1-on-1s, 3-on-3s, kind of against each other with guys that you’ve never played with. So it’s all kind of the same thing, just go in there and be myself and just knowing kind of like you said, the first one you just kind of get it out of the way, the jitters and what not, but after that, it’s nothing different.
