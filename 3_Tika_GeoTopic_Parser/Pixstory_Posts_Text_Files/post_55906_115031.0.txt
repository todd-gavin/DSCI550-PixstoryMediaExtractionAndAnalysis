Trump had tried to contrast his presidency with Biden’s despite being the most trolled PM. Former President Donald Trump claimed that "everybody was happy" during his presidency before the COVID-19 pandemic. Is he forgetting that the supreme court judges appointed by him as the cause of this unhappiness?

Trump, made an unusual call for national unity while stumping for Nevada Republican gubernatorial candidate Joe Lombardo and senate candidate Adam Laxalt in Las Vegas.

Speaking at a panel on crime and safety at the Treasure Island resort, Trump called on his audience "to stop fighting with each other and unify."

He claimed that Americans had been united when living through the "greatest period" in history in "many ways, " referring to his presidency before COVID-19 struck.

"It can happen again," he said. "We were more unified just before that. Everybody was happy."

He claimed that the Biden administration had enabled a "deadly wave of lawlessness... to sweep the land." He continued to criticize the state of crime and safety in the US. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that Trump called the US a "nation in decline" and a "failing nation." He also said that the "streets are filled with the blood of innocent crime victims," per the local media outlet.

Trump hasn’t gone so far as every time but shouldn’t we realize the fact that despite Biden of the democratic party being in power, the actual power exists in the hands of republicans- they are the decision-makers, and should we have to have a Republican president so that we can get our basic rights back? Perks of democracy it seems(irony intended).
