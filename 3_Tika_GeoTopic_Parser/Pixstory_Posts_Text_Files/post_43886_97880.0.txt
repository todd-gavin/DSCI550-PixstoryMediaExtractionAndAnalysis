The Swedish youngster enjoyed a special moment with his Portuguese colleague during a Premier League encounter with Norwich. Anthony Elanga has been explaining how his double “SIUU” with Cristiano Ronaldo came about, with the Manchester United youngster enjoying a “special moment” alongside a Portuguese legend against Norwich. 


The Swedish youngster tweed up a five-time  Ballon d’Or for the first of his three goals against the Canaries at Old Trafford, with an all-time great netting a hattrick in a Premier League fixture that the Red Devils had to win. 

Elanga joined in with an iconic celebration against the Norwich City, with Ronaldo happy to share the limelight as part of the double act rather than have it all by himself. 


How did the Double “SIUU” celebration come in?

Elanga told United’s official website of fluffing his lines somewhat when trying to emulate a talismanic team-mate; That was an exciting time, the double SIUUU!

“I didn’t expect it. He said. “Let’s do it. Fair enough, but if you see in the video, I didn’t really get into the air properly! But I managed to do it and it was a special moment.”


“He is someone I look up to and speak to and ask for advice and stuff. He is a special player to work with.”

The 20-year-old added on earning their trust of Ronaldo after providing him with another assist; “We spoke about it the day before actually. How we were going to work in terms of pressing.” 

“If you get an opportunity to look up if he gets an opportunity to look up for me, as I’ll be in the box or he’ll be in the box.” 

Elanga is enjoying a breakthrough campaign all throughout the season with around 24 appearances. He has recorded three goals, having made his senior mode last season.
