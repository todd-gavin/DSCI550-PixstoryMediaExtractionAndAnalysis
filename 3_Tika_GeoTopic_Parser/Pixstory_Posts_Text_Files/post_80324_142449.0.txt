Emile Smith Rowe - Integral 

At 22 years of age, coming through the academy, Emile Smith Rowe has shown himself as a key player for the Gunners & a breath of fresh air.

Loans:

His talent was never in denial, but his physical development & experience are 2 key cogs for youngsters. Emile started on loan at RB Leipzig, where the Germans tried to buy him despite being mostly injured. A more successful loan spell followed the season after, as the Englishman was a key reason for his new loan club Huddersfield’s survival in the Championship.

Profile:

Emile Smith Rowe is a left interior 8, who’s played as a 10, and as a left winger most notably, but thrives off rotation and freedom, with a very 2 footed & unpredictable nature. Despite being 6’0, Emile glides like a 5’7 player, with his agility, directness, close control in tight spaces, with Carragher saying he’s ‘as good as anyone running with the ball’ (in the league). 

Aside from just on the ball, Smith Rowe has great combination play, and most importantly scans his area always, before receiving the ball. Additionally, the Croydon born man is an incredible ball striker, netting 10 goals from a 5.26 xG last season (xGPhilosophy), with the sustainability not questioned due to his signature low drilled finish, such as vs Chelsea & Watford.

ESR’s Development:

Rewind to December 2020. Arsenal are sitting 15th and are in desperate need of a creator. Who steps up? Emile Smith Rowe.

Thrown in the deep end vs Chelsea, a top creator & making others around him a lot better, with a 57.7% win rate vs 43.8% with him starting (PlanetFootball). 

He voiced he wanted to score more, and did exactly that. Taking a creative burden until Ødegaard’s arrival, turning from a top creator, to a 10 goal a season scorer, with a season hampered by injuries.

A new contract, an England call up & the famous 10 shirt all in a short space of time,  a real ‘star’ who can hopefully conquer his injury issues.
