If you think snakes are not dangerous you haven t heard of the Inland taipan It is also known as the fierce snake or small scaled snake As NatGeo tells us they are found near the borders of Queensland South Australia New South Wales and the Northern Territory intersect amid fissures and crevices in dry rocky plains The inland taipan is solitary and uncommon and it hides away in its secluded rocky habitat It is dangerous because of its very toxic venom which is thought to be the strongest of any land snake in the world and has the capacity to kill an adult human within minutes The inland taipan employs its strong venom which it injects more than times the amount of to kill a g rat to quickly finish off prey when hunting in the cramped environment of the long haired rat s tunnels There is little chance for the prey to defend itself There are very few people all snake handlers who have been bitten by this species Each survived with first aid and hospitalisation Still think snakes are wonderful animals
