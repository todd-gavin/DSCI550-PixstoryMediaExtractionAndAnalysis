Juventus&#39; draw against Sampdoria in Marassi was rather disappointing especially for the Bianconeri&#39;s play The coach Massimiliano Allegri struggling with many injuries tries to see the glass half full Let&#39;s look at the positive things we didn&#39;t concede goals for two games Sampdoria in the first time ran a long way in the second we did good things scored a goal and had two favorable situations In the final we also had an opportunity The big match is on the horizon with Roma still with full points and Allegri underlines how Juve don&#39;t get there at their best We are at a time when Chiesa Pogba important players are out C the introduction of new players C the desire to do something important compared to the others we are behind To recover points we need patience and it must be done one step at a time We are improving in condition and we will get ready on Saturday for the match against Rome
