From making liquid brownies to now making three-layered cakes. Learning how to bake was a trial and error process. My passion for baking started when I was 12 years old, and my first baking experience was quite a mess. The oven was fuming up, and the brownie was more of a liquid state than a solid one. However, my heart set on making treats and goodies for my friends and family. Seeing them happy after eating what I make is one of the best feelings and worth going through hours of mixing, waiting, and baking. Cakes, cookies, brownies, cheesecakes, pies, donuts, and cinnamon rolls are a few goodies I have the expertise and bake. I looked forward to learning more and feeding more.
