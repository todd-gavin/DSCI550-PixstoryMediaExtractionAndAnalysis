Ankita Lokhande and Vicky Jain made their first appearance together for television reality show Smart Jodi recently. The newly married couple not just talked about their love story but also the 'difficult phase' after Sushant Singh Rajput's death.

While they did not take Sushant Singh Rajput's name, Ankita and Vicky both talked about his passing away and how it was a 'tough test' for their relationship.

Ankita praised Vicky for giving her clarity and letting her speak her mind amid several speculations that were going on about her relationship with Sushant Singh Rajput. She said, "The time was such. People had different narratives. I was constantly being questioned. When I wouldnâ€™t answer, they would make an answer of their own because of which Vicky and I faced a lot."
