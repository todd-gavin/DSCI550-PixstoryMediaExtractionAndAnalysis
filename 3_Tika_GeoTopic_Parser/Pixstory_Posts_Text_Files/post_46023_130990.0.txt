Letitia James is our hero! She is doing what countless others failed to do. Protecting Native Americans and their rights! In the wave of unjust decisions of the Supreme Court, she is a one woman army!

She is the attorney general of New York, is defending a 44-year-old federal law that was created to protect indigenous families nationwide but is currently being overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. 

As spectrum local news reported, James  joined a bipartisan coalition of 24 attorneys general from throughout the nation in signing an amicus brief in support of the Indian Child Welfare Act. 

A 1978 statute intended to prevent states and private organisations from starting child-custody cases that split up native children from their parents is at dispute. Children may occasionally be placed in foster and adoptive homes that are not tribal.

“Children are the future. Removing native children from their families and communities denies them the opportunity to be immersed in their heritage and denies these nations an integral part of their future,” James said. 

I sincerely hope she wins this fight!
