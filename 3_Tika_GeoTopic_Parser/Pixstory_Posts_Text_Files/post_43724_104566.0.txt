Belgium and Netherlands will both be looking to make positive starts to their UEFA Nations League campaigns when they lock horns in Brussels on Friday night.In the previous cycle, Belgium advanced to the UEFA Nations League semi-finals before losing to eventual champions France in the final. The Red Devils beat Burkina Faso 3-0 in their previous match and will be looking for a repeat performance this week.

The Netherlands, on the other hand, finished second in their group and missed out on advancing to the knockout stages ahead of Italy. The Oranje drew 1-1 with Germany in their previous match and will need to boost their game in this one.

Belgium vs Netherlands: Probable Playing XI

Belgium : Koen Casteels; Jan Vertonghen, Dedryck Boyata, Toby Alderweireld; Thomas Meunier, Yannick Carrasco, Axel Witsel, Youri Tielemans, Kevin De Bruyne; Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku

Netherlands : Mark Flekken; Virgil van Dijk, Matthijs de Ligt, Nathan Ake; Daley Blind, Denzel Dumfries, Teun Koopmeiners, Frenkie de Jong, Steven Berghuis; Memphis Depay, Wout Weghorst

Belgium vs Netherlands: Prediction

Both managers would likely accept a draw if it was offered ahead of kickoff, and we can see the pair sharing the points on Friday night. Belgium, arguably, have superior talent, especially in the forward areas, but Netherlands will be strong at the back, and we are predicting a stalemate here.

Prediction : Belgium 1-1 Netherlands
