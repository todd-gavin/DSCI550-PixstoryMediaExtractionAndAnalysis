According to me the best form of investment is equity share because it has high liquidity that is it can be converted into cash easily By investing in the equity shares then the return on the shares is much higher than any other form of investment Not only the return on these equity shares is high but we also get to make the decision of the company as we are the partial owners of the company Thus I feel that equity shares are the best source of investment since we can make huge profits from it in a short span of time
