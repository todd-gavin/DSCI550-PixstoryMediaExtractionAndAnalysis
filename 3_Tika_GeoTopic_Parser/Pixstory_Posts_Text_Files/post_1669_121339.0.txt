A woman who was born with a rare disease that meant her feet grew to an astounding size joined a "freak show" to make ends meet.

While she looked like a normal woman from the waist up, Fanny Mills had a condition that meant her feet ballooned to bigger than normal. While her sisters developed normally, Fanny displayed symptoms of Milroy’s Disease, a condition that mainly affects women and causes the lower limbs to swell.

Over time her feet swelled so much that reports say they were 19 inches long and seven inches wide. Most accounts state she wore shoes made from three goat’s skins and socks made out of pillowcases as normal shoes wouldn't fit.

Determined to profit off of her condition, she performed as the “Ohio Big Foot Girl” during the 1980s at dime museums — also referred to as “freak shows” — up and down the East Coast.

She soon became a hit, with audiences travelling far and wide to see her. Thanks to Fanny’s success, she would sometimes earn $4,000 (£2,944) a week.

Visiting dime museums were a popular pastime among many Americans at the time. For the cost of only one dime, they would see people like Fanny, whose medical condition left them few choices other than putting themselves on display for money.

Fanny so was popular amongst dime museum audiences that the people running them used a new tactic to promote her.

They cruelly stated that Fanny’s father would pay someone $5,000 (£3,680) to marry her.

This was in fact, not true, as Fanny married William Brown, her friend’s brother, in 1886.
