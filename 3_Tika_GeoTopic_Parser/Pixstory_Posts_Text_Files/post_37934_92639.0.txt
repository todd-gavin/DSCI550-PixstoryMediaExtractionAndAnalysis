As per the Mirror, Paulo Dybala is reportedly keen on a move outside of the Serie A. Hence three Premier League clubs have already taken up their interest in the Juventus midfielder. 

Paulo Dybala has been one of Juventus' biggest assets in recent years. The Argentine midfielder signed for the Old Lady in 2015. Since then he has scored 113 goals in 284 appearances for the Serie A giants. 

The Juventus midfielder has an impressive 8 goals and 5 assists to his name in 22 Serie A games this season. To add to this Dybala has also scored 3 goals in the UEFA Champions League. 

As per the report, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal are interested in Paulo Dybala's services. Both the clubs want to sign midfielders in the summer and the Argentine fits the bill perfectly. Hence, It is quite possible that Dybala could sign for the club that qualifies for the Champions League next season! 

Antonio Conte is reportedly very keen on signing Paulo Dybala. The Italian has been monitoring the Juventus midfielder and he believes that the Argentine would certainly be a welcome addition to the squad. 

But the North London rivals could face a tough challenge from Newcastle United. The Tyneside club is reportedly set to offer Paulo Dybala a "bumper contract" to attract him in the summer. 

Newcastle United are looking to spend big in the summer transfer window. The new Saudi-based owners want to make the club challenge for the European spots. Hence, quality signings like that of Dybala are at the epicenter of the club's project. 





Other possible options for the Juventus midfielder? 

Serie A rivals Inter Milan and AC Milan are also said to be monitoring the situation as they look to lure the Juventus midfielder in the summer. Barcelona have also shown their interest in Paulo Dybala before. Hence we expect them to join the bandwagon as well in the next few weeks.
