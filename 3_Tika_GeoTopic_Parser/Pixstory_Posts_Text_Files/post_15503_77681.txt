This has allowed us to discover how characteristic structural motifs are present in the AsN crystal with important implications for the stability of the system. The data acquired during the experiments have allowed us to observe the persistence of this new compound up to pressures one hundred thousand times higher than atmospheric pressure at ambient temperature suggesting the possibility of being able to recover AsN at ambient pressure The synthesis conditions of AsN identified in our study, although still far from the possibilities of current industrial technologies, are nevertheless enormously lower than the extreme conditions of pressure and temperature required for the synthesis of cg N more than a million times the atmospheric pressure and C thus hinting at the possibility of synthesizing macroscopic quantities of AsN in the future for further studies concluded Matteo Ceppatelli, researcher at the CNR ICCOM who coordinated the research The implications of the discovery of arsenic nitride AsN recently published in the journal Angewandte Chemie international edition concern both the fundamental chemistry of the elements of the group of the periodic table which includes arsenic and nitrogen and the high pressure synthesis of innovative advanced materials of high energy and technological interest such as thermoelectric materials and those with very low thermal conductivity, opening up new perspectives for the study of these high pressure systems
