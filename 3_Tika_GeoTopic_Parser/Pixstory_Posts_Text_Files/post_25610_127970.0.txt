LeBron James has had a spectacular individual season, despite what his team record states at the moment. The

The King already has 4 NBA championships to his name, and even if he does not win another one, he is already one of the top-5 players to have ever played the game. After all, look at his incredible career. James has won 4 titles, 4 Finals MVPs, 4 MVPs, and made a spectacular 18 All-Star appearances.

As a result, LeBron James is considered the single greatest player of all time to much of the younger audience. While Michael Jordan tends to dominate the GOAT debates, LeBron James certainly has his supporters, and for good reason. Recently, we saw LeBron James pass Karl Malone to become the 2nd greatest scorer in NBA history. He is getting closer to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar at the top spot, and he will likely pass the legendary center next year.

If LeBron James becomes the all-time leading scorer, his status in the GOAT debate greatly increases.

To many fans, especially the younger audiences, LeBron James is already the GOAT without the all-time record in points scored. But capturing that record would convince many more people that we are witnessing the best player ever because that is yet another unbreakable record to his name.
