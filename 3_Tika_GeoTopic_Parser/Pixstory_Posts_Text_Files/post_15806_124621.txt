Background Current paradigms for predicting weight loss in response to energy restriction have general validity but a subset of individuals fail to respond adequately despite documented diet adherence Patients in the bottom for rate of weight loss following a hypocaloric diet diet resistant have been found to have less type I muscle fibres and lower skeletal muscle mitochondrial function leading to the hypothesis that physical exercise may be an effective treatment when diet alone is inadequate In this study we aimed to assess the efficacy of exercise training on mitochondrial function in women with obesity with a documented history of minimal diet induced weight loss Methods From over patient records files were reviewed to identify baseline characteristics of weight loss response from women with obesity who were previously classified in the top or bottom quintiles based on rate of weight loss in the first weeks during which a kcal day meal replacement was consumed A subset of women with obesity were identified based on diet resistance n and diet sensitivity n to undergo a week supervised progressive combined aerobic and resistance exercise intervention Findings Diet sensitive women had lower baseline adiposity higher fasting insulin and triglycerides and a greater number of ATP III criteria for metabolic syndrome Conversely in diet resistant women the exercise intervention improved body composition skeletal muscle mitochondrial content and metabolism with minimal effects in diet sensitive women In depth analyses of muscle metabolomes revealed distinct group and intervention differences including lower serine associated sphingolipid synthesis in diet resistant women following exercise training Interpretation Exercise preferentially enhances skeletal muscle metabolism and improves body composition in women with a history of minimal diet induced weight loss These clinical and metabolic mechanism insights move the field towards better personalised approaches for the treatment of distinct obesity phenotypes Funding Canadian Institutes of Health Research CIHR INMD and FDN CAN CIHR PJT Sources
