In the showboating, smack-talking world of professional sprinting, Fred Kerley has always been something of an outlier. USA Today reported that he does not pound his chest as he steps into the blocks. His news conferences rarely make news. He often ends social media posts with the hashtag "#SayNoMore."

He certainly didn't need to say much Saturday night.

A little less than a year after winning silver at the Tokyo Olympics, Kerley squeaked across the line in the men's 100-meter final at Hayward Field to win his first world championship â€” and lead the first American sweep in the event since 1991.

Kerley, 27, finished in 9.86 seconds, two-hundredths off what he ran in the finals in Tokyo last summer. Marvin Bracy took silver in 9.88, beating compatriot Trayvon Bromell by mere milliseconds.

"It's amazing to do it on home soil with the home crowd behind us," Kerley told reporters after the race. "It's a wonderful blessing to get a clean sweep. We all put the work in."

Defending world champion Christian Coleman, who was the fourth American in the eight-man final, came in sixth.

It's the third time the U.S. has swept the event at the world championships, but none of Saturday's winners were alive the last time it happened. According to U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee historian Bill Mallon, the U.S. has now won more world championship medals in the men's 100 (28) than every other nation combined.
