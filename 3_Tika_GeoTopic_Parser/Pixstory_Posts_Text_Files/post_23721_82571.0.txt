Michiel took this photo of Dantita, as she is fondly known, at the foothills of Braulio Carrillo National Park, close to San Jos√© in central Costa Rica.

The Baird's tapir or 'gardeners of the forest' are extremely important to their natural habitat, with some seeds only germinating after passing through the tapir.

But due to threats from deforestation and hunting, there are estimated to be only 6,000 individuals left in the wild.

Conservation groups such as Proyecto Tapir Nicaragua and Nai Conservation have been set up to work closely with local communities to promote the importance of preserving the land and protecting an endangered species.

Equipment used: Canon EOS 1D X + 16--35mm f2.8 lens; 1/40 sec at f7.1; ISO 5000; 2x Yongnuo speedlite yn600ex-rt; Pixel Pawn remote control.
