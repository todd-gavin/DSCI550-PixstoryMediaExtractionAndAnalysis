‌A Conservative councillor who recently won elections has resigned after retweets from his publicly open social media account shared “abhorrent” and “racist” remarks about Muslims and migrants.
‌
‌During the recent Harlow local elections,
Marco Lorenzini, recent of Bush Fair ward in Harlow, gained his seat from Labour by just four votes.

According to statements by Harlow Council and Harlow Conservatives, he had the party whip withdrawn and later resigned. 

The tweet included one referring to a “Muslim invasion” and another saying white people are “the only race you can legally discriminate against”.

Another one mocked the recent casting of Ncuti Gatwa, a Black Scottish actor with Rwandan heritage, as the next Doctor Who.

Meanwhile, the Conservative party has released a statement that “These abhorrent views are not the views of the Conservative party and we utterly condemn them. There is no place in our party for such thought and we will never accept it.”

We live every day to cast off the traits of racism from humans. People have to think before sharing this kind of content, especially a public figure like him. It is good that we got to know and immediate resignation was done. It's sad that even after years racism is ingrained in many and many people normalise racist jokes. It is high time that this attitude be changed.
