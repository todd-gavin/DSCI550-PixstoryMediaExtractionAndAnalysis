Kakao TV’s original drama “Welcome to Wedding Hell” (also known as “Marriage White Paper”) is a relatable romance about a couple in their 30s preparing for marriage. While they were expecting a happy ending like something out of a fairy tale, the reality of their preparations proves to be somewhat different.

Lee Jin Wook will be starring as Seo Joon Hyung, the smitten groom-to-be who is happy to yield to his fiancée’s every command. Lee Yeon Hee will be taking on the role of the lovable bride-to-be Kim Na Eun who is affectionate and full of laughter but also sharp when working.

The new moving poster is presented in the form of a bridal magazine and uses Seo Joon Hyung and Kim Na Eun as a guidebook for all couples preparing for marriage.
