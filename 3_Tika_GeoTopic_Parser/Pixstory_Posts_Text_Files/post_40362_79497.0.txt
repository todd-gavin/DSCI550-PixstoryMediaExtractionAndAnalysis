Forests harness various ecosystems that maintain the ecological balance in nature. Trees serve as a source of innumerable necessities. However, what we fail to recognise the most important of those necessities â€” oxygen, and continue cutting them down to feed the unending hunger of human civilization. The time where we'll have to pay to access something as vital as oxygen isn't far away. To prevent such a situation and protect the ones the most vulnerable to the horrors of deforestation, it is time for us and the ones in power to do something about this grave issue.
