Covid vaccines were the Saviours of a generation and we know everything comes with a price and the price we expected was headaches, fatigue and soreness as side effects. At least most people thought so. I believe the greatest drawback of the vaccines are it's positive side too-fast production and distribution of it. We almost made a vaccine in a year and the second year, everyone was vaccinated. Hence tests done were legible but weren't complete-side effects arise over time and we can only wait. 

One of the new side-effects researchers found was temporary menstrual changes. An analysis published Friday in the journal Science Advances found that 42% of people with regular menstrual cycles said they bled more heavily than usual after vaccination. 
Meanwhile, 44% reported no change and around 14% reported a lighter period. Among nonmenstruating people — those post-menopause or who use certain long-term contraceptives, for example — the study suggests many encountered breakthrough or unexpected bleeding after their Covid shots.

Still, other recent research also found that the Covid vaccine is related to a small change in menstrual cycle length. 

The respondents were vaccinated with Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and Novavax.
