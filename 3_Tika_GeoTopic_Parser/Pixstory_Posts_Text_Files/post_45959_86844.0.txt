The White House said Wednesday that President Joe Biden intends to nominate Roselyn Tso to manage the Indian Health Service. 

Tso, a Navajo Nation member, is the IHS's Navajo region director, in charge of supervising federal health care for approximately 250,000 Native Americans in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. 

Tso has been with the CIA since 1984, according to the White House. She worked in Portland, Oregon, and at IHS headquarters in Washington, D.C. before taking the Navajo area director position. She's been in her current position since 2019.

The Institute of Health Services is a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency offers health care to 2.6 million Native Americans and Alaska Natives who live on or near tribal reservations, with an annual budget of around $7.4 billion. 

Capital Sun reported that COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted Native American populations. 

Tso's decision was welcomed by Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez on Wednesday, who said she had managed the crisis admirably. 

“Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, her leadership, expertise, and compassion have helped to reduce the spread of this modern-day monster and to save lives,” he said. 

Biden has chosen several Native American people for prominent jobs in the administration.
