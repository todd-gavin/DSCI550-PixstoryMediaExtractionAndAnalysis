The DASH eating plan is rich in fruits, vegetables, fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products, whole grains, fish, poultry, beans, seeds, and nuts. It also contains less sodium; sweets, added sugars, and 
beverages containing sugar.

The DASH eating plan requires no special foods and has no hard-to-follow recipes.

Certain changes that can be easily adapted to include DASH eating plan in a normal routine.

👉Add a serving of vegetables at lunch one day and 
dinner the next, and add fruit at one meal or as a snack.

👉Increase use of fat-free and low-fat milk 
products to three servings a day.

👉Limit lean meats to 6 ounces a day—3 ounces a meal, which is about the size of a deck of cards. 

👉If you usually eat large portions of meat, cut them back over a couple of days—by half or a third at each meal.

👉Include two or more vegetarian-style, or meatless,meals each week.

👉Increase servings of vegetables, brown rice, whole wheat pasta, and cooked dry beans. 

👉Try casseroles and stir-fry dishes, which have less meat and more vegetables, grains, and dry beans.

👉For snacks and desserts, use fruits or other
foods low in saturated fat, trans fat,cholesterol, sodium, sugar, and calories-for example, unsalted rice cakes; unsalted nuts or seeds;
raisins; graham crackers; fat-free, low-fat, or frozen yogurt; popcorn with no salt or butter added; or raw vegetables.

👉Use fresh, frozen, or low-sodium canned
vegetables and fruits.
