House of Dragon is introducing one significant change from the books Set approximately years before Game of Thrones timeline House of the Dragon depicts a monumental era in the reign of House Targaryen known as the Dance of the Dragons House of the Dragon will see the beginning and end of King Viserys I Targaryen s rule of Westeros with the character expected to have a short yet impactful tenure on the series similar to Ned Stark in Game of Thrones Goerge RR Martin said that the series makes Viserys a better character than he ever could In Fire Blood arguably the most important aspect of Viserys character is that he adamantly defends his daughter Rhaenyra s claim as his heir over his son Aegon with his death inciting House Targaryen s Civil War House of the Dragon s changes suggest he ll have a much more substantial bearing on his children and the realm s motivations after his death thus giving him a more tragic rather than anticipated death This is exactly what made Ned Stark s character in Game of Thrones so compelling as he died at the end of season after largely serving as the series main character which made the character such a fan favorite This decision to make Viserys death more meaningful rather than just using it as a plot tool could be a big selling point of the series The fans are rather skeptical about the spin off as they still have the sour taste from the final season of Game of Thrones If anything the news surrounding House of Dragons has me more excited about the show
