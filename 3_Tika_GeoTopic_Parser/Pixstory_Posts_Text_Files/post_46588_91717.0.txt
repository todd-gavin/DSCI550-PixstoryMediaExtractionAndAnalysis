“Healthy Mind, Healthy Body, Healthy Living!”

This is a lesson that has been inculcated in me since I was a kid. My parents taught me the importance of good health and how it is crucial to be in your healthiest state to excel in life. 

How you approach your health is an indicative of how you approach life. If you eat healthy, exercise daily, chances are that you may not be the most fit person in the room but you will definitely not be the most unhealthy person in the room too. Yes, there maybe some external factors like money, other health issues which may hamper the process of being fit but there is always a way around that. Taking a walk around the block, cycling to work and cutting unnecessary junk food are some of the ways. 

Moreover, health professionals repeatedly talk about the dangers of obesity. Heart problem, liver problems, kidney problems, low physical agility, shortness of breath are just some of them. It has been proven that obese people have a shorter life span as compared to non obese people. Obesity not only shortens life but also affects its quality and productivity of an individual. Now, as an employer why would I hire a person who is not at their best?
If I am an employer and I am investing in manpower, it is obvious that I would want only the best people in my workforce. 

Therefore, people are not being “fatphobic” when they tell their friends and family to take care of their health. Creating narratives like these is just another way to justify toxic and unhealthy lifestyle.
