My Years in the Supreme Court continues....

Rai Bahadur Nathu Ram Sethi, O. B. E. who had retired as Additional District Magistrate, Delhi, sometime previous to 1952 and who was a very kind friend willing to do all that he could for anybody, had thought out the scheme of building a colony to be named as Friends Colony on Mathura Road, New Delhi. He had demarcated 70 plots on the site which he had bought and had allotted most of them to a number of his friends. He had been asking me to take one of the plots to build a residential house. 

I had no desire to live in Delhi. Eventually he and a number of other friends persuaded me to take a plot on which I built the house where I now live. I can never forget the kindness of Nathu Ram to whom I owe a deep debt of gratitude for forcing this plot on me which has now become very valuable. 

The President of India was pleased to designate me as his nominee on the Executive Council of the University of Delhi. Dr. D. K. Sen was then the Vice-Chancellor of the University. I attended a number of meetings of the Executive Council. 

The Ministry of Education, it seems, had not taken very kindly to Mr. Senâ€™s Vice Chancellorship and they wanted to appoint somebody else as the Vice-Chancellor. The New Delhi University Act was passed and a notice was given to Dr Sen to quit. He sought my advice and I told him that legally this notice had no force and he could not be sent away before the expiry of his normal term as Vice-Chancellor. 

He did not want to involve himself in this tussle and tendered his resignation. The Executive Council recommended a panel of persons who were to recommend a set of names to the President for the vacant post of the Vice-Chancellor. The President was to nominate one from this panel.
