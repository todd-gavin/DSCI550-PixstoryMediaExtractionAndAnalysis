I asked everyone who passed through the same hard times “ Will this stay forever ? “

They all replied “ No, nothing stays forever. Not the good times nor the bad times. It will pass.
But as it passes, try not to focus on every detail because details hurt the most. 
We all have been through hard times. They may seem like they won’t end at times.
But believe me gardually and all of a sudden you wake up feeling better “.
