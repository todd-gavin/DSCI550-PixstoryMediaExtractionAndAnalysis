This year the world water day which occurs on March will be celebrated in a context of shortage of this resource which has few historical precedents for Lombardy and in general for the Po basin and its tributaries The irrigation season has not yet begun but the crops are already suffering and the water bodies are even worse due to a drought condition that continues to persist The surface waters of Lombardy are found in three very large reservoirs the snow in the mountains the large regulated lakes and the reservoirs of hydroelectric dams at high altitude According ARPA Lombardia in this period of the year they should contain an average of billions of cubic meters of water no Italian region can have similar volumes of water reserves a formidable flywheel to face the entire irrigation season The problem that this year there is a lack of more than billions of cubic meters and the situation continues to worsen despite the efforts of the lake regulator consortia to keep the water inside the now half-empty lake reservoirs in the large lakes it is estimated that the volume of water available for irrigation has decreased to millions of cubic meters the average of previous years Only Lake Garda retains a good part of its reserves while Lake Como and Iseo are scraping the bottom and Lake Maggiore The situation would not be so serious if there was snow in the mountains with low snow figures which emerges the most dramatic picture of the last fifteen years The volume of water equivalent to the snow present in our Alps millions of cubic meters less than a third of the billions of cubic meters that are usually measured in this season they go badly with less than million cubic meters of residual water And in this case the concern for water scarcity is added to the concern for the lack of electricity production this year we have an urgent need to reduce our gas imports
