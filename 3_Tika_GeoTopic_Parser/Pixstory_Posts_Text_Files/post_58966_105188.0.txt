Afghanistan's strong Defense Minister, Mullah Yaqub, the son of Taliban founder Mullah Omar, has shown willingness to send Afghan army men to India for military training, adding they "don't have any objections."

When asked if the Taliban would be willing to send its army officers to India for military training, he said this in an exclusive interview with India's News 18 TV channel.

"We don't see any problems with it." The Afghan-Indian relationship is reinforced, which paves the way for this. He stated, "There will be no problems with it."

Mullah Yaqub, when asked if the present Afghan leadership sought tight defence ties with India, responded that first and foremost, they wanted to create strong diplomatic relations with all countries, including India. "Only when we establish pleasant political and diplomatic relations together will we be prepared for defence relations." He went on to say, "Neither will there be a problem with it, nor do we see any issue with it."

Mullah Yaqub, speaking about the country's relations with other countries, stated that they want cordial relations with all countries of the globe, particularly their neighbours, including India. "We desire excellent and cordial relations with India, and we hope that India will reciprocate and continue to have good relations with us in various ways."
The defence minister also urged India and Pakistan to address their differences through negotiation, claiming that the Taliban administration would not interfere in the bilateral affairs of arch-rival neighbours.

"We will not allow Pakistan to use Afghan soil against India, and we will not allow India to use Afghan soil against Pakistan," he stated in response to a query on the suspected existence of terrorist groups on Afghan territory.
