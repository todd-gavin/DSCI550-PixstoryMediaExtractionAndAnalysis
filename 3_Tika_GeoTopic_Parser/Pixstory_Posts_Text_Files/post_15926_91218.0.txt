Abstract

Objective

Type 2 diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most common global cause of kidney disease and failure. Obesity is a major risk factor for DKD due to its causal relationship with diabetes, hypertension, and other factors promoting kidney disease. We therefore investigated whether metabolic surgery such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is more effective than state-of-the-art medical therapy (i.e. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists) in treating DKD.

Design and Methods

In a post hoc analysis of the Microvascular Outcomes after Metabolic Surgery (MOMS) trial, we compared the likelihood of regression of microalbuminuria as primary endpoint and other renal and metabolic secondary endpoints in a population of patients with obesity, type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria and early CKD followed for 24 months. Nine patients underwent RYBG and 24 patients were on state-of-the art medical therapy.

Results

The gastric bypass arm had a significantly higher rate of regression of microalbuminuria (P<0.001), borderline significant reduction in mean UACR (P=0.055), and much greater weight loss (P=0.001). There were no statistically significant differences between arms in eGFR, risk of developing eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73m2 over 5 years, mean HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, or the ADA triple endpoint.

Conclusion

We found that metabolic surgery offers more kidney protection compared to state-of-the-art triple therapy for DKD at 24 months. Prospective studies in this area are necessary to better define the benefits and risks of medical versus surgical treatment of DKD.
