Man City inch closer and closer to the title win, following their frustrating defeat against Spurs, The Premier league’s title race got heated up yet again between two clubs, Manchester City and Liverpool with Liverpool thrashing teams left and right and Manchester City losing all three points against Spurs. 

But this week Manchester City won their match against Everton thanks to a goal from the English sensations Phil Foden to dampen the Liverpool title hopes and provide a huge boost to their own. 

Unless City does a major mess up here, Pep’s men are certainly destined to win the title yet again.
