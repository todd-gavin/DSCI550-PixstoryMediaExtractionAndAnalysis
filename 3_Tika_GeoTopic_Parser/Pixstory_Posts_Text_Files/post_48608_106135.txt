Following a terrible season speculation of a Randle trade began to heat up That exacerbated an already terrible situation and he began to develop into a true locker room issue Fortunately it appears that all parties have agreed to start afresh Randle appears to have recommitted to his conditioning and the Knicks no longer appear to be aggressively looking to deal him And as it seems Randle is putting up some real work to better himself He underwent a crazy body transformation post all of this mess Social media as always has mixed reactions to it with some people outpouring love and support for him and others being degrading and discouraging The upcoming season will be pivotal for Randle Last year s implosion will be a distant memory if he bounces back strong and plays like he did two seasons ago
