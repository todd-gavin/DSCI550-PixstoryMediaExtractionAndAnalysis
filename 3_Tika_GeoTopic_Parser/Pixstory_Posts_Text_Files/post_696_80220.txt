Came to Delhi got my self a job the hijab stayed I had no problem with the way I looked And I was more confident walking into a PC head covered than any of my contemporaries The newly employed cameramen of news channels did get excited seeing me take notes while holding on to the hijab I was never under confident suppressed oppressed just because I looked and dressed differently When it came to asking questions I was the most vocal A top politicians daughter had unfortunately committed suicide and I went to cover it Dupatta over my head with sunglasses and an umbrella I got papped as the cameramen thought I was someone from the family There were many positives I never had a bad hair day and it protected me from scorching sun The only problem was my non AC existence as I couldn t afford one and auto rides in crazy Delhi traffic jams taxis were a luxury there was no ola uber and no metros So I developed allergies due to sweat as I was out on the roads most day At times when caught in traffic I would just pull the dupatta off my head The icing on the cake was a late night auto ride when the driver who seemed half drunk started singing about hijabs and purdah My face was a give away and Kashmiris were not seen as very friendly creatures than so I decided to say good bye to hijab I CHOOSE NOT TO When I went back to cover Kashmir with HT I faced volatile people and not one but many people asked me why my head is not covered I either ignored them or they got a befitting reply most of the times May be tomorrow I might decide to cover my head again and I will not let anyone take that RIGHT AWAY FROM ME IT IS A CHOICE THAT HAS TO BE MINE Whether u like it or not Hijab is part of practical faith of a Muslim women the constitution of India gives me choice allows me to practice my faith So I choose
