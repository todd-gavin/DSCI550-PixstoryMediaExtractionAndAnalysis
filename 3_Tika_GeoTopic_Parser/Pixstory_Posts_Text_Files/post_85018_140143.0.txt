Bournemouth secured their first win since the sacking of Scott Parker when they took on
Nottingham Forest last weekend. There is a very good chance that we will be treated to goals at
both ends of the pitch this weekend, just as we have seen in three of the last six meetings
between these two clubs Brighton’s last two matches have ended with both teams getting on the scoreboard and thevisitors have only failed to score in one of their last six matches in league and cup.
Prediction: Bournemouth 1-2 Brighton
