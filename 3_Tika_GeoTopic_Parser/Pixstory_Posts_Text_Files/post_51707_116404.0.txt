The skipper is the most important player on and off the field. 

With the arm band , you wear a lot of responsibilities cause after the results the captain is the one who is always appreciated or gets criticized accordingly. 

From my personal experience of being a football player and A CAPTAIN these are the qualities a Skipper should have to boost the team spirit. 

- Patience and being Calm

On the break, when the team is loosing, 
A leader will always Motivate the team by cheering up the players and talking respectively when someone did any mistake,

But the Bossy captain will always blame other players for the mistakes. They always shout and disrespect other players after any mistake. 

- Communication skills ðŸ“¢

Team sports are always based on how the players communicate to each others. The Captain plays an important role in the communication between the players inside the field , 
As being the most important player on the field the skipper should communicate well with thier fellow players. 

- Being a example for the team âš½

If the skipper is giving is best in the field then the fellow players will also try to give their best, 
If the skipper will be lazy and not giving its best there will be a bad impact on the other players Morale.

The Truth of indian Football Managers over choosing the captain - 

Some managers are not aware of how important a captain can be for a team, 

Mostly they choose players as a captian because - 

- The player maybe a relative of the manager 
- The player maybe a excellent player but bossy 
- Young players 

I had also Managed football teams,

According to me These are some qualities a manager should look in a perfect skipper- 

â€¢ Experience 
â€¢ Respect towards the players 
â€¢ Dedication to perform their best 
â€¢ Communication skills 

I had always been a Leader instead of being bossy , 

Do you got to know what kind of skipper you are ? 

If bossy ! Don't worry you can change some little things mentioned above to be a better CAPTAIN, 

THANK YOU
