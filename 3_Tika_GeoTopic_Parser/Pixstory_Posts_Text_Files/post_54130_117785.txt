Hundreds of millions of people struggled to keep cool amid a sweltering summer heat wave as cities across the U S and mainland Europe experienced record high temperatures In the U K thermometers topped Fahrenheit degrees Celsius on July the highest ever recorded While all this broiling heat is surely punishing on a personal level it also has significant impacts on the broader economy As an economist who has studied the effects of weather and climate change I have examined a large body of work that links heat to economic outcomes Here are four ways extreme heat hurts the economy Growth takes a hit Research has found that extreme heat can directly hurt economic growth For example a study found that the economies of U S states tend to grow at a slower pace during relatively hot summers The data shows that annual economic growth falls to percentage points for every degree Fahrenheit C that a state s average summer temperature is above normal Laborers in weather exposed industries such as construction work fewer hours when it s hotter But higher summer temperatures also reduce growth in many industries that tend to involve indoor work including retail services and finance Workers are less productive when it s hotter out Crop yields drop Agriculture is obviously exposed to weather After all crops grow outdoors While temperatures up to around F to F C can benefit crop growth yields fall sharply when thermostats rise further Some of the crops that can be hit hard by extreme heat include corn soybeans and cotton These reductions in yields could be costly for U S agriculture For example a recent study I conducted found that an additional degrees C F of global warming would eliminate profits from an average acre of farmland in the eastern U S A prominent example of this was the collapse of the Russian wheat harvest in response to the country s heat wave which raised wheat prices throughout the world Read more
