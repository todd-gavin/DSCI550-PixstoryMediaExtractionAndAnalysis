Bāḷ Gaṅgādhar Ṭiḷak (July 23, 1856 - August 1 1920), was an Indian nationalist, philosopher, social reformer, and the first popular leader of the Indian Independence Movement. He is known as "Father of the Indian unrest." Reverently addressed as Lokmanya (meaning "Beloved of the people" or "Revered by the world"), Tilak was a scholar of Indian history, Sanskrit, Hinduism, mathematics, law, and astronomy. He was one of the first and strongest proponents for Swaraj (complete independence) in Indian consciousness, and is often considered the father of Hindu nationalism. His famous quote, "Swaraj is my birthright, and I shall have it!" is well-remembered in India even today. In 1881, he established two newspapers, the Marathi Kesari (Lion), and The Mahratta, published in English, to arouse political consciousness in the general population. After being imprisoned for sedition from 1908–1914, he emerged a political leader and helped to found the Home Rule League.
