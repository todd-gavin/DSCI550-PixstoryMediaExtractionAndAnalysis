The critical reception of the film has been mixed.[15] The cinematography and the performances of the cast were described as compelling,[21] but the film faced accusations of historical revisionism,[22] and of carrying propaganda aligned with the ruling party,[25] aiming to foster prejudice against Muslims.[26] Supporters have praised the film for showing what they say is an often-overlooked part of Kashmir's history,[7] while theatres across India have witnessed hate speech including calls for killing Muslims, incited by activists of the ruling party and related Hindutva organisations.[27][28]Directed byVivek AgnihotriWritten by
