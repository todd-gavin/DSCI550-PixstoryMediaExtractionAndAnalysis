Jesse Lingard, a former attacking midfielder for Manchester United, has finalised a free transfer 
to Nottingham Forest. After winning promotion to the Premier League, the 29-year-old, who has 32 England caps, becomes Forest's 11th summer acquisition.

When his contract expired at the end of June, he left United after more than 20 years with the 
organisation. The duration of Lingard's contract has not been made public by Forest.

He had also been linked with a move back to West Ham, where he spent the 2020–21 season on loan and scored nine goals in 16 Premier League appearances.

The duration of Lingard's contract hasn't been disclosed by Forest. It has been said that he has 
signed a one-year deal with the team, though. Depending on bonuses, Lingard may make up to £200,000 per week at Forest, although his base pay is far less.

Before making his official debut for the Red Devils in August 2014, Lingard progressed through the United junior academy and endured loan stints at Leicester and Birmingham. In total, he appeared for the club in over 230 games, including 22 games in the 2021–22 season.

At the end of the season, his contract expired, and West Ham and Forest started to surface as 
potential suitors. Juventus was another potential suitor for the free agent, although their interest waned in the previous month.

At Forest, he'll don the No. 10 jersey. Forest has been active in the transfer market; on Wednesday, it acquired midfielder Lewis O'Brien and defender Harry Toffolo from Championship team (second division) Huddersfield Town. Dean Henderson, Taiwo Awoniyi, Brandon Aguilera, Neco Williams, Giulian Biancone, Wayne Hennessey, Moussa Niakhate, and Omar Richards have also been enlisted.
