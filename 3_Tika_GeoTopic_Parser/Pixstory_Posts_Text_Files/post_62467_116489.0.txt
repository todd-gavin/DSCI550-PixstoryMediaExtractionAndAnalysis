Many people are unaware of or unwilling to appreciate the importance of snakes in the ecosystem. Some of them think snakes are here to hurt us, while others don't know why they even exist.

The biggest myth about snakes is that they enjoy hurting us. Absolutely not. They are fearful of us and are very timid creature. They want to stay as far away from us as they can. They usually only attack in defense. BUT that does not mean you should ever get close to them. Even when you think they're not looking at you, they are. They have heat receptors and can also feel vibrations coming off of you, and trust me, they will attack if you get too close.

Snakes play a significant role in maintaining the balance of their prey populations in their natural habitats. For the environment to remain in balance, that is something that is absolutely required. For instance, in the eastern United States, timber rattlesnakes eat mice that serve as black-legged tick hosts. The bacterial pathogen Lyme disease is spread by such ticks.

It is saddening now many of their species is endangered because of habitat destruction, human involvement, illegal poaching, and medicinal research.
