Ireland has a rough and bloody history with the Monarchy of England and it's safe to say that the IRISH have no love for the Queen. 
Going by the tweets from verified accounts, it is being said that the people in Ireland are out on the streets partying. 
People are apparently celebrating with fireworks, however I have not come around any article mentioning the same, but the people on Twitter are having the time of their life. 
One even went as far as to edit a video of the Irish dancers Cairde performing at the front of Buckingham Palace with Queen's hit song "Another One Bites the Dust" as the soundtrack.
Another wrote: "The Queen has died. Let's take this opportunity to remember all those millions of people who died as a result of British imperialism in Africa, India, Ireland, during slavery and in so many countries in the world who didn't have such a long and privileged life."
A third wrote: "Where's the avengers endgame edit with Ireland, India, Jamaica, Nigeria, Ghana etc teaming up to celebrate the death of the queen?"
A fourth commented: "Reminder that Queen Elizabeth is not a remnant of colonial times. She was an active participant in colonialism. She actively tried to stop independence movements & she tried to keep newly independent colonies from leaving the commonwealth. The evil she did was enough."
While another tweeted " India ü§ù Ireland Partying together coz the old hag is dead"
To be quite honest with you, I don't blame them, if I had suffered what they did, I would feel the same about the Queen's death.
