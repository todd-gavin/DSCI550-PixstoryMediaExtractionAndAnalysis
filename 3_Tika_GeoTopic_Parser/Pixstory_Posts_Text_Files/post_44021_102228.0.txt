Cameron Carter-Vickers has been a revelation for the Celtics defense in the previous season. 
The American stood like a brick wall in front of the forwards and strikers of other teams.

The Celtics defense was one of the weaker parts of the team but Cameron changed that with a 
great season for the Hoops.

Cameron was brought in on a loan from Tottenham Hotspur on a season-long loan.

However, the Celtics are all set to make the transfer permanent as they agreed to the wages with Carter-Vickers.

This is a great signing for the hoops considering the history of having weakness in their defense.

Cameron has played some unbelievable football for them and some believe was the 
Player of the Season.

The American has been rewarded with a contract on his own terms due to his amazing 
performance throughout the last season.

With Maeda agreeing for a permanent contract and Jota ready to join the Celtics as well.

Celtics are lining up a really strong line up for the coming Season.

The transfer fee for Carter-Vickers is believed to £6 million which could rise up to £10 million with add-ons. This makes the defender to be the most expensive signing in the history for the Celtics.
