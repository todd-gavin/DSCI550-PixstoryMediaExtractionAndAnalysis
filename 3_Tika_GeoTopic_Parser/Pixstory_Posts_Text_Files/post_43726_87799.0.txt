Scotland is in second place in Group B, behind leaders Spain; Pedro Martinez Losa's team has won three of their five games and was scheduled to face Ukraine on April 8; Ukraine drew 1-1 with Scotland at Hampden Park in November.
Due to the current Russian military invasion of Ukraine, Scotland's Women's World Cup qualifier has been postponed until June.
The original match was scheduled for April 8, but it has been rescheduled for June 24 due to the Scottish FA's refusal to play a friendly in its place.
Instead, Pedro Martinez Losa's side will prepare to face group B leaders Spain on April 12 at Hampden Park.
"In light of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, we fully support Uefa's decision," said Martinez Losa.
"Football, naturally, comes second at a time like this. Our thoughts are with everyone in Ukraine affected by this horrible situation.
"We look forward to playing them when the time is right, and in the meantime, we reiterate our message of solidarity."
Scotland women boss Pedro Martinez Losa says his dream for the new year is securing qualification for the 2023 World Cup:
Martinez Losa highlighted in an exclusive interview with Sky Sports that his major goal for 2022 is to qualify for the 2023 Women's World Cup.
Last summer, the former Arsenal and Bordeaux women's manager took command of the national team and swiftly won three qualification matches, defeating Sweden and Hungary at home and away.
Martinez Losa's team's chances of winning their group were terminated by an 8-0 defeat in his native Spain, but Scotland are still in second place, and Martinez Losa is optimistic about his goals for the coming year.
Scotland's men's team's World Cup play-off semi-final against Ukraine has been rescheduled for June, with Steve Clarke's side instead playing two friendlies this month.
