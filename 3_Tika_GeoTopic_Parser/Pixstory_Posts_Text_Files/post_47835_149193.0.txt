By NewsDrum DeskWashington: External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday took a dig at the mainstream American media, including The Washington Post, for their "biased" coverage of India."I look at the media. You know, there are some newspapers you know, exactly, what they are going to write including one in this town," Jaishankar told a gathering of Indian-Americans from across the country amidst laughter and applause.The prestigious Washington Post is the national daily published from Washington DC and currently being owned by Jeff Bezos of Amazon."My point is there are biases, there are efforts really, to determine, â€¦. Look the more India goes its way and the people who believe that they were the custodians and the shapers of India lose ground in India the more actually, some of these debaters gonna come outside," Jaishankar said responding to a question on the increase in anti-Indian forces in this country.Such groups, he asserted, are "not winning in India." Such groups, the minister noted, will try and win outside or try and shape India from outside."This is something which we need to be aware of. It is important to contest. It isn't because most Americans will not know what sort of the nuances and the complexities of back home, so, it's important not to sit back, not to let other people define me. That is something which I feel as a community is very important for us," he said.Responding to a question on misrepresentation of the Kashmir issue in the American capital, the External Affairs Minister said if there is a terrorist incident, it doesn't matter what faith the person who's killed belongs to; if there are Indian soldiers or Indian policemen who are abducted; If there are people working for the government, or citizens going about their business, who will lose their lives.Read more: https://www.newsdrum.in/international/jaishankar-takes-dig-at-american-media-for-biased-india-coverage-94358.html
