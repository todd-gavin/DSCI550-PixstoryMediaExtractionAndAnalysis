Native to eastern Australia, the macadamia nut is eaten raw or included in a variety of dishes. From breads to lamb roasts and cakes, this is a versatile nut. Pick some 'round Byron Bay during spring!

Letâ€™s not forget another iconic Australian snack- Damper!

As per CNN, this iconic, cheap Australian food was the staple of road workers and bushies in days gone by. Originally it was the simplest of recipes. The soda bread is made from wheat flour, water and a pinch of salt, then baked in the coals of a campfire and paired nicely with billy tea or a swig of rum. Today it can be a little more fancy -- milk and self-raising flour.

So which one is your favourite?
