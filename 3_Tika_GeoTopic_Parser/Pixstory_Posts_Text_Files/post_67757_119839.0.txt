India is grouped with Ghana, England, Wales and Canada in Group A. India starts their campaign on 29th July against Ghana and they would start as favourites. They will fancy their chances against Wales too. But they will face stiff competition from Canada and England. England in recent times have become a hurdling block in India winning a medal and finishing 4th. They stopped India from winning a bronze at the Olympics and they stopped India from finishing 3rd at Gold Coast Games in 2018. 

While in the last match against Canada in the World Cup, India played out a 1-1 draw at the end of full time. They won in the penalty shoot-out. The Savita Punia led side, looking at their current form, still should move ahead in the semi-finals. 

In the semis, they may face either New Zealand or Australia. They had beaten Australia in the quarter finals of Tokyo 2020 Olympic games so the team will believe that they can beat them again, provided they reach that stage. 

Indian coach Janneke Schopman believes that her experienced side will finish in top 3. "We have chosen an experienced side for the Commonwealth Games and the players believe they have a good shot at a medal this time", the coach said in a statement. 

Indian Team for the Games: 

Savita Punia (captain), Rajani Etimarpu, Deep Grace Ekka (vice-captain), Gurjit Kaur, Nikki Pradhan, Udita, Nisha, Sushila Chanu Pukhrambam, Monika Malik, Neha Goyal, Jyoti, Navjot Kaur, Salima Tete Vandana Katariya, Lalremsiami, Navneet Kaur, Sharmila Devi, and Sangita Kumari
