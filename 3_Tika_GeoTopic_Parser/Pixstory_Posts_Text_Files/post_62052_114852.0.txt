The conclusion to the elongated transfer saga of two wingers involving Barcelona is set to be finalised soon and Chelsea could benefit hugely from it.

As reported by The Mirror, Ousmane Dembele is on the brink of signing a new deal with the La Liga club after his last one expired at the end of June. Head coach Xavi is determined to secure the 25-year-old for next season but faces an internal battle with sporting director Mateu Alemany, who prefers Raphinha, with Barcelona keen to sign the Brazillian ahead of Chelsea this summer.

This tug of war between Xavi and Mateu may hamper Chelsea's chances at Dembele, as he might get Barca to resign him
