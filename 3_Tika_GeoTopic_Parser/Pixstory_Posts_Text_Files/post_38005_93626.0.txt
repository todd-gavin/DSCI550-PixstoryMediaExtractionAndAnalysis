Antonio Conte is a huge supporter of Romelu Lukaku. The Italian manager has worked with the Belgian striker at Inter Milan for the last two years. Hence he could bring Lukaku to the Spurs as well. 

During his time with Inter Milan, Romelu Lukaku scored 64 goals in 95 appearances for the Serie A club. The Belgian striker also helped Antonio Conte in winning the 2020/21 Serie A title before his unceremonious departure from the club. 

Romelu Lukaku followed Antonio Conte out of Inter Milan, eventually moving to Chelsea in the summer transfer window. But the Belgian striker has since failed to justify his £97 million price tag as he has been out of form for Chelsea.

The Belgian has scored just 12 goals in 36 appearances for Chelsea this season. Out of this, Lukaku has only scored 5 Premier League goals in 20 appearances for the Blues.

Romelu Lukaku's last Premier League start came against Crystal Palace on the 19th of February. Injuries and a loss of form have derailed the striker's season and have relegated him to the substitute's bench.

Paris Saint-Germain are also monitoring Romelu Lukaku for a summer swoop as per reports. Hence it has to be seen if the forward moves to Tottenham Hotspur if an opportunity arises.






Will Harry Kane leave in the summer? 


As stated earlier, Tottenham Hotspur's chances of signing Romelu Lukaku would depend on Harry Kane. The Spurs would only think about signing the Belgian if Kane decides to leave. 

Harry Kane was linked with Manchester City last summer. But the Spurs' owner Daniel Levy did not sanction the transfer. Owing to this the striker had to remain at the North London club. 

With the summer transfer window approaching, both Manchester United and Manchester City seem interested in the England captain. Hence it has to be seen if Harry Kane would finally leave Tottenham Hotspur in the summer
