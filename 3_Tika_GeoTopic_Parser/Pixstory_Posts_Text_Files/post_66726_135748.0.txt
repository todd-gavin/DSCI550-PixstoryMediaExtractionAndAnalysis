Situated in a slip of land jutting into the Sydney harbor, the Rocks is a famous historical area which was home to the Gadigal Aboriginal people once. It later became the first site in the country for European settlement. The name comes from the rugged rocky coast situated on the west side of the Sydney Cove. It was in the Sydney Cove that the European convicts pitched their first tents.
Presently, it includes more than a hundred heritage sites which are located on the narrow streets. Stroll around the cobbled streets and visit various cafes, souvenir shops, restaurants, contemporary and aboriginal art galleries to understand the place better.
Things to do: Visit the oldest surviving residence in Sydney built in the year 1816 and called the Cadmanâ€™s cottage, go to the Rocks Discovery Museum, take guided tours which will allow you to see the aboriginal heritage and also take you on ghost tours at night.
