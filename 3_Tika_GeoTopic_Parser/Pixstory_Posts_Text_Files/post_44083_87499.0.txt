In a Ghana Premier League match between Asante Kotoko and Bibiani Gold Stars, the assistant referee hilariously runs onto the pitch. The official was so engrossed in the drama that he forgot where he was supposed to be on the field.

The assistant referee grew so engaged in the game that he ended up closer to the penalty area than the touchline during Asante Kotoko's counterattack against Bibiani Goal Stars in the Ghana Premier League.

As Asante Kotoko scored the first of their five goals against Bibiani Gold Stars, the assistant referee looked more like a full-back than a match official, as he made a good overlapping move.

Because the work of a referee's helper can be a lonely one, as he is typically an unseen figure until you make an unpleasant judgement, we can't blame him for obtaining his moment in the spotlight by accident.
