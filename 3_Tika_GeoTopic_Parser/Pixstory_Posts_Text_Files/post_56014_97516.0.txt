Seems like the war is between US and Russia. We are struggling with inflation and here Congress passes a bill to lend weapons to Ukraine. Are they anyhow trying to stop the war? We have already sent billions of money and humanitarian aid to Ukraine? What else we can do to lend weapons or stop the war? 

The House on Thursday authorized the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022 by 417-10, after the Senate passed it by unanimous permission earlier this month. The lend-lease bill enables the president to lend or lease defence equipment to Ukraine for the years 2022 and 2023, and also slashes bureaucratic red tape to make sure equipment is delivered quickly. The legislation is named for the revival of a World War II-era program that helped supply allies in the fight against Nazi Germany. So are we expecting a WW3, we already did! Ukraine is said to be in desperate need of military assistance. Yes, but war could only bring disaster to both sides. UN reached this late into the issue and we must think about whether anyone is profiting from this as nobody tries to stop it.
