Man is the only species whose diet is not predictable The diet of all other animals is certain Their basic physical needs and their nature decides what they should eat and what they should not how much they should eat how much they should not when they should eat and when they should stop Osho But man is absolutely unpredictable he is absolutely uncertain Neither his nature tells him what he should eat nor his awareness tells him how much he should eat nor his understanding decides When he should stop eating As none of these qualities of man are predictable the life of man has gone in some very uncertain directions But if there is even a little understanding if man starts living with even a little intelligence With even a little thoughtfulness opening his eyes even a little then it is not at all difficult to change to a right diet It is very easy there can be nothing more easy
