Altroconsumo carried out a survey by interviewing some consumers registered on the ACmakers platform Altroconsumo project aimed at directly involving users who told what they really found on the shelves during their last shopping at supermarkets, hypermarkets and discount stores The survey shows that there are less available products than sooner but not at truly alarming levels. Among the less available basic necessities we find first of all the missing sunflower oil, in some cases corn oil and white flour. These are the products whose lack is most feared as there is a lot of talk about it in relation to the conflict, in reality, as regards corn and sunflower oil, we still have stocks while as regards white flour, Italian imports from Russia and Ukraine are really small and have little impact, it should be emphasized that the survey focuses on shelf availability of the products will in any case also need to continue to monitor the effects on the production scenario in the case of oil, for example, the use as an intermediate good must be taken into account The interviewees also did not find availability of fresh sea bass and fresh sea bream phenomenon probably due to the closure of fishing boats in recent weeks due to the high price of petrol. On the other hand, there are no shortages on the shelves for other products that could have been hoarded because they have a long shelf life and are therefore typically purchased by those who want to stock up in view of price increases or shortages
