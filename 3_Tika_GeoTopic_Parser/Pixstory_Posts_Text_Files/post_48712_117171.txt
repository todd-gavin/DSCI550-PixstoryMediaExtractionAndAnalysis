Internalized misogyny occurs when women project sexist views onto other women many times including themselves Women have been subtly degraded in our progressive society for the longest time particularly in the media This sets a dangerous precedent making it all the more difficult to see us pulling each other down Internalized misogyny might be difficult to spot We have numerous preconceived beliefs about how a woman should exist that arise from society expectations and gender conventions no matter how self reliant we think we are It s critical to be aware of this as well as your own thoughts and opinions not just about other women but also about yourself Remember women who are empowered are more likely to empower other women The notion that women may unconditionally support one another s success and exist as mutually empowered individuals challenges society s patriarchal hegemony As a result we re taught that the world is against us that women are catty and stir up drama when there s plenty of room for us to be entire without ripping each other apart We judge other women all the time What for To stay relevant to men and the standards they set for us Shallow standards We speak against sexual harrassment but also invalidate other women who re the victims of the same She could have worn something else This is why women should know self defense It was wrong but probably she shouldn t have acted like that etc etc etc We very well know the only one responsible for the rape is the rapist yet we somehow try to put that responsibility on the victim and end up shaming them instead A lot of women victimize themselves because of their internalized misogyny Self hate and low self esteem among them is one of the worst consequences of that We judge ourselves constantly we are too harsh with ourselves indulge in diet culture or modesty culture We refuse to wear what we want to wear because I am not like other girls It is time we dismantle the most powerful weapon patriarchy has against women internalized misogyny Because women together can change the world
