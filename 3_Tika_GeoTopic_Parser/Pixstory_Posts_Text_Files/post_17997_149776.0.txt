Harry Styles and Olivia Wilde were spotted kissing and hugging after a date night. They were seen hugging and cuddling outside Madison Square Garden in New York City. The singer closed out his 15-night residency at the famed NYC venue on Sept. 22. His monthlong "Love on Tour" run ended that night.
Olivia made sure to be there to show her support for her Don't Worry Darling co-star. The director was spotted wearing an all-white dress and a white feather boa as she danced and sang along to "Music for a Sushi Restaurant," a track from her boyfriend's latest album, Harry's House. 
Although Harry and Olivia—who have been together since 2021—have kept their relationship private, earlier this year, the Booksmart director opened up about their romance, saying that she is in a "really happy place" in her life at the moment. 
"I'm happier than I've ever been and I'm healthier than I've ever been," she told Vogue for their January cover. "And it's just wonderful to feel that."
