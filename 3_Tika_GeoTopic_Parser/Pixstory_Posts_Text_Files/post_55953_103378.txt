 NRA spent about m very much more than all the country s gun control advocacy groups put together in The source of NRA s funds is expected to be a large membership than any of those groups and uses its funds for things such as gun ranges and educational programmes The NRA officially spends about m per year to impact gun policy However that is only the known contributions to lawmakers and substantial sums are spent elsewhere independent contributions funds which are difficult to track It even has a grading system in which it grades members of Congress from A to F on their discerned friendliness to gun rights Those ratings can have a significant effect on poll numbers and even has the value of a pro gun control candidate s seat The NRA has bragged some high profile members over the years including late former President George HW Bush He resigned from the group in after Mr LaPierre referred to federal agents as jack booted thugs in the wake of a bombing attack on a government building in Oklahoma City Current members include former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and actors Tom Selleck and Whoopi Goldberg The NRA lobbies are against all forms of gun control and affirm that more guns make the country safer They staunchly defend a debatable rendition of the Second Amendment to the US Constitution which it contends gives US citizens the right to bear arms without any government oversight The association faced criticism in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting when Mr LaPierre said that the absence of an armed guard at the school was to blame for the tragedy They still use this statement for the recent elementary school tragedy Even when guns are the cause of violence They blame everything except the guns Guns did kill the children which is an unavoidable fact Even if everything hears can be justified use of guns can t be which they are trying to do
