It s time to say goodbye to Andrea Sta kov who next season will no longer play for Juventus Women Her last appearance in the black and white stripes saw her contribute to the historic milestone reached by the Bianconere last weekend with a clean sweep of domestic trophies That Italian Cup victory over Roma took Andrea s adventure full circle as her last two goals for Juve came in the same competition in the semi final second leg against Milan Andrea bids us goodbye having collected three league titles three Italian Super Cups and one Italian Cup in just three seasons at the club Thanks for everything Andrea and good luck for the future
