England 1-0 Austria. 68,871 attendance at Old Trafford. Lionesses hit the ground running with a win to open Euro 2022 and what a delight to finally get this party started. 

A far throw from Englandâ€™s best performance, but tonightâ€™s for enjoying the occasion and celebrating that record-breaking crowd. 

What a summer we have lined up. ðŸ¤©
