A 27-year-old transgender prisoner in New Jersey was recently transferred to an all-males prison after impregnating two female inmates in an all-females prison. Currently, he is serving a thirty-year term for manslaughter. 

Ironically, the American Civil Liberties Union, which was once aligned with the ideals of American freedoms but has since degenerated into an arm of liberalism, sued and reached a settlement with the corrections facility so that people could be housed based on their gender identity and not their biological sex.

Did no one think this through? Did they honestly not anticipate that persons with male genitalia would game the system and be housed among a group of women who haven't had sex in years? A transgender man would be a prize in a female prison, just as a transgender woman would be in a male prison. 

The ACLU's efforts to increase the liberties of a small percentage of New Jersey's population have resulted in the victimization of individuals, with far-reaching implications.
