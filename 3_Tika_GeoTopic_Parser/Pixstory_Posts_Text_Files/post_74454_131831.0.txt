Malaika married Bollywood actor-director-producer Arbaaz Khan in 1998. After being together for over 18 years, they announced separation in March 2016. The couple officially got divorced in May 2017. Together they have a son, Arhaan Khan.👨‍👩‍👦✅

Malaika Arora and Arbaaz Khan are trying to be the best parents for their son Arhaan Khan and we are damn sure the boy is aware of that. The son has seen his parent's journey and knows them better than the world and especially the so-called trollers. ❌❌❌

People might troll Malaika and Arbaaz for their relationship but apart from this their son has a equal respect for them. Both have both moved on in their lives. While Malaika is dating actor Arjun Kapoor, Arbaaz is dating model Giorgia Andriani. The two share amicable relationship and are often seen together with their 18-year-old son.❤️
The ex-couple was spotted at the airport last night as they were there to see off their son who studies abroad. ✅✅

This is what the social media users seem to be impressed by when they saw pictures of both Malaika and Arbaaz coming together to drop their son at the Mumbai airport on Wednesday night. Malaika's pet dog, Casper, also accompanied the mother-son duo😊😊😊😇

The star kid is pursuing his education in America and whenever he returns abroad from India, his parents make sure to see him off at the airport.✔️✔️✔️

Malaika was dressed in a blue-on-blue attire with shorts and oversized shirt, whereas Arbaaz was dressed in beige trousers and bottle green and cream shirt.💯💯😳

The trio were seen engaged in conversations, post which, Arhaan gave Malaika and Father Arbaaz a long hug as he left.✔️❤️
