It is one of the most adorable things about this ferocious animal Wolves are all levels of scary and dangerous enough that you absolutely would not want to become their prey They do not care if you re dead when they start feasting on you Many of their preys are still alive when they start eating them Definitely not how most would want death to welcome them But there is one thing about these beasts they are fiercely loyal to their pack and especially to their mates Wolves fall in love Now it s still debatable whether they do it like humans do but one thing as researchers say that they are confident when they say two wolves have a thing for each other it s at least a serious case of puppy love Wolves mate for life That means they only have one partner throughout their lives they are monogamous And even after mating unlike most animals who part their ways wolves tend to be affectionate towards their partners Their language of affection or for people who like to call it love is touching snuggling and cuddling A lot like dogs or humans They are ferociously protective of each other and mourn the loss if they lose them While they do eventually move on but if their mate die they tend to show great signs of distress and anxiety and become more aggressive which could be spoken as heartbreak
