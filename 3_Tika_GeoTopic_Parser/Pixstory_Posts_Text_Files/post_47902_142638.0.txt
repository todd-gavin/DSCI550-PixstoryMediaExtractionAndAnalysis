Chandigarh: In July this year, Delhi chief minister and national convener of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Arvind Kejriwal announced a plan to provide a cash incentive of Rs 2,500 per acre to the farmers in Punjab for not burning stubble in the upcoming paddy harvest season.
However, the plan to incentivise farmers was only a proposal submitted to the Commission of Air Quality Management.  
As per the proposal, the BJP-led centre was asked to contribute Rs 1,500 per acre while the remaining Rs 1,000 was to be equally shared by Punjab and Delhi governments.
As expected, the much-pubicised plan punctured last week after Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann announced that the centre has refused to commit necessary funds for incentivising farmers.
In a damage control exercise, Punjab Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal, in a statement released on September 11, announced to distribute 56,000 new subsidised machines under in-situ (with-in fields) management of stubble.
Lashing out at the Modi government for turning down the grant for the cash incentive scheme, Dhaliwal was confident that new stock of machines would reach small and marginal farmers.
In-situ machines, he believed, help farmers manage the stubble post paddy harvesting rather than putting it on fire.
This, as many studies and government data point out, has been the major cause of air pollution in the national capital, taking a toll on the health of millions before the onset of every winter. The rural and urban communities in Punjab are also not immune to this mess, studies too revealed. 
As Punjab reported 76,000 burning cases in 2021, a central body, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), revealed that the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s heavily polluted air touched a peak of 48% on November 7 last year.
