A Rs 4,700-crore plan is being evaluated, with the government abandoning the PPP (Public-Private-Partnership) model in favour of directly funding Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contracts.

The most recent strategy is renovating the station complex in accordance with an approved design and the Master Plan for the railway's main station. According to reports, the commercial development of areas surrounding the station will be undertaken subsequently using the PPP model, which will be based on values governing the real-estate development pitch.

To hasten the rebuilding of New Delhi Railway Station, which is the national transporter's largest such project, the government is expected to delink the station complex's construction from the commercial development of property surrounding it.

In the eastern suburbs, a civic authority intends to rehabilitate existing bridges and widen new ones.

The first idea was thought to be capital-intensive, with private players monetising the land and using the profits to construct the station complex. The goal was to have a renovated station without spending any money from the government. However, this strategy proved to have flaws, particularly because the real estate sector did not show a similar hunger for investment.

The six-story station structure was designed as a modern landmark in Delhi, featuring two characteristic domes. Commercial monetisation and revitalization of the surrounding areas, as outlined in the Master Plan, will be handled separately. On railway land, it contains sites that are today railway colonies, offices, inner roadways next to Connaught Place, and the Karnail Singh stadium.

Apart from key stations like New Delhi's and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, the Railways has decided to rehabilitate 50 stations across India using the EPC model rather than the PPP approach, with a budget of roughly Rs 17,500 crore â€” omitting the amount being evaluated for New Delhi.
