Use of cyberspace, i.e. computer, internet, cellphone, other technical devices, etc., to commit a crime by an individual or organized group is called cyber-crime. Hacking and Identity Theft are common ways of piercing the defenses of protected computer systems and interfering with their functioning. Let us look at some tips to avoid cyber-crime-

1. Create Strong Passwords: Make your password at least 12 characters long, include numbers, symbols capital letters and avoid patterns like "123456".

2. Practise Password hygiene: Do not share your password... with anyone! change it on a
regular 90-day basis and, where possible, avoid using the same security questions across multiple sites.

3. Keep your devices secure: Apply encryption to PCs and USB devices and encourage others to keep their devices with them. Enable "Auto Update" across Microsoft Windows-based devices and common 3rd-party add-ons such as Acrobat, Java, and Flash - as these are common malware infection vectors

4. Keep your inbox safe: Enable email scanning by your anti-virus, don't trust attachments, disable automatic previewing, and never respond to email requests for personal or company account information.
