You can t heal in the place you got hurt One of the most difficult experiences in life is that unless you break the cycle unless you remove yourself from a situation or environment where you have been hurt you will most likely continue to be hurt And turning the page is extremely difficult because it implies understanding and accepting that letting go of someone means that while they may have been a part of your history they do not have to be a part of your destiny Murakami once said Pain is unavoidable but suffering is optional And the longer you stay in a situation where you are the one who is getting hurt the more difficult it is to heal and the more you suffer So as Sartre the existentialist philosopher put it life isn t just what others do to you it s what you do with what others do to you And the sooner you realize this the sooner you can start healing It s difficult to heal where you got sick
