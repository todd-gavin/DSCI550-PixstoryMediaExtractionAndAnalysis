Via Salvatori has been completely in the dark for months And we have been pointing this fact out for months Well last night we were robbed on this street Victim of the robbery that took place in Viareggio the Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc and the post was written on social media by his personal trainer who at that time moment was with him The two were allegedly approached by a man who, posing as a fan, asked to be able to take a selfie His goal was not to take a photo with the current leader in the World Championship standings but rather his expensive watch which, after having snatched from his arm he was taken away and fled For Leclerc and his friend there was nothing left but to call the carabinieri and report the incident
