This stained glass artwork at Victoria memorial hall I took on my outing reminded me of what I had learned back in my history classes Stained glass artwork has existed for thousands of years Ancient Romans and Egyptians made objects out of coloured glass However stained glasses gained popularity in the middle ages The tradition of using stained glasses in buildings continued through the gothic and classical periods However during the Reformation period in Europe much of the traditional methods of this artwork was lost The artwork was revived during the th century when many of the churches started being built in the gothic style Despite having such a turbulent history stained glasses are culturally prominent Sometimes they were used only for decorative aesthetic purposes but most of them contained biblical narratives and literary stories for the unlettered public to understand Sunlight illuminated the artworks during the daytime for people inside the churches When candle lights illuminated the church or cathedrals in the evenings these illuminated stories came to life for people outside I can only imagine witnessing such magnificence if I lived way back in time In any case stained glasswork is the reason I started with glass painting I shall share some of my works in the future But if there s anything like an effective stressbuster it d be imprinting stories on pieces of glass
