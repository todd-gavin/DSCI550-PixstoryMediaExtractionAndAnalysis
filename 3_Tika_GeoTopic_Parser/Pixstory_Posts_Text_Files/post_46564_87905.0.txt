This game season is going to be very exciting according to me! Major League Baseball has added 30 doubleheaders to make up for the 91 games that were postponed due to the lockout, which pushed the start date out to April 7. 

MLB announced a new schedule on Wednesday, extending the regular season's end date by three days to October 5. The New York Yankees will face the Boston Red Sox in the first game of the season at 1:05 p.m., the first time the rivals have met in a major league opener since 2005. 

U.S News reported that five games have been rescheduled for July 21, the day following the All-Star Game. The only game on the original schedule announced last August 4 is a doubleheader with the Yankees at Houston and Detroit at Oakland, as well as a single game with Texas at Miami. 

On May 10, the Tigers and Athletics will play an unusual doubleheader at Comerica Park, with Oakland hosting the first game to make up for a game missed on April 4 and Detroit hosting the nightcap to make up for a game missed on May 10. 

Because the Tigers have a doubleheader at Oakland on July 21, the sole doubleheader on the original schedule, a day-night matchup between the Twins and Tigers in Detroit on July 23, has been reduced to a single game.
