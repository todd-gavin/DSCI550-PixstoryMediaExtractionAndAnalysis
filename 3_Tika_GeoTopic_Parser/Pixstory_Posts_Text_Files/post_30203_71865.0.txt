Who doesn’t love love? A sweet, humorous, and charming romance is something everyone loves. The anime rom-com style is exactly what it sounds like: romantic comedy. It is about discovering love, friendships, sweet memories. There will be comical misunderstandings along the way that lead to unexpected situations and keep the story going. Despite the minor mishaps, I love rom-com. It’s my favorite anime genre.

This is a genre I love so I thought I’d compile the best rom com anime into a single easy-to-search list. This list is suitable for anyone who has seen shonen mangas like Naruto or One piece. Although this anime genre is different from many other genres, it still has something to offer everyone. You can also find many other options. You can skip to the next one if you don’t love it.

1)My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU!
2) Ouran High School Host Club
3)Saekano: How to Raise a Boring Girlfriend

4) My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!
