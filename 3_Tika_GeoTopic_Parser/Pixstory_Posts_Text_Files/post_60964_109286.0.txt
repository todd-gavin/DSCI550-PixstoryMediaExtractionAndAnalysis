Edita is one of my classmates in college. She is a sister from Ukraine who came to Bangalore to pursue a B.A. in Mass Communication, English, and Psychology. She is one of the most hilarious, sweetest, and kindest people I have met. Initially, it was a bit difficult for us to understand her because of her heavy accent and the language barrier, but she has improved so much across our college years, and we also caught up with the accent. She brings a different life and spirit to the class, interacts and talks with everyone, even the strict teachers, and cracks us up with her witty humor and jokes. It's always fun to hang out with her.
