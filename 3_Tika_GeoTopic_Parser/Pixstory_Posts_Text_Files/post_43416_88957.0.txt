With the controversial film - The Kashmir files, Vivek Agnihotri has become the BJP’s favourite filmmaker as his film’s messages and portrayal tune with the party’s own , last week prime minister narendra Modi joined the list of the BJP leaders who have promoted the movie. 
In the past few weeks since the movie got released, multiple videos have emerged from the movie theatres of aggressive men inciting physical violence and calling for the boycott of Muslims. The film has not only manipulated the truth , it had cherry – picked the truth and has exploited the truth devolving into a piece of pure vitriol and hatred.
The film is about the exodus of Kashmiri pandits from the state after terrorists began targeting the community after militancy broke out in the 1989. The total number of those who killed varied according to research by different groups, with the Kashmiri pandit sangharsh samiti saying 399 were killed from 1990 to 2011, 7% of them in the first year itself. Since then the total has gone up to 655. Other estimates range 700 to over 1300. 
The film suggests that many more died and blame the exodus on The congress , Muslims , liberals, and the beauty of our country -secularism. The film showed that the exodus happened in the congress governance, it was the governor’s rule in the 1990 in J&K , at the centre it was the BJP backer government headed by V.P Singh.
Besides , the film does not provide any historical context and suggests that had the article 370 been removed , as it was in 2019 by the BJP government , the exodus and killings would have never taken place.
Although the movie had a good potential of telling the truth and bringing people together and heal what has happened to both the communities of Kashmir Instead it is based on the idea that all Muslims must be collectively punished for this and any violence visited upon them is well deserved.
