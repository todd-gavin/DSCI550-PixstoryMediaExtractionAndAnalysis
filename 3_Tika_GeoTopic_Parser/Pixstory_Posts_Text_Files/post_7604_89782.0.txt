All paths have faded,
Time feels like a lost quest,
Seeping through the ancient ruins,
Of my guilt-ridden heart.

To ponder upon the future,
There should've been a past,
Which has already been repressed,
To keep me alive in the present,

Trying to live in the moment,
The existence of which seems farce,
I try to survive this second,
It betrays me as those eyes once did.

Every delusion feels real,
I sense all of them are close by,
Only my soul has gone far away,
To the distant lands of loneliness,

Where its the prisoner of Time,
The hollowness that followed,
Doesn't let me fly away,
To the dawn of my desires,

The sun doesn't set upon me,
It sets upon my dreams,
Bit by bit everything vanishes,
Only me desire to hope lingers on.

Every reason seems empty,
Hope may never die,
As it exists to see me suffer,
As I fail to grasp her love.

I haven't dreamed in ages,
I just lay awake stargazing,
My stars that never aligned,
And the lines that never met.

I failed to determine,
Where I lost my way,
It started somewhere with her,
But all along it was my fault,

As she came near my soul,
Time flowed past my sins,
Turned my love into hope,
Then swept it all away as the night passed.
