Paris Saint-Germain are closing in on the signing of Porto midfielder Vitinha and could now follow that up by moving for Lille's Renato Sanches, reports Foot Mercato.

AC Milan have been strongly linked with Sanches for months as they aim to bring in somebody to replace Barcelona-bound Franck Kessie, but it seems there is now a possibility the Scudetto winners could miss out on the Portugal international.

Even so, they still have the advantage as they have come to an agreement with the 24-year-old, although they have so far only offered €15m to Lille, well short of the Ligue 1's club reported fee of €30m.

So the financial aspect could play into the hands of PSG, as they have the finances to meet Lille's demands, while Milan are unable to make any large offers until July due to their recent takeover.

PSG could use this short period to overtake Milan, as they are ready to match the asking price set by Lille.

If Luis Campos was able to complete a deal and bring Sanches to the Parc des Princes, it would be seen as a big move for the club.

This is not just because they would have beaten the Serie A champions to sign a player they had held a long-term interest in, but also because midfield is an area PSG are keen to strengthen.
