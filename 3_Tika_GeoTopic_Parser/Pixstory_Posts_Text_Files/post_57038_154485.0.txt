The death of a loved one: The loss of a family member or close friend can be one of the most difficult losses a person will face. In many cases, people must also cope with many decisions related to the loss, including making funeral arrangements and dealing with finances as they grapple with intense feelings of grief and sadness. 
Anticipatory grief: This type of bereavement may occur when a loved one is dying. While the person is not gone yet, loved ones may still experience feelings of grief, including sadness and anger, as they prepare for the loss of their loved one.
The loss of a beloved pet: Losing an animal companion can also trigger a bereavement period. It can be a difficult transition, and many people may struggle with feelings of deep sadness.
Miscarriage: The loss of a pregnancy can also lead to feelings of grief and a period of bereavement. 
A loss due to suicide: When someone dies by suicide, loved ones may be left struggling with feelings of shock and guilt. Because suicide is sometimes accompanied by stigma, grieving people may feel particularly isolated and unsupported.
A change in health status: The onset of a chronic illness or a sudden change in a personâ€™s health status can also lead to feelings of bereavement. People may experience sensations of fear, anger, anxiety, regret, and mourning as they face the new challenges presented by their condition.
