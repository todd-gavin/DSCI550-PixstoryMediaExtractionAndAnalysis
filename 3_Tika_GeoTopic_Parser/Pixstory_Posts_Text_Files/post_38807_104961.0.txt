No opponent can dispossess him that easily. He is also decent in the air as he has won 70% of aerial duels mainly in the middle third.

The midfielder has popped in with 3 goals this season, One was from a free-kick where he popped in from the corner post despite the keeper saving it, he hit it on the rebound. Another goal was from outside the box where he let out a screamer. The third goal was where he used his height to score a headed goal from the corner kick. He is a goal threat from set-pieces, as he usually uses his height and physical strength to create goal-scoring chances.

Palhinha is also linked with Manchester United due to his connection with Man Utd stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes. Palhinha’s interest is strong, and he is a defensive midfielder too. He will sit well in the United squad too with Cristiano Ronaldo, Bruno Fernandes, Diego Dalot, and Fred all there to help him overcome the language barrier and get to know Man United.
