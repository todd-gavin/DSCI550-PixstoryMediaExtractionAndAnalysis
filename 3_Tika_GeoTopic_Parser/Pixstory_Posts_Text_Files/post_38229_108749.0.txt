Raheem Sterling has been an integral part of two English superpowers, Manchester City and Liverpool over the years. Chelsea are now said to be Super interested as they are looking to sign the England international this summer. 

Chelsea have had a massive change in their ownership. The Blues are now under Todd Boehly after the 19-year tenure of Roman Abramovich ended on a sour note due to the Russia-Ukraine war. 

The Todd Boehly-led consortium won the bidding process to acquire Chelsea last month. The American businessman reportedly wants to start on the right foot. For this, Boehly is looking to fund heavily in the transfer window as he expects to sign multiple players in the summer. 

One such player that has caught Chelsea's eye is Raheem Sterling. The England international is currently part of the Premier League Champions, Manchester City.


 Chelsea have already made a £25m bid for Sterling but this was rejected by the Sky Blues' management. City reportedly want around £60m for the Sterling but Chelsea are looking to seal the deal for around £40-45m. 

As per the Athletic, "It is understood that Sterling has been talking to people about what life is like at Chelsea and what Thomas Tuchel is like as a manager, and one source at the club believes the only stumbling block to a deal being completed is the size of the fee."

Hence with more than two months remaining, it has to be seen if Raheem Sterling can complete a move to Chelsea in the coming months.
