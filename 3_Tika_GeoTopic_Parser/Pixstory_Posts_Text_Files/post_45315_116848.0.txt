After days of anticipation, Manchester United have finally completed the signing of Argentine
defender Lisandro Martinez from Ajax Amsterdam. Despite the dutch club’s constant attempts of
keeping Lisandro for at least one more season, the player had been pushing for a move to the
Premier League and his dream has finally been realised.

Lisandro Martinez was earlier being linked to Arsenal and in fact, the Gunners had made a great
deal of progress in their talks with the player. However, Manchester United swooped in at the
final moment to break the deal and ever since then, Martinez had been more inclined towards
joining Old Trafford.

The 24-year-old defender has signed until 2027 and Manchester United will be paying a full
package of €55 Million to Ajax for him. This makes Lisandro Martinez the costliest Argentine
defender ever and the second costliest defender in Manchester United’s history.

Like Lionel Messi, Lisandro Martinez is also a Newell’s Boys academy product. He was signed
by Ajax in July 2019 and he gradually rose through the ranks to become one of their main
defenders. He was particularly elemental and one of the most pivotal players in their 2021-22
season and it was his performance in this season that brought him suitors from all over Europe.

Martinez was one of the hottest assets in this transfer window.

“Manchester United is delighted to announce the club has reached an agreement with Ajax for
the transfer of Argentine international defender Lisandro Martinez, subject to medical, to player
terms being finalised, and to UK visa requirements,” Manchester United wrote in their official
statement announcing Lisandro Martinez’s signing.

Lisandro Martinez will also play a crucial role in Argentina’s squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
As we know, the La Albiceleste are one of the favourites to win the World Cup this year and
Martinez will definitely be a part of it.
