Midfielders don’t often hit the headlines, but it’s their brilliance with the ball in the middle of the pitch that helps forwards transcend into match-winners. With so much importance given to statistics these days, the charisma and flair of these midfield marshals go unnoticed. Attacking midfielders give you a chunk of goals and assists, whereas holding or defending midfielders give the team stability to move the ball around. So here are the best 10 midfielders, in my opinion, who were the best of the lot in the previous 2 decades. 

1. Kaka

The Brazilian maestro was one among handful of people who lifted the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Champions League and the Ballon d’Or. The fact that he achieved these laurels as a midfielder is further commendable. He was undoubtedly the best player in the star-studded AC Milan team of the mid-2000s and has etched his name in golden colours.


2. Xavi

The current Barcelona coach, was one of their all-time greats. He played a pivotal role in Spain’s solitary World Cup triumph in 2010. Xavi played a record 767 matches for the Catalans, which was only broken by Lionel Messi in 2021. In his 17 years at the club, he won 8 La Liga and 4 Champions League titles.


3. Luka Modric

Modric was one of those rare midfielders who lay their hands on the Ballon d’Or. He captained the Croatian team and inspired them to the final of the 2018 World Cup. The 36-year-old who plays for Real Madrid has won 4 Champions League with the team, including 3 in a row from 2015-16 to 2017-18 and was in the squad of the year in all 3 seasons.


4. Kevin de Bruyne

Though the Belgian has not won trophies for his national team, his club team’s dominance in his presence has been immaculate. Manchester City are a force to reckon with in the Premier League for the past few years and Kevin de Bruyne is the integral part in the team. The versatility in the positions he plays, gives Pep Guardiola the luxury to organize the team around him.
