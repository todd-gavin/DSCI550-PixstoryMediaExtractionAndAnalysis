Even though it's sometimes misinterpreted, manifestation is the ability of a regular person to employ focused energy to bring about a material change in their world. The human mind is the source of this energy, and quantum physics has experimentally demonstrated its effects. Simply said, energy is the capacity to bring about change. This is a universal truth that our sun and the tiniest atomic particle both demonstrate every day. Thought is energy when it is formed in the human mind. When we focus our thoughts, we direct more energy into the goal of achieving the desired outcome. Would it surprise you to hear that this focused mental energy could have effects beyond the purview of the physical mind?
