The Bollywood music industry is not doing well these days The Industry that was filled with creative and talented artists that produced hit chart busters is now a recycling factory which churns out remakes In these times here are some movies which have beautiful and soulful music but sadly they are ignored Taalash the answer lies within Music director Ram Sampath Muskaanein jhooti hain is my personal favourite Laila Majnu Music by Niladri Kumar Joi Barua Atif Aslam Hitesh Sonik All the songs in the movie are wonderful Fitoor Music by Amit Trivedi Hitesh Sonik This film has beautiful cinematography and the music really adds to the screenplay I love all the songs from this film
