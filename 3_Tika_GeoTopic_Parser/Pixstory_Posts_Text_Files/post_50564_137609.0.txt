As a baby is gradually weaned from the breast or bottle and new solids are introduced, there may be reduced body stores of iron. To mantain body storez, do these-
👉Give your baby foods that are rich in iron and zinc, such as iron-enriched infant cereals, pureed meats and poultry dishes
Iron-enriched rice-based cereals are frequently recommended as the first food to be introduced, as there is the additional benefit of a lower risk of an allergic reaction.
👉Foods can be introduced in any order, provided the texture is suitable for your baby’s stage of development. Foods range from fruits and vegetables (for vitamin and mineral content) to meat, poultry, fish and whole eggs.
👉Do not add salt, sugar or honey to your baby’s food. It is unnecessary.
👉Avoid cow’s milk as a drink in the first 12 months. Small amounts can be used in cereals and custards. All milk used should be pasteurised.
👉Whole fruit is preferable to fruit juice. Avoid juices and sugar sweetened drinks.
👉Put your baby to bed without a bottle, or take the bottle away when they have finished feeding to minimise long-term exposure of their teeth to sugar containing liquids.
👉Avoid whole nuts, seeds or similar hard foods to reduce the risk of choking.
👉Introduce foods one at a time. Offer new foods once every 3 to 4 days to avoid confusion and to rule out food allergy and sensitivity.
👉Feed babies during any illness and feed up after illness. Give ample liquids if your baby has diarrhoea.
