It may not have sunk in yet, but the country has sunk — quite literally — thanks to the pouring heavens.
The deluge for the ages isn’t a solo calamity. It is running parallel to the year-long hostilities out of the political arena where things have escalated to the point where a former prime minister is facing a terrorism charge.
And long before both the deluge and the political crisis were giving us sleepless nights, there existed the monster of an economic turmoil that still lurks in the background.
For a country mired in three totally different but equally scary kinds of crises, it must take a truly special and mesmerising distraction to take their mind off.
Cricket Hungry Nations
The spirit of cricket rules the people of Pakistan and India like nothing else. On the day of the match, schedules are cleared, work days are cut short, phones are turned off — all to not miss a single ball.
Passionate fans flock at screen points and dominate spaces in either green or blue, depending on which side of the border you look. This week should be no different. Watch them relish the pains and pleasures of making it in time at a jam-packed Dubai stadium and declare the entire evening a de-facto holiday.
The festivities
It is worth pointing out that every Indo-Pak fixture is a festival in itself, and Sunday’s fixture will be no exception. Watch entire neighbourhoods and localities get pulled together for an evening to root for national stars: from the terrific Rizwan and young speedsters to the likes of Kohli, Yadav, Sharma — you name it.
Seventy-five years of rivalry is quite a sight to take in. In cricket, that rivalry is complete with a multigenerational focus on what it means to secure this “must-win” fixture.
