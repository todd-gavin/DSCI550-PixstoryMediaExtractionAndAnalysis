The match between Spain U-17 and Mexico U-17 at the U-17 Women's World Cup was brilliant. It was end to end stuff both teams had shots in the double digits. Spain had 14 and Mexico had 20. Spain had 64% of possession while Spain had 36%. It was clear that Mexico were playing on the counter and Spain as usual went with their possession based tactic.  Mexico at the end were the better side and won the match at the very end.
Maribel Flores first gave Mexico the lead at the 47th minute. Then Judit Pujols of Spain scored the equaliser at the 74th minute. Finally, Montserrat Saldivar scored the winner for Mexico at the 85th minute. It was an amazing game of football which went down to the wire. Group C now has all teams with equal points, just goal difference seperates them slightly. Colombia is at the top, Mexico is at 2nd, Spain at 3rd and China at the bottom. This group will  be decided on the final match day of the group.
