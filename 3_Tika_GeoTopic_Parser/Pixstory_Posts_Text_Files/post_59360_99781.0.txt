There are many stages in life when we feel down, alone, and everyone is against us, and there is no one to guide us or talk about it. So at that time, how should we handle it, or how should we deal with it?

Competing with the universe is an obtuse thing to do. It is not a competition in which you must participate. I versus the universe is a bad competition to get into. So this is why I started doing yoga Yoga does not mean twisting and turning your body. The word yoga means union. Right now, it's me versus the universe; this is not the reality

Most people carry a huge amount of baggage on their heads as if they are carrying the entire universe on their heads.

I want to ask the world, do they have proof that we are not already in heaven and that we are ruining everything?

The answer is yes, simply because you don't even learn to manage your basic thinking and emotional faculties. That's why it's important to ask yourself, when will you learn to manage my thoughts, how to handle my body, how to handle my chemistry When are you going to figure this out at the end of your life?

People should understand that they are not suffering in their life. Instead, they are having the privilege of being human. We have these two fantastic faculties. The first is that we have a keen sense of memory. It is because of this memory that our life is so rich that it is unlike any other creature and that we have a fantastic sense of imagination. Now, this is what you suffer, what happened ten years ago, you can still suffer, why?

Therefore, at the phase of adulthood in my life, I want all the young people out there to give time to figure out a few things about themselves, if you don't know how, God has given them the tools to figure out this machine because in our life many issues will come, more issues come up in our life means you are living a more active life.
