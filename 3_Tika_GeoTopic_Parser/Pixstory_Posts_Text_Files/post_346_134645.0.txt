My father @Sureshpe bought a television in 1994 to watch the World Cup football. Earliest memories were that of Maradona dribbling through the opponents. I am not sure was it the Maradona craze or the beautiful jersey that attracted me to the team. Year after Year I prayed for my favorite team. The 26 consecutive passes in 2006, Oh… i thought then, this is it! This is the year! I was awaiting my sisters admission to my college, I am unsure which one was more tense- her future or the penalty shots. We might have lost that day, a game well played, after all we lost to the champions! But there was a promise, Messi. He brought us close in 2014. I quietly retired to the bed and I remember @peekayty coming to me and saying it’s okay, it’s a game! 2022 is year of hope and Messi . I am hopeful :)
