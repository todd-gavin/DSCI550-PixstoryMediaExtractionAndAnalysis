The interesting thing is the way Tony Montana stays in the memory taking on the dimensions of a real tortured person Most thrillers use interchangeable characters and most gangster movies are more interested in action than personality but Scarface is one of those special movies like The Godfather that is willing to take a flawed evil man and allow him to be human Maybe it s no coincidence that Montana is played by Al Pacino the same actor who played Michael Corleone That s because it sees its criminal so clearly as a person with a popular product to sell working in a society that wants to buy In the old days it was booze For the Corleones it was gambling and prostitution Now it s cocaine The message for the dealer remains the same Only a fool gets hooked on his own goods For Tony Montana the choices seem simple at first He can work hard be honest and make a humble wage as a dishwasher Or he can work for organized crime make himself more vicious than his competitors and get the big cars the beautiful women and the boot licking attention from nightclub doormen He doesn t wash many dishes Scarface understands this criminal personality with its links between laziness and ruthlessness grandiosity and low self esteem pipe dreams and a chronic inability to be happy It s also an exciting crime picture in the tradition of the movie And like the Godfather movies it s a gallery of wonderful supporting performances Steven Bauer as a sidekick Michelle Pfeiffer as a woman whose need for drugs leads her from one wrong lover to another Robert Loggia as a mob boss who isn t quite vicious enough and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Pacino s kid sister who wants the right to self destruct in the manner of her own choosing These are the people Tony Montana deserves in his life and Scarface is a wonderful portrait of a real louse
