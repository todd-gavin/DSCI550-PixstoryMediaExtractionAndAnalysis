Black holes have been discovered throughout our galaxy and elsewhere in the universe Black holes are generally regions of space where the gravitational pull is very high so that even light can t escape from it Time slows down near a black hole due to the extremely strong gravitational field of the black hole According to the theory of general relativity this phenomenon is due to the gravity of the black hole curving spacetime in a way that affects all measurements of time and space near the black hole Inside a black hole is where the real mystery lies According to Einstein s theory time and space in a way trade places inside the hole Inside the black hole the flow of time itself draws falling objects into the center of the black hole No force in the universe can stop this fall any more than we can stop the flow of time At the very center of the black hole is where our understanding breaks down Einstein s theory of gravity seems to predict that time itself is destroyed at the center of the hole time comes to an abrupt end there For this reason a black hole is sometimes described as the reverse of creation But no one knows how or why time could come to an abrupt end any more than we know how time was created in the first place Einstein s theory of gravity no longer applies at these tiniest scales of distance and new laws of nature must be found that describe what happens at the center of a black hole
