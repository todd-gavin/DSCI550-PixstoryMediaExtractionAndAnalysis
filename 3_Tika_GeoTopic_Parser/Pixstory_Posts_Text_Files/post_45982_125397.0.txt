Firstly, who drinks wine for health benefits? There are plenty of food options if you want to eat healthy. Drinking wine is an experience that depends on taste! 

As per usual wines, the flavours of white wine are frequently more tangy than those of red wines. Consider citrus, recently cut grass, stone fruits, and fragrant floral undertones. White wine can be drink if we prefer stronger flavours. 

White wines are also a great option if we want our drinks a little colder—perhaps a cool summer glass. You just need to learn more about how to store and serve wine properly.

But that doesn’t mean white wine does not have health benefits!

White wine is the ideal option if you need a low-sugar wine for health or lifestyle reasons. 

Dry white whites are the best option if you have diabetes, adhere to the keto diet, or simply want to minimise your sugar intake because they naturally contain less sugar than their red cousins. 

And Brut is a great option for white wines. This bone-dry, sparkling white wine has a clean, crisp flavour. This brut has undertones of lemon and elderflower and is created from white grapes grown at award-winning vineyards in Napa and Switzerland! 

So which wine do prefer?
