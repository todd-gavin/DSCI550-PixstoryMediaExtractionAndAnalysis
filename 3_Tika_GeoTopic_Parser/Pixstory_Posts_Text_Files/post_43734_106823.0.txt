Diogo Dalot might fill in the boots for Aaron Wan Bissaka if the club decides to play three at the back.


Jurien Timber will get the games under his belt in the domestic competitions and Europa League under the tutelage of Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford.  


Midfielders: Fred, Frenkie de Jong, Bruno Fernandes


With the departure of Nemanja Matic, Juan Mata, Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard, Manchester United desperately need a midfielder who can not only break the lines but also be able to ensure calmness in the midfield. Considering his form under Erik ten Hag, Frenkie de Jong will be crucial for Manchester United's midfield. 


Bruno Fernandes has been phenomenal for Manchester United ever since his arrival despite the blip in the second half of the season. He will be a starter under Erik ten Hag. Amongst the other options available, Fred can get a nod ahead of Scott McTominay and Donny van de Beek in the 2022/23 season. 


Forwards: Jadon Sancho, Antony, Cristiano Ronaldo 


Though there are still doubts over Mason Greenwood’s availability, Manchester United are heavily stacked in the attack with Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Cristiano Ronaldo available. Alejandro Garnacho is also looking to break through from the academy to fill the ST role at Old Trafford. Amidst these, if Manchester United sign Antony from Ajax, they would form a formidable attack. 


Considering the form, Jadon Sancho will start on the left whereas Antony will play on the right flank. Cristiano Ronaldo will again spearhead the attack for Manchester United. 


Bench: Marcus Rashford, Tom Heaton (GK), Victor Lindelof, Jurien Timber, Anthony Martial, Alejandro Garnacho, Scott McTominay, Anthony Elanga, Hannibal Mejbri
