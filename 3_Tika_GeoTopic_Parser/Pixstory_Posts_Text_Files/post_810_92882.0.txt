There can’t be a single student of Prof Abraham Joseph (AJ) who does not have a fond memory of him. AJ sir who died last Friday, was immensely talented and hugely popular, yet never shied away from speaking his mind.   

He could have risen higher, but he preferred keeping his feet on the ground and disliked some strings that power and position often bring along.   

He was 60. 

AJ was a vibrant student leader, amazing teacher, engaging quiz master and a writer. AJ wore many hats—all of them unassumingly.  I have learnt many lessons from AJ.  

As it ought to have been with great teachers, almost all of them came from outside the classroom.  

Since I too dabbled in student politics, he used to tell me many things about leadership. “Look at the eyes of the students and speak. That’s the first step to win confidence and trust.”  

He used to write down some thoughts using a Rotomac turquoise blue pen. “Prepare before you speak or write,” he used to tell me, especially after offering a ride in his blue Maruti Omni van. I realized what he meant once after I saw him interview Kiran Bedi for All India Radio. “As an icon of youth and a beacon of hope.....” I still remember some of his questions.  

Once after the selection of Kerala University for the national model parliament competition, first in a decade, he gave me a hug and said: “Good preparation to have come this far, but to go thus far, you need to do more.”  

Once he excused himself from giving a welcome speech at a function, saying that he prefers students to do the honours. On prodding, he later told me that he didn’t want to praise someone, which is a norm in such speeches, because he felt no genuine need for that. AJ stories, all of his students will tell you, are never ending.  

AJ used to say, wherever you go take a slice of Bethany Hills (hill in which Mar Ivanios College sits). He certainly has taken one with him to the other world. Rest in Peace, AJ sir.
