Lemon is a great fruit. Rich in vitamins, anti-oxidants and all kinds of nutrients. It's incredibly good for your skin too.

Then why not put it on your face?

The answer is simple, it will irritate your skin. It's good to add lemons in your skincare but most people do it wrong. Never apply lemon juice on your skin directly, and repeat after me â€“ NEVER. 

It will cause your skin to act up, irritating it and damaging your tissues. Lemon is too acidic for our delicate skin. One thing you especially have to keep in mind is to never rub it on your face, no matter how much those YouTube videos tell you to.

The right way to add lemon to your skincare is, obviously, one, by eating it. Consuming lemon is not only good for your skin but is great for your gut health as well. It also makes you more active and helps against laziness.

If you want to put it on your skin, always dilute it with other ingredients. Water, yogurt, honey, aloevera, egg etc. That way, it's extremely beneficial for your skin. Not to mention, the extra goodies from the other ingredients you use!
