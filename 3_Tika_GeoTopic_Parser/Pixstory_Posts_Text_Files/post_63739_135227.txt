For those who do not know who they are Black Veil Brides are a sort of copycat version of Motley Crue mixed with Avenged Sevenfold and emo and with neither the attitude or spirit of either of the two They are known for their gothic androgynous make up tight black clothes and hairstyle all inspired in a sort of emo gothic tribute to early glam metal bands like KISS Dokken and Motley Crue The band is actively one of the most hated bands in the hard rock heavy metal community but do they deserve the hate To be honest it is a bit of a tough question because while at first glance it is very easy to hate them they have a good vocalist and great instrumentalists with some real talent over their instruments Perhaps where the band lacks is in terms of originality Their material is extremely substandard all the way over from their debut to their current selves While they may have changed a bit changing styles from metalcore to a more standard hard rock heavy metal style their music is incredibly dull and perhaps that is why they have rightfully earned that hate It would seem that no matter how much they change it up there really is not much to them On the other hand they know how to write some good hooks which can quickly grab your attention and also pack some really good sense of melody doing a pretty good mix of hard rock with some melodic pop hooks so they have that going for them To add to that they have some pretty good riffs bass and drumming so that is also a plus point Finally a band s fanbase is not reason enough to detest them but most Black Veil Brides fans are absolutely incorrigible emo fanatics it is a challenge to not punch them in the face they are about as horrible as Tool fans Ultimately all art is subjective and Black Veil Brides is incredibly generic stylistically limited and not too original they have their musical direction quite well figured out leading to them producing some pretty enjoyable tunes from time to time
