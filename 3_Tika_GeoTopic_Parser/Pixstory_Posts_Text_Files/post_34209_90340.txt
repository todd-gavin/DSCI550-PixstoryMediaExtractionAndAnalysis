After the home knockout against North Macedonia, the blue captain Giorgio Chiellini spoke to Rai Sport microphones It&#39;s difficult to explain It&#39;s a great disappointment Even today we had a great game where we failed to score We weren&#39;t presumptuous We certainly missed something We made some mistakes from September until today and we paid for them I am proud of this team obviously we are disappointed and destroyed We have to start again It is difficult to comment immediately A great void will remain and I hope this void can give us that energy to restart We have to restart to win again and return to the top of the European Championships and in four years go to the World Cup We had chances We missed the starting point We arrived there also well I have nothing to attribute to this group I think we should play the next one too Not the time to say if it was mine last game
