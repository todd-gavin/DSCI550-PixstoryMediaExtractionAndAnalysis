Today is also birth annniversary of Shailendra. also known as Shail, was a noted Hindi film lyricist during the 1950s and 1960s, who is best remembered for Vijay Anand's magnum opus Guide (1967). Besides that, he also worked in a number of successful projects like Bimal Roy's Madhumati (1958), Raj Kapoor's Shri 420 (1952) and Kishore Sahu's Dil Apna Preet Parayi (1960)
Shailendra penned a vast number of patriotic verses at the time. His poem ‘Jalta hai Punjab’ was very popular amongst the masses, and during one of his recitals filmmaker Raj Kapoor met him and offered him his first role as a lyricist in the Hindi film industry. Thus, he started work with Kapoor's super-hit classic Barsaat (1949). Over the next few years, Shailendra was already working with veteran music artists such as Shankar-Jaikishan, Salil Chowdhary, S N Tripathi, and S D Burman.

 Shailendra also produced the film Teesri Kasam (1966) but the film did not fare well at the box office and it led to financial problems and he died soon after. 
He wrote great songs, my favourites are from Bandini, Guide, Sangam, and the great ‘Ajeeb Dastaan’ and ‘Awaara ae Mere Dil’
2 great songs from Shree 420; Dil ka Haal and Ramaiya Vastavayia
