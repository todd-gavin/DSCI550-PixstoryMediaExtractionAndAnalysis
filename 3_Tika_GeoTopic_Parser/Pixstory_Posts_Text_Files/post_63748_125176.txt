Nostradamus by iconic English heavy metal band Judas Priest is a double disc concept album based on the life of French astrologer and seer Nostradamus and his prophecies Released in this album is perhaps the most controversial Priest album of all time because it did away with the classic heavy metal style of Judas Priest opting to go for a classical music inspired almost symphonic progressive metal style approach and the other most Judas Priest fans are not big on change But how is the album in general Suffice it to say that Nostradamus is among the finest if not the best thing the band has ever put out and is right out there with the likes of Painkiller Sad Wings of Destiny Stained Class Sin After Sin and Angel of Retribution Musically while it is true the band explores completely unfamiliar territory it also represents the band at perhaps at the pinnacle of its creativity with all the members in top notch shape Rob Halford s vocals are simply epic here while the instrumental work of guitarists KK Downing Glen Tipton bassist Ian Hill and drummer Scott Hill is absolutely power packed and amazing featuring amazing riffs solos and bombastic drumming Nostradamus is what happens when classical music meets heavy metal and further showcases just how two such diametrically opposed music genres can create something so beautiful maybe it is because on its part heavy metal is inspired by classical music The disc is monstrous in length over minutes in length But it is so well crafted that it is well worth the listen from all its interludes to its metal tracks the album is bombastic and full of epic proportions Nostradamus with its length is the equivalent of a movie with the addition of orchestral and choir sounds adding a great deal to the overall feel and scale of the album Nostradamus is ambition defined and realized and as such there is no reason to even remotely hate this album as is done by several in the Judas Priest fanbase
