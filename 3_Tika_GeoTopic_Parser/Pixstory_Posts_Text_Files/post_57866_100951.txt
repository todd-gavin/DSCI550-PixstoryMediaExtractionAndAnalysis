Greek mythology very succinctly surmises the concept of Soul Mates If it is to be taken as the truth for a moment and pondered upon we can delve into the theory of the amount of power that is housed in our brains and what it is capable of when with and put together with our other halves The other postulation would be of the truly wondrous fact that in this wretched and inconsiderate world where we live with the belief that we are alone there exists another being that can really be ours to be with to live with and to bear with all the musings of this life How significantly fulfilling would our lives become were this to be true and we were able to find these other halves of our whole Wouldn t you see life from a different point of view not only from your soulmates perspective but with that feeling of wholeness that will creating a new looking glass for you to look through A soulmate doesn t necessarily have to be romantic they can be platonic and familial as well But just the presence of that one person according to this myth that completes you in more ways than one that can impact your whole existence in a tremendous way makes a difference like nothing else We see numerous stories about soulmates online in other fictional mythologies like werewolves vampires and mermaids and even in normal human stories where you have timers and countdowns and first words on your skin that help you meet that one person We are capable of doing and creating great things with the amount of intellect we have but the emotional and psychological factors in and around us either become barriers or promoters Soulmates I believe help keep those barriers at bay and maintain the promotion and balance of our peace of mind work ethic and leisure time Perhaps we do indeed have soulmates out there but let s also try to be our own soulmate in terms of understanding knowing and controlling ourselves in all situations to be the best and do the best for ourselves
