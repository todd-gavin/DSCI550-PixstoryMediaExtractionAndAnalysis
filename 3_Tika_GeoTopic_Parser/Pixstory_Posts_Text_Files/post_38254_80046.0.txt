Yes, the Gunners have had a horrible January transfer window in terms of incoming signings. But let's consider the outgoing signings as well to see exactly how bad it has been for the North London club. 

Arsenal released Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Calum Chambers, and Sead Kolasinac on permanent transfers in January. All the mentioned players joined new clubs but the Gunners failed to get a single penny from the transfer fee. 

This has not happened for the first time. In the 2021 summer window, Arsenal let David Luiz, Willian, and Joseph Willock leave. Of these, the Gunners salvaged a transfer fee of €29 million for Willock. Whereas the two Brazilians left on a free transfer. 

Arsenal have just collected £377 million from player sales in the last 10 years. To add to this, Mohamed Elneny, Edward Nketiah, and Alexandre Lacazette will all go out of contract in the summer. Hence they could be leaving as free agents as well. 

Manchester City and Liverpool have earned £604 million and £660 million respectively in player sales in the last 10 years. Whereas London rivals, Chelsea have earned a whopping £1 billion in the same period.

Hence it can easily be seen that these clubs have profited a lot from their recent transfers. Hence it should be no surprise that the three clubs are currently head and shoulders above the rest of the Premier League clubs.


The Gunners need to change their transfer strategy 


Arsenal invested around £150 million in the 2021 summer window as they added younger talents to their roster. And as stated earlier, this has already helped the Gunners close the gap between themselves and their rivals. 

But at the same time, it would be important to sell players if a really good offer comes their way. Hence technical director Edu would have to pay a close look into transfers if Arsenal are to become a European superpower once again.
