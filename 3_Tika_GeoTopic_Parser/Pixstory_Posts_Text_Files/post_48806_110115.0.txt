While people with vagina are constantly fighting for their reproductive rights today, there's tonnes of "opinions" we are seeing from people who are not affected by this ruling, in particular, cis men. And well that's mansplaining at its worst.

Even if you, as a cis man, are one of those who claim to 'support' abortion rights and think you should be the one leading the fight, I have news for you.

What is mansplaining in the conversation about abortion?

1) Telling people affected by this ruling to 'calm down'.

2) Taking the limelight in the fight, which means speaking over the real victims of it and acting. You can never match their own rage, stop pretending you do.

3) Telling the victims that abortion is wrong â€“ obviously.

4) Trying to 'understand' pro-lifers / Being a pro-lifer.

5) Talking about "men's rights" in a situation where primarily women are getting targetted.

6) Saying 'Abortion should be legal but only under a few circumstances.'

7) Comparing the plight of women of different countries. / Invalidating and erasing the struggles of women from the countries where Abortion laws are different, especially the third world countries.


What's NOT mansplaining?

1) Listening to what the affected population has to say.

2) Amplifying their voices instead of speaking over them.

3) Joining the protests.

4) Standing up to people who are anti-abortion.

5) Supporting the marginalized genders when they're being cornered by anti-abortion individuals.


Men's participation in this fight matters more than you think. You are the driving force of the system, we need you to stand for our rights.
