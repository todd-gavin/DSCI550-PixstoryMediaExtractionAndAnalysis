Naseeruddin Shah, one of the finest actors in the history of Indian cinema turns 72 today. He has given numerous iconic & powerful performance over a career lasting for more than five decades.

The veteran actor has received prestigious awards like Padma Bhushan, Padma Shri along with 3 National Awards and 3 Filmfare Awards. From a being a champion of parallel cinema to starring in commerical successful movies, Naseer Sahab has done all.

Aside from conquering Bollywood, he has written a memoir of his early years 'And Then One Day: A Memoir'. 

The book chronicles Shah's life from his early days in his hometown of Meerut to his stardom in Bombay.

In the memoir, you will find many powerful quote by the star. I have compiled some of them below 👇🏻

1. "there is no such thing as talent but there is such a thing as lack of talent, and lack of talent occurs when one is not in one’s right place."

2. "Films take you captive, they feed you everything on a plate, the legerdemain they create transports you into a state where you may as well be dreaming, but theatre takes you into a world where your imagination is stimulated, your judgement is unimpaired, and thus your enjoyment heightened."

3. "The finest definition of theatre that I have come across is ‘one actor-one audience."

4. “Unfortunately, in our country, crying is mistaken for good acting.” 

5 "“An actor’s job is to find variations of the same emotion in his being so that it doesn’t look the same every time he expresses grief or joy.”

:. “Acting is learned, not taught.” ― Naseeruddin Shah
