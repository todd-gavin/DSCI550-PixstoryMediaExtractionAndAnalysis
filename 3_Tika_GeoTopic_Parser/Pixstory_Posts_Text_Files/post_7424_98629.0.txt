More than two years into the coronavirus pandemic, restaurants across the city continue to open their doors, sometimes because their concepts could be adapted to the new normal, but more often because their owners saw no other choice but to forge ahead. Since March 16, 2020, when the state first temporarily closed indoor dining, hundreds of new restaurants have opened, including a Champagne bar tucked inside of a party store, an Elmhurst Thai spot, and a new spot from the Wayla and Kimika team.

Carroll Gardens: The red sauce joints that used to dot this section of Brooklyn have dwindled over the years, but Bensonhurst native Sal Lamboglia (who was also a 15-year veteran of Andrew Carmellini’s restaurants) is putting forth his version of a classic Italian restaurant with Cafe Spaghetti, according to a representative. A bevy of family recipes appear on Lamboglia’s menu, including his mother’s eggplant parm and his father’s tiramisu. 126 Union Street, between Columbia and Hicks streets

Chinatown: In addition to its Hell’s Kitchen original, fast casual Thai restaurant Three Roosters has opened a second outpost, according to its team. Eater critic Ryan Sutton stopped by the original in summer 2021 to declare its Thai-style fried chicken rice platters “damn fine.” 23 Pell Street, at Doyers Street

Downtown Brooklyn: Food delivery app DoorDash is getting into the food hall game with a splashy new Downtown Brooklyn space. Partners include Chinese favorite Kings County Imperial and Southern comfort spot Pies ‘n’ Thighs. 383 Bridge Street, near Willoughby Street

Dumbo: Grub Street has the scoop on Randolph Beer’s new Dumbo location (the original one is in Williamsburg), that, in addition to functioning as a bar, has something called Belgian “feather bowling” as one of its activities. 82 Prospect Street, at Sands Street

East Village: Vegan-focused restaurateur Ravi Derossi has relocated his James Beard-nominated Southern restaurant, Cadence, a few doors down. The larger space — that will be able to seat nearly five times the amount of customers — is still led by the decorated chef Shenarri Freeman. 111 East Seventh Street, between First Avenue and Avenue A

Elmhurst: New York City’s growing cadre of restaurants focused on Isaan, the northeast region of Thailand, now includes Zaab Zaab.
