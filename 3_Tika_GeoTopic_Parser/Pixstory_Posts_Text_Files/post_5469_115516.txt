In the midst of the Peak District of Derbyshire Chatsworth House is home of the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire The stately English Country house has been handed down through generations of the Cavendish family It is a coveted place amidst a living landscape of mesmerizing valleys beside which flows quietly the River Derwent Visitors and tourists alike flock to the grounds to have a view of the estate and enjoy a warm sunny summer day Locals with their friends and relatives have a day stroll midst their favourite spots which they own with grandiose for their limited time of the day My daughter and myself arrived at our most cherished spot which gave a clear view of the house beside the river Derwent carefully navigating ourselves through the varied maze of sheep poos lying everywhere Children playing in the river young and adults dipping and bathing some cannoeing was a visual treat to behold Lazing on the grounds we sneaked into each other s warmth sharing our thoughts about the place A perfect mother and daughter bonding The added treat was an imposing display of a throng of LOTUS cars a show probably held by owners of the car club A host of colours spread across the lawns beside the river magnificent in their design and make Photo shoots dripping here and there of which we both excitedly partook as well In midst of the paraphernalia ducks quietly wade through the river quacking and children laughing adults sipping wine cider lager or any drink they could lazy upon One thing that cannot be stopped mentioning is the unstoppable Mr Darcy and his muse Lizzy of Jane Austen s famous BBC hosted Pride and Prejudice which was captured in this magnificent house and surroundings Released in the same year impaled with my memory of ushering in the dampness of UK Darcy and Lizzy kept me warm in their quirkiness Finally a warm enjoyable day mellowed with time and we had to take a return back Holding onto our spirits of visual ecstasy and laughter pleasure and content a cosy day slided into the pages of our memoir
