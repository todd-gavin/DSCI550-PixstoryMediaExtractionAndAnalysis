As climate change, global warming and other climate catastrophes draw closer, there is an increasing global pressure on every corporation indulged in capitalism to correct their ways, get on the right path and pay for their mistakes of committing environmental crimes. In an effort to project and promote a very nature loving, environment friendly image, these big bad corporations engage in green washing while still destroying the planet and causing exploitation of the environment and humans alike. Green washing is the practise of creating a false impression or providing incorrect information about how a company's products are better for the environment. Green washing is when a firm makes an unsubstantiated claim to trick customers into thinking its products are ecologically friendly. It is an attempt to capitalise on growing demand of environmentally sound products. For example, companies involved in green washing behavior might make claims that their products are from recycled materials or have energy-saving benefits. Although some of the environmental claims might be partly true, companies engaged in green washing typically exaggerate their claims or the benefits in an attempt to mislead consumers. Green washing is a play on the term "whitewashing," which means using misleading information to gloss over bad behavior.
