This typical Australian cuisine is strange to most Americans Did you know that it was even an eating challenge on one season of the Amazing Race and the participants were retching because it was so terrible So what is it about this food that Americans find so repulsive It s the traditional Australian Meat Pie For many of us it s not such a strange concept however Americans are accustomed to having fruit in their pies and eating them as dessert so maybe eating a meaty dessert is a bit strange Pies are a popular on the go food and practically every corner store bakery and supermarket will have a case full of hot meaty pies to select from Even specialty pie shops exist One can buy a variety of savoury pies in Australia but they are usually stuffed with minced meat gravy mushrooms onions and cheese After a long night of partying it s also a good snack After a night of drinking and dancing one can sit on the sidewalk with a pork pie in one s hand Source nomadsworld
