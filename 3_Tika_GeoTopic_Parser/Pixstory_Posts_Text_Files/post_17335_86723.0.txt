After years of smashing it alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez at Barcelona, Neymar decided to stun the sporting world by joining Paris Saint-Germain for a world record fee of £198 million.

The Brazilian superstar was eager to prove he could thrive outside of Messi’s shadow and help the French side win the Champions League for the very first time.

Sadly for Neymar, things haven’t really gone to plan. Injuries and off-field controversies have seen his stint in Paris so far resemble something close failure.

Sure, his numbers are great. In 135 games for PSG across all competitions, the 30-year-old has scored 91 goals and assisted a further 57.

However, he has not turned up when it’s mattered most for the Parisian outfit, like on Wednesday night in the Champions League away at Real Madrid.

Neymar may have assisted Kylian Mbappe‘s goal in PSG’s 3-1 defeat that saw them eliminated from the competition, but his overall performance on the night was woeful at best.

And it seems the Ligue 1 side have had enough of the world’s most expensive footballer letting them down.

PSG now want to sell Neymar

According to Roman Molina, PSG’s ownership have now decided they want to get rid of Neymar.

As explained by Toni Juanmartí, Neymar’s sub-par displays and the club’s poor relationship with his father have resulted in those at the top believing that they’d be best off without him on the team.

If the information turns out to be true, it begs the question; where could Neymar go?

A move to the Premier League would, of course, be touted, but it’s hard to see any of the teams who could afford his astronomical wages making a move for him these days.

Neymar doesn’t have the work ethic to play for Manchester City, while Manchester United could do without another inflated ego in their dressing room.

Basically, if the transfer saga does materialise in the summer, we have absolutely no idea what its conclusion will be…
