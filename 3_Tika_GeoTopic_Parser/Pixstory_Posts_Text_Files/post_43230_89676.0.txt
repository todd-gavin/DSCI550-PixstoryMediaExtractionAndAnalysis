Absolutely NOT.

Infact not a single star in Bollywood is even close to Akshay Kumar in comedy. Bhool Bhulaiyaa was a perfect movie and the character played by Akshay. The duo of Priyadarshan and Akshay has worked big time.

Karthik Aryan is a good actor but he's not a good choice for this movie. Only Akshay should have done this. By the way it's Producer's (Bhusan Kumar) call.
