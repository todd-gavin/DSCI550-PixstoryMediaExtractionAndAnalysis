Supreme Court refuses to entertain Nupur Sharma's plea to club the multiple FIRs registered over her remarks on Prophet Muhammed in a TV channel debate.

1. Supreme Court says Nupur Sharma's comments are "disturbing". "What is her business to make these remarks?"

Sr Adv Singh says she apologized for remarks and withdrew the comments.

"She should have gone to the TV and apologized to the nation", bench says.

2. "She was too late to withdraw...and too she withdraws conditionally, saying if sentiments hurt", Supreme Court.

3. "These are not religious people at all, they make statements to provoke", Supreme Court.

4. "If you are a spokesperson of a party, it is not a license to say things like this", Supreme Court 

5. "If there is a misue of the debate, the first thing she should have done was to file an FIR against the anchor", Supreme Court 

"There was provocation from the other debator", Sr Adv Maninder Singh for Nupur Sharma submits.
