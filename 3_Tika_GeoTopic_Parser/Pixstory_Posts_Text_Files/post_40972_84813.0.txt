Following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Warner Bros. has halted the release of The Batman in Russia, just days before movie was set to open in theatres there. 

Al Jazeera reported that on Monday, Warner Bros., Walt Disney Co., and Sony Pictures announced that their films would be "paused" in Russia. Each studio has a number of important upcoming releases that are slated to hit theatres throughout the world in the coming weeks.

One of the most anticipated pictures of the year, The Batman, will be released in North America and many international markets, including Russia, on Friday. 

"WarnerMedia is suspending the distribution of its feature picture 'The Batman' in Russia due to the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine," a studio representative stated in a statement. 

"We'll keep an eye on the issue as it develops." We hope that this tragedy will be resolved quickly and peacefully." 

The action by Warner Bros. was shortly followed by a similar one by Walt Disney Co. on Monday.

Turning Red, a Pixar film, was supposed to be released in Russia on March 10th, according to the company. In the United States, that film will be available on Disney+. 

Warner Bros. was expected to proceed with the Russian release of The Batman before Disney's news. 

"We are suspending the release of theatrical films in Russia, including the upcoming Pixar picture 'Turning Red,' due to the unwarranted invasion of Ukraine and the awful humanitarian crisis," a Disney representative said in a statement.
