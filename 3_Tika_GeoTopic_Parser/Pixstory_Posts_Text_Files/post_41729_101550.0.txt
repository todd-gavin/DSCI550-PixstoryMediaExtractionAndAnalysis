Women’s Cricket is making progress and making history and I, for one, am so proud!

The World Cup-winning Australian women's cricket team has been retained for the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, where they will face India on July 29. 

IE reported that for their T20I tri-series against Ireland and Pakistan, Australia has picked the same side. The Northern Ireland tri-series is great preparation for Meg Lanning's team, who will be led by temporary head coach Shelley Nitschke after Matthew Mott's resignation. 

Mott was appointed as the men's white-ball coach for England. 

In addition to winning the 50-over World Cup in New Zealand, Lanning's team also won the T20 World Cup and recently won series against England and India in the format. 

“Outside of the squad, Tayla Vlaeminck (knee) and Georgia Wareham (ankle) continue their injury rehabilitation, though both are unlikely to feature for most of the Australian summer later this year,” the ICC said in a release.

Let’s hope that they continue to make us proud!
