Curious episode during the African Cup final between Senegal and Egypt In the first half the referee awarded a penalty for the hosts Sadio Man on the penalty spot who let himself be hypnotized by the Egyptian Gabaski Before the penalty for Mohamed Salah he had suggested to his goalkeeper where to dive while the Senegalese forward had indicated where he would kick The shot was then neutralized by the full back on the opposite side of the one shown by Man The result has not been unstuck since after the minutes and the teams are currently in extra time Photo credits Goal com
