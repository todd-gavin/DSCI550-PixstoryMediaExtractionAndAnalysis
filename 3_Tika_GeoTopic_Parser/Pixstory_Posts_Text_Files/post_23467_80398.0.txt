Day 3: 

It was enough of not doing any touristy thing, so we decided to visit some famous places now. We were not sure if we should go to Rohtang pass or the Manikaran Gurudwara first. We decided to vist Manikaran that day. 

Manikaran Gurudwara is located in Parvati Valley on Parvati river in the small town of Manikaran in Himachal Pradesh. Manikaran is 4 km far from Kasol and 40 km ahead of Kullu.

It is also known as Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji Gurudwara. It was built on a place where Guru Nanak Dev Ji and Bhai Mardana came for betterment of the people. The legend goes that Bhai Mardana arranged for some pulses and flour for langar from the locals upon their arrival. He couldn't, however, get a fire to cook the food. Guru Nanak Dev Ji then asked Bhai Mardana that he should remove a stone beneath him. Bhai Mardana was astounded to see a fountain of spring hot water erupt. Guruji then asked him to donate the langar.

Apart from its religious significance, the Gurudwara offers a breathtaking view of the mighty Parvati River. There is a kund with warm water where one can bathe. Apart from that, there is a natural fountain of boiling hot water in the Shiva temple. It is said that if we grab a rice bag or uncooked channa and dip it in the boiling water; within minutes, we will have cooked rice or channa. To test that, we did the same and to our surprise, it actually came true! 

It was a great experience overall. Before heading back, we even had the sacred langar there. After which we were all set to get our way back to home. The plan was to drive through Kasol and drop by a cafe for some snacks. We, however, did not stop at any cafe in Kasol as we were too full after having langar prasad. So, we decided to sit in some cafe at the Mall Road for dinner. 

We ordered some authentic pasta, coffee and breads before heading back to our cottage.
