When you are having that day of struggling with mental health, it's difficult to do the easy tasks you have for the day. So just focus on one single task at a time. Take one hour and then complete the task and praise yourself for every step you take. 

Waking up and getting out of the bed is huge especially when you are experiencing low energy, lack of motivation and no desire to go about your day. 

Even if doing only one thing among the tasks you had for the day, it is still an achievement and it is something you can be proud about. 

Give a try to talk someone who is close to you and who knows you well. Opening up is not easy and you might even tend to get thoughts like you are burdening them or like they won't understand what you are trying to tell. 

But we need to remember that people who cares about us would like to help us out as well. And if they need to help you out they need to know what you are going through. 

Also self care basics are the most important ones on the list. Eating at least a small portion and drinking water is needed for you the most especially when you are mentally down.
