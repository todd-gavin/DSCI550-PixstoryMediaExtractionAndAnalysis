The establishment of United Nations in 1945, owes its origin to the increasing need felt worldwide for maintenance of International Peace and World order after witnessing death and destruction of mankind on colossal scale, caused by use of Nuclear Bombs to put an end to World War II.In its endeavour to sanitise humanity on this issue of immense importance, the United Nations General Assembly in 1981 declared third tuesday of September, which was the opening day of annual session of the General Assembly as International Day of peace.Two decades later in 2001, UNGA adopted a resolution to observe 21st September, every year as International Day of Peace, of Non-violence and Ceasefire, which incidentally happens to be exactly 10 days after Twin Tower bombing by Al-Qaeda in New York. This day also calls upon among all people to enforce 24 hour global peace and conflict truce between combating groups, with a view to give peace a chance.World will be much better if peace exists. Mankind needs to accept and respect the diversity in ethnicity, culture, religion, colour, race and practices among the people inhabiting this beautiful creation of God called Mother Earth. Nobel Prize for Peace instituted in 1901 is again a laudable effort to focus on establishing world peace. This day is also to recognise the efforts of peacemakers and peacekeepers who individually and collectively work tirelessly to make this world more peaceful.
