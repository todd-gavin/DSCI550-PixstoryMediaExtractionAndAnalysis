Cunningham in 1872 discovered a cave 40 feet in length and 30 feet in width, immediately behind the stone basement at the Jarasandh ki Baithak, and identified it with the Pippal cave or Vaibhara cave, of the Chinese pilgrims. He found a flight of steps, along with a portion of the unbroken roof, after clearing some trees which had covered the entrance and seemed to be growing out of a hole. He had searched for the cave near the Jarasandha ki Baithak, considering that Jarasadha was an asura, whose palace might have been referred to by the Chinese pilgrims. 
Discovering this particular cave, he confirmed the Son Bhandar cave to be the famous Saptaparni cave. Cunningham related his finds as having an important bearing on the history of Indian Architecture, since there were now identified specimens of Indian stone buildings at least two hundred and fifty years older than Asoka. Since these caves were existing at the time of the Buddha, they were perhaps older than 500 B.C. Cunningham related the socket holes in front of the Son Bhandar, as showing that at some former period the caves had extended towards the front. He quoted the Ceylonese Chronicles which mentioned:- “With the assistance of Ajatasatru, Raja of Magadha, a splendid hall was built for the assembly of the first synod at the mouth of the Sattapani cave, on the side of the Webhara mountain. Five hundred carpets were spread around for the monks; one throne was prepared for the abbot on the south side, facing the north, and another throne was erected in the middle, facing the east, fit for the holy Buddha himself.”
