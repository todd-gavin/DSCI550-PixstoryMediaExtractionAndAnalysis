Well last few years everything went online I got into college and since Covid was there we could not meet each other So all the communications went through WhatsApp and social media I started making friends with people whom I never ever met in real But when I met them in real they complimented me that I am way more sweet and generous as they previously thought I was rude and egoistic I was shocked after listening to them as I always tried to be nice with everyone and then I understand that people interpret WhatsApp messages with their own perception and since I don t use emojis much they interpret in an other way So now when I text I make sure to put emojis as it can actually tell you with what consent someone is talking to you
