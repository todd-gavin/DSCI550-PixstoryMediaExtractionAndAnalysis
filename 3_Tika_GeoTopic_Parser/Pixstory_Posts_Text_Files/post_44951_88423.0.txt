According to Fabrizio Romano, the Egypt international wants to stay at Anfield, but he wants a solid contract since he knows he could earn "crazy" money elsewhere.

In an interview with Rio Ferdinand for Gazzetta dello Five, Romano indicated that he is beginning to suspect that Salah will not sign a new contract with Liverpool.

The Merseyside giants will undoubtedly try to turn things around, but Romano has stated that the club is keen to maintain their current salary structure.

Liverpool would be wise not to abandon what has shown to be a winning plan, but Salah appears to be a talented enough player to disregard the rulebook for.

Since joining Liverpool in 2017, the former Roma man has been absolutely brilliant, and it's hard to imagine they'd be able to find a successor without spending a fortune, so why not put that money into paying him the salaries he wants?

According to Spotrac, the free-scoring winger earns £200,000 per week, which puts him in a tie with Virgil van Dijk and Thiago Alcantara as Liverpool's best earners.

So, you might be wondering, what's the big deal? Well, 13 Premier League players now earn more than that six-figure weekly wage, and Salah certainly believes he deserves to be closer to them – which is understandable when you're the greatest player in the division.
