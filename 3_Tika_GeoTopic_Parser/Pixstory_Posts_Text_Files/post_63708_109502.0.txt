Part 1

Going into the final episode and given Disney’s history with lightsaber duels I did not have high hopes for the final duel of Obi Wan vs Darth Vader in the finale of Obi Wan Kenobi. In the most pleasant surprise, the duel proved to be the best part of not just the series, but one of the best Star Wars duels of all time, even surpassing the flashback duel between Anakin and Obi Wan.

This duel was everything that I ever wanted to see in a live action Obi Wan vs Vader standoff since the breathtaking Battle of the Heroes in ROTS, and furthermore, it was done very beautifully. Obi Wan Kenobi is now at his peak powers once again, having now finally cast aside his fear and hesitation and therefore being able to match Darth Vader blow for blow. The best part of this duel was that it combined the emotional aspects of the original trilogy duels, with the flashiness and martial aspects of the prequels.


Speaking of the setting, if the duel on Mustafar featured a volcanic fiery hellhole symbolizing the ferocity and rage of young Anakin/pre suit Darth Vader, then this cold dark lifeless rocky planet on which the duel takes place symbolizes the absolute resolve of both Vader and Obi Wan to finally end things. Seriously, the setting could not have been better.

Throughout the fight we see a change in Vader, who goes from cocky and arrogant, thinking this will be a walk in the park like last time to actually using all his strength this time as he switches from one hand to two, signifying just how powerful Obi Wan really is. In a surprisingly different, but pleasant turn of events, we actually see Vader employ more of a defensive fighting style while Obi Wan goes more on the offensive. Furthermore, having found his motivation finally, Obi Wan is no longer pulling his punches.
