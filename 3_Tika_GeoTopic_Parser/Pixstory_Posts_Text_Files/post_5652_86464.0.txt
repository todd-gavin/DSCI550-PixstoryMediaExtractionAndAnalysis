Akhilesh Yadav's dream of returning as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh will remain a dream for atleast next 5 years.

Despite the fact that Samajwadi party performed will in terms of vote share, it was not enough to defeat the ruling BJP. Their vote share increased by 10% from 21.8% in 2017 to 31.8%. 

The partyâ€™s best performance before this election was in 2012 when it polled 29.12% of the votes. It had then won over 200 seats.

Akhilesh has managed to take SP's number from 47 in 2017 to 115 in 2022. Akhilesh was contesting Karhal and won by a margin of whopping 61000 votes.

He might not become the CM this time, but SP under his leadership has fared well in this election.
