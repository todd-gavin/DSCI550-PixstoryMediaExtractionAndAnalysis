Mikel Arteta praised the effort and caliber on display before the team's match against Leicester City, saying, "The guys have been practicing exceptionally well."

Fabio Vieira, a recent addition whose eye-catching flexibility promises to transform the game this season, was one of those in action. According to Vieira, "He doesn't want to be stuck in any one position because he's so used to it, and that's a really great thing for us." The manager praised Vieira for his readiness to meet the fitness requirements of the Premier League.

Several starting players who weren't included on the squad sheet for our season opener joined the 22-year-old Portuguese player. This week has seen the return of Kieran Tierney, Emile Smith Rowe, and Takehiro Tomiyasu to first-team practice.

Tierney, whose season-ending knee injury occurred in March 2022, participated in the Crystal Palace game as a substitute. Arteta was overjoyed with his development, saying, "He played 15-20 minutes last Saturday and he performed pretty well." After the knee injury, he was out for a while, but he now appears to be in excellent shape and is ready to go.

While still working toward match fitness, Emile Smith Rowe appears to have overcome the groin issue he sustained in preseason. He was an important player for Arsenal in the Premier League during our 21/22 campaign, featuring 21 games and scoring 10 goals.

The news from the practice field wasn't all positive, though. Reiss Nelson's mid-week injury hurt Arteta's team, but the manager held out hope that he would recover quickly. They need to do one more test, and perhaps by the following week, to know more about it.

Following the new Premier League rules allowing five substitutes per game, squad depth is more crucial than ever. As the season goes on, the boss emphasized how crucial this modification in the rules will be. This is incredibly beneficial in that it increases the squad's and players' individual opportunities to take part in games significantly.
