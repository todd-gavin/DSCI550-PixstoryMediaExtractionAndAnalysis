Kylie's typical day starts at 5:50am which is then followed by breakfast, a shower, putting Stormi back to bed and getting into glam before 9am. Kylie's following in the footsteps of momager and actual mom, Kris Jenner, who has previously revealed she gets up at 4:30am every morning. ⏱☀️🍴👶🏻

🥞 for breakfast — a bowl of yogurt topped with crunchy granola, blueberries, raspberries and a sprig of mint. Her boost of caffeine is a frothy-looking green drink in a mug. Perhaps a matcha latte or green tea? 🫐🍓☕️

After that, Jenner makes us all jealous with coconut water. But it isn’t in a bottle. It’s in a freshly opened coconut with a straw sticking out. Something most people only get on vacation, but we can live vicariously through her. 🥥🌴🧊

Lunch is a fresh pile of greens with crunchy slivered nuts, purple cabbage, black sesame seeds and herbs in a creamy dressing. 🥬🍋🍴

On the side or as a snack, she snacks on some grapes and pours herself a glass of lemon water from a tall container filled with bright yellow sliced lemons. In there, she drops some black liquid, which we assume is blk.water’s fulvic drops.  🍇🍋🍸

For dinner, a creamy penne, some roasted asparagus and a light salad of arugula and cucumbers make up a plate. 🍝🍽🥒 🤤

Dessert is some freshly-baked chocolate chip cookies that look soft and gooey on the inside and crispy on the outside.  🍪🧁🥮

Her most favourite- Fresh coconut, creamy pasta and a green salad. 🥥🌴🍝🥗
