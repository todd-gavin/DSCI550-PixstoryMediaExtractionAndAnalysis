Given a thought of how our brain really learn on new things and learn from mistakes let s find that out This is totally based on how a multitasking group of neurons work which is called as messenger cells that is in our brains They identify the tasks and function accordingly The study published in the journal Science gives an insight into how the brain operates at various situations and track how we can adjust in other situations Be it when trying new things or improving our skills Part of the magic of the human brain is that it is so flexible says senior study author Ueli Rutishauser PhD a professor and director of the Center for Neural Science and Medicine at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles We designed our study to decipher how the brain can generalize and specialize at the same time both of which are critical for helping us pursue a goal To learn more about it the scientists studied about the brain activity in adults who had experienced epilepsy who had electrodes implanted in their brains to point out the origins of the seizures The electrodes were situated in a region of the brain known as medial frontal cortex This is where the tracking and managing of the mental skills happens The participants were given various cognitive tests and and they completed it the electrodes showed two types of neurons at work that cells that send messages in response to mistakes and cells that fired up after completing difficult tasks When we observed the activity of neurons in this brain area it surprised us that most of them only become active after a decision or an action was completed says Rutishauser This indicates that this brain area plays a role in evaluating decisions after the fact rather than making them Rutishauser says to know about how the neurons function in this region of the brain that response to feedback and learn from failure and success may help one to treat mental health conditions that includes abnormal performance tracking like schizophrenia or obsessive compulsive disorder Sources
