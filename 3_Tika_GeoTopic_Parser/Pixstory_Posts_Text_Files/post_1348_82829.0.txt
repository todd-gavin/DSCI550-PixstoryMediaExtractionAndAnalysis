BJP’s official Gujarat page posted this picture today. It’s clear incitement for violence. Thousands of people have reported this particular image. 

Despite that, Instagram is refusing to take any action on this (SEE THE SECOND IMAGE FOR THEIR RESPONSE). Meta doesn’t want to get in trouble again which is why they’re allowing such filth to stay on their platform.

Try posting such a thing on Pixstory. Proud to be a part of a strong app such as this.

——-UPDATE——-
The image has been deleted. Whether the page itself removed it or it was removed by Instagram is unclear. The main point still remains. A post such as this would have been taken down in a matter of minutes on Pixstory. 
Instagram has some serious introspection to do.
