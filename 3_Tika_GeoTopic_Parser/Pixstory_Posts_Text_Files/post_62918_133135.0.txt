When you're traveling to a place that is culturally different from your own, it's important to be aware of the local customs. This way, you'll avoid any unintentional disrespecting of their culture. Here are a few things to keep in mind:
- Be respectful of the people and the environment.
- Don't take photos or videos without permission.
- Don't behave in a way that would make them uncomfortable.
- Don't try to speak their language or do anything that might make them feel uncomfortable.
- Do not touch anything that does not belong to you.
- Do not speak over them. They know about their culture better than you do. Do not mansplain.
- Don't mock any tradition just because you don't understand it. It holds a meaning for the people it belongs, and that's enough.
