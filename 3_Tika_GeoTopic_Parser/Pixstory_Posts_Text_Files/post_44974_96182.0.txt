A brace at Stamford Bridge really brought Eddie Nketiah to the spotlight at Arsenal this week.

Manager Mikel Arteta spoke highly of the 22 year-old following the 4-2 victory, although the Spanish International gave Nketiah just his second start of the season. For the rest of the season however, Nketiah has spent his time in amongst the bench, or playing for the reserves.

For someone who's been training with the first team so consistently, he does play a significantly less number of minutes. Game time is a crucial aspect of the game for any youngster let alone a promising footballer at Arsenal. Nketiah is valued at the Emirates, but his future is anything but certain. Reports coming out of North London suggest club representatives are hopeful of a renewal.

Nketiah too, will be willing to put pen to paper given he's guaranteed sufficient minutes. The 
likes of Borussia Monchengladbach and Crystal Palace are said to be interested too, with the summer bringing a close to his current contract.

It remains likely however, that he extends at Arsenal, for this is where he seems most comfortable. With Alexandre Lacazette keen on a move and captain Aubameyang having already left, it opens up a void for the centre forwards role in Arteta's first team.

The fans at the Emirates love the young lad, as is evident from the football he plays. Electric 
fast, a team player with an eye for goal-moving to the Bundesliga or to a mid-table Premier league side would most likely end up in a waste of potential. Eddie Nketiah is Arsenal through and through, having come up the ranks at the academy, bar a loan spell at Leeds United.
