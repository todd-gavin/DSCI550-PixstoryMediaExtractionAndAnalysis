One of the greatest monuments of pre Mughal Islamic architecture in India, the minaret forms part of a complex containing some of the earliest structures of Muslim rule in the country. 
Standing 72.5 meters tall, it was built as a celebratory victory tower accompanying the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque and was probably inspired by the style of Afghan minarets. Inscriptions suggest that it was begun by Qutub-ud-din Aibak in 1198 and completed by his successor Iltutmish in 1215, although the two upper tiers were rebuilt at later dates. 
The chief material used is red sandstone. Four balconies separate its five storeys, and a beautiful effect is achieved in the lower three storeys which have broad carved bands of interwoven calligraphy and floral motifs. Within the minaret is a spiral stairway of 360 steps. Inscribed below: 'Cutub Minar.'
Now, It has become a symbol of Delhi's heritage and culture. Thousands of people visit it everyday, both tourists and locals. A Sufi music festival takes place in the complex every autumn. Visitors were allowed to climb up to the top, but after a tragic accident in 1981, it is prohibited.
