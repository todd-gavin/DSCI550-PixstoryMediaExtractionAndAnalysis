Sonamarg is one of the most charming places to visit in Jammu & Kashmir in February. A trip to Sonamarg is refreshing and enchanting during winter. Tucked at 2800 m, Sonmarg, also known as 'meadow of gold', is a photomontage of lakes, mountains, glaciers and opulent meadows. The temperature stays moderate, ranging between 10 to 20 degrees; thus making it a place perfect for trekking, camping and nature walk.
