For the last years I am watching F and enjoying it a lot My favorite team in F is Scuderia Ferrari and my favorite driver is Carlos Sainz but my favorite Team Principal Manager is Toto Wolff who is the CEO of the Mercedes AMG Petronas F team also holds a stake in the company When you watch him when the race is happening as a spectator you will get to know nothing about him but when you see the documentary F Drive to Survive series on Netflix then you got to know how strong this guy is how he operates each and everything which is happening around him Today when I woke up and read the news about him and how he is getting help to overcome his problems with the help of a psychiatrist since and my reaction was how television shows everything good about the person who is famous and not his vulnerability and because of this person people who are watching them from all over the world thinks that how lavish their life is People from all over the world still know very little about Mental health and treat it as taboo They never understand that mental health can cause serious issues to the person who is going through it and people also don t know how their small gestures can disturb another person mentally People who idolize sportspersons actors business persons and politicians think that by being a rich lad they don t have to worry about anything and they are just enjoying their life But it s not TRUE at all Nowadays Mental Health is a serious issue and people have to talk about it more and more because people who are going through a bad patch in their life feel shy to talk about Mental health because they think that people will make fun of them or will not understand it Start talking to your friends start talking to your children and last but the most important start talking to yourself and by just talking you can save so many lives and can make people smile around you
