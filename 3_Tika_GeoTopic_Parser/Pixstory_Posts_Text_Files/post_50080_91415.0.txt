My Kinsman Major Molineux is an outstanding short story by Nathaniel Hawthorne. It dives into many levels of colonialism. How colonialism made people suffer and later how people made colonialists suffer. 

The story is dreamlike as a young man arrives at Massachusetts Bay in search of his Kinsman but to his terror, he sees him being tarred and feathered which shatters all his hope of starting a new life. In the end, he is left behind with joining and starting a new life alone in a New World. Stands as an allegory to the chaos Americans faced in the New World. To fight or to survive was the option. 

The story is highly magical and realistic with shifts in emotions within seconds. The magic Hawthrone creates through his words is excellent! He creates a mood of chaos, anger, madness and vigour. The reader gets on a roller coaster of loud expressions. The protagonist at the end of the story develops from an innocent to a confused adult. The good-evil, themes exist, the protagonist almost runs away from all the sins he sees in his way.

The story is recommended for the vigour it carries, its figures of speech, and the mood it takes the reader into. Do read the short story you will never regret. 

Happy reading ðŸ§¡
