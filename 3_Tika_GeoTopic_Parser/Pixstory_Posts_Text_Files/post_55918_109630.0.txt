Overturning Roe v/a Wade, the worst nightmare for women has come true and this not only takes away women's rights but put families in economic distress! 

Do abortions stop after this no? It becomes less safe and hard to access. Women might have to travel long distances to get an abortion. Hence those who do not have the least resources to travel, pay and time off work falls into trouble. Everything will be easy for rich people and when abortion doesn't come in health care poor people suffer. Is it ok to push people into pregnancy? Will the government be responsible for the mental health of broken relationships and forced families? 

Reproductive choice gives us the ability to plan our lives supporting financial stability for individuals. The ability to choose isn't all about rejecting motherhood it is also about accessing education, pursuing a career, and becoming a change to their community. It is about following their dreams and wanting to live a life of one's own will.
