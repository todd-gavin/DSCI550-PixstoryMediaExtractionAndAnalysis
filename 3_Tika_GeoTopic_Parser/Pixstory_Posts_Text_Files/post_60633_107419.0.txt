Someday love will find you and break those chains that bind you… from the last two episodes of Stranger Things Season 4. 

While there are still a few weeks before Volume 2 launches on July 1 — and we finally learn what Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) means by “you can’t stop this now” — we can share some first-look photos from Episodes 8 and 9 to hold you over until then.
The new pics show our heroes dispersed in their four corners of this season’s storyline. Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) squares off against her “Papa,” Dr. Brenner (Matthew Modine), while Mike (Finn Wolfhard) spots something on the horizon from the backseat of the totally tubular Surfer Boy Pizza van speeding through the desert.

The Russian prison escape brigade, comprised of Murray (Brett Gelman), Hopper (David Harbour), Joyce (Winona Ryder) and Dmitri (Tom Wlaschiha), looks a wee bit skeptical, while the crew back in Hawkins is working together, which is — as we’ve learned— what they do best when confronted with their latest foe from the Upside Down.

Run — don’t walk — on up that hill and take a look at these eight sneak-peek photos of the Stranger Things cast before Vecna casts his next spell. Go on, it’s time.
