3 Raul
He was the first player to break the record of many Real Madrid legends from the 1990s, moving from Real Madrid C to the senior team due to his perfection in front of goal. Raul became more clinical with each season he spent with Real Madrid, and he set the record for highest goal in Real Madrid history.
Raul's development was pleasant, and the striker developed into a complete goal-scorer, scoring 29 goals in consecutive seasons and finishing his Madrid career with 323 goals in 741 games.

2 Karim Benzema
When Ronaldo left, the goal-scoring onus of responsibility fell on the Frenchman's shoulders, and the pressure was bolting because he couldn't find his form, and Real Madrid needed a lethal striker. The club began looking for a new forward and, under pressure, Benzema began to aspire. Benzema eventually recovered his form and demonstrated his ability in front of goal.
His last season performance was enough to convince us that he carried Real Madrid on his shoulders, scoring back-to-back hattrick and winning the Champions League. He gained a reputation and is now considered the favourite to win his first Ballon d'Or. So far, the Frenchman has played 611 games and scored 327 goals.
1 Cristiano Ronaldo
He couldn't reach 500 appearances, but he made sure he left the club by breaking every legend record; he was a man of his words. Ronaldo left the club by breaking every player record, including Raul's 71-goal record. He came when he was at his best, scoring a brace or a goal in every game. He was on every scoreboard; he was inevitable.
Ronaldo made history and did not stop there, winning four Ballon d'Or and four Golden Boots in Real Madrid's jersey, five Champions Leagues, and leaving the club as the club's all-time leading goal-scorer, with 450 goals in 438 appearances.
