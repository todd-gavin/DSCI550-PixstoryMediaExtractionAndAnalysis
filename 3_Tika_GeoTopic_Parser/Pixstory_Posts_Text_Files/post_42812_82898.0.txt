One of the most common causes of child marriage is the tradition which has been in practice for a long time. In many places, ever since a girl is born, they consider her to be someone elseâ€™s property. The pressure of dowry adds on to the parents and becomes a leading cause of child marriage. Despite being made illegal, child marriage continues to be a part of society in many backward areas. This hampers the growth and development of youth and further of the country as a whole.
