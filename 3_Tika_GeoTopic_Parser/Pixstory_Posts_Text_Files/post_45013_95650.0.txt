Manchester United has announced the resignation of two key members of its recruitment staff,
less than 24 hours after their humbling loss to Liverpool on Tuesday night.

Jim Lawlor, the club's chief scout, and Marcel Bout, the club's head of global scouting, have
both left the club ahead of what is likely to be a major makeover following another poor season.

Erik ten Hag of Ajax is expected to take over as head coach, replacing interim Ralf Rangnick,
who will take on a consulting role.

Lawlor has been head scout since 2014, having joined the club nine years prior, while Bout was
brought in as part of Louis van Gaal's system and stayed at Old Trafford when the Dutchman
left.

A United official said that Jim was a vital source of counsel to Sir Alex Ferguson and each of the
managers who followed him and played a crucial part in the building of many trophy winning
Manchester United teams.

As an assistant coach, Marcel has been instrumental in the recent enhancement of our scouting
powers.

"We extend our heartfelt gratitude to Jim and Marcel for their important contributions to the club,
as well as our best wishes for the future."

In recent seasons, United's recruiting has been widely criticized, with their massive expenditure
unable to return the team to the top of English football.

Last summer, the club paid Â£73 million to finally sign long-term target Jadon Sancho, as well as
making high-profile signings like Raphael Varane and Cristiano Ronaldo, but they are currently
22 points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool and face an uphill battle to qualify for the
Champions League at the end of a trophyless season.
