Rahul Gandhi, who paid his condolences to the family of Punjabi artist Sidhu Moosewala in Mansa, Punjab on Tuesday, took aim at the Bhagwant Mann-led AAP administration, stating that preserving peace in the state is beyond their capabilities.
In the morning, Rahul Gandhi travelled straight from the Chandigarh airport to the singer's hometown of Moosa, where he spent about 50 minutes with his family.

He also paid Moosewala flower tributes.

Rahul Gandhi criticised the government over the law and order situation shortly after leaving Moosewala's home after seeing the family.

"The state's law and order has entirely collapsed. The AAP government's ability to maintain peace and calm in Punjab is limited "He used Hindi in his tweets.

Rahul Gandhi remarked on his visit to Moosewala's home, "It's difficult to put into words the anguish that Congress leader Sidhu Moosewala ji's parents are through... It is our responsibility to bring them to justice, and we will."

Several Congress leaders followed him, including Punjab Congress chief Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, Punjab Assembly Leader Partap Singh Bajwa, former deputy chief minister O P Soni, and others.

Rahul Gandhi was out of the country at the time of the murder and returned over the weekend.
