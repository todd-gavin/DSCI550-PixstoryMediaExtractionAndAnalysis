Fondazione Prada is preparing to inaugurate Useless Bodies an exhibition by the duo Elmgreen Dragset famous for having created the replica of a Prada boutique in the middle of the desert Prada Marfa The exhibition is a sort of retrospective on the duo&#39;s work over the last twenty years of their career, extending all the spaces of the Foundation and one of the largest conceived The main objective is to explore the condition of the body in the post-industrial era where the physical presence has been replaced by the digital one Our bodies are no longer the active subjects of our lives Unlike what happened in the era industry today no longer generate value within the advanced production mechanisms typical of contemporary society One could even say that our physical identities have become more of a hindrance than an advantage explain Elmgreen Dragset One of the most impactful installations of the retrospective is located near the cistern a extremely realistic statue of a man hanging by one arm from a rope who has lost his balance but still holds the rod in his hand with bare feet and wears a t-shirt with the question What&#39;s Left That even the title of the work looks like just an inscription on a t-shirt and yet that question starts from an observation on what is actually left to us as humanity but also what is left of the left as a concept as ideals We ask ourselves more than anything else how these visions of society can be reconciled with the hyper-speed of technological progress is a big question that a trivial writing printed on a t-shirt comments on the artistic duo From March to August the exhibition can be visited and will certainly be the artistic event of the year
