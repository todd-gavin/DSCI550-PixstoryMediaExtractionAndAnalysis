I sometimes wonder that what could be the best foods for Pre-workout ? 🤔 Do you Ever got Confused about what to eat before hitting the gym ?
It's Common problem now a days ! 🏋️‍♀️

I have seen people taking working out at the gym very seriously , they head to gym on an empty stomach because they have succumbed to the notion that one shouldn’t eat before a workout or simply because they don’t know what to eat . 🍽️✅

But guys , this doesn’t mean that you chow down heartily before your workout . The key is to follow a middle path , eating right at the right time . ✅

So if you are Confused ? Then Worry no more ! I got your back ! I will Tell you what to eat before Gym ; 🥰

✅ Wheat bread with banana 🥪
✅ Oatmeal 🥘
✅ Brown rice with chicken 🍚🍗
