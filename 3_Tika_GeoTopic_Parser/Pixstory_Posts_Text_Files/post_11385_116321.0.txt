Our emotional, mental, and physical wellness all benefit from being outside. It's important to take precautions to shield your skin from the sun when you go outside. 


When the sun can't be seen through the clouds, it could be tempting to forgo wearing sunscreen. The ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun is still quite potent despite being invisible. Even on cloudy days, UV light can damage your skin, increasing your chance of developing skin cancer and giving you a sunburn.

The reasons why sunburns can occur even on cloudy days  ;

The sun’s UV radiation is a type of natural energy source we can’t see. But we can feel the sun’s UV energy. This is why unprotected skin feels hot or warm during daylight hours when the sun is out.

The sun’s UV radiation is strongest and most damaging between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. daylight saving time (9 a.m. to 3 p.m. standard time) when the Earth is most fully exposed to the sun.

UV radiation grows even more powerful and potentially damaging during the summer, as the Earth tilts on an angle toward the sun (during the winter it tilts away).

If you live near the equator, the sun’s UV radiation is strong all year round because this part of the Earth sticks out closest to the sun. People living, working, or recreating at high altitudes also experience strong sun exposure for similar reasons.

The sun’s UV radiation can be strengthened and do more damage when it hits reflective surfaces like water, cement, sand, and snow.

So, it’s especially important to ensure you have adequate sun protection when you’re in places or situations where you’ll encounter these sun-magnifying factors, such as when:

1 swimming
2 at the beach
3 walking down a cement sidewalk
4 shoveling or playing in snow

It’s true that clouds do block some UV light. But more than 90% of the sun’s UV radiation can still pass through clouds on lightly overcast days and cause sunburn.
