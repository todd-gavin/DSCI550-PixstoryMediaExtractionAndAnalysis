Jennifer Lopez has a new last name!

The "Ain't Your Mama" singer, 52, married Ben Affleck over the weekend and signed off "With love, Mrs. Jennifer Lynn Affleck" in a newsletter sent Sunday.

Per the marriage license, which was obtained by PEOPLE, Lopez plans to use Affleck's last name as her own.

A Clark County Clerk's Office marriage license record names Benjamin Geza Affleck as Party 1 and Jennifer Lopez is named as Party 2. Nothing is listed under the "new name" section for Party 1, however, Party 2's "new name" is listed as "Jennifer Affleck."

The marriage certificate, which must be filed within 10 days of the ceremony, had not yet been filed as of Sunday afternoon.
