Following a 2020 high court judgement, a somewhat divided Supreme Court heard arguments about Oklahoma's authority to prosecute some offences on Native American territories. 

US News reported that the decision will most likely be made by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the lone member of the court who did not participate in the previous case. 

Barrett, who was appointed to the court after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death in 2020, sat through more than two hours of arguments without tipping her hand. 

The issue sets Oklahoma Native tribes against Republican Governor Kevin Stitt, and it's the latest stumbling block in his relationship with tribal leaders. 

The state retains the authority to punish non-Natives for crimes committed on tribal grounds where the victim is a Native American, according to the supreme court.

After a state court overturned the conviction of Victor Castro-Huerta, who is not Native American, Oklahoma appealed to the Supreme Court. Castro-Huerta, a member of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, was accused by Oklahoma authorities with malnourishment of his crippled 5-year-old stepdaughter. 

The state court decided that Oklahoma lacked the legal power to prosecute a felony committed on tribal property against a Native American.
