 th of August marked the beginning of a new chapter in my adventurous life a chapter that I would love to relive again After completing my graduation I found myself in the middle of nowhere Having spent the last years of my life competing for A grade results that had worn my soul out I was in search of something different That s when I crossed paths with the Naropa Fellowship program The NF changed my perspective of life and helped me be a better version of myself The NF based in Ladakh is designed for individuals devoted to working for the Himalayan region Coming from the Himalayas I had always envisioned myself working towards enhancing the quality of life of the people residing in this region Fortunately I got enrolled in the batch and this was the beginning of my Journey of a Lifetime Far from the madding crowd Ladakh is a place whose beauty not only captures your soul but also stays with you forever If someone had told me that I would be flying over the mighty Shivalik Range into the land of high passes Ladakh I would ve not believed it The person who said The path of life can change in an instant was probably right Our cohort had students from all walks of life In a year those strangers became my family and Ladakh my new home We all lived under the same roof and had our share of blissful and sorrowful moments From surviving the freezing Ladakhi winter to taking a dip at Indus to escape the scorching heat of the summer who knew that it would be this hard for us to let go of those moments Although our fellowship was cut short because of the pandemic I will forever cherish my time at the Naropa Fellowship Ladakh is where I found my true self and met some of the most remarkable people on this planet From the lonely woods of Kalimpong to the endless roaring mountains of Ladakh it sure was a beautiful journey a journey that will be engraved in my heart forever
