The Brontë sisters are an enigma in literature. Charlotte Brontë is the most famous for her work “Jane Eyre”, but Emily Brontë's “Wuthering Heights” is sure to be found among the shelves of us readers as 
well as our hearts. So are Anne Brontë’s works. 
The Brontë family’s life had been so rich and fascinating, the inspirations for their various novels acquired through it. 
In September 1824, the sisters were sent to the school for clergyman’s daughters in Cowan's Bridge. But in 1825, Cowan’s Bridge was hit by Typhoid Fever. This school was the inspiration for Lowood in Jane Eyre. Charlotte was never shy in claiming how the school was responsible for her sisters' illness and early deaths. 
Their brother Branwell Brontë was younger than Charlotte and older than Anne and Emily, making the four youngest really close. Branwell was an aspiring artist and poet. But he was plagued by the lack of
success. He resorted to alcoholism, opium addiction and succumbing to depression. He was a distress to his sisters and inspiration for their characters. Anne Brontë based Arthur Huntington, the drunk husband in The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, on Branwell. Emily's character Hindley Earnshaw in Wuthering Heights 
was also inspired by him. 
All these aspects of their lives influenced their work heavily. Most of the geographic settings were also 
inspired from real life.
