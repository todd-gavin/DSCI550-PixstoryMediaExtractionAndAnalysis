As per a recent report, Roman Reigns and Paul Heyman don't want The Tribal Chief character to turn babyface.
Reigns is the current Undisputed WWE Universal Champion and is the biggest superstar in all of WWE today. He has previously hinted that he holds major creative pull about his character right now.
As per Ringside News' latest report, the champion "refuses" to have The Tribal Chief persona turn into a babyface. Paul Heyman, Reigns' Special Counsel, apparently shares similar sentiments regarding his character.
To add to that, here's what a member of WWE's creative team reportedly had to say about Reigns and Heyman's conversation with the team:
"They both are always telling writers 'the character is the champion, the top attraction, the WrestleMania main event, the one who everyone relies on.' They always use the word “burden” as in “the burden the top attraction feels at all times.”
