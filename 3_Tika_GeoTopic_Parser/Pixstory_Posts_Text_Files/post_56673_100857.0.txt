There is nothing that can strike fear into my heart quite like the thought of losing my phone. Even a day of leaving my phone at home can throw me off balance — and it turns out I’m not alone.

New research from Medibank has revealed that stress levels are generally high since the pandemic and the main factors come as a shock to no one — finance and money, personal health, the pandemic in general, work, and doom scrolling are all part of it.

Not far down the list of stress-inducing scenarios for Gen Z and Millennials, however, was also the thought of losing a phone.

You may scoff, but phones aren’t just for calling anymore.

Right now my phone is my alarm, my torch, my calendar, my address and contact book, my main way of checking emails, my keeper of sentimental photos I should have saved elsewhere and important notes of things to look up later.

As someone who was born with absolutely zero sense of direction, digital maps are the only way I ever manage to find my way anywhere outside my suburb.

Not to mention that since the pandemic — especially for the many, often younger, people who had to lockdown alone — phones became our main source of connection to the outside world. While couples were allowed to connect with their partners in real life, singles weren’t allowed that same courtesy with a trusted friend or family member for much of the lockdown.

How are we copping up?

Over half of us have turned to binge watching, 43 per cent are stress eating (which gets even higher when you isolate Gen Z, at 58 per cent), 22 per cent are drinking excessively and 15 per cent are turning to online shopping.

“While there’s certainly more optimism that we’re moving into brighter times, there’s a huge number of Aussies who are feeling heightened stress,” said psychologist Noosha Anzab.

“In 2022, we have to remember people are facing their new ‘reality’ post lockdowns, which may include changes in finances, relationships, and work and career.”

What can we do about it?? 👇🏻
