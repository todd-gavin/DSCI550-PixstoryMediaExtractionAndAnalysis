Lukaku Inter can be done The parties seemed to have drifted apart given the requests from one side Chelsea would have wanted millions of euros for the loan and the few funds they could put on the field from the other to a positive conclusion somehow And the way would have been found The Nerazzurri could take on the player&#39;s signing saving Chelsea around million euros The Belgian striker earns net millions In this way Lukaku&#39;s loan request could be lowered to a tens of millions of euros even if Inter would like to reach In this way, the Blues would not throw heavy money since Tuchel would use Lukaku as he did last season, i.e. with a dropper Another card in favor of Inter Denzel Dumfries that Chelsea likes The assessment of the Blues of a few million euros for Inter but a second hypothesis to be able to get to Lukaku therefore should not be discarded
