Freedom is a state of being unchained to escape in the wilderness without fear Freedom brings harmony and requires a sense of responsibility Freedom for me is to accept and project myself just the way I am To me in this modern world people need to have freedom from screening This world of screen makes everyone believe that Success depends on the number of luxurious cars you purchase walk in fancy restaurant to have an apartment sized closet and so on All these curb human mind and close the doors of creativity making them follow the crowd rather than seeking their own abilities and rare gifts Moreover this screen world has made Freedom today just an another word for desire and chaos so much as so that it has chained people s mind Freedom is not about having the power to do anything or everything as it can lead to immorality Freedom requires oneself to be able to acknowledge who he she is To realise one s self worth to be connected with one s roots to control our impulsive reactions to forgive oneself All these qualities develop a person to be free from the contraints of society pressure to fit in and so on My way of freedom is to embrace what comes on my way rather than grumbling because even to get the best scenic view we need to climb a hill There are many areas of life in our world where freedom is yet to step in However we must work on ourselves first to bring a change Deliverance comes with decision let s decide to free our soul of everything that our mind has filled in it
