Klamath Falls city councillors unanimously approved to rename Kit Carson Park to Eulalona Park. 

Oregon Live reported that before present-day Klamath Falls, there was a Native American hamlet called Eulalona near the park site. According to Jefferson Public Radio, the city began discussing renaming the park after a Klamath Falls equality task force recommended it last year. 

Kit Carson was a 19th-century frontiersman who was notorious for slaughtering nearby Native American tribes. 

“I just think it’s appropriate to, in light of the history of Kit Carson, to honor our Native people and to honor them with a park,” City Councilor Phil Studenberg said.

Using an online survey, the Parks Advisory Board sought community recommendations for new park names. 

Sunshine Park, Discovery Park, and Yadenite Park, called for a yellowish rock discovered in the vicinity, were among the final name alternatives, in addition to Eulalona.
“I just think it’s appropriate to, in light of the history of Kit Carson, to honor our Native people and to honor them with a park,” City Councilor Phil Studenberg said.

In a recent community survey, almost 60% of respondents favored renaming the park, according to the city.
