Even though I'm not a big advocate for "ageing slow", I do respect women's choice to do so. However, sunscreen has more than just aesthetical benefits.
UV radiation is the type of light that can cause skin cancer. Exposure to UV radiation over a long period of time can lead to melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. In fact, sunscreen is one of the most effective ways to prevent skin cancer.
There are 4 main types of melanoma skin cancer – superficial spreading, nodular, lentigo maligna and acral lentiginous. The vast majority of skin cancer deaths are from melanoma. Nearly 20 Americans die from melanoma every day. In 2022, it is estimated that 7,650 deaths will be attributed to melanoma — 5,080 men and 2,570 women
Sunscreen also helps protect your eyes from damage caused by UV radiation. This is because sunscreen filters out both UVA and UVB rays, which are the types of rays that cause eye damage. Moreover, sunscreen reduces the amount of skin pigmentation in the area near your eyes, which makes it less likely that you will be exposed to dangerous levels of UV radiation from the sun.
Unfortunately for us, most of the world cannot afford to add this essential to their skincare routine, and how will they when they can barely afford food. There's not much we, as an individual, can do about it except trying to change the system.
