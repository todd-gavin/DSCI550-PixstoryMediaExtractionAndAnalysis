Virat Kohli recorded yet another failure to perish for just 1. He miscued a Richard Gleeson delivery and the result was a fine catch by Dawid Malan, who ran backwards to complete the grab.

Amidst Kohli's continued lean patch, the debate over his form remains a hot topic of debate. The star batter has looked a pale shadow of himself of late and Ajay Jadeja said he wouldn't pick Kohli in his T20 side, especially when the team has shelled out a new template of playing aggressive cricket.

"You have been shown that there is another way of playing the same game. You are still scoring around 180 to 200. It's not that the game has changed, but you have a choice of how you want to play. I think Rohit Sharma will be making that call," Jadeja told Sony Sports.
