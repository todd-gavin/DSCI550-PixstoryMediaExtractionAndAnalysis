Luca Magliano is truly an emerging designer because he is years old and above all because he launched his eponymous brand in In Italy a designer is labeled as emerging or as a young premise until he is years old, indeed perhaps he does so until he is successful of brands such as Prada and Gucci In Italy, however, it is not understood or at least many that until a young creative is compared to maisons that have existed for years and more this will always remain young emerging and even small Magliano always sets his collections at night usually these are the Romagna nights in which he used to dance and have fun but this night is different A sense of flat calm a night darker than the others a night on the other side of the Adriatic as Jacopo Bedussi defined it on GQ The collection does not have a common thread i pieces are not characterized by the same cuts or by a precise chromatic range They are beautiful made and very well made and combined with each other they are dignified and elegant And perhaps indeed I am quite convinced of all this
