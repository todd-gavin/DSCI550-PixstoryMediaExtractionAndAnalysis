Belgian outlet Voetbal Flitsen claims that, Leeds, Newcastle and Crystal Palace are all in the running to sign Napoli veteran Dries Mertens. The 35-year-old contract is all set to expire and will become a free agent.

Napoli’s all time record goalscorer with 148 goals, Mertens is all set to end his nine-year-old spell with Napoli - just three games shy of 400.

The race is hotting up to sign the free agent and a move to England to come about.

Leeds have already made two signings in Brenden Aaronson and Rasmus Kristensen - 
but competition for Patrick Bamford and Joe Gelhardt is likely. Newcastle made Matty Targett’s loan a permanent deal on Wednesday.

Crystal Palace has numerous options up front in Jean-Philippe Mateta, Christian Benteke and Jordan Ayew - but could look to improve. The report claims, Newcastle are in the best position to get him, due to their financial powers.

Mertens is a wonderful player. A pocket-sized striker in a similar mould to the likes of Lionel Messi and Diego Maradona, in that he can play as a number 9 despite his 5 feet 5 inches stature.

Mertens can also play as a false nine, a number 10 or on either flank. He has clocked up 104 caps for Belgium and shows no sign of slowing down - proofs, there are still many years left in his legs.

He would break the wage structure at Leeds. Palace could tempt him, living in London for the last couple of years of his career. But surely, the cash on offer at Newcastle will be tempting if he is to move to the Premier League.
