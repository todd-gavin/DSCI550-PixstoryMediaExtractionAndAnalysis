Arsenal have reportedly decided how much they'd accept to let go of record-signing Nicolas Pepe this summer – and it could cost them a lot more than they paid for him.

The Ivory Coast international arrived at the Emirates in 2019 for a club-record fee, but he has struggled to hold down a regular spot in Mikel Arteta's starting line-up in recent seasons.

 And the Gunners are said to be willing to cut their losses on the former Lille star this summer if the right price is offered. 

It comes as the Gunners believe they have an advantage over bitter rivals Tottenham Hotspur in the race to sign Leicester City playmaker James Maddison.

 And Mikel Arteta is said to have cost Arsenal the opportunity to sign "one of the best midfielders in the world."
Marseille manager Jorge Sampaoli believes Matteo Guendouzi is on his way to becoming one of the "best midfielders in the world."

The former Arsenal player joined Ligue 1 side Marseille on loan last summer and will officially join them in the summer transfer window after the French club's president Pablo Longoria confirmed the deal's clauses were met. 

And it appears that his current club is pleased with his performances this season, with his manager heaping praise on him ahead of the weekend's round of fixtures.
Arsenal, believe they have a significant advantage in their pursuit of Leicester City's James Maddison.

 The Gunners are reportedly set to compete with bitter north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur for the signing of the playmaker, who could be available for around £60 million this summer. However, Maddison's glowing mention of Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka could imply that the Leicester star would be eager to team up with him on the field. And that could give Mikel Arteta a chance to outdo his bitter rivals the Spurs and sign Maddison.
