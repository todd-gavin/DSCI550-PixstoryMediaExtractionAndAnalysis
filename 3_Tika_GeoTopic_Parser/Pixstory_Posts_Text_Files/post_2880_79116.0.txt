For 18 years, Facebook has been drawing more and more people in its social network. Now, however, the line on the graph going that was only higher and higher has been halted for the first time in its history. FB’s growth is stagnating around the world, according to the parent company Meta’s quarterly earnings report released this week: https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2022/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2021-Results/default.aspx 

One quarter may not be enough to raise doubts about the FB phenomenon’s longevity, yet Meta has to face the question that was not raised so far. Its stock fell about 20 percent after Wednesday’s news: https://www.barrons.com/articles/facebook-meta-stock-price-earnings-51643759349 

In the last three months of 2021, the number of daily users on FB went down by about half a million users, to 1.93 billion. (Curiously, the number of ‘monthly’ users has continued to grow, and so has the revenue per user.): https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/02/02/facebook-earnings-meta/ 

The firm has seen an explosive growth. In 2004, Mark Zuckerberg started it from a dorm in Harvard and by 2012 it had 1 billion monthly active users. The next milestone, 2 billion, was crossed in just five years. But by then it had got on board all who could join it in the US and Europe. Then it continued to fuel its expansion by focusing on developing countries. In the latet quarter, the drop has come mainly from Africa and Latin America. This is an indication that what happened in the developed markets – saturation, peaking out – might be happening in developing markets too.

The news comes at a time when the recently renamed parent firm is facing challenges on several fronts. After a major leak about its lax security procedures, it is facing scrutiny from regulators in the US and elsewhere. Its competitors like TikTok and YouTube are gaining ground: https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60238565 And it aims to make an ambitious transition to ‘metaverse’: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/02/technology/meta-facebook-earnings-metaverse.html Its hardware division has posted a $3.3 billion loss in the quarter: 

But all is not gloom and doom for Meta. Its other apps – Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger – have continued to add users though in modest numbers.
