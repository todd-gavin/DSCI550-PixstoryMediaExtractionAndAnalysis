Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia's week started in an eventful manner, the Central Bureau of Investigation on Monday summoned Sisodia for questioning him in connection with the alleged scam in Delhi excise policy case.
Sisodia started his day by visiting the party office from where he proceeded to Rajghat. 
In August, the CBI registered an FIR in special court in Delhi against Sisodia and 14 others under various sections of Indian Penal Code, including 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 477A (falsification of records), and section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which deals taking undue advantage to influence  a public servant by corrupt or illegal means, or by the exercise of personal influence. 
The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) called it a "second freedom struggle" after Sisodia was framed in false cases to arrest him.
