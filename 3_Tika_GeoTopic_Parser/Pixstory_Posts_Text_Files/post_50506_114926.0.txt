Our Internal Assessment got over at the end of this weekend and we were just deliberately waiting for the Sunday to come cause its Eid🥳🥳

We live in a same hostel, we decorate our room, wear the best clothes we have, cook good food, spend quality time with the friends and we also went out today on the occasion of Eid.

Well! this day is not over and there are still lot to more to celebrate and excited for the savai to be made in night.😍
