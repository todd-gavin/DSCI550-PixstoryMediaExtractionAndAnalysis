Zach Braff and Florence Pugh have split up, but don't worry, dear, it sounds like they're still friendly.

The actress, 26, and the Scrubs alum, 47, acknowledged their separation in a cover story for Harper's BAZAAR's September ICONS edition. Since everyone has an opinion on their relationship, Pugh told the source, "We've been trying to do this separation without the world knowing." "We simply believed that doing something similar would prevent millions of people from telling us how pleased they are that we are not together. So that's what we did."

The actors, who initially ignited romance rumours in 2019, made headlines for their age difference throughout their relationship, which Pugh frequently defended. She thought of the attention their romance garnered during her conversation with Harper's. "I think it's incredibly wrong," she said. "Whenever I feel like that line has been crossed in my life, whether it's paparazzi taking private moments, or moments that aren't even real, or gossip channels that encourage members of the public to share private moments of famous people walking down the street. "I disagree that people should have every element of their lives documented and observed simply because they work in this field. We are not participants in a reality TV programme."

Despite the fact that Pugh and Braff are no longer together, she is excited about the debut of the screenplay he penned for their film A Good Person.

Pugh praised the picture, which is scheduled for release in 2023, saying, "The movie that we made together honestly was maybe one of my most favourite experiences." It appeared quite natural and simple to execute.

Another project in Pugh's mind? 

She co-stars in the movie Don't Worry Darling with Harry Styles and Olivia Wilde as the director.
