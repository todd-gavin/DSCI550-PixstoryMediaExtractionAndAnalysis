Chelsea have been interested in Frenkie de Jong for weeks, but they know that Manchester United have an agreement with Barcelona, and also that Frenkie as of today has no plans to leave Spain.
So far, De Jong remains on the same idea - so Chelsea will not submit offers until they know that Frenkie has different ideas.
