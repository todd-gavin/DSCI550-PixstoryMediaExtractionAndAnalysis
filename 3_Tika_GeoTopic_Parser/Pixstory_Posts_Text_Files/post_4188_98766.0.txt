‌The President's Colour Award is the highest honour that can be bestowed upon any military unit of India. The presentation of the award is an acknowledgement of the unit's excellent service. 
‌
‌It is also known as ′Nishaan′ which is an emblem that is by all unit officers on the left-hand sleeve of their uniform. In the Indian context, 'Colours or Standards' are also known as 'Dhwajs or Patakas'. The idea of dhwajs has also origins in the 'Vedas' and 'Puranas'. The armies of the king or emperor also carry the 'Dhwajs'. If the army lost its dhwajs at the hands of the enemy, then it means disgrace and if the army captures the dhwaja of the enemy, then it means an honour. If the army accepts the was of the King/Emperor, then it means that the army has accepted the hegemony of that King/Emperor.
‌
‌While the technique of carrying the Colour into battle has stopped, the tradition of receiving, holding and parading the Colour continues even today in the Armed forces. The President's Colours are very significant if the unit loses its colours, it is a disgrace for that unit and, if the unit captured the enemy's colours then it is a great honour for that unit.
‌
‌The President's Colours/Standard/Guidon is one of the greatest honours bestowed in tribute to exceptional service rendered by it to the nation, both during war and peace. The 'Standards' are awarded to Heavy Cavalry and the 'Guidons' are awarded to Light Cavalry
‌
