When Natalie Portman returns as Jane in #ThorLoveAndThunder, she'll not only be playing a superhero - the Mighty Thor- but one who can stand toe-to-toe, and nearly eye-to-eye, with Chris Hemsworth's Thor. "On 'Black Swan, I was asked to get as small as possible," Portman tells Variety. "Here, I was asked to get as big as possible. That's an amazing challenge and also state of mind as a woman."

In our cover story, Portman opens up about her superhero physical transformation, the upcoming "Lady in the Lake" limited series, and her work as the co-founder of Angel City Football Club.
