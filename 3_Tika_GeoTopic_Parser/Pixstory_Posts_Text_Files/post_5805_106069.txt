Jurassic World Dominion the third part of the Jurassic World trilogy is here Starring Chris Pratt Bryce Dallas Howard with Laura Dern Jeff Goldblum Sam Neill coming back to the world of dinosaurs after Jurassic World Dominion takes place years after its prequel after the destruction of Isla Nublar in Fallen Kingdom Dinosaurs live alongside humans all over the globe How this complex relationship between humans dinosaurs affects the planet and will humans remain the apex predators or fall to the might of history s most fearsome creatures makes the rest of the story Just as in previous movies the Dominion is more of the same An amazing cash cow for the studio but unnecessary for moviegoers The co existence angle for sure excites us as it is something new for the audience but during the second half it takes a complete U turn and we are back to the previous movies Humans running dinosaurs hunting an evil billionaire scientist all we have seen thousand times before The X factor is missing except for a bike chase scene with Chris Pratt which is fun but that s it The movie is all about feeling nostalgic thus bringing back original stars from Jurassic park as well as the T Rex Believe me throughout the six Jurassic movies T Rex is the biggest star of these movies He is like Optimus prime from transformers you can t make a Jurassic movie without this anti hero T Rex is like the terminator he was the villian in part now he saves everybody s ass I can understand the nostalgia with these movies it s something I feel with Tobey Maguire s Spiderman For fans of the original it is indeed a treat but for our generation it s just a boring predictable monster movie
