Some people think that the terms Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, and Deep Learning are the same. But these terms are different from one another. 

Artificial Intelligence is a broad term that can include Machine learning and Deep Learning inside it. Machine learning provides different techniques that would be helpful to achieve the goal of AI. We can say that Machine Learning can be the subset of Artificial Intelligence. However, Deep learning is the subset of Machine Learning. It is used to solve large complex problems using neural networks.

Artificial Intelligence is broadly categorized into four types:
1. Reactive machines: This type of AI has a short memory. They do not store previous memories. The IBM chess game program will be the perfect example of Reactive machines. 
2. Limited memory Artificial Intelligence: As the name suggests, it has limited memory. Self-driving cars are examples of Limited Memory AI.
3. Theory of mind Artificial Intelligence: These types of AI are under processing. It aims to make machines that can hold humans like emotion and thoughts.
4. Self-aware Artificial Intelligence: These are the advanced versions of AI. It is believed that it will be more intelligent than humans.


Artificial Intelligence can have both positive as well as negative impacts on society. The applications of Artificial Intelligence are making human tasks much easier. This could result in the loss of human jobs. The implementation cost of Artificial Intelligence is quite high and skilled workers are required for their development.

However, it is expected that a machine could take human-like decisions but what will happen if humans lose control of them?

Therefore, the impact of Artificial Intelligence is still a matter of debate in society.
