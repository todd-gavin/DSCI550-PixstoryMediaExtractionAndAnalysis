What will begin shortly for Juventus will be the year of redemption or at least so hope all the fans and management who are making a high-level transfer market to immediately return to winning in Italy and dreaming in Europe The new cycle will have a new captain after Chiellini&#39;s farewell This year the armband will be on Bonucci&#39;s arm the first to speak from the American tour after the victory in the night against the Mexicans of Chivas Guadalajara This year that is about to begin sees Juventus eager to return to compete for the first position I spoke with Allegri said Bonucci I saw the desire to win again The club is making major investments to be at the top In the last two seasons we have been below his expectations we aim to return to Juventus in Italy and in Europe Among the new additions there too Pogba that little boy who had left Turin for Manchester returned as a man He understood that today&#39;s Juventus is perhaps a step behind the one that had left him at the center of the project and of the group he will be fundamental I told him we had a great we need the Pogba we know that I have never seen the real Paul in Manchester and now I expect to see him again at Juve Bonucci will find himself different teammates in defense compared to previous years Chiellini is no longer flown to Los Angeles De Ligt too he said goodbye to everyone to marry Bayern Munich for millions of euros Bonucci had something to say about the Dutchman Some of his statements made it clear that he did not want to stay at Juventus But I think that at the base of everything you need respect for the group with which he was served for three years to grow and the club has invested in him I wish him the best for certain phrases said in the national team were not very nice We talked about it after the holidays and he understood Bayern is a great club but it did not say that in a top team you are destined to WIN
