Vegan diets can make a healthy lifestyle if it is planned correctly.
Studies have shown that veganism helps to reduce cardiovascular diseases.
David Rogerson, at Sheffield Hallam University, found from his research,
 “There’s growing evidence that reduced consumption of animal products, coupled with an increase in plant-based foods, seems good for our health. This is perhaps due to these foods containing a lot of antioxidant phytonutrients and nitrates. In contrast, some animal products contain lots of pro-inflammatory fats and lead to the production of a metabolite called TMAO, which has been linked to cardiovascular problems.”
 
Many studies have found that those who were vegan had the lowest risk of hypertension and the lowest BMIs, compared to participants eating a vegetarian diet or a plant-based diet that included small amounts of animal foods. In addition, other research on this cohort has linked veganism to better cholesterol levels, reduced inflammation and lower rates of heart disease.


Research published in 2014 looked at 198 patients to further investigate whether eating a strict plant-based diet could stop or reverse heart disease. It found that of the 177 patients who stuck to the diet, the majority reported a reduction in symptoms, and 22 per cent had disease reversal confirmed by test results. But that study didn’t just rule out animal products – it also cut out added oils, processed foods, sugar, refined carbohydrates, excess salt, fruit juice, avocado, and nuts. Physical activity was also encouraged, and prescribed medication continued.

So veganism can prove to have good health benefits.
