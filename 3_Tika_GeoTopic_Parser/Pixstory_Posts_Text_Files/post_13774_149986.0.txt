For anything and everything they want to know, the current generation visits the search engines in the internet. All information is found in search engines is the popular belief. In all probability, the search engines, too, have started believing in the theory. In fact, they have gone one step ahead – it seems they feel they are blessed with a gift of prophecy. Only recently a popular search engine predicted the two finalists of the 2022 Qatar World Cup months before the start of the tournament. In a weird mistake, the said search engine showed Brazil and France as the two finalists of the upcoming World Cup.
The World Cup final is set to be hosted by the Lusail Stadium in Qatar. The stadium is set to host a total of ten matches in the FIFA World Cup 2022, including one semi-final tie and the all-important final on December 18.  For a brief period early this week, a search query of – “Lusail Stadium events” showed Brazil vs France listed as the final of the World Cup on December 18. While it remains unclear if it was a technical error on part of the search engine, the mistake was rectified within a few hours.
Knockout matches in football and other sports with no confirmed teams are usually displayed as “TBC” when searched through the engine. However, Brazil vs France listed as the finalists left many bewildered on social media as a screenshot of the search query and its results went viral. While they are not certain to make it to the summit clash, France and Brazil remain two of the strongest contenders for the title at the upcoming World Cup. Defending champions France have continued their dominance after lifting the trophy in 2018 and have remarkable quality in their ranks to pull off a successful World Cup defence this year. Brazil, on the other hand, have been on the rise once again under head coach Tite and have extraordinary depth with the likes of Neymar, Vinicius Jr, Gabriel Jesus, Antony and Raphinha among others in their line-up.
