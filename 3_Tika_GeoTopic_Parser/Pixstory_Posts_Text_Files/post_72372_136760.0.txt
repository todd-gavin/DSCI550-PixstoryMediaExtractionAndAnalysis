Actor Tiger Shroff made a wild guess about veteran actors Amitabh Bachchan and Rekha when he appeared on the chat show Koffee With Karan season 7. In the latest episode of the show hosted by filmmaker Karan Johar, Tiger and actor Kriti Sanon were the guests. 

During a quiz segment at the end of the episode, Karan asked Kriti and Tiger Shroff, "Name any actor who has played Amitabh Bachchan's lover and mother?" As Kriti replied, "Yeah I'm not very sure", Tiger pressed the buzzer and answered uncertainly, "Rekha ma'am?" A visibly shocked Karan looked at Tiger and asked, "What?"
As Tiger took a step back, Karan clutched his chest and said, "no" laughing. He then fumbled and continued, "No. She didn't..never played his mother. Waheeda Rehman who played his lover and his mother, as has Rakhee, as has Sharmila Tagore." Tiger then said, "I was thinking that." Karan then asked, "Okay, you were thinking that?"

Waheeda Rehman played Amitabh's lover in movies such as Kabhi Kabhie. She then played his mother in Namak Halaal and Trishul among others.
