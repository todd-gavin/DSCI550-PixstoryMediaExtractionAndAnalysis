Claudio Ranieri has been sacked by the Watford football club only after three months in charge. Ranieri managed the team over fourteen games fishing out only two wins out of them. 

There has been no improvement under Ranieri, whose greatest achievement was helping Leicester win the title in 2016. 
The next Watford manager position is still up for grabs as candidates like Rafa Benitez and Frank Lampard also being considered.
