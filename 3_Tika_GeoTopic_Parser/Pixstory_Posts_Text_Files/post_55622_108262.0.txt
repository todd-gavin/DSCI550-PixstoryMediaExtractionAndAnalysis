Cult comedy duo fans, rejoice: The whole fourth season of Jane Turner and Gina Riley's classic Y2K-era sitcom, which aired from 2002 to 2007 and included two stand-alone films (2005's Da Kath & Kim Code and 2012's Kath & Kimderella), is now accessible on Netflix. 

A suburban comedy filmed with a mockumentary cinéma vérité lens—think This is Spinal Tap meets mall-walking Melbourne—Kath & Kim stars Turner as Kath Day-Knight, a brassy, fitness-loving empty nester, and Riley as Kim Craig, Kath’s romantically flighty, self-obsessed adult daughter. 

Kath & Kim is the ultimate slice (pun intended) of Australian television history. Broad, awkward, and goofy to the extreme, Kath & Kim is the ultimate slice (pun intended) of Australian television history.

As a bonus: Already the ne plus ultra of mother-daughter cringe comedy, Kath & Kim manages nevertheless to up the absurdist ante with the fact that Turner and Craig are just one year apart in age — a surreal detail echoed by one of today’s own cringe cult comedies, PEN15. It’s the circle of (satiric) life!
