Getting a tattoo is a personal choice and should be respected! In an era where we are continuously fighting for rights over our bodies saying that tattoos are a bad idea is unfair.

Moreover, employers are becoming more tolerant of visible tattoos! 

As BBC pointed out , Body painting will no longer be prohibited, according to Air New Zealand, allowing employees to exhibit their uniqueness and cultural heritage. This is testimony to how times are changing! 

Additionally, the London Metropolitan Police announced last year that it will now consider tattoos "on a case by case basis" rather than outright prohibiting the recruitment of candidates with body art.

Therefore, it is evident that the mindset of people for tattoos is changing and the job market should not deter people from expressing themselves through tattoos!
