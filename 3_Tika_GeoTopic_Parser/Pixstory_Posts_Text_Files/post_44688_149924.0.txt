‘Operation LEGHORN’ and the
Battle of the Namka Chu continues....
Thus was the name and title of 7 Infantry Brigade given to the miscellany of troops hurriedly marshaled for what was thought would be a limited show of force. Having been caught napping Army HQ sought to restore the position by collecting the first unfortunate units they could lay their hands on. The so-called 7 Brigade did not have any affiliation, no collective training and no time to get to know each other. It normally takes months of joint training as a formation to mould a team, develop mutual trust and confidence and to practise battle drills. Three battalions grouped together at the eleventh hour do not form a fighting brigade.
7 Brigade of 4 Infantry Division could thus in no way be compared to what it was as part of 4 Infantry Division during the Second World War, when the division had become famous in North Africa as the ‘Red Eagles’.
After the outbreak of firing at the Namka Chu from September 20 onwards, Gen. Thapar asked for the decision regarding ‘Op LEGHORN’ to be reconsidered. The meeting was held on 22nd September, presided over by Deputy Defence Minister, K.Raghuramaiah in the absence of both Nehru and Krishna Menon. The Foreign Secretary re-iterated the Prime Minster’s views, and after some discussion it was decided that as a matter of policy there was no alternative but to evict the Chinese from the Dhola area. Gen. Thapar requested for a written order of the government to that effect. As a result, he received a note signed by the Joint Secretary, Ministry of 
Defence, stating:
The decision throughout has been as discussed at previous meetings, that the Army should prepare and throw the Chinese out as soon as possible. The COAS was accordingly directed to take action for the eviction of the Chinese in the Kameng Frontier Division of NEFA as soon as he is ready.
