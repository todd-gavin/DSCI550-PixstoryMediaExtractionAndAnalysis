Have you ever asked the question - What else are you doing with this?

This what else is problematic which no would understand how much!

Ya, this question which sometime is enough to irritate , or trigger someone! 
I am grateful that I am able to do this thing.

You have a greater capacity to do things , while someone is unable to do a single thing at a time.

Sometimes someone is struggling mentally , which make them to not catch up in this life's race.

And sometimes it's not even about anything , it's just about pace.

But this hustle culture made us forget what we are doing, how well we are doing it from our past self , we just remember how others are too ahead of us .

Seeing every other person doing something makes you feel like you are too slow to catch up.

Expectations make it too difficult to except that you can relax and go on your pace, expectations of your loved ones and your one is like a burden we are carrying on for so long and needs to be released.

Remember you can take a break and keep doing things at your pace!
