Today is the day when two teams will see the ultimate dream but only one will achieve it. Yes, I am talking about the final of the UEFA Champions League where Real Madrid and Liverpool will play against each other to win the silverware and the winner will be crowned as European Champion.

When the stakes are so high, pressure will be there too. When Real Madrid beat Liverpool in the 2017-2018 Champions League final, there was a reason behind that why Real Madrid won that match and the only reason for that win was “experience.” 

After losing Mohammad Salah because of injury Liverpool lacked the experience and the star power to intimidate Real Madrid and because of that Real Madrid won their 13th UCL but now the scenario is changed because, after that final, Liverpool won the UCL and Premier League once and their squad is very much the same and their growth is unmatchable.

On the other hand, Real Madrid saw many ups and downs because of many senior player’s departures in the last four years but Real Madrid never looked weak because in the last four years, Real Madrid won La Liga twice and reached the semifinal of UCL once and now they are back in the final of UEFA Champions League after beating Paris Saint Germain, Chelsea FC, and Manchester City.

As a neutral fans, we can’t say that either of the team didn’t deserve to be in the final of the Champions League and before the starting whistle of the final match, both teams are equally deserving to win the match and they can create history.

Key players for Real Madrid will be Fede Valverde, Karim Benzema and Casemiro and on the other hand, Trent Alexander Arnold, Thiago Alcantara, and Luis Diaz can play a big role in Liverpool’s victory.

As a Real Madrid fan, I want my team to win the UEFA Champions League final and make all the Madrid fans happy around the world.
