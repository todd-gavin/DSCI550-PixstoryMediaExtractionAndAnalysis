Hot on the heels of Sneaker Con in Anaheim this weekend, eBay will open Wear 'Em Out, a brick-and-mortar sneaker shop on Fairfax Avenue, on Memorial Day weekend. The shop will feature exclusive stock of new season styles and collectables, such as the Jordan 1 Retro High OG Patent Bred and the Yeezy Boost 700 Wave Runner. In addition, the store launches with an underlining mission: to reward sneakerheads for actually wearing their new kicks out of the store with an additional discount.

"Most people can identify with that feeling of getting a new pair of shoes that you love so much, you just have to wear them out of the store," said Garry Thaniel, GM of sneakers at eBay. But, he added, "The Wear' Em Out Store celebrates a love of sneakers while acknowledging that sneakerheads often balance what they wear with what they keep in the box. eBay is the place to find every style and price, and now we're offering an incentive to lace up the most coveted summer sneakers." 

According to a recent survey commissioned by eBay, most respondents said they wear less than half of their collections. To that end, The Wear them Out Store is designed to encourage sneakerheads to show off their favourite styles on their feet this summer.
