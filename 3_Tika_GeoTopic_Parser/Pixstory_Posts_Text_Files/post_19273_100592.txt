David Moyes was a hero for the Evertonians for more than a decade the chosen one at certainly one of the biggest clubs in the world in Manchester United where it all started going downhill after he replaced one great Scotman He is surely is right at the top for his long years of service in England and Europe for coaching A certain East London club in West Ham United came calling for him in for the managerial role and it all started turning bright for both parties A slow process at the start but fruits and results were there to be seen as time progressed and it felt like in no time Moyesy had the Irons competing and competing on a greater level well and truly West Ham were relegation battlers until some years ago and now after some brilliant recruitment and managerial decisions patience and backing with full strength the club and the fans are a constant threat for the European places among the traditional big six of the Premier League David Moyes is indeed doing a tremendous and commendable job with the London club and all this with fewer demands been fulfilled due to the financial conditions and various other causes He is another fine example of not giving up which has resulted in a redemption for himself and the club as a whole It is like the stars were aligned when he was picked for the West Ham managerial job and ironically he somehow proves how he is the chosen one however it may have come his way A story which tells us that you have got to be patient and success doesn t catch up with you overnight and how beautiful is the journey of sweat tears pain to happiness satisfaction and a feeling of being proud The game keeps teaching us life lessons in ways we never knew it would oh football
