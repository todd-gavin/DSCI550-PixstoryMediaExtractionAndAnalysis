AC/DC, the legendary rock band, is no stranger to selling out venues all over the world. For the past few decades, the band has been continually writing, producing, and playing incredible music. There isn't much they can't accomplish. In every way, shape, and form, they are incredible.
Do you recall the band performing in front of nearly 70,000 people in Donington Park in 1991? All rock enthusiasts will remember this concert as a historic event!
AC/DC headed to the stage to sing Thunderstruck, which is possibly their most popular song ever recorded. As with any large crowd (especially when AC/DC is performing), the audience goes completely crazy and all jump in sync to the song. It's a sight to behold, but let's be honest, AC/DC wouldn't have it any other way!
The two-hour show featured real cannons, the Hells Bell, an inflatable Rosie, and two inflatable Anguses: one to the right of the stage during Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be, and one to the back of the stage during Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be. It was shot in 35 mm Panavision using 26 cameras, one of which was mounted inside a helicopter. Special features on the DVD include stereo and 5.1 surround sound, Iso-cam versions of select songs for different band members, and Angus and Malcolm Young's audio commentary.Â
