Magnificent heavenly light filters through the wispy clouds signifying a new day The thin clouds slowly drift apart presenting a beautiful sky above Speaking out to me the sky seems to know every one of my thoughts my dreams my darkest fears The sky is but a canvas of light creating a new picture within seconds Weaving a story through the delicate clouds the picture grows beyond the expanse of sky The colors splay before me stunning and simple Pink hues morph into vibrant purples as they blend with the beautiful blues The glittering stretch of sea shines before my eyes With every new wave the light from above whispers promises of riches and sparkling diamonds The swift breeze that kisses the sea sends the twinkling light back into the air above
