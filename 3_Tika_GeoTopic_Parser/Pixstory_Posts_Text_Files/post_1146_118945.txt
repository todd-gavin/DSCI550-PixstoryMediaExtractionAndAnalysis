Ashik Second year B Com student St Gregorios College Kottarakara I was in class XII when we went for a tour to Ooty a hill resort in Tamil Nadu known for its pine trees and tea plantation from my school Inside the bus we were told to sit in two separate groups by our teachers Girls in the front boys at the back and teachers like buffer zones in a Reserve forest in the middle A few hours into the journey many of us were already regretting why we even thought about coming for a tour like this But there was little we could do anyway The entire journey was about hours By the time we reached Ooty we were so happy and relieved that the ordeal was finally over How wrong were we As soon as we deboarded there was another set of instructions Boys and girls were to move around only in their respective groups and in two different directions Those who dared to break the rules or tried chatting up with girls were mocked in front of everyone The only time we got to mix freely was in the evening when we were about to return We were so happy that we finally got some time to chat and dance together inside the bus Exhausted we retired to our respective seats I was joined by a female friend of mine who also came and sat next to me We were so lost in conversation when one of our teachers who spotted us together started yelling at us without any provocation At first we didn t understand why we were being yelled at The teacher was so insistent that we were up to some mischief But when we denied doing anything wrong she got angrier and started humiliating us in front of everyone and even threatening that our parents will be informed Even today after more than two years I still cringe at the humiliation and trauma which I endured that night As told to thapasya The series is a part of a VVOX initiative against moral policing
