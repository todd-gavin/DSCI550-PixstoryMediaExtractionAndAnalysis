By the end of the month Marotta wants to give Simone Inzaghi the squad for next season And he is continuing to deal with more players with his staff and someone has already closed him Like Kristjan Asllani from Empoli for whom there has been intense dialogue with the Tuscan club for weeks At lunch yesterday the negotiation was closed even if the signatures are still missing The player will wear the Inter shirt with an agreement found in this way Empoli was asking for millions of euros but Marotta will give him some this year as a loan and next year for the definitive purchase In addition there will be a counterpart that has not yet been defined All Empoli should still go Martin Satriano who is very popular with the Tuscan club The Argentinian player would prefer to stay in Milan but would find very little space and therefore would be convincing himself to accept Empoli&#39;s offer
