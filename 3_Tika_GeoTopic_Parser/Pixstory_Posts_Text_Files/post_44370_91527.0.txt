Two of English football's titans meet in the ever- prestigious FA Cup in a fortnight. JÃ¼rgen Klopp's Liverpool are on fire at the moment, having reduced the deficit to just a singular point at the top (considering City win their game in hand). 

Next week, City and Liverpool go head to head at the Etihad, in what will be seen as the potential tie-breaker in this season's Premier league race. In Europe of course, both Pep Guardiola and Klopp remain highly ambitious in their pursuit to win this year's Champions League. It is their FA Cup game though, that brings about today's story.

With Wembley chosen as the venue for the semi final, with Engineering works ongoing in and around Central London, preventing fans from travelling to and from the stadium with ease. Without direct trains to London, fans of both teams will have to look for alternate ways to reach the 90,000 seater stadium. 

Liverpool Captain Jordan Henderson and manager Jurgen Klopp criticised the FA's decision, deeming it nonsensical. Even with the FA's initiative to provide upto 5,000 fans with free coaches, getting to London is a task in itself. Naturally, both City and Liverpool fans and staff are not best pleased. 

Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson criticised the decision, saying: "I've been thinking a bit more about the fans," he said. "In many ways, it's their day, and not being able to get down to London for different reasons - the cost of that.

"In my head, it would make sense obviously to change it to a (different) neutral venue, especially with it being two teams from the north-west".
