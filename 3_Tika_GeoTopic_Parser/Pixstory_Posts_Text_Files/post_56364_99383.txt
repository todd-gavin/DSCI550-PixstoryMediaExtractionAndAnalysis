Social Media isn t always about toxicity It gives a platform for many to express their opinion Many people get to know news from social media rather than from other mass media Many viewpoints are discussed on social media We almost get the different and individual opinions of people Social media algorithm is set in such a way that we always see what we what to see in our feed So it is easy to choose positivity Everything should be discussed on social media Not only social issues Now social media has become a platform for mainly social issues Why arent people sharing their achievements goals happiness something they made anything and everything that makes them happy Please post and share your happiness and let it be an inspiration for others to do so Yes you can choose your content but always try to give a mixture of content as there is always a silver lining to every cloud or at least that is the hope with which we live So instead of blaming social media or detoxifying from it Try to control your content and access to it Restrict anything unwanted to you and I would suggest an option in every app to make positive and good comments as the priority and make a choice to see all the other comments Have a great day
