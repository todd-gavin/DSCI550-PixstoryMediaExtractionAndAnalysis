Thailand on Thursday (9th June , 2022)  became the first country in Asia to decriminalise cannabis.

 However, tough penalties will still apply to those who use the drug to get high, said Thai Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul.

In an interview, Anutin Charnvirakul said the move to decriminalise legal production of cannabis is taken to boost the economy. He also cautioned that recreational use of the drug still remains illegal.

"We still have regulations under the law that control the consumption, smoking or use of cannabis products in non-productive ways," said Anutin Charnvirakul.

Under decriminalisation, growing and trading marijuana and hemp products or use parts of the plant to treat illnesses is not a crime.

After this step is taken , many other country will give this idea a thought .
