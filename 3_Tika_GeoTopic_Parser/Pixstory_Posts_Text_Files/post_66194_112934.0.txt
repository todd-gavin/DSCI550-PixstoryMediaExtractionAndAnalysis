Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Sunday pledged further military support to Ukraine, including armoured vehicles and drones, while meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv.

Making the first ever visit to Ukraine by an Australian premier, Albanese said at a news conference in Kyiv that his country would give Ukraine "a hundred million dollars of military support", without specifying if he meant Australian dollars.

This figure in Australian dollars would amount to US$68 million.

The prime minister specified that Australia would provide extra military equipment requested by Ukraine including 14 armoured personnel carriers, 20 Bushmaster armoured vehicles and a number of drones.

Personally I don't like the idea of supplying more weaponry in an area of war, but Russia has all the might, so Ukraine would be willing to welcome any aid that they can get
