Brahmastra is the talk of the town Everyone simply cannot get enough of it with lead cast of Ranbir Kapoor Alia Bhatt and Amitabh Bachchan ji everyone expects the movie to do well Though the concept and storyline of the film is indeed impressive and refreshing execution can make a big difference I personally feel that Ranbir Kapoor s dialogue delivery was a bit flat in the trailer His acting seems forced and abrupt The way he said the dialogue Isha aag mujhe jalti nahi mera kuch rishta hai aag se was a bit off he did not seem convincing at all Though I do hope it is not the case when the film released Because it really is a new and unique concept and vfx looks amazing Plus the music and soundtrack are great but ultimately if acting of lead character is not up the mark the film will not work
