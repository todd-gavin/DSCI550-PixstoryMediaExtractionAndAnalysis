Drawing on his own memories and impression of India, celebrated author Ruskin Bond in his latest book, "A Little Book of India: Celebrating 75 years of Independence", pays homage to the country that has been his home for 84 years.

The book, an amalgamation of the "physical and spiritual" attributes of India, promises to take readers on a journey filled with nostalgia and devotions.

It is published by Penguin Random House India (PRHI).
