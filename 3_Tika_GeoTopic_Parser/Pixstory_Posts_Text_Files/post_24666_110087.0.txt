22 year old attacking midfielder Fábio Vieira joins Arsenal for a transfer fee of €35 mln, becoming one of the top 10 outgoing transfers from Porto. 

Fábio Vieira is a versatile attacking midfielder, left footed but equally comfortable with his right. He is very creative, skilled, and loves to keep the ball and dribble. When Porto were crowned as the champions of Portugal for the 30th time, Vieira played an integral part finishing second in assists(14) and scoring 6 goals. Most of them coming in the second half of the season, playing 27 matches, starting in only 15 of them. He was selected as the Primeira Liga Midfielder of the Month in April 2022. 

Vieira is coming into senior leagues after a very successful youth career. He was part of the Porto Juniors when they won UEFA Youth League in 2018-19. His contributions for the Portuguese youth has been illustrious. He was part of the U19 and U21 teams who were runner's up in UEFA Championships. He was named in the team of the tournament in both championships and was selected as the player of the tournament in U21. He is yet to feature in the senior national team, which is expected to happen in near future. 

When Manchester United suffered in the previous season, Bruno lacked confidence to be creative and lift the team with performance. He missed shots, penalties and seemed uncomfortable on the field. 

Arteta is also trying to bring Tielemans and Gabriel Jesus to Arsenal. Vieira will be wearing jersey no 21 in Arsenal. He is a player with a potential similar to Kevin De Bruyne. Like De Bruyne, Vieira likes to shoot from outside the box, with both feet, find players inside the opponent box, and create chances. Arteta, who likes to play 5 midfielders, might move to 3-5-2 with Gabriel, Ben White and Rob Holding in the back line. Jesus and Martinelli as strikers. Arteta might be planning not just to finish in the top four, but to finish at the top in the upcoming season.
