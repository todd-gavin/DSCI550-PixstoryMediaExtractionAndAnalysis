Why is India has so much dust We have a very peculiar seasonal climate In monsoon the land is completely drenched for four months which gives impetus for the growth of plants This creates cracks in the rocks and soil due to the roots ofcourse And then we face months of dry climate where all of these so called weeds die leaving behind the soil and rock ready to be eroded by the wind this is known as denudation Anyhow this cycle has been going on in our lovely country for a long time now causing a lot of withering and creation of dust particles Plus the winds that blow from the Arabian desert gets us a gift of tons and tons of light sand which gets deposited in western India To mitigate this problem we should plant more deciduous trees that hold on to the ground for a longer period of time in comparison to the grasses and shrubs Or we can actually take efforts to harvest the enormous amount of rain water we receive and use this water to keep the land a little more moist throughout the year okay yeah yeah the second option is more of a joke Or we can just keep brooming our surroundings and stay happy without complains
