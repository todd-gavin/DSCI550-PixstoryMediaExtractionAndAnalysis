Despite Song Hye Kyo and Song Joong Ki having divorced for years, topics regarding the 2 are still extremely high-discussed, especially when it comes to their career. Earlier this year, both of them were confirmed to star in K-dramas scheduled to air in late 2022, leading to expectations that their projects will be up against each other, and a reunion at year-end awards. 
However, insiders are spreading news that Song Hye Kyo’s upcoming series, “The Glory”, has been delayed to early 2023, which means that there’s no chance of Song Hye Kyo and Song Joong Ki meeting at an award ceremony. 
Previously, netizens also brought up a previous statement from Song Hye Kyo in an interview with Women’s Chosun, where the actress said: “I don’t work everyday, but whenever I start a new project, I find myself having no time to rest. I like my appearance while working, and believe I am living my fullest while on the set. Therefore, I would work harder and desire nothing else.”

They then draw the conclusion that Song Hye Kyo’s focus on working is due to her being absent from the dating scene.
