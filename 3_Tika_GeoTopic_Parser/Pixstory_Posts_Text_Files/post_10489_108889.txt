Akshay Kumar came to his teen neighborhood of Old Delhi today for the trailer launch of his upcoming movie Raksha Bandhan As many people know Akshay lived his growing years in Chandni Chowk accompanied by Bhumi Pednekar he launched the trailer at Delite Cinema in the walled city The trailer shows that Raksha Bandhan is the story about a family who lives in Old Delhi It might be the reason why the makers decided to launch the trailer at a walled city single screen rather than a hotshot multiplex The people went gaga over the superstar as the road to the theater was blocked and it was packed with die hard fans of Akshay Fans were waiting for hours to get a glimpse of their beloved star Some guys were even hanging from a tree while others climbed onto barricades All in all it was a madness and a testimony to Khiladi Kumar s magnificent stardom
