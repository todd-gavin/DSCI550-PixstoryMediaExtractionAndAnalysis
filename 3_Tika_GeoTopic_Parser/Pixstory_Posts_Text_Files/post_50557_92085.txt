I shifted from Jharkhand to Delhi as I got admission in one of the colleges of Delhi University I am living in the hostel which is under the campus of Shaheed Rajguru college of applied sciences for women Delhi University For the very first time shifting from hometown and living independently makes me felt anxious and excited at the same time Staying from home for the first time is such a rollercoaster ride In this transistion one very significant change I see is in my food diet which was not easy as I was accustomed to my homemade comfort food The fact is inevitable that the mess food can t match the taste of homemade food Foods are different as compared to what I used to eat usually There are some dishes which had been familiar for me as well as there are some dishes which I never knew about them The food is overall better than what I expected The hostelers have been provided meals time a day starting from breakfast in which we usually had chillas parathas macroni and coffee then around lunch starts in which we usually had rice chappati dal and one kind of sabji and sometimes raita then snacks and tea at p m and ends with dinner which we had rice chappati dal alongwith a kind of sabzi and sometimes dessert Since we live in Delhi we used to have Chole Bhature and Fried Rice once in a week as their speciality The best part is that although food taste are different here as compared to what I usually have in my home but still there food is somewhat healthy tasty and nutritious as compared to other hostels around India Till now I am having a healthy food but I am also missing my staple food and speciality of my hometown which is duska and litti chokha
