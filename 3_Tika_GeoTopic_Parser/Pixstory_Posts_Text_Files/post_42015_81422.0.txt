Deforestation, mistakenly introducing invasive species, overhunting animals to extinction, polluting rivers, spraying pesticides, and introducing cattle that overgraze are just a few examples of human activities can affect biomes. These actions might be carried out on a small or large scale. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, for example, has harmed it to the point where the tropical biome in this area has shrunk in absolute size as a result of humans.

However, this has to stop, we must take steps to undo the damage already caused. We must all become more environmentally conscious in every little thing we do daily.
