The Taliban arrested Mursal Ayar, a female protester, at her home in Kabul on Wednesday evening. The Taliban have not yet commented.
 This is the third woman to be detained by the Taliban, after Zamiab and Parwana Ibrahimkhel.
The activists staged several demonstrations to protest the Taliban's restrictions on women in Afghanistan.

The Taliban are detaining the protesting activist as the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights yesterday expressed concern about the safety and health of Temana Zaryab, Parwana Ibrahimkhel and their relatives who are being held by the Taliban.
A spokesman for the commission asked the Taliban to report their disappearances publicly and to demand their immediate release.
While the European Parliament, Special Ambassadors, Afghan civil society activists, the international community is calling on the Taliban government for the freedom and rights of Afghan women on Afghan Women's Day.
Every day, by arresting civil activists and violating the rights of citizens, they show that they can not become human.
