On Friday, Maharashtra reported 1,134 new Covid-19 cases, including three deaths. 763 of the new cases originated in Mumbai. This was the third day in a row that the number of people added to the tally in the city exceeded 700.

The state health department asked district and civic officials on Friday to increase coronavirus testing since the quantity of samples being evaluated had decreased while the number of cases had increased. Additional Chief Secretary (Health) Pradeep Vyas wrote to collectors, municipal corporations, and chief executive officers, urging them to guarantee that at least 60% of RT-PCR tests are performed. In light of the increased number of cases, it was recommended that people wear masks in enclosed public areas such as trains, buses, theatres, auditoriums, and offices, hospitals,schools and colleges.
