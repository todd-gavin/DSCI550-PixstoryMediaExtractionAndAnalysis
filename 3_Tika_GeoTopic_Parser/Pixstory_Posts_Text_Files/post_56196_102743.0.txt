We all witnessed through the photographs in the Sue Grey's report what happened in Downing street and yes it is clear that Boris Johnson had played with the confidence of the citizen but will he quit? 

What did he do from his side? He apologised and went out of his way to explain why he believed he had unintentionally misled the Commons in his previous accounts of what happened. This is very important as he has been caught red-handed lying to the house-might force him to resign. He also believed during the event he believed he didnâ€™t do anything wrong but was eventually fined by the police. He also said previously he had to respect his workers' service to him.

Even though Mr Johnson has privately apologised to the MPs they still are resentful and embarrassed. They know Johnson cant get away with an apology. Tory MPs have now broken cover to call for Boris Johnson to resign since the publication of Sue Gray's report.

John Baron, David Simmonds, Stephen Hammond and Julian Sturdy have joined a list of Conservative MPs persuading the prime minister to resign. Mr Hammond said he "cannot and will not defend the indefensible".
Mr Johnson has said he is "humbled" by Ms Gray's findings, but did not lie to MPs and is not going to quit. Yet there are plenty of cabinet ministers who have publicly conveyed their loyalty to the Prime minister. They believe it is a minor setback from his side, a mere incident and hence his policies are good for the country! Good for the country or them? So in the current scenario, the majority stands with him and Boris Johnson is in full confidence hence there are few chances for him to resign. Yet it is sure that elections will be difficult for the Tories as this added to the people's lack of confidence in the government.
