The Flash has become the longest running Arrowverse show, overtaking Arrow and outlasting all the other shows. 

While The Flash season 8 finale was initially set to work as a series finale, this was before The CW renewed the show for a season 9. Nevertheless, season 8 wrapped up most of the show's big storylines from this year, including Iris West-Allen's time-sickness. However, like most of the previous seasons, the finale didn't leave fans without a taste of what is to come in season 9. Towards the final minutes of The Flash season 8 finale, the show included a post-credits scene that will set up season 9.

During the dying minutes of the finale, as Iris and Barry were talking, Iris pointed out that in 2049, Negative forces will have to find someone else entirely to manifest their powers into. And then the shot panned to 2049, where we saw a blue crystal!! 

For the longest time, fans have speculated that if there ever was a speedster that could rival Thawne's hatred for Barry, it would be Cobalt Blue, and by the looks of it, that's where the series is headed. Fans have been asking for years to let Rick Cosnett's Eddie Thawne return as  the Cobalt Blue.
