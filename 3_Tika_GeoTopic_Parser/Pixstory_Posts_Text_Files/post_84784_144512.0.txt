The culture of Korea had a huge influence on me. I've grown interested in their culture from watching their web and television series, whether it be their music, food, or clothes. Kdrama has a lot of wonderful qualities!
Films (Series): Every aspect of contemporary life—romance, family problems, office politics, and so on—appears in their scripts, which are exceptionally well written. I enjoy how they portray cooking as a labour of love in all of their episodes.
Here are a few of my favourites:
Crashing down on you: Crash Landing on You might be the ideal place to start watching K-dramas if you're new to them.
It's okay to not be okay: It is a psychological drama that features several persons who have mental illnesses. It contains just about everything to keep you interested, including mystery, family ties, bromance, friendship, and more.
The reasons why I suggest these two series
Fashion: It can be difficult to avoid bringing up clothes when discussing Kdrama. The series received a lot of praise for its clothing as well. The primary protagonists wear an astonishing number of eye-catching, daring, and stylish clothing. Some fantastic wardrobe styling advice as well!
Music: Even though you don't understand their songs' lyrics, listening to them is extremely relaxing. You are definitely missing out if you haven't listened to any Korean music! A song from Crash landing called "Here I Am Again"
