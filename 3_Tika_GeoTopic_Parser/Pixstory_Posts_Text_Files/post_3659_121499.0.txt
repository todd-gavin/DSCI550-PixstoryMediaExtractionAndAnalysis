Continuing its focus on human insights, Spotify has launched a fresh campaign in four languages - Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam - to highlight how music can uplift moods, and positively impact our state of mind in specific moments.

With the tagline ‘Mood toh tabhi banega, jab Spotify chalega’, the marketing campaign uses Gen Z situations including a break up, a house party, and a romantic drive to show how a song can immediately change the listener’s mood.

This is the first time that Spotify is doing an ad in Malayalam. All the ads will be rolled out on multiple TV channels and relevant online media across key Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam.

Neha Ahuja, Head of Marketing - India, Spotify, said, “Music has the power to be the calm in our chaos, no matter what the circumstance may be. It accentuates the way we feel in a certain moment, but it also changes our mood for the better if we aren’t in the best headspace. The core idea behind our new campaign is simple - music changes the way we feel, in a good way. It helps you release emotions, break the ice, or simply look at the positive side of life. The situations we’ve chosen are also relatable for Gen Z, so we hope they feel connected to these new ads.”

Spotify is also working with Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Hotstar, Sharechat and YouTube to take the campaign deeper into India.
