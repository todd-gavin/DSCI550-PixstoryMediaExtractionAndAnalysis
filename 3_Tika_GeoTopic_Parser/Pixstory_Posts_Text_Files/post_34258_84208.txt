At the presentation of his NFTs taken from his book Adrenalina My Untold stories Zlatan Ibrahimovic spoke like this I decided to write this book because in my life there are so many things to say so I made a book to remind me of everything that happened I wanted to share my life with everyone so as to get to know the person and not just the footballer Italy as my second home I wanted to give something back to Italy and I chose the book I chose to say everything without hiding something even if something is missing because I don&#39;t remember them Without sacrifice without give everything you get nowhere I made this book to send a message and say that everything is possible Everything I did was not right then I had a different situation in Sweden but at the beginning I didn&#39;t feel welcome I didn&#39;t feel strong and good enough for what I did I believed in myself because I had too much confidence and this is a message for everyone it doesn&#39;t matter who you are and where you come from if one wants to reach one&#39;s goal Then also a joke about one&#39;s future as the expiry with Milan is now My future is the football my world football I&#39;m sorry if I can&#39;t play for the moment and this pains me so much especially now that the team is doing well even if less well in the last two games I want to be there and help the team since I got here we&#39;ve been doing great things and now there is only one thing missing winning trophies We are fighting and we are working towards this I won&#39;t give up until I win with this team
