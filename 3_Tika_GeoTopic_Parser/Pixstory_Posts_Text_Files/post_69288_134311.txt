I woke up at five in the morning and boarded the shikara at five twenty It was chilly and dark The Shikara cruised gently along the Dal Lake s waterways When the owner of our Shikara offered us a cup of Kashmiri Kahwa I was trembling from the cold a type of Kashmiri tea And it was a delight for my body at that time As we travelled through the lake we sailed towards vegetable market we spotted the houseboats and a few businesses The sky started to progressively turn yellow as we continued to move The Kashmiri homes that opened up to the lake were also visible These are Dal Lake s residences Shikaras alone can access these homes Deep inside the lake are medical facilities and schools It was Dal Lake s way of life Then it was a treat for the eyes
