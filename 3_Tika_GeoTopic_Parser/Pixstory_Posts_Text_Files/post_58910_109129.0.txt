The operator of Delhi's Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport, Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), announced on Wednesday that as of June 1 the airport will function solely on a combination of hydro and solar power, making it the country's first airport to do so.

The Cochin International Airport in Kerala made history in 2015 when it became the first airport in the world to run entirely on solar power. While they use a combination of hydro and solar electricity, according to DIAL, a sizable portion of this is now hydro dependent. According to DIAL, this is a step toward the airport's objective of being a "Net Zero Carbon Emissions Airport" by the year 2030.

Since June 1, about 6% of the airport's electrical needs have been satisfied by on-site solar power plants, with a hydroelectric plant providing the other 94% of the energy, according to the statement.

The IGI airport's airside and cargo terminal roofs are home to solar power installations. A Himachal Pradesh-based hydropower producing business and DIAL have a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) for the provision of hydroelectricity to the airport until 2036, according to a DIAL representative.

The Delhi airport has a 7.84 MW solar power plant on the airside, and lately, as part of a stakeholder engagement, it constructed an additional 5.3 MW rooftop solar power plant at the cargo terminal.

According to the operator, switching to renewable energy should enable the airport to cut its annual energy emissions by 2 lakh tonnes of carbon dioxide. The airport had declared its intention to become a Net Zero Carbon Emission Airport by the year 2030 last year in November.
