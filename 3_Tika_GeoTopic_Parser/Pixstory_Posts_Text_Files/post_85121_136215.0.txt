Barcelona have signed Hector Bellerin on a free transfer after the player agreed to terminatehis contract with Arsenal. The defender has signed a contract which runs until the end of theseason and a buyout clause is set at 50 million euros.

Bellerin, who used to play at Barca Academy, joined Arsenal at the age of 16 in 2011 insearch of valuable game time. He has made 308 appearances, netting 15 goals for theGunners and winning three FA Cups and the FA Community Shield twice.

He was loaned to Real Betis last season after losing his spot in the team. He became aregular starter and helped his side win the Copa Del Rey. The Heliopolitans were keen tosign the right-back on a permanent deal but were unable to do so due to a lack of money.

However, after sealing a move to the Spanish giants, Bellerin posted an emotional messagefor Arsenal fans on Twitter which read:

“Hello Gunners. Feels like it was only a couple of years ago when I touched down in Londonfor the very first time. “From day one I truly felt at home and I’ve said time and time againhow this city has shaped me into who I am, and how much I owe it.”

It’s with a lot of sadness that today I say goodbye to this club, the fans, the staff, the playersand our family all together. “There’s been highs, so high, and lows, so low, but I’ve enjoyedthoroughly every single experience I’ve lived with you Gunners,” he continued.

Barcelona sought the Spanish footballer after missing out on the likes of Cesar Azpilicueta,Juan Foyth, and Thomas Meunier for the right-back position.

The 27-year-old defender is taking a pay-cut to join his first-club. He replaces AmericanSergio Dest, who Barcelona loaned to AC Milan with an option to buy at 20 million euros.

It has also been learnt that Arsenal will receive 25% of the money generated from the sale ofBellerin in the future.
