A film that witnessed more than its share of delays, it is the first part of a trilogy and attempts to weave the Astraverse—India's first cinematic universe.🇮🇳🔥

Now, reports about its estimated budget have surfaced, and the jaw-dropping amount makes it the most expensive Bollywood film ever!🤑🤑

Brahmastra was in development for several years, and the makers announced multiple release dates in the past. However, none of them materialized due to varying reasons.
Nonetheless, the film has managed to keep the buzz alive; its trailer was released in mid-June to a thunderous response.🤯🤯❤️‍🔥

Now, it's finally ready to hit theaters on September 9 and must do extremely well to stay profitable.
Budget👍🏻👍🏻

Brahmastra has been mounted on a budget of a staggering Rs. 410cr, not counting publicity and print expenditures🤑✅🔥

The fantasy adventure film's whopping budget can be chalked up to its extensive, much-hyped VFX that has been done by six-time Oscar-winning company DNEG (Interstellar, the Harry Potter series).🎥🎥

The report also suggests that the makers are "silently confident about the project."🔥🔥
