The FUTURE is here!

Social media is forever evolving. From new features, to new app… enter the scene PixStory! As someone who’s been on twitter for years, I have always expressed ONLY my football opinions. Sometimes a bit shameless & sometimes a bit of banter, but isn’t that what Football’s about?

The key part is I’ve always kept it to football, yet the responses have not. From personal comments about weight to looks & even threats of physical violence. There unfortunately seems to be a culture forming where abuse is too excepted. 

Thankfully here on PixStory, we have found a game changer. Finally a space where football can be spoken without any fear of ‘Am I going to get abuse for this?’
