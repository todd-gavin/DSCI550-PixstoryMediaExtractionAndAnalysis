Barcelona has made Leeds United winger Raphinha one of their top summer transfer targets as they seek to replace outgoing winger Ousmane Dembele.

According to the Daily Mail (via Fichajes), Barcelona will now face competition from French heavyweights Paris Saint-Germain in their pursuit of the 25-year-old Brazilian speedster.

Raphinha has been a revelation since joining Leeds United from Rennes in 2020. The winger has wowed observers with his pace, guile, ball skill, and technical ability, contributing crucial goals and assists along the way.

As a result, the forward has piqued the interest of clubs all over Europe, with Barcelona expressing serious interest in signing him in the upcoming window.

Indeed, the Blaugrana have already made an opening bid for Raphinha, which Leeds United have rejected, claiming that the prized asset is worth €75 million.

Even though Barça are optimistic about their chances of securing the Brazilian winger, they will now face competition from PSG.

The Ligue 1 giants are preparing for the departure of Kylian Mbappe, who is set to join Real Madrid. Furthermore, Angel Di Maria's contract expires at the end of the season and is expected to leave, leaving two vacancies in the final third at Parc des Princes.

So, despite reports that PSG have an agreement to sign Dembele once his contract with Barcelona expires, they are looking for another forward, with Raphinha emerging as a target, along with Wolves' star Pedro Neto.

Because of their financial clout, Les Parisiens will be in a much better position to meet Leeds United's demands for Raphinha. However, the winger appears to be set on a move to Barcelona, with the Catalans in advanced talks with his agent, Deco.

Raphinha has nine goals and three assists in 27 Premier League games this season. Given his talent, the 25-year-old can contribute to any team he joins.
