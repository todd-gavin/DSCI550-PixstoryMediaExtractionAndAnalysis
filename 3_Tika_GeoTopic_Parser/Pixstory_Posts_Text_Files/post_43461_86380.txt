Ethiopia is truly living on another timeline The country follows their own calendar which is rooted in biblical stories The calendar is seven years behind the traditional Gregorian calendar based on the notion that Adam and Eve lived in the Garden of Eden for seven years Most of the world switched to the Gregorian calendar created in by Pope Gregory XIII but Ethiopia was free of influences from the Roman church and retained their own calendar To this day the country uses their month calendar with Pagume the th month having only five days Many Ethiopians use both calendar systems interchangeably Source
