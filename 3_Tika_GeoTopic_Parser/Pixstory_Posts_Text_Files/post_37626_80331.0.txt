Red Bull finished second in standings last year while Max Verstappen won drivers' title; New car, the RB18, has been designed around the sport's revolutionary new rules

One of F1's powerhouse teams, who enjoyed a superb 2021 season that ended with Max Verstappen lifting the drivers' crown, are the second to reveal a glimpse of a car that has been designed around F1's revolutionary new rules.

F1 is set for a shake-up in 2022 with new cars and regulations brought in to help aid racing and overtaking, but Red Bull will be aiming to still fight towards the front and go one better than last year in the team standings, where they were just beaten by Mercedes.

Verstappen and Sergio Perez's new car - which will look much different to last year due to the rule changes - is called the RB18.
