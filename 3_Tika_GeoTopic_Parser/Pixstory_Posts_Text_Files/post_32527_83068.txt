Luciano Spalletti&#39;s Napoli couldn&#39;t reach the top and in fact they only saved themselves with a good Cagliari thanks to a goal from Osimhen after going under in the first half due to a goal from Pereiro And so after the championship day they remained in the lead alone Milan with points despite the bad draw with Salernitana ahead of the pair Inter Napoli with the other Milanese who have to recover a game Fourth Juventus from the top then Atalanta who precedes at odds and one game less Lazio Fiorentina and Rome
