I know a lot of you won’t agree with me but let’s face it, French fries are disgusting! 

I never got why people are so crazy about it! What’s to love in thin crisps of fried potato? The only taste they have is salty. When there is a whole palate of flavours right there, why would anyone go for JUST SALTY? 

Also most of the time, fries turn soggy and ew, they just like wet potatoes. Bland and sorry excuse for a food! 

Moreover, don’t get me started on how bad they are for your health. Did you know that according to a study of nearly 4,500 adults published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, feasting on french fries more than twice per week could double your risk of early death. 

Given that fats are more slowly digested by the body than carbs and proteins—and given that they contain more calories as a result of how they're cooked—it's a good bet that your fries will sit in your stomach for much longer than if you were filling up on healthier food. As a result of this, according to a study published in the journal Ultrasound International Open, you'll have a greater chance of suffering through stomach pains. 

It plain bland fried potato really worth it?
