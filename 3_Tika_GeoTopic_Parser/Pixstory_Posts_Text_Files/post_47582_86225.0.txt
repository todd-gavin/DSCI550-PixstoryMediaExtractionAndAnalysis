Who will challenge PM Modi in 2024 depends on UP voters continues...

Scenario 4: Modi gets a big setback as the BJP actually loses the UP elections. The Samajwadi Party does a surprising performance, giving a big boost to the opposition to revive itself to challenge Modi-led BJP. This verdict will be seen as a big shock for the BJP whose confidence to face the 2024 polls  under Modi will be shaken to the core.

Such an eventuality will also mean not just Akhilesh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party but other regional leaders like Sharad Pawar of Maharashtra, Mamata Banerjee of West Bengal, M K Stalin of Tamil Nadu, and K Chandrasekhar Rao of Telangana will get a booster shot in the arm.

Then, of course, they may also start vying with one another for leading a combination of political parties and projecting an alternative to the BJP.

Of course, the Congress will appear to be left out of the game though Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra may draw satisfaction from the sliding popularity of the BJP. In any case, a split in the Congress cannot also be ruled out in the event of one of the other scenarios playing out.

The reality is that even the die-hard critics of the BJP do not believe it can easily lose a crucial election under Modi when he has personally undertaken a high voltage campaign.

Senior BJP leaders do admit that anti-incumbency issues could cost some seats to prevent a repeat of the 2017 verdict but they are still hopeful that the party will be in a commanding position. They attribute the BJP's strength in the UP polls to Yogi's record in improving law and order, implementing welfare schemes in a remarkable manner and helping in creating a huge constituency of "labarthis" (beneficiaries) through qualitative difference in ensuring free ration for hundreds of thousands of families since the outbreak of Covid-19 two years ago, besides ushering in 24x7 supply of electricity, improvement in infrastructure and other facilities.
