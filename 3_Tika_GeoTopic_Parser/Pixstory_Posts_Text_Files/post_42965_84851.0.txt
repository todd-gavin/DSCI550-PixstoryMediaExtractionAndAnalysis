Badal has been a player for us. He also acted in the movie, "Jhund." He enjoyed playing football more than acting in the movie as playing football has now   become a part of his routine. Hence he feels more comfortable while playing football rather than acting. Badal doesn't have any plans to work on more movies and he wants to focus on soccer at a higher level.
Badal enjoyed working with the iconic actor, Amitabh Bachchan. According to him, he felt that Amitabh was completely engrossed in his character and he couldn't differentiate between Amit Ji and their real coach. He also talked about how Amit Ji has amazing charisma, is very soft spoken and also a friendly person.
He said that it was a great opportunity for him telling that he did not come from a privelegded background and their family struggled so their family thought it was a great opportunity to send him away for this opportunity. 
Badal is a forward and adores the style and play of Lionel Messi calling him “Magical Messi”, saying that no one can understand his style of play. 
Badal only focuses on playing soccer and studying, he wants to make his family proud, being in his second year he just wants to play professional football and make his way to Europe.
