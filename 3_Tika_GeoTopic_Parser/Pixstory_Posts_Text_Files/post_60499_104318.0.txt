It's not often that you're in a cinema and you realise that you're watching one of the year's most delightful films, but it happened to me during a screening of Broker at the Cannes Film Festival, and I'm sure that I won't be alone. Broker is written and directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda, who won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 2018 for Shoplifters, and in some ways his new film is just what you'd expect from the master of nuanced, bittersweet dramas about makeshift families. But in other ways Broker is a major departure. Not only is it Kore-eda's first Korean production, but it's an accessible, high-concept genre movie that brings to mind the Coen brothers and such crowd-pleasing indies as Little Miss Sunshine.

At the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, Hirokazu Koreeda's Broker, a Korean-language drama about an abandoned child, illegal baby brokers, and makeshift families, won the Ecumenical jury award for best film.
