‌The renowned poet is also known for her activism in the Civil Rights Movement where she worked with Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. No other inspiration was needed for her rather than her life as most of her famous books were her autobiographies. 
‌
‌Her childhood was depressing with her being involved in different jobs such as fry cook, nightclub performer and even a sex worker. 
‌
‌She was honoured as an ambassador for Black people and women. Her works have been deemed to be a defence of Black culture. Her works are widely used in schools and universities worldwide, although there have been some attempts to ban her books from some U.S. libraries.
‌
‌She put out her real-life struggles echoing the life of Black women in society and her life and activism imbibed hope in many. 
‌
‌Her life and its psychological studies have helped in the study of childhood traumas, effects of abuse etc. Her poems are full of life and are called the anthems of African Americans. Forever she remains a poet in our hearts.
