After Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth's demise yesterday, people from all over the world expressed both their grief and rage. Queen Elizabeth II has done a lot of things during her long 70 reigning years, and many of those things are, for the lack of better words, not too great. 
Many people, including the Chief Coordinator of Organization of Solidary with the Yemeni Struggle (OSYS), Roni Al-danimarki (@Aldanimarki | twitter), took to Twitter to share what the queen has done in their countries. He writes, 
"The Queen ruled over South Yemen as a colony in which native Yemenis were separated from the public image while white Britons lingered around as if it was their own country. In 1963 the Yemeni people rebelled against British colonialism. In turn the Queen ordered her troops to violently suppress any and all dissent as fiercely as possible. On the 30th of November 1967 the last British soldier leaves Yemen, and the Yemeni people turn to the streets celebrating the victory of their anti-colonial struggle. 
"Queen Elizabeth is a colonizer and has blood on her hands. 
"The main punitive measure of Queen Elizabeth's Aden colony was forced deportations of native Yemenis into Yemen's desert heartland. The deportations came in response to the Aden Trade Union Congress' call for industrial action in 1958.
"This is Queen Elizabeth's legacy. A legacy of colonial violence and plunder. A legacy of racial segregation and institutionalized racism."
