For its first player acquisition since Erik ten Hag took over as coach, Manchester United returned to the Netherlands.

Luke Shaw of England competes with Tyrell Malacia for playing time at left back. Luke Malacia joined from Feyenoord for a reported initial fee of 15 million euros ($15.4 million). Malacia reportedly signed a four-year deal, according to United.

Malacia said of Ten Hag, whose Ajax squad won the Eredivisie in each of the past four seasons while Feyenoord's best result was third, "This is a new chapter for me, a new league with new colleagues and a wonderful manager leading us."

Malacia, a Dutch international, may never get the chance to play alongside Cristiano Ronaldo at Old Trafford.

Ronaldo was excused from preseason practise on Monday, with the club citing family obligations. It is unknown if he will travel to Thailand this week with the team.

The 37-year-old great has informed the organisation that he wants to depart and play in the Champions League. After finishing sixth in the English Premier League in May, United will participate in the Europa League this year.
