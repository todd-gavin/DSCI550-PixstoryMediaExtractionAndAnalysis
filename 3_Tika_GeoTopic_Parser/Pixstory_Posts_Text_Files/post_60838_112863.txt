Lal Bagh Botanical Garden is a huge place Sometimes you might get lost taking walks down the winding paths of this garden The place has a history of around years and was first planned by Hyder Ali It was later developed by British Superintendents and is maintained in pristine condition till date This garden is complete with a mini hill that gives some of the best sunset views fountains green houses and a lake My favourite photo from my childhood album features a photograph of me with my mother during the flower show that Lal Bagh is famous for hosting Depending on the season they also host mango shows It s quite a marvelous scene almost like a fairytale seeing the decorations made out of various species of plants flowers and fruits I visit Lal Bagh whenever I get the opportunity because it helps me relax meet new people and also just sit near the lake and write as evening arrives The changing hues of the evening sky is a sight to behold If you ever find yourself in Bangalore make sure you visit Lal Bagh I would recommend evening hours to avoid the afternoon sun but if you wish to explore the place properly make it a day trip There are a lot of other places in the vicinity including cubbon park stadium the Vidhan Soudha etc It s still a great place for weekend outings and for residents there a great walking spot
