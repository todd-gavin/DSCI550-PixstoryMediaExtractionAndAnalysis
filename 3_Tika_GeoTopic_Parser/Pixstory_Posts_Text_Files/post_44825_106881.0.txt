Lucas Torreira, an Arsenal midfielder, says he still wants to play for Fiorentina next season.
Torreira has been kept in limbo following his loan with the Viola last season as Fiorentina and
Arsenal wrangle over the price of a permanent deal.

"Honestly, at this point, I really don't know anything," the Uruguay midfielder told Ovacion.

"I just want to rest after a busy season. Then we will find the best solution with my representatives, I have said it several times: I hope to stay at Fiorentina, otherwise I'll find a
team in which to play continuously.

"Where will I rest? As always in Fray Bentos."

If recent reports are to be accepted, Arsenal has been quite disappointed with Fiorentina's latest
bid for Lucas Torreira.

Torreira joined Arsenal for a reported £24 million in the summer of 2018, and he immediately
made an impact, winning man-of-the-match accolades in games against Tottenham Hotspur,
Liverpool, and Bournemouth in his first few months under Unai Emery's guidance. However,
after Mikel Arteta took over as manager in December 2019, the Uruguayan international battled
for playing time before being loaned out to Atletico Madrid for the 2020/21 season.

The tough-tackling midfielder then spent the previous season on loan with Serie A side Fiorentina, where he had a solid season in which he scored five goals for La Viola, an impressive return considering his defensive prowess. The 26-year-old was generally anticipated
to join Vincenzo Italiano's side permanently this summer, with Arsenal reportedly included a €15
million (£13 million) buy option in the deal.

Fiorentina, on the other hand. The Gunners have been left 'greatly unhappy' by Fiorentina's
latest offer of €7 million (£6 million), which is less than half of what they sought for the gifted
maestro, according to the source.
