My aim as a coach now is to build up quality players and teams even consisting of players that aren t being given chances anywhere else and develop them into the best here People might not pick players into their side for a certain issue like if they can t run fast but I tend to look at these players on the basis of their strengths and make them enjoy the game What I usually do in coaching is try to make people love the sport and develop a genuine interest in it When I was in Mumbai I also started to coach parents and they developed two separate teams of fathers and mothers and they re still continuing to play football because they love the sport now As a coach a person needs to guide the life of an individual into the right way and I straight away tell the players the reality and try not to demotivate them I follow all the top managers around the world and I ve read the books of Jose Mourinho Pep Guardiola and Sir Alex Ferguson
