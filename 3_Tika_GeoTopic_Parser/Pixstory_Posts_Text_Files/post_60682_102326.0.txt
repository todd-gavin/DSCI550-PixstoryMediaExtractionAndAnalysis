The art of compliment-giving is age-old with them given even before verbal language was invented!💫

In this fast-paced world, who doesn’t like random bits of kindness sparkled their way?
Throwing compliments around like confetti can indeed make both your and the receivers day.✨


Here are 5 tips to level up your compliment game

1. Link your compliment to something you genuinely feel: For authenticity and it to not seem like flattery, it’s important to actually mean what you say.

2. Spend a little time thinking about why you appreciate that quality.

3. Don’t let your body language say otherwise: make sure your body language is correct for it might seem you don’t mean it fully.

4.Find a unique detail associated with the person.

5. Lastly, when on the receiver’s end of compliments, never just let out a plain thanks. Perhaps, add another compliment. 

Now that you’re equipped with these, go ahead, make someone’s day a whole lot better with the kind words in the pictures. ✨✨
