One of my observation while I was using YT Premium is that I was using it less frequently I don t know why but it is real when the subscription ended I was again Addicted to YT One of my theory is may be I m wrong When YT Charge for Premium it has to share this amount with creators who the premium user watches So if the user watch more without ad YT have to loose their share in revenue from premium subscription If Premium user watch less they have to pay less to Creators So to save money YT created another algorithm that is less addictive in comparison to the one with Ad With Ad Viewers watch more YT earns more Premium Viewers watch less YT retains more That s my conclusion What do you think Let me know in the note section What s your Perspective Support this if it s informative challenge if you ve counter experience Thanks Stay Khush
