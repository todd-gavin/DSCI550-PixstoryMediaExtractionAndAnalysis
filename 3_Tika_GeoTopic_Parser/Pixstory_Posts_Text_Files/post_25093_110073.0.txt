It seems that Cristiano Ronaldo is not happy with the recent developments at Manchester United. The lack of transfer activity after a forgetful season has further made the veteran striker consider his future at Old Trafford. The 37-year-old striker made his return to Manchester United last season, signing a two-year deal.

As questions grow over his Man Utd future, Sporting CP Director, Hugo Viana gave his opinion on whether Cristiano Ronaldo could return to his former club. Although he does not rule out a return, yet he stated it was quite improbable for it to happen this summer. He stated that the Portuguese has one-more year left on his Red Devils contract, and it will be interesting to see what happens in the future. 

“I think not now that will be possible, but you never know. I think he can decide where he can go, but we do not know the future. I think he has one more year left on his contract so whatever he decides, let’s see,” said the director to SkySports.

Cristiano Ronaldo ended as the top goal-scorer for Manchester United last season. The English giants failed to make the cut for the Champions League, finishing a lowly sixth in the Premier League. Ronaldo has never set foot in the Europa League before, and this will be an uncharted territory for him. Top European clubs would be interested in signing the veteran striker, if he does decide to exit Manchester United.
