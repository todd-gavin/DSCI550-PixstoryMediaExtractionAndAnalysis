William Saliba could well get his first taste of Premier league football next season. Sources from within the club confirm Mikel Arteta's interest on re-calling the 21 year old for the new campaign. 


Despite having signed for the Gunners in 2019, he's yet to make a single first team appearance for Arsenal. Those inside the club have been left impressed with his consistency and discipline at his latest loan spell in the French League. And for good reason. 


Jorge Sampaoli's Marseille team have played some incredible football over in the French league this year. Saliba, alongside Matteo Guendouzi signed for Les Olympiens from Arsenal last summer. In retrospect, the defender may have not signed for Arsenal at a very good time. It was a chaotic period, a period of change.


Now, with multiple loan moves and a couple thousand more minutes under his belt Saliba is ready for premiere league action. Arteta's current centre back options include Cédric Soares, Ben White and Brazilian defender Gabriel who signed from Lille two seasons ago.


“He’s gone out to really learn his trade and fine-tune those skills, and I’m sure Mikel Arteta will be excited to get a look at him in pre-season to see where he’s at.


“The fact that he’s pushed all the way into that France squad is really encouraging. It suggests to me that he’ll be competing in that Arsenal squad next season – he’s ready for that chance." remarked Noel Whelan (former Leeds United and Middlesbrough)


Undoubtedly, with his confidence through the roof It's no surprise that so many onlookers have tipped Saliba to excel in an Arsenal shirt. His initial two loan moves weren't the most successful, with a temporary move away from England imminent last season after a hellish first half to the campaign. 


With his first national team call-up and some experience, is William Saliba finally ready to Don the Arsenal
