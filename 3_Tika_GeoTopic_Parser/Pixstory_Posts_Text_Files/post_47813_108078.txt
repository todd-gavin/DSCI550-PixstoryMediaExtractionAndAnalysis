By Medha Dutta Yadav Last year when Aurangabad resident Anoop Bijapurkar and his wife were expecting their first child the IT engineer working with a Hyderabad firm was in for a rude shock I wanted to apply for paternity leave But there were no policies in place at my office for paternity leave My boss was prepared to give me a week s break at the most When I told my HR that I wanted a longer period to be able to bond with my child she simply said that as per company rules only women were allowed maternity leave and there was no provision at all for paternity leave says Bijapurkar who finally got only a week s leave to spend time with his newborn The conversation around work life balance in our country is centred only around women That is because women are seen as the primary caregivers of the family The role of the man is to work and provide for the family The fact that a man may want to take time off work to spend with his family or that his work is interfering with his family time is frowned on Society labels such men not ambitious enough and worse irresponsible Little wonder that Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal s announcement early this year that he would take time off for the birth of his second child rocked the pre conceived notions and struck many as not the right thing to do Hindi film industry actor Anushka Sharma was one of the few to praise Agrawal s step And rightly so She was herself at the receiving end of society s view on paternity leave when her husband Indian cricketer Virat Kohli opted for paternity leave to welcome their newborn In India central government and some states too allow their male employees to avail days of paternity leave But there is no similar policy in place for private organisations It is simply assumed that it is the woman s prerogative to look after the baby hence maternity leave of three to six months is in place for most women Read the full story here
