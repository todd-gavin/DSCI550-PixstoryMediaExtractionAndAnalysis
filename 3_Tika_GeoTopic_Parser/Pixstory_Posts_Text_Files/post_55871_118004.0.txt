‌How eager are the courts to put a hold on abortion rights? a federal appeals court reversed a lower court ruling and allowed Georgia’s restrictive 2019 abortion law to take effect immediately Wednesday. The decision was anticipated after the overturning of Roe by the U.S. Supreme Court.

The law bans most abortions once a “detectable human heartbeat” is existing. Cardiac activity can be observed by ultrasound in cells within an embryo that will eventually become the heart as early as six weeks into a pregnancy before many pregnancies are detected.

Georgia law includes exceptions for rape and incest, as long as a police report is filed. It also allows for later abortions when the mother’s life is at risk or a serious medical condition renders a fetus unviable.


Normally, the ruling wouldn’t take effect for weeks. But the court granted a second order Wednesday allowing the law to take effect immediately.
