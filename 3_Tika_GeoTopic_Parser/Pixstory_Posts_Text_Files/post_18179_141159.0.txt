Eric Appel's Weird: The Al Yankovic is relentlessly silly, wholesome at heart. Co-written by the artist (who also costars as a fickle record exec) It's a kindred spirit to his songs without being so gag-hungry it forgets how to tell a story.
Aaron Paul played the singer back then, helping to sell the (totally invented) rock-star self-destructiveness the trailer hinted at. This time we get Daniel Radcliffe, whose sweetness makes Pacino's turn toward nasty behavior funnier and poignant.
As a boy, Al was like every other kid; he kept shameful things hidden under his mattress to be discovered by his worried mother. He fell under the spell of a traveling accordion salesman, earning the wrath of his father. It's true that all great art is transgressive, and in return for alienating his old man, Al would have it all. He kept shameful things hidden under his mattress to be discovered by his worried mother (Julianne Nicholson); he fell under the spell of a traveling accordion salesman, earning the wrath of his father. 
Soon his songs are the most-requested song in town, and he's discovered by Dr. Demento (Rainn Wilson). Now he needs to develop a live show, and attract the attention of this great pun-loving DJ. Enter an opportunistic young singer named Madonna (Evan Rachel Wood) who seduces him and makes him believe they're soulmates.
Review: Weird is a funny, welcome reminder of a time before the internet and Marvel made being a nerd so ordinary. The movie knows how to race offstage when it's ready, offering a genuine twist or two as it goes. It may not set the world on fire, as "Eat It" did, but Weird is funny, warm and engaging.
