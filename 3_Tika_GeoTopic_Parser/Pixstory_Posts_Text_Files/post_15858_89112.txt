Zhi Lu J Y Peng Abstract Dioscin presents extents of pharmacological activities on several diseases but its effect and mechanism on diabetes cognitive dysfunction DCD remains unclear Herein we conducted a series of pharmacological evaluation assays of purinergic receptor P X P X R with dioscin We uncovered that dioscin presented a clearly protective effect on diabetes cognitive dysfunction via a methylglyoxal treated PC cell model and streptozocin STZ induced rat models Additionally it found that P X R and NLRP inflammasome signals were activated in diabetes cognitive dysfunction via in vivo and in vitro detection Moreover it was demonstrated that P X R regulated NLRP inflammasome signals in methylglyoxal treated PC cells Meanwhile it was showed that dioscin induced anti diabetes cognitive dysfunction effect was accompanied with an inhibition of P X R NLRP signal A deeper mechanical study indicated that an overexpression of P X R further enhanced the protective effect of dioscin Whilst an inhibition of P X R abolished the protective effect of dioscin These results suggested that dioscin protected type diabetes cognitive dysfunction through at least partially regulating the P X R NLRP signal pathway Our findings further indicate the great value of dioscin on preventing type diabetes cognitive dysfunction Sources
