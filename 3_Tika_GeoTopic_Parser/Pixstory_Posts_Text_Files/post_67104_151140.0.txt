You ever heard of the proverb: 
“He who laughs last, laughs best”? 
Be patient enough to see something through to the end, because even if you seem to be losing right now, things could eventually change with time. 
Your current status don't matter. You could be struggling and hurting but just know that the outcome of your story is what will determine your success. 
Right now isn’t forever. The best revenge is happiness! Don’t stay broken. Heal yourself and level up!
