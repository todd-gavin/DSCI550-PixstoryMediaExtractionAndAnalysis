Hallucinations occur when someone sees, hears, smells or feels things that do not exist, yet they feel genuine to the person experiencing them. These hallucinations can include real people the person knows, even though they are not there, which can contribute to their lifelike quality.
Delusions are firmly held beliefs about something that is not true. Examples include someone thinking they're being harmed or believing someone is in love with them.
Disorganized thinking occurs when a person struggles to organize thoughts or complete tasks. It often causes incoherent speech, which can result in repeating the exact words repeatedly, rushed lessons, appearing to talk to people who don't exist, using made-up words, word salad and other atypical speech patterns.
Negative symptoms are the absence of everyday experiences and actions. For example, someone with negative symptoms may struggle to have regular communication or connections with others or be unable to experience pleasure.
