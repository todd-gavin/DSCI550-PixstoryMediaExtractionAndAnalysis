Peace needs to weigh heavier than conflict or hate in our day to day life The only way to defeat sadness hatred and competition is to raise the bar of amity Peace Harmony and Peace have always existed in the year old history of the human race along with conflict that will never go and civilization Sadly we have never tried to invest in the Peace to multiply the Peacetime We have never tried to enlarge the Peace taught us through different religious books and education to follow it practically We have never seriously researched the syllabi and curricula of Peace that need to be introduced to every human being from the toddler age to saddle Peace deep into the heart and mind of each individual Make the curricula of peace simple to be part of natural life rather than complicated burden challenging to understand at ground zero We need more study on Peace to find how it looks as part of each one s daily life in easy automatic steps Rather than it remains buried in the existing international laws international humanitarian organizations their complicated imported definitions Training the population on Peace in their own language Kindergarten like friendly tools and acceptable curricula of happiness and Peace in routine daily life are needed in educational institutions and outside in the streets in simple methods Education on Peace needs practising Peace which could bring the green shoots of happiness Until and unless joy is multiplied as a first baby step Peace will continue to be subdued to daily challenges Suppose Coca Cola can reach billions of people on the same day why does Peace not correspond to every individual daily Need of the hour is exemplary efforts baby steps largehearted budgets and human resources where people need to lead people rather than someone else bossing or by force The first right steps should be to dissolve the distances of superiority and hidden agendas and bring equality that only can bring green shoots of Peace to the societies communities countries and religions
