 So it is with Fast amp Furious which is arguably the most sentimental of the Fast flicks The regular cast members are all either approaching or well into their forties When this series started years ago they were still hot young Hollywood upstarts Whoever was a teen or tween back then finding in these photogenic badasses the epitome of cool is now likely sweating over rent and taxes Fast wants to give them a little commencement present akin to Star Trek VI which actually put a lump in my throat when it ended by having the TV icons of my youth sign their names across the stars Yet Fast is still cold blooded and brutal enough for the children A kind of name in the stars paean happens in the opening credits a montage of moments from all over the series We glimpse Paul Walker and Vin Diesel in the early days slightly slimmer swifter and lighter of voice We see various beatdowns jiggling bikinis and vehicular massacres set to the thump of a generic hip hop track Justin Lin is a playfully bombastic director but his wise ass sensibility goes missing in one of the key areas where he could leverage this trash into trash art the soundtrack One of their homies thought long dead has been photographed among the suspects Letty is alive apparently She was Vin Diesel s girlfriend in Fast One and Four in the latter she was presumed killed by a drug lord s henchman When Letty finally showed up alive onscreen there were gasps and murmurs among my fellow moviegoers They love Vin Diesel s marble mouthed charisma and Paul Walker s earnest aqua blue eyes framed in the film s most spectacular shot between fire engine red prison bars They love the horribly written but charmingly performed banter between sidemen Chris Ludacris Bridges and Tyrese Gibson They love the shy sweet courtship between Han and Gisele They love these raggedly human things and it s the filmmaker s job to withhold them at times to force viewers to face the possibility that they might never enjoy them again then bring them back from the narrative dead with an invigorating flourish
