Efootball is the last game in the Championships Esports category. This was a very controversial choice due to the fact that when the game was released it was bugged,glitched and was very unpleasant to play. Players neck's were being broken when the opposition tackles his legs. so, it was a very controversial choice because there were many other games which were better than it. however, people eventually warmed up to the game as well.

So, for all these 3 games there is a men's and women’s  category. India is only playing in the men’s category of Dota2 and rocket league. In Dota2 the Indian team consists of moin ejaj, Abhishek Yadav, Ketan Goyal, Shubham Holi and Vishal Vernekar. Indian team is one of the strongest in the championship which would in 90% of the cases make it to the semifinals. In Dota2 in addition to India there are 7 other countries which are divided into two groups with four teams in each group. The tournament starts off in a round robin format with each team playing the other teams in their group twice. Then the top two teams in each groups face off in semi finals and the winners will go to finals.

Rocket league plays out in a similar manner to the Dota2 with the 8 teams and round robin format. The Indian team consists of Hargun Singh, Sandeep Sahani and Rushil Reddy. 

When we talk about the medal chances of India In these events. We can expect a medal in the Dota2 and it is a event we can hope for a Gold medal if a little luck favors us. Whereas Rocket league might be a event where our Indian guys might have to sweat it out not because they are bad but due to the amazing amount of talent present in the game. But, we will definitely get a medal in the Dota2 and if we don’t it would be a huge disappointment for us after the dominating victory we had in the Asian Qualifiers to enter the commonwealth games.
