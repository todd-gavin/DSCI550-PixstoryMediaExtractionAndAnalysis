When Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool contract expires, he is more likely to become England's next manager than Germany's.

Klopp formerly managed Borussia Dortmund and was Liverpool's interim manager during the 2015/16 season, replacing Brendan Rodgers.

Klopp has now won the Premier League, Champions League, Carabao Cup, and FIFA Club World Cup with Liverpool, and according to BILD, he would like to take over the England national team rather than Hansi Flick's Germany group.

Klopp has close ties to England players, particularly Jordan Henderson and Trent Alexander-Arnold, according to the source.

Klopp will leave Liverpool in two years, according to James Pearce of The Athletic, since he told his family he would take a vacation from football.

Commenting on the matter previously, Klopp said: "If I decide for myself that I can't go on anymore, I'll take a break.

"I have absolute energy, but I have one problem: I can't do 'a little bit'. I can only do 'all or nothing'. But the chances are very high that my energy levels will go up again [after a break]."

After signing a contract extension in November, current Three Lions manager Gareth Southgate's contract expires in 2024.

Klopp was connected with the Germany post after Euro 2020, but he backed away before Hansi Flick was appointed. So far, the former Bayern Munich coach has performed admirably, winning all seven of his games in charge and guiding his team to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Southgate's England contract is due for renewal in December 2024, according to BILD's report, after he signed an extension in November. Southgate has overseen some of England's best performances in recent memory at international competitions, including reaching the World Cup semi-final in 2018 and the European Championship final last year.

Klopp previously stated, "The plan at the moment is to get to 2024 and then, 'Thank you very much,'" when asked about his future. Klopp says.
