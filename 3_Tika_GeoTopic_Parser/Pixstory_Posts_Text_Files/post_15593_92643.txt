Statement by Murat Sahin UNICEF Representative in Ukraine April We strongly condemn today&#39;s attack on Kramatorsk train station in Ukraine We still don&#39;t know how many children were killed and injured in the attack but we fear the worst Kramatorsk train station was the main way out for thousands of families evacuating from Donetsk Oblast which has seen some of the greatest destruction of the war to relatively safer areas in Ukraine UNICEF today delivers medical kits and emergency supplies to Kramatorsk UNICEF has delivered nearly tonnes to Kramatorsk in the past week of life-saving supplies including medicine water and hygiene kits to respond to rapidly deteriorating humanitarian conditions in the east The UNICEF team was delivering life-saving supplies to the regional health department one kilometer away from the train station when the attack occurred Civilians especially children they must be protected from harm. The killing of children must stop now
