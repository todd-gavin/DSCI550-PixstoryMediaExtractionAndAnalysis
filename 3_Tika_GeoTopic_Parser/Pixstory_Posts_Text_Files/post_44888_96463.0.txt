At his former club, the manager is still a popular figure. During Roma's match against Inter, Jose Mourinho was serenaded by fans of his previous team, demonstrating that they still have positive feelings for him.

Mourinho was the manager of Inter from 2008 to 2010, winning the Serie A treble, the Coppa Italia, and the Champions League in his final season at San Siro before taking over at Real Madrid. Despite the fact that Mourinho left Inter more than a decade ago, fans sang the name of their former manager late in Saturday's 3-1 victory, and he appreciated the affection in his former home.

In recent weeks, the Portuguese, who returns to San Siro on Saturday, has been embroiled in even more controversy than normal.

Jose Mourinho was welcomed "home" by the Curva Nord, who sang his name to the tune of "Can't take my eyes off you" as he returned to San Siro for the first time to face Inter.

It's always struck me as a particularly fitting tune for one of the game's most interesting characters. Whether you like him or not, Mourinho has always made for entertaining television.

Depending on which way your moral compass points, the Portuguese is either an anti-establishment anti-hero who is never afraid to speak his opinion, or a brazenly vocal narcissist who uses unsubstantiated, contentious allegations to deflect attention away from his flaws and failures as a manager.

Whatever the case may be, Mourinho has a history of altering the narrative, which is why his upcoming match with Inter is so intriguing.
