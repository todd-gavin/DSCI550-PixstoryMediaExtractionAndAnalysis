Southampton Football Club have confirmed the permanent transfer of their legendary midfielder Oriol Romeu to La Liga side Girona. 
The Spanish footballer joined the South Coast from Chelsea back in 2015. He made 256 appearances during his seven-year spell at the club, netting a total of eight times. Romeu, in his very first season, helped the Saints achieve their best-ever Premier League points table spot - sixth and a place in the Europa League. 
He was also awarded the fans’ and players’ Player of the Season in the 2016-17 season, where he played a vital role in helping his team reach the EFL Cup Final against Manchester United. However, his side lost the big game 2-3.
He now exits England to join his home country team Girona, who won a spot in the top flight last season. Informing about the transfer, the English club released a statement which read: 
"The move brings to an end a wonderful seven-year spell at St Mary's for the midfielder, who has made a significant contribution to the club ever since arriving from Chelsea in 2015. Oriol departs with the very best wishes of everyone at Southampton Football Club. We would like to express our gratitude to him for his dedication and magnificent efforts both on and off the pitch during his time here. We wish him every success in the future.”
The 30-year-old midfielder has already represented Chelsea, Barcelona, Valencia and VFB Stuttgart across his professional career. He made his last appearance for Southampton on August 24 against Cambridge United in the EPL cup, which they won 3-0. 
The newly-promoted Girona have won only one out of their three games in the Spanish League. Romeu could make his debut for the club against Mallorca on Saturday (September 2).
