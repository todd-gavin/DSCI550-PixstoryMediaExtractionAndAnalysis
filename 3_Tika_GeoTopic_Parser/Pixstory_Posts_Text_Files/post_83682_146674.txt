Here s why you should stop chasing perfection Perfection is an impossible dream It s similar to happiness in that we believe we can pursue it And yet the harder we try to be happy the further away we are from happiness It s similar to perfection the more you strive for perfection the more likely you are to become flawed Instead you must seek perfection within imperfection It s like realising there is no such thing as authenticity unless you embrace your own inauthenticity In a way this is the Kantian sublime The Kantian sublime is the idea that what appears to be a failure of the thing is in fact its essence For example consider Shakespeare s sonnet in which he says I couldn t possibly put into words how much I love you You ve just put it into words except you ve put the failure into words You ve captured the perfection of imperfection in words And that s what love is saying you are imperfectly perfect
