Gabriel Jesus is expected to score "at least 20 Premier League goals this season" for the
Gunners.

Three goals in his first six games, especially a great composed finish against Leicster, but it has
been everything else that comes with the Brazilian -- the pressing, interplay, and relentless hard
work -- that has captured the imagination of a fanbase who have been crying out for a do-it-all
striker since Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang went off the boil, perhaps even since Robin vanPersie left.

In what appears to be the penultimate step in their pursuit of a new striker, Arsenal and
Manchester City reached an agreement on a £45 million fee for the forward. Mikel Arteta'steam's primary goal scorer, a position the four-time Premier League winner will easily fill. Itwould be incredible if Arsenal's newest acquisition didn't score 20 Premier League goals for Arsenal this campaign.
We're not sure if a number nine can be that, though, given the way Mikel Arteta prefers to play.
Because of this, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang excelled as a goal scorer. He wasn't a true nine;
instead, he was a number 11 who used his speed to play off the sides.

The Gabriel Jesus controversy is quite contentious. He wasn't a fan and didn't always play for Pep Guardiola's team, so it would be astonishing if he didn't score a minimum of 20 goals thisseason for Arsenal now that he is there. Jesus enjoys doing things like that. Arsenal missed outon his ability to play it around the boundary of the box with a great burst of pace.
Because he was typically deployed sporadically, Jesus struggled to reach the 20 PremierLeague goal mark during any of his five years at City under Guardiola. The Brazilian's finestperformance came during the 2019–20 Premier League season, when he scored 14 goals in 34appearances. Jesus scored 58 goals overall for City in 158 league games.
