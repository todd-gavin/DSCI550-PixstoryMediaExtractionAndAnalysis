It’s been 11 years since the Indian Cricket Team won the World Cup at Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai on 2nd April 2011. What a night it was for all the Indian fans, when India won the final against Sri Lanka, every street became the stadium that night and fans were celebrating the whole night.

That World Cup was special because Of many reasons which are as follows:- 

1. The 2011 World Cup was the last World Cup for Sachin Tendulkar and finally, he got his hands on the trophy.
2. The team who won the match against Sri Lanka in the final of World Cup, those 11 players never played together after that match and that’s some strange fact. 
3. After the World Cup, we got to know that Yuvraj Singh played the whole tournament suffering from cancer and he was in so much pain. 
4. Indian team made history on that day because no other team won the World Cup in past by chasing more runs. So, the Indian team won the World Cup as well as broke the record that day. 

India won the World Cup in 2011 after a gap of 28 long years. Back in 1983, Kapil Dev and his devils won the first World Cup  (then known as the prudential cup) for India after beating West Indies. 

In 2011, I was 12 years old and I still remember that winning six from MS Dhoni and commentary of Ravi Shastri. After that shot, all the cricket fans got mad and started celebrating like anything. I also went on a bike ride with my dad and bring some sweets.

After that World Cup. Indian team looked stronger in every World Cup but choked in crucial knockout stages and got out from the 2015 and 2019 World Cups in the semifinals round.

The next Cricket World Cup will be held in 2023 and the host of the World Cup is India.

So, let’s hope India will win the World Cup on their home ground !!
