I found this game on steam and bought it instantly. It looked just like my type. This is an adventure-driven indie game full of action. The game is based in California in 1986. 
A group of friends discover a mysterious pink stone that allows travel between two realms. This gang will live the summer of their lives in an adventure that will get them involved in a government conspiracy. Control five kids with special skills while fighting and solving puzzles.
