Bharmal Vahid Shabbirhussain Surya Kumar Singh Abstract Background and aims Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease NAFLD is common in type Diabetes Mellitus DM that might progress to advance liver fibrosis Early recognition of liver fibrosis may have clinical implication Non invasive assessment tool for severity of liver fibrosis in NAFLD is expensive fibroscan An alternate method of diagnosis will be very useful innovation We aimed to evaluate Carotid Intima Media Thickness CIMT and its association with severity of liver fibrosis in patients with type DM and NAFLD Methods Treatment na ve patients with type DM were enrolled Measurement of CIMT hepatic ultrasound and fibroscan were done Liver function tests included hepatic transaminases The data obtained was subjected to statistical analysis using IBM SPSS version software Result Prevalence of NAFLD was including with moderate to advance liver fibrosis in patients with type DM CIMT was significantly higher in patients with NAFLD than with normal liver CIMT positively correlated with severity of liver fibrosis measured by fibroscan ROC curve analysis showed right CIMT value of mm predicting liver fibrosis with sensitivity of and specificity of Conclusion Three fourth of patients with type DM had NAFLD but small proportion had moderate to advance liver fibrosis CIMT increased more in patients with NAFLD than with normal liver in T DM CIMT value of mm has a good sensitivity to predict liver fibrosis and therefore it can be a reliable marker of severity of Non Alcoholic Steato Hepatitis NASH in diabetes with NAFLD Sources
