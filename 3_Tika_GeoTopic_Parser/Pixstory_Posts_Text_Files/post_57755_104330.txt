Late at night or early in the morning when you re peacefully sleeping you either feel a chill or a mosquito or something that wakes you up and makes you aware that your blanket isn t properly covering you it s all tangled and jumbled up So you feel around looking for the corners to pull it up and around you properly only to end up in a struggle as it s buried under your own weight and will not budge unless you do And it s especially harder if there s someone else with you who s hogging the blanket and just won t let up to let you take your side back
