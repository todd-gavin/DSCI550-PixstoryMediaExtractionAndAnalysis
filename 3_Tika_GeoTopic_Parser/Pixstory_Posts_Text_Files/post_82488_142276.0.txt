Shayara Bano vs Union of India & Others in 2017In the year 2016, Shayara Bano was divorced by her husband after 15 years of marriage through instantaneous triple talaq method. To curb this situation where men could abandon their wives by saying 3 words together, a Writ Petition was filed in the Supreme Cour to call for the unconstitutional practice of the Muslim community, “nikah-halala.”Many feminists and unions supported the argument of Shayara Bano. SC declared that such practices must be labelled unconstitutional. Triple talas was therefore rendered illegal by the SC. A legal ban was implemented and if practiced it would lead to 3 years of jail for the husband.
