The FA has prosecuted Newcastle midfielder Isaac Hayden after he posted statements on social media implying that Chelsea had the referee on their side in their 1-0 victory over the Magpies at Stamford Bridge.

On March 13, a late goal from Kai Havertz handed the Blues all three points in a very fought match in west London, ending Newcastle's nine-match unbeaten streak.

Hayden was unable to play due to his rehabilitation from knee surgery, and he was also left out of Newcastle's 25-man Premier League squad for the remainder of the season, although he expressed his displeasure with referee David Coote's performance online after the game.
What has been stated so far?
Hayden wrote on Twitter: "Some performance from the boys against 12 men."

"Newcastle United's Isaac Hayden has been charged with a breach of FA Rule E3.1 following their Premier League game against Chelsea on Sunday 13 March 2022," an FA spokesman said in an official statement.

"It is alleged that the midfielderâ€™s comments on social media after the game constitute improper integrity of the match official and/or are personally offensive and/or bring the game into disrepute.
"Isaac Hayden has until Wednesday 23 March 2022 to provide a response."
What transpired during the match?
Hayden was enraged by Coote's contentious rulings throughout the game, particularly following an incident involving match-winner Havertz in the first half.
For appearing to throw an elbow at Dan Burn, the German playmaker avoided a red card, but Newcastle later had a strong penalty case denied down.

Just before the hour mark, Jacob Murphy was clumsily dragged down by Trevoh Chalobah, but Coote waved aside the Magpies' penalty shouts, infuriating the away bench and supporters.

After the international break, Newcastle will return to Premier League action on April 3 against Tottenham Hotspur.
