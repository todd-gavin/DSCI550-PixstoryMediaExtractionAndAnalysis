One guy kill his duplicate multiple times why not duplicate himself just once then use a fake machine on stage with one Angier dropping beneath the stage to safety and the other climb into the balcony why the need for the bloodshed could Angier not trust himself ie his duplicate to keep his trick a secret did he never know when Borden would head beneath the stage in order to frame him so he had to kill himself every night and seriously in a world where the solution to every illusion no matter how seemingly impossible always has a grounding in reality how the hell does that electric cloning machine work people are posited theories online that in fact the machine doesn't work at all all Tesla's machine does is create Sparks and the multiple cats and hats are simply replicas an extended piece of showmanship the flashback of Angier meeting and shooting his own duplicate is just a lie spun by Angier as he dies and that the copy of Angier ended up in the tank to frame Borden was in fact route the doublet Angier uses earlier in the film.
