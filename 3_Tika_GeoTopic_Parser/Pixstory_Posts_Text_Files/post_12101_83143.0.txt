British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced the end of all domestic Covid-19 restrictions in England in a process starting later this week.

The Prime Minister on Monday announced the lifting of all long-term coronavirus rules in Parliament as he unveiled the government's strategy for "living with Covid", Xinhua news agency reported.

The legal requirement for people who test positive for coronavirus to self-isolate will be removed from Thursday of this week, Johnson has announced.

From April 1, when Winter is over and the virus will spread less easily, we will end free symptomatic and asymptomatic testing for the general public," he said.

Johnson said it will mark a moment of pride after one of the most difficult periods in history as Britain begins to learn to live with Covid-19.

"The pandemic is not over but thanks to the incredible vaccine rollout we are now one step closer towards a return to normality and finally giving people back their freedoms while continuing to protect ourselves and others," he said.

More than 91 per cent of people aged 12 and over in Britain have had their first dose of vaccine and more than 85 per cent have received both doses, according to the latest figures.

More than 66 per cent have received booster jabs, or the third dose of a coronavirus vaccine.

"Britain will move from government restrictions to personal responsibility," said Johnson, adding contingencies will be maintained to tackle any future virus variations.

Saying people in Britain need to get their confidence back, Johnson added: "We chose to compel people to be considerate to others. We can rely on that sense of responsibility towards one another by providing practical advice in the knowledge that people will follow it to avoid infecting loved ones."
