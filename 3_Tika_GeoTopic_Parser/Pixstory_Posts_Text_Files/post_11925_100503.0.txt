Recently I and we all have Heard a News " Spain to offer 3 Days menstrual Leave every month " ! ✅

Women who suffer from bad period cramps every month are going to get relief . They will be granted menstrual leaves from work for up to three days in a month . However , this good news is only for women who are staying and working in Spain .

Not Just Spain , Other countries that already have this policy are -- Japan , South Korea , Indonesia and Zambia .

But my Question is - why just Spain and These 4 country ! why not India ? Why the Idea of Period Leave Is Still Sparking Debate ?? 🤔

To people Who Underestimate The strength Of a women - can You bleed for a week straight without dying ??

Do you know ? Menstrual cramps , has finally been ruled "as painful as having a heart attack " ! If You ask me - Nobody in this world can Bear this pain but We women's have to Bear this every month with the smile on our face ! Many women becoming silent sufferers , choosing not to disclose their pain rather than demand their right to rest .🥲

India’s legislative system has been fairly backward in introducing menstruation-friendly policies like menstrual leave ! Bihar is the only state in India which has been providing two days of special menstrual leave to women since 1992 through its Human Resources guidelines . India has also witnessed the Menstruation Benefits Bill , 2018 which was tabled in Parliament , but is yet to receive assent .

According to me " It is important to understand that menstrual leave need not necessarily mean a complete loss of productivity for women ! Menstrual leave can easily allow a woman to work from home ! "

These Change must come from the grassroots of society – discussions on menstrual flow and cramps must move from women’s locker-room discussions to the open , with Everyone showing the willingness to be included in the discussion in both personal and professional capacities !❤️
