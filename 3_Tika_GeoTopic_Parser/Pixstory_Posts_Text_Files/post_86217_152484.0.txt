The magic of friendship 
Friendship is a precious gift, they say. These days, it is a privilege to find true friends.
They give you a sense of belongingness. 
They call you out on your mistakes but are never mean.
They may tease you but will be there with you through thick and thin.
They understand you if you are busy rather than guilt tripping you.
Some people may come and go in our lives but true friendships last forever.
