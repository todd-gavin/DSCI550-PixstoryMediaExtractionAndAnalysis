Forgiveness is letting go of the anger and resentment it s not letting go of the reason why it happened Forgiveness should never be unconditional It does not erase that you were hurt it acknowledges that you re over the hurt The one thing that comes with forgiveness should be a promise that it will never happen again Saying forgiveness is unconditional is implying that the other person wouldn t have to work for it That s not fair They should be working to get it and most importantly they should be working to not repeat what they did The condition of forgiveness should be that it s only given once
