Carlos Alcaraz is on the cusp of making history One step away from winning the US Open and becoming the youngest ever in ATP rankings began with a bang for the Spaniard He won straight titles But then he lost focus and momentum failing to make an impact in the French Open and Wimbledon There were fears that like so many before him this teen with the unreal talent would not be able to live up to expectations His performance at the US Open has put all the doubts to rest Alcaraz has won his last three matches in marathon five sets displaying incredible resilience and mental strength Win or lose on Sunday he has captured the hearts of tennis fans around the world With the big on their way out the year old Alcaraz is the future of tennis
