Nemanja Vidic

Vidic finished his playing career with an injury-plagued 18-month stay at Inter Milan after leaving
Manchester United in 2014.

Chris Smalling

Throughout the 2010s, Smalling established himself as a fixture in United's lineup, particularly
under Louis van Gaal's leadership.

 After being replaced by Harry Maguire, the centre-back
signed a loan deal with Serie A side Roma, which he made permanent at the end of the
2019-20 season.

Rafael

Rafael fell out of favour under Louis van Gaal and is now playing right-back for Istanbul
Basaksehir in Turkey.

Patrice Evra

After leaving United, Evra went on to win two Serie A titles with Juventus, but he was released
by Marseille and had a dismal three months at West Ham. The 40-year-old announced his
retirement in 2019 and has since established himself as a highly entertaining Sky Sports studio
analyst.

Rio Ferdinand

After a failed tenure at QPR in 2014, Ferdinand retired from football and currently works as a
pundit for BT Sport.

Mame Biram Diouf

During his stint at United, Diouf only made nine competitive appearances before being sold to
Bundesliga side Hannover 96 in January 2012. In 2014, he returned to England with Stoke City,
where he spent six years before joining Hatayspor in the Turkish Super Lig in 2020.

Park Ji-Sung

Park graduated with an International MA in Management, Law, and Humanities of Sport from
Leicester's De Montfort University after hanging up his boots in 2014. He recently joined
Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors of the K League 1 as an adviser, assisting with player development,
scouting, and training.

Michael Carrick

Carrick won five Premier League titles, the Champions League, the Europa League, the FA
Cup, and two League Cups during his time at United. After retiring in 2018, the midfielder joined
Jose Mourinho's coaching staff at Old Trafford, where he now works with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
