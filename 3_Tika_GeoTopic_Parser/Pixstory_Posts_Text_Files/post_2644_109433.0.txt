Aankh Micholi is a popular group outdoor game enjoyed by children aged 5 to 12. The boys and the girls actively participate in playing this group game.

How to Play:
One of the players, the denner, is blindfolded with a piece of cloth. The denner has to catch hold of one of the other players while being blindfolded. All other players scatter around in the open space and avoid the denner so that they do not get caught. The players are allowed to make sounds for the denner to give hints for the direction. The dennerâ€™s turn comes to an end as soon as he/she is able to catch one of the players. This player now becomes the denner for the next turn and the game continues till the all players decide unanimously to end the game.

Variation:
In some variant of this game, once the denner catches another player, he/she also has to identify the other player correctly. Unless correctly identified, he/she continues to be the denner in the game and the game continues.

Conclusion:
This game helps in developing the sensory skills, alertness, and a sense of sound in the players. The denner or the blindfolded player has to make judgment of space based on his hearing abilities. This helps the denner in developing his/her skill to be alert at all times and have a sense of sound. This game also helps in developing tactile sense.
