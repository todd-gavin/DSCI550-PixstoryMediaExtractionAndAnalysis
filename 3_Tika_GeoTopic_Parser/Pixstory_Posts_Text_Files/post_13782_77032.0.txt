Neymar is certainly trying to perform a balancing act – at least that’s what some people might start thinking after watching the well-made documentary on him on an OTT platform. The Brazilian star was in FC Barcelona till 2017 before moving to his current club Paris Saint-Germain. And then again, in his own admission, he wanted to leave the French side in 2019, which he couldn’t do because of contractual obligations. On both occasions, if Neymar is to be believed, he held nothing against the club. In fact, it wasn’t clear why he wanted to leave PSG. In 2019, he had a good mind to move out of PSG. According to Neymar, “When I made the decision to leave PSG, it wasn’t because of a fan or a club. It’s because I saw that I would feel better elsewhere.” Well, that’s definitely confusing and doesn’t explain anything. There has to be some solid reasons; it could be financial one or something else, because a professional footballer, that too of Neymar’s stature, doesn’t generally change his club just to feel better elsewhere.
Equally puzzling is Neymar’s decision to leave Barcelona. The Brazilian superstar exited the Camp Nou in the summer of 2017 for a world record transfer fee after PSG triggered his 199 million euro release clause. The move split up the fearsome attacking trio of Neymar, Messi and Luis Suarez. Naymar’s action was largely shrouded in doubt and mystery with it and was widely suggested that Neymar wanted the move to step out of the shadow of Messi. Now, what Neymar’s father Neymar Santos Senior had to say on the issue? “My son did not leave Barcelona by my will. He was in his comfort zone and wanted to get out of it,” was all he had to say. It’s a statement that tells us very little. Was it Messi’s overwhelming popularity that prompted him to take the decision or his spirit of adventurism clubbed with a lucrative offer made him switch to PSG? Frankly, he didn’t satisfy our curiosity.
