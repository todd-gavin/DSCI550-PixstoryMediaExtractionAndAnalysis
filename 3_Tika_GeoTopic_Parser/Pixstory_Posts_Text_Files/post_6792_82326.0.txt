A man named Kishan Bharwad was shot and killed in Dhandhuka, Gujarat for allegedly posting an “objectionable” religious Facebook post. Since then, several claims related to the murder have been floating on social media. A few arrests have been made in connection with the incident. Against this backdrop, a video is being circulated widely that shows people arguing with the police. It has been claimed that Hindu residents from the village where Bharwad was murdered were forcefully evacuating the Muslim families.

Twitter user Harish Rajguru shared the footage with this message.

Another video of people sloganeering at a rally is also being circulated with the same claim. Twitter handle ‘@maheshspatel74’ posted the clip with the same claim.

Both the videos are widespread on Facebook and Twitter. (Tweet 1, Tweet 2)

Fact-check
Alt News found that neither of the two videos was linked to the murder of Kishan Bharwad.

First video

We performed a reverse image search which led us to a TV9 Gujarati report dated January 30, 2022. It says that locals were protesting the administration’s decision to erect a wall outside the Imamshah Dargah in Ahmedabad’s Pirana area. Police and representatives from the city’s municipal corporation also reached the scene to reason with the angered crowd.

Local media outlet GSTV News also covered the incident.

Second video

This video also depicts the aforementioned incident that occurred in Pirana.

Several videos of this protest were posted on Facebook, including by a page called ‘Hazrat Pir Saiyed Imamuddin’. It is evident that the video is from Pirana as there are several bystanders who can be seen in both sets of visuals. For instance, the man highlighted below.

Similarly, we have pointed out the same female protestors in both the videos using different coloured arrows.
