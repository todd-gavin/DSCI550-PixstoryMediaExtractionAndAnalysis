Kashmir has a diversity of cultures and traditions, and delicacies like Basrakh are part of that inheritance.

Another popular sweet delicacy in Kashmir is basrakh. It is created from flour and ghee, cooked, and then dunked into sugar syrup. The flavour of Basrakh is then enhanced by the addition of dry fruits. 

Traditionally, Basrakh was the main gift given during weddings and other related festivities. Not long before, the families of the bride and the groom would exchange Basrakh before any marriage in Kashmir could be considered complete.
