Songs from Sairat 
You may or may not know the film Dhadak starring Jhanvi kapoor and Ishaan Khattar was the remake of the marathi film Sairat . 
The film talked about the deep caste feeling that runs in the country and how two youths who fall in love deal with it . 
The film 's music composed by Ajay Atul gives a very festive and cultural feeling. The songs are nothing short of masterpieces.
