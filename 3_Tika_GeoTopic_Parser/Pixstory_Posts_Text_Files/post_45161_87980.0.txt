Arsenal has not competed in Europe this season, nor in the FA Cup, since January 9. Mikel Arteta is likely to criticise the Premier League for arranging their games in a 'unfair' manner.

The Champions League aspirants meet Aston Villa at Villa Park in a mid-day kickoff on Saturday, following a home win over Leicester and a loss to Liverpool on Wednesday night. This will be their third Premier League match in the space of six days.

Arsenal, led by Mikel Arteta, will have to play catch-up with their fixtures next month if they are to finish in the top four for the first time since 2016.

Arsenal has back-to-back away games against Southampton and Chelsea in the next week. The match will be followed by a key home meeting against Manchester United, who are also in the Champions League qualifying round.

Following their 2-0 loss to Liverpool last night, Mikel Arteta sarcastically applauded the Premier League for the schedule they were handed.

"Thank you so much to the Premier League for doing that. And they've done it again when we have to play Chelsea and Manchester United. So, if they want to give them any advantage, I say to them today: 'Thank you so much for doing that'."
The Gunners have played much less games than the majority of their top-four rivals this season.

Liverpool, Manchester City, and Chelsea are still in the Champions League, while Manchester United was knocked out of the competition by Atletico Madrid in the last-16 stage this week.

West Ham is still in the Europa League, and the second leg of their round of 16 tie against Sevilla is on Thursday night. Tottenham also competed in the Europa League group stage, leaving Wolves as the only team that did not compete in Europe this season.

The Gunners were also knocked out of the FA Cup by Nottingham Forest in early January. For the previous two months, they have just had the Premier League schedule to contend with.
