West ham had the first chance in the game with Samacca trying his luck with a long range shot only to see his shot fly over the post. Southampton however struck back in quick time and scored the opener at the 20th minute.Romain perraud opened the scoring with a low strike which took a deflection before finding the back of the net.West ham came incredibly close to an equaliser in the closing end of first half when Lucas paqueta found a good cross from Samacca only to smash a header onto the post.
West ham continued the good work in the second half too trying to attack the opposition goal with all their might.Bazunu was regularly kept busy by the West ham attackers who repeatedly found their target but were being denied by the goal keeper. However it was in the 64th minute when West ham finally had their breakthrough as Declan Rice equalised with a brilliant goal. A one two with benrahma saw Rice open up a fine space as he curled a beautiful shot in. 
The match ending in a 1-1 was certainly a frustrating result for the visitors as they clearly had more sights of goal and could've arguably won the game comfortably. West ham will now be facing Liverpool next weekend while, Southampton will be taking on Bournemouth in their next fixture.
