The hullabaloo over the successor of Boris Johnson has finally come to an end as Liz Truss is going to become Britain's next prime minister and the third woman to hold the office after winning a leadership race for the governing Conservative party.
After weeks of a constantly ill-tempered and divisive leadership contest, Truss, currently the foreign secretary, defeated former finance secretary Rishi Sunak in a vote of Conservative Party members, winning by 81,326 votes to 60,399.
Liz takes over as the nation faces a cost of living crisis, industrial unrest, a recession and war in Europe, where Britain has been a leading ally of Ukraine. She seemed to rule out another national election for the next two years, saying she would win a great victory for her party in 2024.
Truss will succeed Johnson, who was compelled to announce his resignation in July when six months of rolling scandals — principally Covid lockdown-breaching parties held at his Downing Street residence and office — finally culminated in a critical mass and his lawmakers forsaking him.
