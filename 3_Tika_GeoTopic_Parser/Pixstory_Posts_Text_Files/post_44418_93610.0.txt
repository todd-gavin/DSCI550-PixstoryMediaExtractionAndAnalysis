Rafael Soriano, the ex-coach of the Desportivo Ferroviária was seen headbutting a woman line
judge after he invaded the field.

The sight of a man arguing with a line judge and then headbutting her were caught on camera.

In the disturbing video the man could be seen banging his head into the line judge's nose.

Following the attack the coach was immediately dismissed by the refere. However, in the video
it is clear that Rafael continued to argue against the decision of the officials. After which the
security intervened and escorted him out of the stadium.

The actions taken by the coach were utterly disgraceful. It doesn’t matter how wrong the
decision was violence is never the way in which you should answer any situation. It is
commendable that there was no retaliation from the match officials after Rafael attacked the line
judge.

Later the club fired Rafael and released a statement which read, “Desportiva Ferroviária goes
public to inform that it repudiates any type of violence, whether physical, verbal, moral or
emotional, especially against women, and we sympathize with the arbitration assistant Marcielly
Netto, making us available for whatever is necessary. We also inform you that, in the face of
what happened, coach Rafael Soriano was disconnected from the club.”
