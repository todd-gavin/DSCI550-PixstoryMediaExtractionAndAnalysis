Nemanja Matic

Nemanja Matic is one of the footballing brains across Europe and the world. In his prime, he
was the warrior mentality player whom Jose Mourinho preferred over anyone. The central
defensive midfielder is set to leave Old Trafford as a free agent and is on the verge of sealing
the deal with AS Roma. The Serbian international will join his master, Jose Mourinho, in Italy if
the deal goes through.

Forwards/Strikers:

Edinson Cavani

The Uruguayan international has left Manchester United as a free agent after serving the club
for two seasons. Cavani joined the Red Devils as a free agent and gave it all for the Old Trafford
outfit. However, the injury in the second term neither helped him nor the player.

The player
wants to return to South America or join a Spanish outfit in the upcoming transfer window.

Gareth Bale

Gareth Bale helped Wales to qualify for the FIFA World Cup after 68 years. Similarly, he had helped Real Madrid end their Champions League drought. He inspired Real Madrid to win
against Liverpool after falling behind.

The Spanish outfit has not renewed his contract and neither did the player display intent to get a
new one. The player is wanted by multiple clubs and Getafe are the frontrunner to get his
signature.

Angel di Maria

The former Manchester United and PSG player is a free agent and will leave the French capital
on a Bosman transfer. The player featured as an attacking midfielder and a right-winger for PSG
over the last few terms. Juventus are leading the race to secure the signature of the Argentine
international.
