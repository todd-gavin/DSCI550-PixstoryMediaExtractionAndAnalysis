Multiple revisions by the Reserve Bank of India in its projections for growth and inflation have caused concern within the government about these being off the mark from actual numbers. At least two ministries are learnt to have red-flagged this and discussions have been held for developing another mechanism for periodic inflation and growth forecast.
Though at initial stages, the ministries are learnt to have held internal consultations for developing a system for projecting price trends and growth forecasts, distinct from the actual data collection and estimates currently done by departments such as the National Statistical Office.
