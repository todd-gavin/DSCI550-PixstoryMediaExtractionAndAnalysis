‌Germs enter through the nose, eyes, and mouth. Wherever the germs are the main possibility of entering our body is through our hands. Say we touch the 'germyphone' and later put our fingers on our face. You invited germ to your body.

‌According to a report, raising awareness about the significance of handwashing in a community has significantly lessened diarrhoea by 23-40%. Interestingly, this has also decreased diarrheal illness in people with weakened immune systems by 58%. Additionally, such awareness has led to a reduction in respiratory illness, e.g., common flu, in the general population by 16-21% and gastrointestinal illness in schoolchildren by 29-57%. And of course Covid-19
‌
‌Handwashing also helps in increasing antibiotic resistance in our bodies. It is important to wash hands frequently, particularly, after using toilets, changing nappies, eating, dealing with raw meat, and attending to sick children or adults. Even new research finds pets transmit antibiotic-resistant germs to your body. Hence hand washing is a lifesaver. Even though the pandemic has calmed down a bit let's not stop sanitizing and handwashing as we cannot afford a pandemic or any diseases for that reason.
