A move that was made as one for the future, Amad Diallo came into spotlight back in Italy during his Atalanta days. Came through the ranks under a great manager in Gian Piero Gasperini, he was one of those many deals MUFC made during the last days of 2020 summer transfer window. Signed in October, he signed his contract in January with Manchester United.

His time at United wasn't about a lot of positives, but it also wasn't about any negatives apart from the game time which was kind of obvious as he came in as a future prospect. In the summer of 2021, a loan move to Turkish club Fenerbahce was set to go through for the Ivory Coast winger only for an injury causing the move to fall apart. Within all this while, he has been professional of the highest level with his current club and as they say time does wonders for one it indeed did one for Amad.

Fast forward a year later to January 2022 and Amad has landed a dream move to Scottish giants Rangers FC who are to play European football and considering the Scottish league, it is also going to be fruitful for the young player. Another great thing about the move is Amad will play under a great manager who has his basis covered in attacking and he will be given ample amount of game time. Amad Diallo will definitely come back as a mature player after his short stint in Scotland, no doubt about that. Wishing him anything but good luck and hoping for a strong show from him on his loan move.
