On Monday WHO recommended that officials begin investigating whether the new variant of omicron poses additional risks as case numbers rise in Europe and Asia. It appeared in US also, now officials 
Said the sub variant is present in India as well. 

Case numbers of the what the media calls  “stealth Omicron” variant remain low, but health experts are monitoring the emergence of a new strain all over the world. 
Figures from US show fewer than 100 confirmed cases of what scientists have named the BA.2 we don’t have India number by the sub variant is present . 

So what is it a cause of concern. 
All viruses mutate and make variants these variants may form sub variants with very minor differences. So Delta has sub variant and so has omicron. Is it more virulent? we don’t know. 
So far world over omicron is seemingly milder variant and the sub variant doesn’t seem to change much.  

The problem is it is under detected or not detected even in RTPCR

Stealth Omicron,” or the the BA.2 sub-strain of coronavirus differs from the more dominant BA.1 Omicron strain or the original omicron is absence of a mutation that made the initial strain possible to detect as Omicron in PCR tests, and  BA.2 strain is harder to detect . 

BA.1 contains a genetic deletion in the “S” spike gene, and allows for doctors to quickly identify and classify positive PCR tests as Omicron. 

Faheem Yunus , the famous doctor from Maryland US who is active on social media and followed for updates, has tweeted a very easy explainer 

Omicron Sub-variant BA.2. Update:

- Belongs to the Omicron family
- Unclear if it causes reinfections
- Calling it “stealth” or “son of omicron” is media sensationalism
-  Delta had sub-variants too…
- Our current strategy works against BA.2.

So better not to think about the fancy names and variants and sub variants . 
Vaccinate, take a booster if you are due , wear masks  and resume normal life? Hopefully
