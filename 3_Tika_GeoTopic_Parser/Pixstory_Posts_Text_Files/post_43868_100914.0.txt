Arsenal will again be offered a chance to sign Barcelona’s misfit defender Samuel Umtiti
this summer as William Saliba’s future hangs in balance.

French defender Samuel Umtiti is surplus to requirements at Barca, who have decided
to let him go at the end of the season. Arsenal has long admired the 28-year-old and
came close to signing him on loan in January only for the transfer to break down as
Umtiti broke his toe.

Umtiti has not played since then, although he did return to the Barca squad earlier this month. But he has been on Arsenal’s radar since becoming a key part of the France
team which won the 2018 World Cup.

And with the Gunners recently suffering a defensive crisis, Barcelona hopes Mikel
Arteta will reignite his interest. Arsenal was struggling to fill their centre-back roles after
injuries to Ben White and Gabriel Magalhaes were followed by Rob Holding’s red card
at Tottenham. And it is understood that they will be in the market for defensive cover
despite Saliba’s impending return from a loan spell at Marseille.

Saliba, who has recently been crowned Ligue 1 youth player of the season, is expected
for pre-season. But while Arteta insists the 21-year-old will get a chance to be part of
next season’s squad, doubts persist about his future at Arsenal. Marseille wants Saliba
back next season and the player has spoken warmly about the prospect of expecting
his stay in France.

Umtiti would offer a more experienced alternative and is back on the market to make room for new signings at Barcelona. The Spanish giants have already sealed a deal to
take Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen on a free transfer when his contract
expires this summer.
