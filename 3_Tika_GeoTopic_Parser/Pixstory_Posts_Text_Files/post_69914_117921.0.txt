Amitabh Bachchan’s Jhund released on OTT on May 6. The film had landed in a soup after Hyderabad-based filmmaker Nandi Chinni Kumar alleged copyright violation. Amid trouble with the film’s streaming on OTT, a bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao directed the High Court to consider the revision petition filed by Kumar. The bench also said that the order of the top court dated May 5, 2022, would continue and direct the High Court to consider the revision petition.

As per a PTI report, the bench also comprising Justices BR Gavai and AS Bopanna said, “A compromise decree was passed between the trial court parties relating to the rights of movie Jhund. Respondent No 1 (Nandi) challenged the decree on the ground that fraud was played on him. He also filed a writ petition before the High Court which was dismissed. The trial court also dismissed the application for recall of the compromise decree...In the revision filed by the respondent, the high court ordered status quo, and this court on May 5, 2022, stayed the order passed by the high court.”
Justices Gavai and Bopanna further said, "Respondent No 1 (Nandi) appearing in person submitted that the interim order of status quo of the high court should be continued and in the alternative, there should be a stay of release of satellite rights or else he will suffer irreparable loss. Having examined the facts of the case, we are of the considered opinion that the May 5 order is to be continued till the disposal of the revision petition. The high court is directed to consider the revision petition of the respondent immediately after the summer vacation.”
