What's more precious than celebrating birthdays? Here is a little story for you guys..

So, I came to Vadodara for completing my masters thinking, what if I end up being all alone in this city since I'm new to the culture and away from home for the first time and Gujrati language is completely alien to me. But guess what!

I made friends and not just acquaintances, I made friends who understands me and whose company I actually adore. So meet me and Vedika, the birthday girl in the picture. We are always there for each other through thick and thin and this time we celebrated her birthday although I'm not a heavy believer of celebrating birthdays (Will let you guys on a lil secret! I've never celebrated my own tiol date) 
It was a great day, with awesome food and a series or picture clicking ceremony!!!!
