Are you wondering where all your time is going Whenever I am trying to get more done and feel productive I look to where my time is being wasted A lot of the time we do these things without even thinking about it They are just procrastinating habits that we have formed over time If you are low on time maybe these are some things that can be changed Checking Social Media Checking social media over and over throughout the day takes a lot of time Not Planning Whenever I don t plan my day out I usually waste half of it For a productive day I like to jot down at least to things I want to accomplish This helps to keep me on task Not Enough Sleep Getting a good amount of sleep will help you to stop wasting your day If I go through my whole day tired I find myself wasting time Worrying What People Think Worrying about what people think wastes so much time This makes us take too much time to make every decision We are busy thinking about how every decision is going to make someone else feel Certain Relationships Not every relationship is positive Some relationships are too much work and take up too much time Procrastinating Procrastinating obviously wastes time We all know this The important thing is to figure out when we are procrastinating so we can accept it and stop Trying to do too much There is only so much time in the day and only so much we can do By overfilling a schedule you may find nothing is fully finished A lot of half done projects that you have to come back to can waste time Getting Distracted is a Time Waster Remove all distractions and make sure you have everything you need Get your water and snacks before starting a project
