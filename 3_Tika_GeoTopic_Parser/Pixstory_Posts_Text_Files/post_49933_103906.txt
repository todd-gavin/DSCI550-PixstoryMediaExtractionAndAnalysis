We have many other medias showing violence it doesn t propagate violence It has triggering factors for a person to commit violence Studies have shown violent video games may cause aggression not violence Further any competitive video game or activity may cause aggression Whenever we hear of tragic mass shootings blame also falls on violent video games too Violence is physically or mentally damaging someone generally Aggression is a more broad term that refers to angry or hostile thoughts feelings or behaviours So everything violent is aggressive but not everything aggressive is violent For example getting frustrated screaming talking back and arguing are aggressive behaviours but they aren t violent The research on the effects of violent video games and behaviour often looks at these benigner forms of aggressive behaviour The only reason to cause it isn t video games There are many factors such as traumas bad parenting controlling issues etc What we need is proper awareness and regulation of video games Moreover many people use it as a tool to relieve their frustration hence reducing violent behaviour When you watch a sad movie you feel sad that it It doesn t lead you to clinical depression Similarly just because a person plays video games doesn t fundamentally change their behaviour It cannot trigger a person to go and shoot for fun
