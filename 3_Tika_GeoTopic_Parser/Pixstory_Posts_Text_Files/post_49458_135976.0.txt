It's common for parents to take away gadgets from their kids in the hopes that they'll learn to rely more on face-to-face communication. However, this is not a good practice. In fact, it can prevent trust from building between parents and their children. And let's be fair, it's kind of a jerk move too.
Not every kid can go outside and play. Disabled kids, especially. We seem to completely exclude them from discussions like these. Not to mention, children who have a hard time socializing when forced to do that have pretty bad effects on their mental health. Restricting kids from using technology in that scenario will often lead to problems like social isolation, anxiety and ADHD. These problems can be worse if kids don't have understanding parents. In these cases, they may feel left out and withdraw from social interactions.
There are several benefits of allowing kids to use technology, in moderation of course. For example, it can help them develop problem-solving skills, strengthen creative abilities and build confidence when interacting with other people. It's also beneficial for overall brain development because it helps increase cognitive flexibility and creativity. Ultimately, restricting kids from using technology doesn't seem to be a good idea - but giving them permission to use it in moderation does!
