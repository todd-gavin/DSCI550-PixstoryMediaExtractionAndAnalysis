Jaw-dropping and glamorous- words fell short when Blake Lively transformed her rose gold Versace gown into a splendid turquoise-hued ensemble at the Met Gala 2022 red carpet. Naturally, netizens couldn’t stop fawning over the Gossip Girl actor’s beautiful ode to the theme of the charity event.
Now, Mumbai Police has also taken a cue from Lively’s outfit change and used it to spread awareness about cyber security. “Keep your passwords 'Lively'. Change them frequently,” they wrote in the caption alongside a photo of Blake Lively in both the dresses.
