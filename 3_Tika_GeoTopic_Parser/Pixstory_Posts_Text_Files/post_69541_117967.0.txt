Nottingham Forest have announced the signing of free agent midfielder Jesse Lingard.
The 29-year-old was available this summer after his contract with Manchester United expired following a 22-year spell on the club’s books.
But he has now opted to join Forest’s survival bid by penning a one-year contract at the City Ground.
