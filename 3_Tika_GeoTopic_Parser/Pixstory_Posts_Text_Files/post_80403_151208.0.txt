Pierre Hojberg (6.2/10): Pierre Emile Hojbjerg had a good game in the midfield with three tackles and an aerial win to his name. 
Rodrigo Bentanacur (6.5/10): Bentanacur was an engine in the midfield for Spurs with two tackles and a dribble. 
Ivan Perisic (6/10): The Conte’s faithful, Perisic did not have a fruitful game against Arsenal. He struggled to help his team out offensively as well as defensively. He had a pass success rate of 92%. 
Harry Kane (6.7/10): Though Harry Kane had a goal return against Arsenal, the player could not contribute much more than that. He scuffed up the golden chance in the second half to equalize. 
Heung Min Son (6.2/10): After scoring a hattrick in the previous game, Heung Min Son failed to repeat the performance against Arsenal. He had two dribbles to his name against the Gunners. 
Richarlison (6.3/10): Richarlison helped Spurs to get the penalty through his ability to dribble but barring that, he could not impact the game.
