The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson, hacker alias “Neo,” who is just minding his own business when all of a sudden everyone starts bothering him and telling him what to do. After hearing persuasive arguments from both sides, Neo opts for the guys with cooler sunglasses, and blindly swallows a pill given to him by a man he’s known for about two minutes.
Turns out it’s actually the future and Neo’s entire reality is just a simulation. Who knew?. The real world is located in a grimy sewer where they all wears rags and are constantly under attack by robot jellyfish. Morpheus teaches Neo how to do some Looney Tunes shit and then they celebrate with some homemade cookies. Morpheus gets roughed up by a guy in a bathroom, so Neo and Trinity take matters into their own guns. While fighting, Neo invents a new move: falling down really
slowly. He dies.

Alright, let’s start with the names.

Neo means “new” in Greek, and is an anagram for "One," which is, in my experience, the loneliest number. Morpheus is named for the God of Dreams in Ovid's bestseller the Metamorphoses. Trinity refers to the Christian Bible’s “Holy Trinity”: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Just as the Holy Trinity purportedly brought Jesus back to life, so too does Trinity bring Neo back to life with a big wet, well I’m sure you get it. Also, Trinity begins the movie in room 303, which has threes in it. But don’t worry, the Christian imagery doesn’t end there. If you look very carefully, you might notice that Neo is a sort of Christ figure. Neo’s other name, "Thomas Anderson”, harkens back to the Apostle Thomas, aka doubting Thomas, who expressed reservations about the whole Christ savior thing. Etymologically(a very big word which has to do with origin of words), Anderson means "son of man," a nickname Jesus used sometimes around his mortal friends. Cypher is Neo’s Judas, betraying him for a sirloin and a smile.
