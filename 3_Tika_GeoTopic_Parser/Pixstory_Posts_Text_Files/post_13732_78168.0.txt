Our beloved country Afghanistan has been living under the umbrella of a democratic system for ten years. Karl Raymond Popper believes that one of the harms that always threatens democratic systems and is likely to cause catastrophe is the growth of populism; Because the principle in democratic systems is competition. Political parties and influential figures try to be the masses and ordinary people of the society in an election. The competition for votes makes the political parties and their candidates raise more popular issues and the issues of interest to the masses. Give.
Masses and Enemies:
One of the issues that fascinates and excites the masses the most is ethnic and religious prejudices. Why?
Friedrich von Hayek speaks beautifully about this. Hayek says that one of the rules of human nature is to agree more on negative plans than on positive ones. One of these negative programs is enemy building. Populists all over the world use this method to gain power. As Hitler and the Nazi Party came, they declared the Jews as enemies and Stalin, the communist of the Soviets, the Gulaks. In India, too, the BJP (Hindu Nationalist Party) has resorted to hostility against Muslims in order to win the majority of Hindu votes.
In Afghanistan, the first person to try to resort to this strategy was Amir Abdul Rahman Khan. Abdul Rahman Khan, when he was able to rely on the British with the help of the British, thought of overthrowing the sectarian monarchy and establishing a strong and powerful central government. To this end, he marched on the Hazaras and suppressed the Hazara people. In order to be able to provide many troops for this campaign, Amir Musauf excommunicated the Shiites and the Hazara people and declared jihad against them a presumption. Therefore, we can say that the first founder of populism in Afghanistan is Amir Abdul Rahman Khan.
Current populists.
