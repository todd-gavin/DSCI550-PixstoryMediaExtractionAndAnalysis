The prices of Renaissance books almost always sold as loose leaves are difficult to obtain and in general are partial and unreliable There is instead a completely exceptional source for Venice, the Zornale of the bookseller Francesco de Madiis, that is, a register of the daily sales of books, approximately each registered with the fineness and the price from May to January The registration took place with the same coin as in the Aldini catalogues, furthermore the value of the ducat coin did not change for many centuries as it is linked to the value of gold and for this reason it is possible to make a comparison To make a reliable estimate of the price it is necessary to standardize the cost in terms of cost per sheet since paper accounted for more than the total production expenditure. Being the Zornale of a few previous years we must assume that in the period of Aldine activity the general prices of books were even lower than in what is not shown in it To have a general idea of the cost it varied from to denarii per sheet Consulting the Zornale the prices of Latin books are more expensive than those in the vernacular while the only example of a text in Greek by Zornale costs times more because it was a book imported from a Milanese workshop since Greek texts were not yet printed in Venice at the time of the Zornale. excessively as the texts were also sold in other workshops The Greek texts are instead more expensive in terms of cost for which the contemporary complaints have a justification The most expensive of all are the in octavos the portable books are very expensive even compared to the titles in large format from the same catalog The monthly salary of a Vatican librarian was ducats, approximately the amount for which a horse was bought at the same time, therefore the cost of ducats to buy the Aristotelian collection was a rather substantial figure and equivalent to a month salary of a university teacher
