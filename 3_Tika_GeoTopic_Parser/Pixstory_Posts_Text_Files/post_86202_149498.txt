Flowers Some are cultivated to beautify a place some grow and beautify the place just by existing They uplift the mood of those full of sadness They bring colors to the life of those disheartened They can bring joy to the face of a random stranger Don t believe me Try giving someone even a single flower and watch the smile bloom on their face
