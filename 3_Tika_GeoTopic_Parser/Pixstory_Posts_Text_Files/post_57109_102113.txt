The Climate crisis has become apparent with the rising temperatures and heatwaves every day Climate change refers to long term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns These shifts may be natural such as through variations in the solar cycle But since the s human activities have been the main driver of climate change primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal oil and gas New research shows that rising temperatures due to climate change deprive people of sleep globally Published in the journal One Earth the study provides the first planetary scale evidence that warmer than average temperatures erode human sleep said Kelton Minor at the University of Copenhagen Denmark who led the research It might be the tip of the iceberg because it s very likely our estimates are conservative The study looked at more than people spread across countries and analyzed their sleep tracker records This is because our body temperature needs to drop to fall asleep which would become difficult during rising temperatures The lack of sleep would impact both physical and mental health Kelton Minor also said that due to increasing temperatures sleep is eroded and it was observed in a study that by a person would not be able to sleep for approximately hours a year
