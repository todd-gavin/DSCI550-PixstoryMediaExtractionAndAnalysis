The 40-year-old has also hinted that he may return to the United States in the future. During his two-year stint with the Los Angeles Galaxy, Zlatan Ibrahimovic called himself the "greatest player to ever play in MLS" and stated he was "too talented for the whole league.

Between 2018 and 2019, Ibrahimovic scored 53 goals in 58 games for the Galaxy before returning to Serie A with Milan.
Despite the fact that the Galaxy failed to make the playoffs in 2018 and then lost in the Western Conference semi-finals the following year, Ibrahimovic believes his effect justifies him the number one spot.

After his contract with Manchester United was terminated early, Ibrahimovic joined the Galaxy in March 2018. The 36-year-old had only recently returned from a significant knee injury the previous year.
"I'm very happy. I'm very thankful for MLS because they gave me the chance to feel alive.” He told ESPN.

“But the problem was I was still too alive. So I was too good for the whole competition. That is what I showed. And I'm the best ever to play in MLS and that is not me having ego or trying to show off now. That is true.

"There was no empty stadiums when I was playing. It was even overbooked, so I cannot complain, and I'm very happy I was there."

Despite the fact that Ibrahimovic is 40 years old and still playing at the highest level, injuries have limited him to just 24 appearances for Milan in all competitions so far this season. His contract is up in the summer, and there have been rumours that he would retire, which he categorically denied earlier this month.

When asked about his future plans, the former Sweden striker would not rule out a return to the United States, either as a player or by buying a club like David Beckham did.
