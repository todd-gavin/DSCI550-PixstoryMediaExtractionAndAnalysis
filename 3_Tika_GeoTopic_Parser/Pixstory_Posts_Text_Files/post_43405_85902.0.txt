Personality has come from a Latin word ‘Persona’ meaning to speak through (mask). As in the ancient days masks were worn in Greece and Rome by actors, while enacting plays. Thus, personality is used for influencing others through external appearance. However, personality is not the external appearance alone.

Personality is a characteristic way of thinking, feeling, and behaving. It embraces mood, opinions, and is most clearly expressed in interaction with other people. It includes behavioural characteristics, both inherent and acquired, that distinguish one person from one another and that can be observed in human relation to environment and to the social group.

"Personality is the most adequate conceptualization of a person is behaviour in all its details, which the scientist  can provide in a moment. " - McClelland.
