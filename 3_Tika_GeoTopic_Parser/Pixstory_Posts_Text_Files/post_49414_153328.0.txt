Pete Arredondo, the police chief for the Uvalde school district, was dismissed in August on the superintendent of the district's recommendation. Although Arredondo has stated that he did not view himself as the officer in control, the Texas House committee's report stated that under the district's active shooter strategy, he would have been the incident commander.
Earlier this week, less than a day after reports of Officer Crimson Elizondo's hiring broke, the district let her go. Elizondo, a Texas state trooper who responded to the massacre, was one of seven troopers whose actions are currently under internal review.
She resigned from her position as a trooper in August, according to police body camera evidence obtained by CNN. Uvalde school administrators apologised on Thursday but did not elaborate on the decision of the hiring Elizondo.
"We sincerely apologize to the victims' families and the greater Uvalde community for the pain that this revelation has caused," the statement said.
Several investigations into the shooting are still ongoing and many major decisions are still to be taken.
