Climate is a big thing and as a topic it used to be discussed in serious live forums. For a layman, however climate changes was melting ice glaciers or polar bear conservation. And now it's not that like it's a reality which we can see everyday, with or without knowing it has started affecting our daily lives. So that information has to be passed on we have to spread the word especially to the vulnerable/marginalised communities are the most vulnerable to climate change across the world. Various reports show they are the least contributor to these changing climatic conditions. That's the irony and these people are not at all aware about what exactly the climate emergency is. The can't understand the technical terminologies of climate change and the advocacy process happening in the world. So we have to start communicating. We have to change the narrative to communicate in their social and cultural context.

So collectively, all these actions should be taken. So now's the time to start, to preserve and protect our health, our families and our livelihoods. We should start changing, start acting now. Start acting for our planet start acting from our homes. That's the message we have for this Earth day.
