Last December, during the heartfelt match against Anderlecht, the public at the Breydel Stadium in Brugge became the protagonist of unpleasant racist insults aimed at their opponents The guests&#39; coach Vincent Kompany had reported the incident at the end of the match We were targeted for both players and staff I am disgusted certain things shouldn&#39;t happen A few months later Club Brugge took the situation head on by devising a method in step with technology Thousands of QR codes have been inserted inside the facility to be scanned as soon as you notice that someone is engaging in racist behavior Once the signal has been sent, the system will notify the closest steward who will therefore be able to intervene promptly A simple idea but one that can revolutionize the fight against racism in stadiums Photo credits ESPN
