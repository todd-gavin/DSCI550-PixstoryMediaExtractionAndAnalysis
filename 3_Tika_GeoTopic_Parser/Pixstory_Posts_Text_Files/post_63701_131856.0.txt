In another big announcement from Gamescom 2022, the official trailer for the next installment in The Dark Picture Anthology, The Devil In Me has been released. 
 
The Devil in Me will be the fourth installment in Supermassive's Dark Pictures series – continuing from Man of Medan, Little Hope, and House of Ashes. This time, the story focuses on a group of film makers trapped in a replica of H. H. Holmes' infamous 'Murder Castle' hotel.
 
From the looks of it, The Devil in Me looks to be something of a departure from previous anthology entries, trading the supernatural overtones for a more grounded, grisly Saw inspired slasher horror vibe.
 
The trailer shows off plenty more of its traps and torture rooms, and gives a few hints that the studio might be expanding its familiar horror formula a little this time around, seemingly adding the likes of mini-games and inventory puzzles to its usual cinematic action and choice-based gameplay.
 
Besides coming in both digital and physical formats, Bandai Namco which is one of the publishers of the game is also offering an Animatronic Collector’s Edition which includes a collector’s box, exclusive postcard and envelope, a map of the Murder Castle Hotel, a Lonnit Entertainment business card, and an four-inch animatronic bust of The Devil In Me’s villain
 
The Devil In Me arrives on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam on November 18. The game is said to mark the finale of The Dark Pictures Anthology's first season, though given that the developers at Supermassive have trademarked five logos, The Devil in Me is unlikely to be the last one.
