Fardin Nabizadeh Alzheimer s disease Neuroimaging Initiative Abstract Objective There is a shred of growing evidence demonstrating that diabetic patients are at higher risk of developing Alzheimer s disease compared to the general population The previous investigation showed the protective effect of metformin for delaying dementia in diabetic patients However there are limited data on the effect of metformin on structural changes This study aims to investigate the effect of metformin on hippocampal and cortical volumes in non demented diabetic individuals Method We entered non demented diabetic subjects including mild cognitive impairment MCI and cognitively healthy individuals from Alzheimer s disease Neuroimaging Initiative ADNI which were then categorized as metformin users and non users We used the ANCOVA model for measuring the association between metformin use and hippocampal and cortical volumes Results Among subjects with a mean age of included in this study individuals were stratified as metformin users Results of the univariate model indicate that metformin users had a higher right p and left parietal lobe volume p Moreover the volume of left cingulate was higher in those who used metformin compared to those not used it p Our results were also significant for the right frontal lobe and indicated that metformin users had higher volume p There were no significant differences in the hippocampus occipital and temporal regions Conclusion Our findings showed the protective effects of metformin on brain volumes in non demented elderly individuals with diabetes Comparing the groups show strong enough results regarding the lower atrophy in metformin users Sources
