Australia has denied reports that Australian security officers stationed in Honiara Solomon Islands to suppress disturbances in November were told not to safeguard Chinese built infrastructure The Guardian reported that Danny Philip the former prime minister of the Solomon Islands who is currently the chair of the current government s foreign policy advisory panel made the assertion Philip said his country s new security agreement with China was born of a desire to protect Chinese assets in the country in the event of future unrest during a webinar hosted by Georgetown University s Center for Australia New Zealand and Pacific Studies and the University of Hawai i s Center for Pacific Islands Studies A very senior diplomat from the Australian High Commission said very plainly to us that their presence here was not to protect any Chinese interests this needs to be verified but as a government it was said to us in no uncertain terms they are here not to protect Chinese investments Chinese infrastructure So that gives rise to other considerations in the minds of the Solomon Islands government to get the Chinese police to come in and train our own police to handle the situation such as we have last November Asked if this was the primary goal he said the agreement was also aimed at protecting Solomon Islanders too
