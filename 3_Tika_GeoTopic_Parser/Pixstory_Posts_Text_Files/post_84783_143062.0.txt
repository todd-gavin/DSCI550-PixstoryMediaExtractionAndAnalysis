The large city of Delhi, the capital of India, is home to many wealthy and powerful people, but it also has a number of complex issues, including overcrowding, waterlogging, poor sanitation, an inadequate system for collecting trash, sewage, traffic infractions, and an increase in commercial activity in residential areas. Sanitation and a reliable waste collection/disposal system would be the most crucial item I could fix to improve Delhi out of all the issues mentioned above and maintain cleanliness. The amount of garbage and waste produced by residential areas, roadside sellers, construction sites, hospitals, and other regions in a large metropolis with millions of residents is huge. For regional businesses, disposing of tonnes of these waste products on a regular basis is a major burden. 
A city that has been well cleaned and sterilised is one that is also healthy and beautiful to live and work. I genuinely believe that with the help of the local government and the efforts of the people, Delhi will become a clean, beautiful city that will not only inspire pride in Delhiwallas but in all Indians as their capital.
