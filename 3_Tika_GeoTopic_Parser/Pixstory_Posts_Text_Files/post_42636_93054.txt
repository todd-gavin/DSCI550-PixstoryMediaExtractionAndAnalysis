On Saturday night I watched the match between Real Madrid and Getafe where Madrid won the match by a scoreline and get one step closer to the La Liga title Now Real Madrid is standing at the top with points and FC Barcelona is in the second spot with points so I think the la Liga title race is almost over because to cover the points gap Barcelona have to win all the eight matches they have to play and they have to wish that Real Madrid will lose at least four matches which I think is impossible As a Real Madrid fan I am very happy at the moment because every fan wants their team to win the league title But some Real Madrid fans who came to the stadium to watch the match between Real Madrid and Getafe didn t seem too much happy because at one moment when Gareth Bale entered the pitch after Carlo Ancelotti decided to sub off Benzema in the th minute every Madrid fan started to boo Gareth Bale because of some unknown reason As a fan of Real Madrid and knowing what happened in the last couple of years between the Bale and Madrid I think Bale received too much already and now we Madridistas should respect Gareth Bale because of his commitment to Real Madrid After the Wales Golf Madrid controversy the relationship between the board of Real Madrid former manager Zinedine Zidane and Gareth Bale was not so good and because of that Bale went to Tottenham Hotspur on a one year loan deal and played quite well After that when the season started Gareth bale came back and decided to stay at Real Madrid after he talked with new manager Carlo Ancelotti Carlo also believed in him and gave him the place in playing at the start of the season BUT Gareth Bale got an injury and he got out for months We all knew what Gareth Bale meant to us since he joined the club and now we should respect him because maybe it s his last season at Real Madrid
