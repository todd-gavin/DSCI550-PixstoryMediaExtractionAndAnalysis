This is difficult as if you look at Lingard he endured a frustrating campaign with Manchester United last season and struggled for minutes This means that it will take time for him to reach his optimum level and therefore he has not been able to be as effective as Forrest and their fans would have liked The defense also seems to be a big issue so far as they have leaked several goals and their goal difference is which is unacceptable Opportunities It would be a massive achievement for Forest to stay up and avoid relegation this season This is purely down to the fact of the competitiveness of the league and the challenge clubs face who have come up from the Championship As mentioned earlier Forest should look to focus heavily on a counterattacking style of football as they do not have the defensive stability to attempt to dominate games from the get go Threats The biggest threat Forest face is the fear of the side not building good chemistry So far the defense does not look to be on the same wavelength and this is an area that needs massive improvement Injuries to their main players are also a big threat as while they have a good starting eleven they do not possess strong squad depth and they will hope that their summer signings stay fit throughout the whole campaign Take a look at Nottingham Forest s squad for the Premier League campaign
