Following a two-year spell at Bayern Munich in which Flick collected two Bundesliga titles, DFB Cup, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup and UEFA Champions League trophies, the 57-year-old took his country's reins in August last year.
Typically, of a coach who led Bayern to an unprecedented sextuple, Flick took to international duty in fine fashion.
Predecessor Joachim Löw finished his tenure with two losses, a defeat and just one win as Germany exited the UEFA Euro 2020 championships at the last-16 stage to old foes England.
One of Flick's first decisions was to immediately reinstate Thomas Müller to his side and the fresh face of a new coach saw the team hoover up eight successive victories. Now with 14 games under their belt, the former shopkeeper's side still boast an impressive run of results (W9, D4, L1) and they again look a force to be reckoned with.
It shouldn't come as a surprise when you consider that Flick served as Löw's assistant when Germany claimed a fourth world title in 2014.
Since taking the big job, the national team have scored in 13 of those 14 matches and hit four or more goals on six occasions, including a 9-0 demolition of Liechtenstein as Germany made light work of qualification for Qatar.
Option 1
As was the case during his spell in the Bayern hotseat, Flick has settled on a 4-3-2-1 formation for all but one of his games in charge, instead opting for a 3-4-2-1 in the 1-1 draw with England in June.
Interestingly, versatile defender Thilo Kehrer has started most frequently under Flick, with the former Schalke man beginning on the right and left of Germany's defence four times apiece and at centre-half in his three other starts.
He's clearly a player trusted by his coach and his versatility will be a major asset in tournament football, but Kehrer is most likely to start from the bench when Germany are at full strength.
