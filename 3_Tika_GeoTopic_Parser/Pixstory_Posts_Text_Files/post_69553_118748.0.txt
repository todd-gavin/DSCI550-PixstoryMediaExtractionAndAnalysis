The Gamroo-Gundqaiser Bridge, which was damaged by last month's torrential rains, is now closed to the public, affecting dozens of villages. 
The bridge's base columns on both sides, as well as parts of the road, caved in after the Arin stream was flooded on June 22, according to locals. 
They claimed that administration officials visited the site the same day and promised immediate repairs to alleviate the hardships that many villagers would face. However, no repair work has yet begun, and the bridge remains closed to all traffic. 
According to locals, the bridge is used by commuters from at least a dozen villages, and it also serves as a sort of bypass to divert traffic in and out of the town area.
