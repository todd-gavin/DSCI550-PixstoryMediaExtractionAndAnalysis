No one can disagree with the fact that the coronavirus pandemic has changed the way we approach our daily lives But if I have to mention something that I would not want to change since the pandemic then it will be how we thought about more than just ourselves how we learned to look at the bigger picture and how we started to appreciate the small little things how we learned to prioritize our overall physical and mental health Let me know what do you think about this Or if there is any experience that changed you for good that you might like to share with me
