The situation is dire at Manchester United. A plethora of players like Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic, and Juan Mata are running down their contracts and the duo of Fred and Scott McTominay are nowhere near the perfect duo. If the 4-0 humbling by Brighton Hove and Albion is anything to come by one could see that Man Utd as a team were so poor.


 One could see that change from top to bottom is needed. The incoming boss Erik ten Hag has a few players in his mind when he does an overhaul. 


The focus is on the midfield for now as the call for a defensive midfielder is much needed to catch up to Liverpool and Man City. Man Utd have been linked with Enzo Fernandez who currently plays for Argentina powerhouse, River Plate. 

Fernandez primarily plays as a central midfielder, but he doesn’t have any problem slotting into defensive midfield roles. 

Fernandez started his career in the River Plate academy in 2006, and he moved through the development process to make for the Primeira division in January 2019. 

Looking at his season heatmap we can see that Enzo has operated mostly in the midfield, going forward to middle third.


We will look at some of the stats of Bueno Aires native. His first touch is very sleek and smooth which allows him to circulate play to the teammates at a fast tempo, which is very important in escaping from opposition pressure. He likes to play one-two touch with his teammates mostly in the final third. He would play between the lines usually to receive the possession before spreading the ball into the wide areas. He has made 76.3 touches per 90.

The Argentinian is known for threading up passes and he would usually send a defense-splitting pass to his teammates. Even though he has 0 assists to his name this season in Copa Libertadores and 5 assists in Copa de la Superliga, he has created many chances for his teammates to score or score a goal. His weak foot is equally good as his right foot.
