Monza wins the first of two matches against Brescia for the Serie B playoffs and puts one foot in the final Rigamonti ends up with the Danish striker Gytkjaer author of the double that puts the Rondinelle in difficulty for the return match scheduled at the Brianteo on May Yet the match immediately went uphill for Monza To Brescia&#39;s advantage with an unfortunate deflection by Carlos Augusto who serves a golden ball to Moreo who scores with a nice left footed shot under the cross from an angled position Important for the progress of the match two injuries suffered by Brescia in the space of minutes out Huard with a concussion and Sabelli in the half hour with a suspected fracture of a vertebra Pajac and Bertagnoli take their place The draw comes before the interval Al Gytkjaer counters a short clearance by Joronen after Ciurria&#39;s pass The second goal in the second half after about ten minutes Joronen lands a very fast Mota in the area and from the penalty spot Gytkjaer scores his personal double and gives Monza the lead Result that will remain unchanged until the triple whistle
