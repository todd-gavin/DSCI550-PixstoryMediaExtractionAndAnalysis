Cristiano Ronaldo scored his first hat-trick since rejoining Manchester United against Tottenham...
Cristiano Ronaldo returned to action in style after missing the Manchester derby due to an injury, scoring his first hat-trick since returning to England against Tottenham Hotspur on March 12, 2022.
The 37-year-old star led the Red Devils to a crucial 3-2 victory over the Spurs to keep their dreams of finishing in the top four alive.
Ronaldo's hat-trick was his 59th of his career and only his second in a Manchester United shirt. The last time he scored three goals in a game for Manchester United was against Newcastle United in 2008.
His adversary Lionel Messi, the all-time leading hat-trick scorer, is a close second with 54 hat-tricks in his career.
Only Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have ever scored more than 50 hat-tricks in their careers. They are followed by Robert Lewandowski (29 hat-tricks) and Luis Suarez (21 hat-tricks).
When was the last time Messi scored a hat-trick?
Messi gets a hat-trick for Argentina, breaking Pelé's international goals record.
Argentina beat Bolivia 3-0 in a World Cup qualifier, and Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick to surpass Pelé as South America's best male international scorer with 79 goals.
In Buenos Aires, Messi opened the scoring after 14 minutes, weaving over the Bolivia defence before curling in from just outside the area. He made it 2-0 in the 64th minute with a one-two with Lautaro Martnez and brilliant technique in a crowded penalty area, and he completed the hat-trick with two minutes remaining, smashing home a rebound from close range.
Messi's hat-trick was his ninth for Argentina, putting him two goals ahead of Pelé in the scoring charts. "I was a little nervous, but I wanted to enjoy it," Messi remarked.
