The snake will tighten its hold if you oppose it and struggle. The snake's natural instinct is to constrict its prey tightly until it stops moving because, if the prey can resist, the snake could get hurt. And that's something it does not want. The snake is therefore tremendously motivated to keep you still. Attacking its head may cause it to release its grip—a big may, or it may coil up around you to defend itself and tighten the hold ultimately making it more difficult for you to save yourself.
So you want to go to the tail—not the head. Since the snake's strength is dispersed throughout its body, if you start at the tail, you can unwind it and eventually defeat it by taking out individual sections one at a time. You can release yourself if you can control and unwind the tail. It would be difficult to perform this with just one hand; it would probably only work if both are free.
This is why you should never handle a captive constrictor that is longer than 9 feet alone. Snake attacks on humans are rare. You're too big for a snake to eat, your shoulder is too wide to swallow. You're also not its regular meal. The great anaconda holds the power to kill you but it will most likely not attack you. And honestly, if you're at a place where you're in danger of being constricted by an anaconda, I hate to break it to you, the snake is the least of your concerns.
