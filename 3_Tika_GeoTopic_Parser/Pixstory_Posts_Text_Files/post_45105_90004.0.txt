#3.  Jack Rodwell

Manchester City were seeking for a midfielder in the summer of 2012 after winning the Premier League in 2011-12. Everton's Jack Rodwell impressed the Cityzens with his performances and was so signed.

In midfield, Rodwell had a spark about him that brought a lot of energy to the pitch. He was quick, capable of tackling, and had a solid understanding of the game. In his debut season with Manchester City, he was out for two months due to a hamstring injury. In his first season, he made 11 Premier League matches.


#2.  Scott Sinclair

The English forward is a Bristol Rovers academy graduate. Scott Sinclair joined Chelsea in 2005, but was loaned out to a number of other clubs. In 2010, he joined Swansea City, and his performances at the Liberty Stadium drew the attention of a number of Premier League clubs.

In 2012, Sinclair joined Manchester City to play for Roberto Mancini. With several top players around him, he was expected to shine at the Etihad. Unfortunately for him, the Englishman only made 11 Premier League appearances with the Cityzens. Sinclair battled on the bench after failing to impress the Italian management.


#1.  Jo

Having come through the ranks at Corinthians, Jo started his senior career in the Brazilian league. In 2005, he joined CSKA Moscow in the Russian Premier League. In his first 18 appearances, he scored 14 goals.

This inspired Manchester City to sign the Brazilian striker in the summer of 2008. The tall striker struggled to get a place in the starting lineup after managing to score once in his four league appearances. In total, he managed to start only six matches in the 2008-09 season, scoring only once.
