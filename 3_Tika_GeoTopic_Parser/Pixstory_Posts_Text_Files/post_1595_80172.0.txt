The Indiana Pacers traded Domantas Sabonis to the Sacramento Kings today in a deal that involved six players and a draft pick.

Here are the full details of the trade, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN:

Sacramento receives: Sabonis, Jeremy Lamb, Justin Holiday and a 2027 second-round pick

Indiana receives: Tyrese Haliburton, Buddy Hield and Tristan Thompson

Sabonis, a two-time All-Star, has averaged 18.9 points on 58.0 percent shooting, 12.1 rebounds and 5.0 assists per game in his sixth NBA season. The Oklahoma City Thunder traded him and Victor Oladipo to the Pacers for Paul George in 2017.

Indiana signed Sabonis to a four-year, $74.9 million contract extension in October 2019 which runs through 2023-24.

Sabonis could also help one of the NBA's worst defenses. He currently sports a positive defensive box plus-minus, per Basketball Reference. The Kings are 29th in the league in defensive rating, per NBA.com.
