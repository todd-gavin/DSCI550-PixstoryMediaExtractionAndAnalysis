Headaches are easily one of the most annoying things we have to deal with. Donâ€™t you just hate the onset of a headache and its slow, long and constant pounding?
While most of you might like to turn the lights out, put on a balm or pop a pill to deal with it, there are some other ways you can cure headaches and also prevent them.
Instead of taking medicine you should have almonds. Magnesium, found in almonds, may protect your body from the brunt of a headache by relaxing the blood vessels. Just pop in a few almonds or dry roast them and top it with some honey for that extra flavour when you have a headache next.
