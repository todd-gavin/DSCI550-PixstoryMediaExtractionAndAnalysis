Third case of Covid among participants in the Wimbledon tournament After Marin Cilic and Matteo Berrettini, the virus also stopped Roberto Bautista Agut, semifinalist in the edition and seeded number of the tournament. This was communicated by the Spanish tennis player himself. Today I communicated my withdrawal to the organizers I tested positive for Covid Luckily the symptoms are not very severe but I think it&#39;s the best decision Thank you for your support I hope to come back soon After defeating the Hungarian Alan Balazs in the first round Bautista Agut was expected today from the match against the Colombian Daniel Galan which thus passes directly to the third round
