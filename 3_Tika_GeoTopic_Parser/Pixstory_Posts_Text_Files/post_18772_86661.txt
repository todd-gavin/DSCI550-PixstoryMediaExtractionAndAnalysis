The criteria for awarding the Ballon d&#39;Or, the highest individual recognition for footballers, have changed. From the next edition, the winners of which will be announced in September or October, the calendar year will no longer be taken into account but the previous sporting season. In this way, the players will not be evaluated over two half-seasons to date, the prize was awarded in December but over an entire year that begins with the start of the championships and ends with the Champions League final or, like this year for women&#39;s football, with the European Championships. This is the opportunity to give new impetus to the award Until yesterday we judged the players over two half-seasons In this way the choice will be more understandable said Pascal Ferr editor-in-chief of France Football the French newspaper that created the award Another difference from the past will be the number of voters Not more but only coinciding with the first hundred nationals in the Fifa ranking
