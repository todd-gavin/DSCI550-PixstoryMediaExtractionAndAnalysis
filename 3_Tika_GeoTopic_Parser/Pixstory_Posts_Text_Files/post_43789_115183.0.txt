Kante, who is largely regarded as one of the best defensively-minded players on the planet, 
would significantly enhance Arsenal's midfield. He would be a far better option in the middle of 
the park than Granit Xhaka and Albert Sambi Lokonga because of his extensive Premier League and European experience.

Vieira would flourish alongside Martin Odegaard as Arsenal's primary creative outlets behind their forward line with Kante's arrival, as well. However, it appears that a deal to sign the Chelsea player is still some distance off at this point given that the Gunners have apparently yet to confirm their interest in him.

According to the source, Mikel Arteta wants to find a new defensive midfielder and is investigating whether Chelsea would be willing to sell Kante rather than risk having him depart 
Stamford Bridge for free the next year.

Due to his Covid vaccination status, Kante was not included in the Chelsea team's preseason 
trip to the United States. The 31 year injury plagued old's season resulted in him starting just 21 Premier League games.

Tuchel recognised that Chelsea's injury issues with Kante were a "major problem" at the end of the previous season. According to Tuchel, if Kante only participates in 40% of the games, it may be a miracle if we finish third. He is the key player, so if he only plays in 40% of the games, 
there is a serious issue.

Given that percentage, his ability to create outcomes may be a miracle. It puts everything into perspective because, as Tuchel witnessed, Liverpool struggled greatly last season without Van Dijk. The distinction is evident. Chelsea's most important player, N'Golo, must be there for the team.
