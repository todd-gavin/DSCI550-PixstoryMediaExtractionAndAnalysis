It was goalkeeper Ionu»õ Radu's first appearance in Serie A for Inter, 3rd in total since 2019, in which Romanian keeper made an irremediable mistake when score was 1-1 and 13th placed Bologna defeated Inter Milan at home for 2-1. With just 4 games left, rivals AC Milan got the advantage from this error, going back to top of the table with 74 points from 34 matches. This was Inter's fourth loss in the league this season. 


Simone Inzaghi was saying before the match "I have faith in him" but that faith might have lost forever now.


Inter took the lead with a brilliant goal from Perisic in the 3rd minute itself. Croatian Perisic got the ball in the right side of the box, which he dribbled out due to heavy traffic of Bologna players. After turning, he dribbled back to the edge of the box, with the help of a give and go with Barella, and took the shot with his left, to beat the keeper at first post. It was a beauty to watch. 

Lautaro Martinez got a chance to double the lead in the 9th minute, after Skorupski stopped Dimarco's shot, which fell for the striker in the box, which he blazed into the sky. 

Bologna scored in the 28th minute, against the run of play. Former Inter player Arnautovic headed in a perfect long cross from Barrow to equalise. Bologna came to the match with draws against Udinese, Juventus and AC Milan, so the goal was a relief to them. It came from their very first attempt on goal too. 

Dumfries and Dimarco's attempts went over the goal and Barrow missed a big chance from an Arnautovic cross, which he hit into the stands instead of goal. Martinez missed another chance, a free header from corner, again seen going over the crossbar. 


Radu's mistake came in the 81st minute, when Perisic sent a throw- in directly to the keeper from the left side, Radu swinging his left foot, which shockingly did not connect the ball. The ball rolled into the net, which Bologna striker Sansone claimed by kicking in from 1 yard from goal line.
