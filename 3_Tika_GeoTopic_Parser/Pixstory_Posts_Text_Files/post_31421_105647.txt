One hundred days ago children in Ukraine had a normal life They were safe They had hopes and dreams to pursue They went to school and met their friends But the war changed everything for them and their families It is depriving children of stability safety school friends family home and hopes for the future And it is taking the lives of children and hurting their bodies and souls One Hundred Days of War has brought devastation and suffering to Ukrainian children on a scale and scope not seen since the Second World War World War II And had a profound impact on the lives of children with consequences that we will face for years to come Nearly two in three children have been displaced by the fighting Families have been torn apart Schools hospitals playgrounds parks and thousands of homes have been damaged and continue to be destroyed the conditions of children in areas where fighting has intensified are increasingly desperate Children fleeing violence are at high risk of family separation violence abuse sexual exploitation and trafficking Most of them have been exposed to deep trauma and emotional suffering that will accompany them for years I would like to extend my deepest condolences to all the families who have lost children to this horrific war Every day on average more than two children are killed and more than four injured mainly in attacks with explosive weapons in populated areas And these are just the numbers that the United Nations has been able to verify we believe the real figures are much higher The strength of every parent and every person caring for children in Ukraine and abroad deserves our Utmost Respect Every single day Ukrainian mothers fathers and caregivers wake up and go to bed not knowing what the next day will bring them Yet they do their best for all the children in their care to keep them safe I would like to sincerely thank them for this Statement by the UNICEF Representative in Ukraine
