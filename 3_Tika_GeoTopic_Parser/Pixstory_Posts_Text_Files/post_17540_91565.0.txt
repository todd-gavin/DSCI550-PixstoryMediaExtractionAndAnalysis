Westbrook’s form has surged over the past couple of weeks, during which the guard averaged 19.6 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 7.0 assists, shooting 48.7% from the field and 38.1% from downtown.

Frank Vogel said he believes the 33-year-old will keep up the good work even after James and Davis returned from their injuries.

“I don’t think it should change that much, honestly,” Vogel said.

“We want him always to be aggressive but never to force. That applies if Bron and AD are out there or if we’ve got the group we had tonight. We want him to be as aggressive as he can, but to be efficient with his turnover ratio and his shooting percentage. So that shouldn’t change that much.”
