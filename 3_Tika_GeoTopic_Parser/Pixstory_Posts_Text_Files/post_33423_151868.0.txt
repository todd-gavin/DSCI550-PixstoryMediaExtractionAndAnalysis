Stephenson was the first to effectively document his findings at the site of Bakhra, as it was then known, and his note was published in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in March, 1835. It was aptly titled as “Excursion to the Ruins and Site of an Ancient City near Bakhra, 13 cos north of Patna, and six north from Singhea”; this was read to the Asiatic Society on the 14th January, 1835.
When Stephenson (1835) visited the site, he discovered an interesting ancient tradition regarding the pillar being believed as the walking stick of “Bhim Sinh”, perhaps referring to the ancient legendary Pandava Bhim. Stephenson calculated the dimensions of the pillar and remarked that the sculpture was better than the Egyptian, and that the general appearance was striking and good. He noticed that the names of several Europeans who had visited from time to time were scribbled upon the pillar. The natives called the pillar as “Bhim Sinh ka Lattea, Lath or Gada; literally, Bhim Sinh’s walking stick.” He quoted a contemporary tradition that mentioned the existence of one “Bhim Sinh the great”, about two thousand years ago, who had used the pillar as his walking stick by which he supported himself when carrying a large tree on his shoulder as a bhangi, laden with two hills. The bhangi however broke with the weight near to the spot where the pillar stood, and the two hills or mounds were there left by Bhim Sinh, and remained to the present day, and could be seen near the pillar.
