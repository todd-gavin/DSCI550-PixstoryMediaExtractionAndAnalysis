The Kashmir Valley's shortest and easiest alpine lake trip is this one. starting the walk from Pahalgam, a well-known mountain resort. 80 kilometres separate Pahalgam from Srinagar City. From Pahalgam, it will take up to an hour to get to the trailhead for this short hike. The path from Chandan Wadi follows the snow-fed river water stream parallel until turning left. beginning the ascent via a rocky, pass-over passage in the cement. Compared to what we left behind, the terrain beyond the pass is brown and completely different. Amarnath Cave can be reached using the same trail that leads to Sheshnag. 
The same trail also goes to "Warwan," also known as Wadwan, one of the most remote treks in the Kashmir valley.
