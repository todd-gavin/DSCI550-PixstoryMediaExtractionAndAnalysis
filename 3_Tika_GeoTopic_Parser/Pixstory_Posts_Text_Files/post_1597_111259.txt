Monty McNair continues to impress Within hours of announcing they were not extending a qualifying to Donte DiVincenzo the Kings signed Malik Monk to a two year million contract Now the DiVincenzo situation makes sense The most important needs the Kings had to address this off season were the lack of shooting and the SG position and Monk gives them both Monk is an athletic wing who can score in bunches and should make the Kings much more exciting and dynamic offensively Monk also helps with chemistry since he and Fox shared the back court at Kentucky in and clearly enjoyed running and gunning together Don t get me wrong Monk isn t the whole package He doesn t help things defensively but his signing leaves second year defensive wizard Davion Mitchell a clear role If Monk were the whole package he would ve commanded much more than his dollars a year contract Now this gives the Kings a nice headed monster in the back court that should balance things out nicely Interestingly Monk is very similar to Jaden Ivey in both size athleticism and weakness both aren t great defenders but Monk doesn t need the ball in his hands to thrive and has already proven to mesh well with Fox which was the main concern with Ivey The Kings are in a tough position to add good pieces with the limited assets they have but they definitely got this one right Grade B Where to go from here SF would be the clear position to upgrade since Barnes is an expiring contract but you won t find a better SF on the market without trading away pieces we shouldn t trade and Barnes now really helps balance things with his experience Most of the top eight rotational players are now below with only Sabonis Barnes and Holmes having more than five years of NBA experience My motto for McNair has been in Monte I trust until proven otherwise Thankfully he still hasn t proven me wrong notwithstanding causing a brief scare by not extending Donte DiVincenzo a qualifying offer
