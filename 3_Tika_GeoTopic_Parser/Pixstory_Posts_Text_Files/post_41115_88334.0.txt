Racism is not a thing of past and very much present today too. The inherent racism is prevalent not just in common folks but in people who are supposed to be our advocates for justice, people in power.

While speaking to a throng assembled in Washington, D.C., a member of the "People's Convoy" declared he was going to tar and feather Black Lives Matter Plaza. 

The Hill reported that the People's Convoy was inspired by the "Freedom Convoy" movement of Canadian truckers. The activists gathered in the nation's capital to protest vaccine requirements and other COVID-19 guidelines in the US. 

A speaker on a podium with a sign for "Freedom Convoy 2022" instructs a crowd to "take back" a street adorned with the slogan "Black Lives Matter," which spans for two blocks on 16th Street NW in D.C., in a video taken by The Daily Beast.

According to The Daily Beast, the speaker is unknown, but "People's Convoy" organiser Mike Landis handed him the microphone. 
The organisers of the People's Convoy have been contacted by The Hill for comment by no response was received.

The Metropolitan Police Department and the District of Columbia Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency told The Daily Beast that they had the resources and support they needed to monitor and respond to any criminal conduct. 
The street earned national notice and was praised by John Lewis, the late civil rights legend.
