I disagree with this whole point of tough love and it s just a myth Loving someone always comes with a positive image whether it s about loving your child or anyone else There is no such thing as tough love no matter how correctly anyone uses this mechanism it would always inflict the person The coldness and impertinent behaviour would psychologically impact both children and adults it will not improve the situation but aggravate it What better could be done through positive teaching and behaviour that can never be achieved through tough love as the person experiencing it would never understand your intent The sternness and rude behaviour would be analysed and comprehended as what it would look like to the person you re doing it to the concealed kindness behind the act will never make people feel better and improve Instead they would dislike anyone who has been rude to them Moreover it is a well researched fact that most people who choose to act tough with their children tend to break their bond with them So it is doubtful that tough love could bring a positive change
