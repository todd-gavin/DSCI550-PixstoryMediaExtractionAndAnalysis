Suppose you're walking through the corridor of your school and this big, muscly, physically stronger person just casually punches you. Next day, it happens again. And again. And again. Soon after, you start to develop a dislike towards that person.

They hate you. You hate them. You're both the same. Or, are you? That's it. That's the difference between misogyny and misandry.
