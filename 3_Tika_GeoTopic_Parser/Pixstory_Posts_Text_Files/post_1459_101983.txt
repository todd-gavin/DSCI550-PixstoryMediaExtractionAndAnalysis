Today a Kerala court convicted former Govt officer Kiran Kumar in the death of his wife Vismaya He was booked under IPC A subjecting a woman to cruelty for dowry and B dowry death It s not an unusual case Such deaths happen everywhere yes even in Kerala which is famed for being more progressive than other places But the one detail that struck me was how Vismaya told her mother that she would not leave her husband even after he assaulted her because she was worried about what people would say if they knew her marriage was in shambles Her death could have been prevented if only she had been able to feel that she was worthy in her own right that she was more than a wife that she would be able to leave her abusive husband and find her own happiness
