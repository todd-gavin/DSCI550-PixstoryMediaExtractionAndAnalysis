The Euro 2024 Qualifying Group Stage draw has brought back all the football fans buzzing together. European football fans are on their toes for the tournament that is set to happen next year. All the groups have both heavyweights and new joiners to international football. In this article, we shall look at Group C of the Euro 2024 Qualifying draw. 
Group C consists of the Euro 2020 (held in 2021) finalists, the country that failed to qualify for the FIFA World Cup 2022, the upsetters of Euro 2020, the war-torn nation and Malta. Amongst these teams, two find themselves in the zone of automatic qualification whereas the rest will fight out for the playoff spots.
Talking about the teams, though England were relegated to Group B of the UEFA Nations League, the presence of talent and experience would make them contenders for the top spot in the group. The golden generation of English football will aim to not only get the direct qualification for the tournament but also lift the title in 2024. 
Italy endured a tough time after failing to qualify for the FIFA World Cup 2022 Qatar. They faltered on the final step. The Azzuris would want to rectify the mistake and qualify through the group stage for Euro 2024 cometh 2023. 
Amongst the rest of the nations participating in the tournament, Ukraine are struggling to keep their land as the war is going on. Though their fight is applauded, it would have negative effects on football performance. We predict them to finish third/fourth in the group stage. North Macedonia performed well during the Euro 2020 and will hope to capitalize on the momentum that they gained through the tournament. Malta will look to avoid the wooden spoon and will start the campaign as minnows. 
Predicted Group Stage Finish:
#1) England
#2) Italy
#3) Ukraine
#4) North Macedonia
#5) Malta
