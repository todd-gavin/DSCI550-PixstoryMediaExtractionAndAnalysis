Found these quotes filling up the social media and they clearly say a lot about women and abortion rights. Best part is they aren't even inappropriate.


*No matter what men think, abortion is a fact of life. Women have always had them; they always have and they always will. Are they going to have good ones or bad ones? Will the good ones be reserved for the rich, while the poor women go to quacks?


*The "right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" begins with "life", and "life" begins at conception.

*Governments who manipulate population growth have two choices: making maternity pleasant, or making it inescapable.

*Those who turn superstition into law are no judge but a bunch of dumbbells.

*The lie that abortion is murder is right-wing propaganda designed to demonize Democrats. Abortion is legal all over the world because a fetus without a cerebral cortex cannot think or feel before the 27th week. According to the CDC almost all abortions happen before the 13th week.
