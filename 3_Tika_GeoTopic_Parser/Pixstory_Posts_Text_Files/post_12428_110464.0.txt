Mental health includes our emotional,
psychological, and social well-being. It affects how We think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Mental
health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.

Maintaining a positive mental health and treating any mental health conditions is crucial to stabilizing constructive behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. Focusing on mental health care can increase productivity, enhance
our self-image, and improve relationships.

Nurturing mental health doesn't just improve our daily functioning, but it can also help us control - or at least combat - some of the physical health problems directly
linked to mental health conditions. For example, heart disease and stress are related, so managing stress might have a positive outcome on heart disease.

Other benefits of taking care of our mental health can include:

• Improving our mood
• Reducing our anxiety
• Creating an enhanced sense of inner peace
• Thinking more clearly
• Improving our relationships
• Increasing our self-esteem

Our mental health is something that impacts our eating and sleeping habits and has a lot to do with our physical health as well. It is important to address our mental health
needs, or oftentimes we will feel the impact of it in other areas of our health as well.
