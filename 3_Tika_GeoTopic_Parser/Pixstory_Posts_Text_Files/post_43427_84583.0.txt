We’re living in the 21st century, where men and women are not expected to play a specific role. Men work outside if they want to, women work if they want to. Men work in the kitchen if they want to and vice versa. 
I remember growing up we used to watch the commercials on TV featuring idealized gender stereotypes where men wear suits heading off to work and women stay home fulfilling their role as housewife and mother. Our society has progressed a lot and all the stereotypes and sexism is left behind right? 
Not quite. 
What do I mean by the bad representation of women and why do I think it is a huge problem: 
How many of us have came across advertisements where the father is packing lunch for the kids or changing the diaper ? None. It’s always the mothers and wives in the dish soap , tea products, toasters ,detergent ,mixers, refrigerators ,diapers advertisements and the list goes on. In contrast outdoor products like cars are dominated by men. 
Similarly beauty products ads , hair oil ads and fitness products ads have set certain beauty standards for women and made them insecure about their own skin and body. And the advertisements where women feature with men are the ones where they're chasing a man with strong deodrant and being strongly objectified by them. 
Advertisements are not just for telling us about the product it also reinforce subtle messages that influence how we think. 
There are many progressive brands which have tried to break the stereotype by showing the men help women in the household chores or in the kitchen , but in my opinion they’re just being glorified for doing the bare minimum. 
It’s 2022 people need to realise that women are more than just mothers, sisters or wives , Rather than being fixated on marriage and children, the four greatest aspirations women have are to feel comfortable in their own skin, to be financially independent, to be able to make their own decisions in the life and the travel the world and much more.
