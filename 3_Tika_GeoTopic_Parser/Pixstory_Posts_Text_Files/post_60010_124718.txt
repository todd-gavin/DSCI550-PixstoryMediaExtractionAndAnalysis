Nirmala Sitharaman the union minister of finance called for a discussion on freebies on Thursday in response to Arvind Kejriwal the head of the Aam Aadmi Party AAP who claimed that the Modi led federal government exclusively gives freebies to its coperate world Education and healthcare have never been referred to as freebies No Indian administration has ever objected to them By defining health and education as freebies Kerjiwal is attempting to instil anxiety and fear in the minds of the poor There should be a sincere discussion of this issue She spoke The discussion over freebies is being given a perverse twist by Kejriwal she continued Arvind Kejriwal is purposefully presenting the argument in a flawed way Nobody disputes the logic of providing poor people with free benefits However it is incorrect to categorise the loan write offs as freebies or to claim that the corporate tax rate reduction was implemented to benefit corporations According to a formal document In fact it s possible that the government is the first to offer free food in addition to the heavily subsidised food provided under the NFSA By the end of September the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana which has been in operation for years will have provided kg of free food to crore people each month It read The Opposition according to the Centre does not seem to have a plan for long term remedial measures such as increasing employment income or business accessibility Instead the emphasis is solely on securing victories in elections and maintaining power by making generous promises Kejriwal called for a referendum on whether taxpayer funds should go toward ensuring that people have access to quality healthcare education and other services or whether they should be used to support one s family and friends After PM Modi claimed in Panipat that freebies hinder India s efforts to become self sufficient and also burden taxpayers the AAP chief made the demand Kejriwal claimed that climate is being created in the nation to give the impression that the country will suffer losses if the governments provide free services to the populace in a covert attack on the BJP leadership
