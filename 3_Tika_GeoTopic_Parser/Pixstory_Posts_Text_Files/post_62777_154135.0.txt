"When stupidity is considered patriotism, it is unsafe to be intelligent."
"There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge."
One of the most prolific writers in history was Isaac Asimov. Nearly the course of his life, he published over 500 books, 1,600 essays, and around 90,000 letters.
The best thing about Asimov, in my opinion, was his ability to present issues and arguments in wholly unanticipated contexts, allowing readers to view them from a fresh perspective. Getting the other person to view the issue from a different perspective is one of the most challenging things to do in a philosophical debate, and Asimov was excellent at it.
Other than that, his views really spoke to me. Just like what I quoted. The way we look at patriotism is still pretty much the same. We tend to bend over backwards to defend political parties, military or the police. Our love for nation translates more to our love for praises and less to our love for our people. We neither criticize, nor can tolerate others criticizing the system that gives us a certain privilege over some other marginalized groups. New ideas seem funny to us. The youth is patronized for coming with apparently too radical ideas, instead of being understood.
It also makes me want to speak of another favorite author of mine, Rabindranath Tagore. His writings throw light on similar subjects.
