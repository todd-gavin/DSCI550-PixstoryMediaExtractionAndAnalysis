How do you its true love Here s a great rule from Oscar Wilde he says you don t love someone for their looks you don t love someone for their fancy clothes you don t love someone for their expensive car you love someone because they sing a song that only you can hear that s what love is Love isn t saying i made a value assessment of how much benefit you will bring to my life love isn t saying i am falling for you because you have all these exterior attributes that other people might find lovable love isn t about a fit love isn t about a ride love isn t even about looks Love is about saying you are my particular type of weird I used to have a type or I thought I did and now you define my type Love is a song that someone sings that only you can hear doesn t make sense to anybody else Oscar Wilde knew
