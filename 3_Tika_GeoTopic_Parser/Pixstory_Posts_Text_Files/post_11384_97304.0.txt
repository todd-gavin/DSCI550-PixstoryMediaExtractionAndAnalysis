The scorching heat have been taking its peak for quite sometime. Even though we know about the warnings on the climate we really can't get over it as by the end of the day it makes it so exhausting. 

Due to the rise of heat many animal species are migrating to new area and the interaction with other unfamiliar creatures are rising rapidly. 

This phenomenon affects all the living creatures and it could have dire consequences to people's health as well. A new study have raised a concern and these are associated with the raise of new virus illnesses like HIV, Covid 19 and it is believed that due to this the virus have been passed from the bats or pangolins to people. 

The researchers predicted that the contact with various species could rise and double within next 50 years, and this increases the risk that other viruses will jump from animal to animal and then later onto people. 

The viruses will spread to new animal species at least by 15,000 times by 2070 due to the migration that's caused by the climate change. 

"We are probably well into those changes. We are not keeping a close eye on them and they make pandemic risk everyone's problem," said lead researcher Colin Carlson, an assistant research professor with Georgetown University's Center for Global Health Science and Security in Washington, D.C. 

"Our study shows that unequivocally, in every simulation we do, climate change is creating innumerable hotspots of future and present-day zoonotic risk right in our backyard," Carlson continued.
