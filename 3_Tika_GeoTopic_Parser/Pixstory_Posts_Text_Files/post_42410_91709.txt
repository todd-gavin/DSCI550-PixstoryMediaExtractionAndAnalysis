 We are few against the many and this one dialogue of Lucian played by Matt Smith is the current situation of the people who liked the movie Morbius and there are many people who are bashing this movie unnecessarily But whatever is said and done the movie is not so perfect too Morbius is a movie about two best friends Micheal and Lucian aka Milo Both are suffering from a severe blood disease and because of that they have to intake artificial blood three times a day But one day their mentor Jared Harris found that Micheal is good in his studies and mentor helped Micheal to continue with his studies A few years later Micheal becomes a doctor at the age of on the other hand Lucian is still living with his mentor but their disease is still there and use crutches to walk As a doctor Micheal is experimenting to mix human DNA with the DNA of a bat because if the experiment works Micheal can cure his and Lucian s disease In a lab Micheal got a partner named Dr Martine Bancroft After the successful attempt on the mouse Micheal finally uses his experiment on himself but things go upside down and Micheal s weakness becomes his strength as a result he wants to drink the blood every six hours and not the artificial one because of this Micheal started killing people Conflict in the movie began when Lucian got to know about the experiment and now he also wants to become as strong as Micheal without worrying about the after result Will Micheal be able to stop Lucian or Lucian will kill Micheal What happened next If I tell you then it will be a spoiler for you guys The only thing that I didn t like about the movie is director made this movie half baked a few sequences should be longer which will help viewers to understand the movie a bit more I don t know why critics are hating this movie so much It s not the perfect movie but not that bad too
