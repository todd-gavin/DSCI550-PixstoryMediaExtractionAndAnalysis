Marie Kondo, a very famous Japanese author and health advisor had outlined a significant method for raising happiness levels and uplifting moods: 
The Konmari Method. 

She believes putting our living spaces in order can have tremendous impacts on productivity, lifestyle and perspectives.

It is an act of moving objects from one place to another, keeping only the important ones close to you. 

Ideology here in discarding and tidying home/work spaces , lies close to how our mindset works.

In spaces
When we discard unwanted objects
We have more space for things which are actually required.

In mindsets,
When we let go of things that hold us back/ or are unwanted , we have more space and time for things which actually spark happiness.

Therefore a verbally-similar parallel can be drawn between improving perspective and the Konmari method. 
No wonder how they also go hand-in-hand in reality! ðŸ’«

Hope this helpedðŸŒ»Have a nice day!
