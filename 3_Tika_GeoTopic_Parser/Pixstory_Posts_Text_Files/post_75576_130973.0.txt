One moment stood out from Oleksandr Zinchenko's performance on Saturday. Arsenal had been caught out on the break, with a Bournemouth attacker isolated with Zinchenko in a 1v1 situation. The Ukrainian isn't notably quick, nor is he massively strong. However, he is remarkably calm and he used that to diffuse the potentially dangerous situation. 

Rather than diving in and risking a red card, the defender simply waited for the attacker's touch to let him down, and it did. Stepping in once that opportunity had arisen, Zinchenko took the ball cleanly. He didn't wait around after that either, immediately attempting to set Gabriel Martinelli away with a long pass.

Mikel Arteta's Arsenal system is built on positional flexibility. When the club moved for Zinchenko, the player's experience in both midfield and left-back was undoubtedly key. 

Throughout the game, the left-back can be seen in different positions. Sometimes in his starting position of left-back, to defend and sometimes start build-up. Other times, he can be found in the left-wing position, overlapping Martinelli and whipping crosses into the box.

However, the most effective space Zinchenko can be found in, is not on the left at all. It's in the middle of the park, alongside Thomas Partey. Zinchenko is a natural midfielder, and he looks truly at home when in those spaces.

He is incredibly press-resistant, a brilliant passer of the ball and an extremely intelligent footballer. 

Gabriel Jesus has rightly been lauded as a big difference maker for this Arsenal team, but the man he arrived with from Manchester City has had just as much of an impact. The assets the Ukrainian brings have given Arsenal technical ability and security in the centre of the pitch, in bucket-loads.

Zinchenko is a natural leader and a phenomenal player. He is the epitome of an 'Arteta player', in technical ability and character. It's early days in Zinchenko's Arsenal career, but the signs are very good.
