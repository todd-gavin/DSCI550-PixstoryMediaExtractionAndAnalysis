Words have energy and power with the ability to help, to heal, to hinder, to hurt, to harm, to humiliate and to humble.We can choose to use this force constructively with words of encouragement, or destructively use words of despair.It is our words that provide a bold affirmation of our innermost thoughts. They are a confirmation to the world of how we see others, our lives and ourselves. It is actually our words which enables our thoughts to manifest into a reality.But many a times we hear people say “you weren’t hurt physically, they are mere words.” The point is that despite many discoveries and inventions in science and in medicine, we have nothing that can measure the amount of pain a person suffers caused by someone’s inappropriate language.

A Japanese scientist and water researcher Dr Masaru Emoto has revealed that thoughts and vibrations affect the molecular structure of water.After studying water for many years through high speed photography of water crystals and by the use of MRA, a vibration measuring device to record emotional vibrations in humans, Dr Emoto observed that water reacts to the sound vibrations.The water crystals formed beautiful geometric shapes when words of love and gratitude were spoken near the water. But when evil words were uttered near another sample of water taken from the same source the crystals smashed, and turned into destructed shapes. 
The research of Dr Emoto showed that water has memory and effects on things, for instance plants, trees and above all humans.It can have a strong impact on human consciousness, since a human body contains 70% water. So the words we hear have impressions on our heart and mind because the water inside reacts accordingly. Dr Emoto’s research provides enough evidence that the person complaining of someone’s bad attitude is hurt and is reacting for a reason.

It’s important to know how we can make someone’s day or ruin it with mere use of words, at times without even realizing it.These experiments concluded that the energy projected onto something can actually change the physical structure of an object, whether it be positive or negative
