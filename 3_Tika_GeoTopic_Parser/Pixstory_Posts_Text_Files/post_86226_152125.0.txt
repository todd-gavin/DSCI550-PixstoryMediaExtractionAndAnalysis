The subtle art of being unapologetically yourself 
“You can't make people be or do what you want. All you can do is be unapologetic about what you want and let others show up however they can.”
-Gabrielle Bernstein 

In this harsh world that dictates the lifestyle of people while judging their life choices, it requires a lot of courage to put on a brave front and be unapologetic yourself than appease the crowd because you have the right the view the world from your lens. Embrace the unique person you have become fearlessly and unapologetically. That is where true self-love starts.
