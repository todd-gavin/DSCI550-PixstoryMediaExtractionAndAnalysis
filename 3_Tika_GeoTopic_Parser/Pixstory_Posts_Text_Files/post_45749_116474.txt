After dazzling the world with the first images from the powerful James Webb Space Telescope this week NASA released even more photos from the observatory yesterday this time pictures from within our own Solar System as the Verge reported The space agency revealed the telescope s images of the planet Jupiter as well as an asteroid used as reference targets when engineering teams were calibrating the observatory s instruments The pictures serve as a small teaser of the images we should be getting from our Solar System in the months and years to come The James Webb Space Telescope or JWST may be known for its ability to peer into some of the deepest recesses of the Universe but scientists will also be using the telescope to study our own cosmic neighborhood in greater detail Because these images of Jupiter were used as guides for JWST engineers they aren t as sparkly as the highly processed full color photos that NASA released this week of distant nebulas and galaxies But the pictures do show the kind of precision we can expect from JWST s images of the outer Solar System Jupiter s iconic storm feature the Great Red Spot can be clearly seen in the photos as well as the planet s icy moon Europa And Jupiter s thin rings which often go overlooked in images of the gas giant make a very faint appearance
