Atletico Madrid vs Celta Vigo Match Prediction

Atletico Madrid have had a decent start to their La Liga 2022/23 season so far. They haveplayed 4 games till now, lost 1, won 2 and drawn 1. Celta Vigo currently have the same pointsas Atletico (7) and are right behind them on the points table. Celta have proven to be one of thetop 6 worthy teams in La Liga in the last few seasons and it is definitely difficult to get 3 pointsagainst them.

It will definitely be a tough and open match but we predict that Atletico Madrid will win the bout. The way in which they defeated Porto in a thrilling encounter in the UCL a couple of days agogives us hope that Diego Simeone's men are indeed back in track and thus they will give it theirall to get those three points against Celta Vigo.
