Do you want to save the planet? Or want to work towards decreasing carbon footprints?

But! If you are not able to go outside, then I have something for you through which you can contribute towards the environment by just sitting in your comfy place.

Do you know by deleting your unnecessary emails that are no longer in your use, you can reduce carbon footprints generated by it? 

According to The Good Planet, nearly 107 billion spam emails were sent and received a day in 2019. If every person only deleted 10 of those emails, they could save 1,725,00 gigabytes of storage space and around 55.2 million kilowatts of power. 

So, from today, we will try to implement it to save our beloved planet.🌱🌍
