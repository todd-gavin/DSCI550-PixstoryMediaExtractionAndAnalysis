Some say Australia vs England is the greatest cricket rivalry but most know the truth that India vs Pakistan is the greatest cricket rivalry of all time. The passion with which both these countries play their cricket is incomparable to others.
India faces Pakistan on 23rd October 2022. This time Team India will try its best to undo what happened in the last T20 world cup.
However it is our responsibility as the fans of this beautiful game to support our heroes regardless of the result. 
May Team India make us all proud at the highest level.
