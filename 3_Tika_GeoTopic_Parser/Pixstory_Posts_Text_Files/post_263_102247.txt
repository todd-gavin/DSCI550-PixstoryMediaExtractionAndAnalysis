Oxford s Bridge of Sighs lives up to its namesake fragile glass tiled windows demand a quaint quietness from cobbled stoned footsteps passing under the contrasting stark red underbelly of an arch connecting Old and New Quadrangles of Hertford College My voice drops to a whisper that blurs into itself like the fuzzy facts attempting to pick apart the myths that ve nestled into the brick gaps in the walls hugging the Bridge of Sighs As the story goes many decades ago a health survey was performed on Oxford University students Hertford College students were said to be heavier than any of the other students So in response the university imposed restrictions on them The bridge was closed off forcing Hertford College students to take the stairs for more exercise thus losing weight However this historic tale of discrimination is untrue a website called Oxford Royale states The bridge is always open and requires students to use more stairs than if they didn t use the bridge at all Discover Oxfordshire chips in Moreover the repeatedly retold tale of Hetford s Bridge inheriting its name from Venice s Bridge of Sighs is highly disregarded Oxford s legend of the Bridge of Sighs is far less romanticised but it is a quirky and interesting urban legend with a character of its own Oxford Royale exclaims In my attempts to research I find out more about what the Bridge of Sighs isn t wasn t and was never meant to be rather than learning about what it is But I do take this from it If I keep leading with who I m not I ll never get the time to state who I am
