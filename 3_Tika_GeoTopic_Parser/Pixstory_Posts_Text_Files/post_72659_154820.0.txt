Bharti Airtel, India's leading telecom provider, launched Airtel 5G Plus services in a phased manner in eight Indian cities. Airtel customers in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Siliguri, Nagpur and Varanasi can now start enjoying the ultra fast Airtel 5G Plus services as Airtel continues to complete the roll-out across the country. Customers with existing 5G phones in these cities can expect up to 30 times faster speed with Airtel 5G Plus service, available on their existing 4G data plan until the roll-out is more widespread. Users in other parts of urban India can also expect to be a part of Airtel's 5G network by March 2023, making this one of the fastest rollouts.
Airtel 5G Plus is a next-generation mobile service with several customer advantages. Apart from offering up to 30 times higher speed than the current 4G networks, Airtel 5G Plus service runs on technology with the widest worldwide acceptance. It means anybody with a 5G-enabled phone can use the service on their existing Airtel SIM, making the switch hassle-free.
The telecom leader also uses a highly well developed ecosystem to enable the service, ensuring customers have the best possible mobile experience. In simple terms, think lag-free gaming, high-definition video streaming, instant content/ files uploading and downloading, and much more!
