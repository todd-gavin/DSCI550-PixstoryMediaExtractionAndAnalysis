In a country where inequality is such a problem the idea of the NEET makes sense on its face The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test NEET is an all India entrance test for medical school aspirants It replaced various private exams held by medical colleges and one of the strongest arguments in its favour is that it created a more level playing field Why not have a single standardized exam Well here s the issue with the NEET the Justice A K Rajan committee appointed by the state government of Tamil Nadu found that the NEET tends to give an advantage to students from privileged backgrounds It also observed that NEET in terms of orientation is biased towards the Central Board of Secondary Education CBSE Why is this so Because the NEET is largely a matter of who can afford the best private coaching who went to English medium schools the students who went to Tamil medium schools or whose parents could not afford special coaching tend not to do well on the exam This issue has also caused a rash of suicides from students who could not pass the NEET which is a colossal tragedy Therefore it makes more sense from the egalitarian perspective to go by Class XII marks when deciding to give admission to medical school But tell the BJP that the only Tamil Nadu party that supports NEET
