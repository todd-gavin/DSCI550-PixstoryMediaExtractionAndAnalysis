Russian invasion into Ukraine got retaliated by NATO nations with a barrage of economic sanctions against the country, including a ban on some Russian banks from SWIFT global payment system, freezing assets of some oligarchs close to the Kremlin and even holding the Russian Central Bank’s foreign currency reserves hostage. Putin warned Russian business tycoons of worse sanctions and asked them to work “in solidarity” with the country’s government. 

The sanctions had their obvious impact: Russia's stock markets and currency plunged. Some Russian companies were struck, but it seems they had already made some preparation early, fully aware of the invasion. Many of the close business associates of Putin converted their assets into crypto currency or stashed elsewhere in advance, keeping in mind earlier sanctions by the West during Putin’s Crimea attack in 2014. 

But many European and American companies that expanded their business in Russia, including their tie-ups with many companies in the country, are already experiencing a boomerang effect of the sanctions. Except for some multinationals, like Germany-based Deutsche Bank that minimised dealings in Russia after Putin’s Crimea operation, many foreign companies went on an overdrive with their Russian business operations in the last few years. 

The EU happens to be Russia’s biggest business partner that imports over 50% of its natural gas and oil from the country. The bloc accounts for 37% of Russia’s global trade. Many European energy companies – such as British BP, German BASF, French Total and American ExxonMobil — have deep ties with Russian companies, including some state-backed firms of the country. Apart from these, automobile industry companies like Renault (France), Volkswagen (Germany) and Pirelli (Italy) also have a strong presence in the Russian market.  

Cutting off Russia from the SWIFT payment system has already affected European creditors receiving money they owe to their Russian sources. Further sanctions will hit Russians, but the blowback will be quite severe to companies in NATO countries looking for an economic recovery after COVID lockdowns.
