Serie A giants Juventus are yet to make an attempt regarding a new contract approach for defender Danilo.
The versatile player arrived at Juve from Manchester City in a swap deal involving Portuguese star Joao Cancelo, who has been mighty impressive at the Etihad. While Danilo’s impact hasn’t been as much as that of Cancelo, he has still done well.
Corriere Torino (via TMW) have reported today about the situation of Danilo, stating that he is considered to be one of the most important players in the squad. And an extension for him is a very appealing idea for the club.
Contacts with the entourage are frequent and while the last meeting dates back to last week, no progress has been made. The acceleration is postponed, with the Bianconeri’s priorities seemingly directed elsewhere right now.
