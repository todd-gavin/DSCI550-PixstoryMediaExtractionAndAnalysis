Juventus suffered a tragic defeat against Maccabi Haifa in their 4th match of the UEFA Champions League 2022/23 and with this, their hopes of qualifying in the knockout stages are practically gone. The Israeli Premier League team from the city of Haifa was surprisingly phenomenal and they were clearly the better side tonight. It was a much-deserved win for them. 
As early as in the 4th minute, Maccabi Haifa had their first solid chance of scoring as left-back Pierre Cornud’s perfect cross into the box found Frantzdy Pierrot who headed the ball directly into Juventus goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny’s hands. Fortunately for Juve, the Polish International was able to save the header. 
Moments later, however, Maccabi scored from a replica of the first attack. It was again Cornud’s cross but this time, Omer Atzili did no mistake in putting it into the back of the net right at the 6 minutes mark. 
A couple of minutes later, Tjaronn Chery’s free-kick hit the crossbar as Juventus proved to be lucky again. Had it not been for their luck, the Serie A side could have been subjected to an even more humiliating defeat. For instance, in the 28-minute mark, the referee turned down a clear handball appeal of the Maccabi Haifa players. 
Omer Atzili was undoubtedly the most dangerous Maccabi Haifa man inside Juventus’ half. He got came close to scoring a lot of times and he did end up scoring twice. His second goal at the 42-minute mark was particularly exquisite - What a Finish!
Juventus never really found their way back into the game. Although they had more possession and were a lot better in the second half, they could not find the back of the net. They attempted 10 shots and had 5 shots on target. 
With this loss, Juventus’ chances of qualifying for the knockouts of the Champions League are practically gone. However, it might also so happen that they finish at the bottom of the group table and are unable to qualify for the Europa League even.
