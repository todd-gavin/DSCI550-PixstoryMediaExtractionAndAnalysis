Barcelona had a forgettable outing last season as they went trophyless without giving a firmfight. They finished second in the La Liga, 13 points behind their arch-rivals Real Madrid.Walking in with hopes of success in the Europa League, Barca put their sword in thequarter-final against the Eintracht Frankfurt at the Camp Nou.

Even in the Copa del Rey, Xavi's side forced the game into extra-time before Iker Muniain ofAthletic Club put his team in front from the spot in the 105th minute at San Mames,eventually winning the game.

It looked like the Catalan club, which have been struggling through a financial crisis, wouldremain behind for some years now. However, that was not the case as they activelyparticipated in the transfer window and made some awestruck signings to boost theirresources.

The Blaugrana, who were relying more on free agents to fulfil their needs, didn't shy awayfrom breaking the bank after activating financial levers. Indeed, they now have a large squadwith excellent individual qualities and the hunger to win titles.

Hereâ€™s a look at three reasons why Barcelona can step up and clinch the La Liga title thisseason:

#1) Incredible squad depth

Barcelona have always had the facility to pick players from a pool of world-class talents. Thisseason they have upgraded the quality of players from last season. They now have at leasttwo world-class players in every position, indicating their incredible depth in the squad.

Last season they had to suffer when some vital names were either injured or had to miss outdue to suspension. This time, however, they have got quality back-ups ready to go in andperform at the top-notch level without degrading the level of play.
