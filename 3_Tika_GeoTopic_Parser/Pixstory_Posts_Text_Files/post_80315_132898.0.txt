Lucas Paqueta - A Statement Signing

Brazilian sensational & versatile Lyon attacker Lucas Paqueta looks set to trade France for London by moving to West Ham.

Previously linked with Arsenal, Spurs & Newcastle, but it is West Ham who look to seal his signature. 

Lucas Paqueta is a very versatile midfielder, who’s just come off the back of a sensational season for Lyon.

The Brazilian started his career at Flamengo, through the academy & 3 early in his senior career, before joining Milan in 2019.

After struggling to find form in the Italian city, Lucas moved to Lyon.

Paqueta is unanimously known for his ball striking, versatility, flair, ability to glide past players, a great creator & forward thinking player with 4.91 progressive passes (fbref), with 15 goal contributions in 33 games last season at an underperforming Lyon.

Versatility is undoubtedly one of his most useful attributes. In the Nkunku mould, Paqueta has been operated as a false 9, a 9, as a right winger, as a left midfielder and as an 8/10.

Paqueta is most commonly an 8, starting this season there for Lyon & the back end of last season, so in West Ham’s 4231 you’d anticipate Paqueta would fulfil the 10 role - where he played for Lyon in instances when they were in the same setup at West Ham. 

Paqueta provides a lot of flexibility for the Irons presuming this move happens. With Soucek struggling & West Ham struggling for goals, there is the potential West Ham could be more expansive & go for a 433 type - with Rice as the 6, Fornals & Paqueta ahead, or alternatively a very aggressive pivot with Paqueta alongside Rice against lesser teams - with Paqueta’s workrate and defensive contributions for an offensive player very noticeable, with 2.77 tackles per 90 & 23.10 pressures, ranking 95 & 99 on fbref. 

A very ambitious move, a top quality player who’ll just add more quality to a star studded league. A great acquisition for the Irons, in areas which were desperate.
