The rains always induce a sense of nostalgia. If you are driving down the gorgeous green Mumbai-Pune Expressway this weekend, make the most of your visit to the city by stopping at these culinary gems that dish out delicious food wrapped in warm memories. If you grew up in Pune or travelled to the city often in the 90s, these eateries are sure to give you a kick of nostalgia.

German Bakery
The bakery opened in 1983 with the idea of serving Osho Ashramites. As there were very few places serving Continental food then, the cafe shot to fame for its bakery products and breakfast spread. Pune was largely known for its colleges, universities and educational institutions then, and although cafe culture hadn't really come to India in those days, German Bakery became a cool hit among students and tourists. In 2010, a terrorist bomb exploded at the bakery, killing 17 and wounding scores of others as the place was packed with students. The team at the bakery recovered from this unfortunate event and their loyal patrons came thronging back when they reopened.

Prems
If you feel like a fun binge with friends over pints of beer, the happy vibe at one of the city's most popular restaurants may just be what you need. Over the years, Prem's has witnessed a lot of first dates and first outings with friends. While the restaurant officially opened in 1986, it was whipping up delicacies before that, too. "The Sharma family came from South Africa and started selling basic parathas, sandwiches, tea and coffee to all those who came to the Osho Ashram, which was in full swing at the time as Osho had just returned from the US. There was only German Bakery and Prem's in Koregaon Park then, and a handful of other places like Chinese Room in Camp and ABC Farms," Sandy Singh of Iceberg Hospitality, that now owns and runs Prem's, tells us.
