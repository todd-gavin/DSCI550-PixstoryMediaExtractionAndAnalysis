Nehru Park has no monuments but it makes it here purely for nostalgic reasons. Decades back it used to be our Sunday outing sometimes and we always seemed to get ice-creams at the end.

It reminds me of a sleeping dinosaur with the spine running in the center and the rest of the park falling on either side and the various folds holding the slopes of rolling green with these rocky outcrops here and there.

Set in the heart of the diplomatic enclave it is often the venue for some amazing cultural performances and mean gastronomical festivals. So, it’s good for either, eating your heart out or burning it off on the undulating slopes!

This by no means is an exhaustive list. There is the Mughal Garden within the Rashtrapati Bhavan premises which is open to the public in February.

The Buddha Jayanti Park on The Ridge, an extension of the Aravallis which are beyond historical themselves. 

Likewise, there are many swatches of green embellished with pieces of history in Delhi waiting for us to put that coffee thermos in the rucksack, get those walking shoes on and spend a languid few hours in the sun exploring them.

Concluded……………
