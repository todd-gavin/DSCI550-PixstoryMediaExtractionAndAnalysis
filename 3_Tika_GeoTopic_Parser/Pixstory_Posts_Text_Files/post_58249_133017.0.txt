Anime openings are very integral part of a series. Fans love a good opening while they skip one if they don't like it. It creates a hype for the series and sets the mood for the story . Fans remember often rank the series's  opening and closing themes. 
Again by Yui , the season 1 opening of the anime fullmetal Alchemist brotherhood is one of my favourites. It always manages to give me  goosebumps. It has  catchy, fast paced  beats which set a tone for a mysterious yet thrilling atmosphere. It  brings out the the theme of the series really well.
