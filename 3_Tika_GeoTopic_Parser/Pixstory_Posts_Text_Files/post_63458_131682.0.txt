Wolverhampton Wanderers winger Pedro Neto has been said to be “really tempted” by a switch to Arsenal before the closure of the transfer window as Mikel Arteta is keen to strengthen his attacking options, per transfer football expert Fabrizio Romano.  

The Portuguese international has been linked with a potential £50million move to the Emirates this month and the exit of Nicolas Pepe suggests the likelihood of the acquisition of Neto. 

Mikel Arteta is keen on adding more depth to his side and he made this known during the post match conference after Arsenal’s win over Bournemouth in the weekend.“We have to add more firepower and we can do it,” said Mikel Arteta.

Speaking on his Here We Go Podcast show, Fabrizio Romano had this to say on Pedro Neto’s move to Arsenal. 

“Pedro Neto is the main target but it's not easy to negotiate because Wolves want more than £50million. Let's see after the outgoings what happens. Neto would be really tempted by Arsenal but I'm told the player is not forcing anything as of now but he'd be keen to go to Arsenal."

Neto would be a replacement for the outgoing Nicolas Pepe who is on the verge of completing a loan move to OGC Nice in the French Ligue 1.
