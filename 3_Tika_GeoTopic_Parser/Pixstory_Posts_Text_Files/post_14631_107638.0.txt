In 1955 the “father of marine microbiology,” Claude ZoBell, concluded that there was very little, if any, microbial life beneath the seabed. He based this assessment on the absence of bacterial growth in cultures from marine sediments deeper than about 10 meters. 

About a decade later, this notion was reinforced when the deep-sea research submarine Alvin broke free of its tethers and sank. Although the scientists in the sub were rescued, a sandwich was not. Ten months later, Alvin was recovered and the sandwich was still intact. “Aha!” said scientists, “the ocean depths are too extreme to support microbial life!”

Not surprisingly, this approach to studying deep-sea microbial ecology has not stood the test of time. The modern age of subsurface microbiology was launched in the mid-1980s, when the U.S. The Department of Energy drilled wells 200 m deep and a variety of microorganisms from subsurface aquifers were cultured. 

This was followed by a 1994 report of the growth of microorganisms from sediments collected 500 m below the seabed. In both cases, novel culture conditions were employed that more closely resembled the pressure, temperature, and redox potential of subsurface environments.

Nonetheless, it was hard to convince the scientific community that these microbes weren’t contaminants.
