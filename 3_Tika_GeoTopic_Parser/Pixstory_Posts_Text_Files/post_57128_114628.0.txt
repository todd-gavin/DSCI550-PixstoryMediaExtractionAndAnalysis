Amidst all the chaos of daily life, people tend to forget that their mind needs rest and a calming session.
Some of these ways can be used to calm oneself.

Besides all the exercises or meditation tricks, breathing always wins the race. Just asking someone to breathe when they're anxious could help them greatly, as breathing is the best technique for quickly reducing anger and anxiety.

Oftentimes people avoid acknowledging or accepting how they're feeling; this restricts their emotions from flowing. So letting yourself know how you're feeling and accepting it would allow the emotion to flow easily.

Have you ever noticed that sometimes you feel anxious or angry about things that don't make sense? It could be the most futile thing to worry about and in such cases challenging your thoughts is essential. So challenge and ask questions yourself if what you're feeling is rational? Is it likely to happen? Has this ever happened to me before?
No one can help you the best way than you, so consider supporting yourself by challenging your irrational thoughts.

See, physical activities would always help to allay emotional pains. And emotions like anger and anxieties are best released through physical activities.

Music has the capability to soothe you in the most challenging times.
So why not lend your ear to beautiful and peaceful music? It could be your best calming exercise.

Writing it down can be another way to throw it all out, something that is bothering you or has angered you.
