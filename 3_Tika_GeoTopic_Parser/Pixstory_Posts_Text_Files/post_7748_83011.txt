A raging debate among Cinema lovers is that a series is able to do more justice to the source material for e g series adapted from novels If we look recently the Reacher series which is adapted from the Jack Reacher novels even the author Lee Child has said that Alan Ritchson is a better representation of his character even though the Tom Cruise version was also success This is not only due to their physical appearance but it has more to do with how a character has more time to evolve and his her inner workings are revealed more intricately in a T V Series which can offer more time rather than a movie According to me even in the case of Hannibal this is the case if we look at the classic movies Silence od of the Lambs Hannibal and Red Dragon in which Hannibal Lecter is played by the legendary Sir Anthony Hopkins only the character of Hannibal and Clarice played by Jodie Foster shine in the limelight In the novels we see the characters Hannibal Lecter and Will Graham steal the show and its their eerie connection which makes it way through the workings of the novels this is very well portrayed in the T V Series Hannibal Even though it has a modern premise but this connection between the two characters played by Mads Mikkelsen and Hugh Dancy is what stole the show So for me the time that the characters from a novel or other source material get in a T V Series allows for a better evolution which in turn helps in the better portrayal of characters and hence the whole plot
