 Are there any hopes on the issue of gun control which lawmakers have failed to act on for more than a decade Sen Chris Murphy D CT a leading gun control advocate said I m hopeful there is growing momentum But I have failed plenty of times before Murphy said he is open to anything to curb this problem if it is around the red flag laws or universal background checks policies Republicans have expressed their willingness to consider Republicans unwillingness to support policies at the federal level has caused so much damage so we cannot fully trust them when they say they are ready for changes Democrats have been united on the subject Sens Joe Manchin D WV and Kyrsten Sinema D AZ both centrist lawmakers who ve renounced from the caucus on other issues have expressed support for gun control discussions However neither has implied a willingness to eliminate the filibuster which would facilitate Democrats to pass legislation with the members they have Sen Susan Collins R ME is among the Republicans who have said they re open to discussing a red flag law similar to the yellow flag law in her home state of Maine These policies enable law enforcement to seize firearms if someone is considered a threat to themselves or others the effectiveness of the law relies heavily on implementation Sen Pat Toomey R PA suggested that universal background checks could be an area to concentrate on since it has previously gotten Republican support In Toomey and Sen Joe Manchin D WV reached a bipartisan agreement that garnered the support of four Republicans including Collins and then Sens Mark Kirk and John McCain That bill however wasn t able to get votes and ultimately failed in the Senate In poll after poll universal background checks have been extremely popular Experts note that background checks are also central to other gun control proposals like requiring each firearm owner to have a gun license The two parties should stand together to curb this issue as citizens of America are living under constant threat Sources Vox
