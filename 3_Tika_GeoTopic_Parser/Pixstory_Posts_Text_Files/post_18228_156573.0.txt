Remembering the Oct. 18, 1922 opening night of the Egyptian Theatre, which played host to Douglas Fairbanks' 'Robin Hood' and ushered in the modern era of the studio premiere.
Exactly 100 years ago — on October 18, 1922 — Hollywood unrolled what has been cited as the inaugural modern movie premiere and red carpet proceeding. At the opening night of the Egyptian Theatre, heralding the silent film Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood, showman Sid Grauman set out to conjure movie magic before the reel ever started rolling.
The red carpet cut through the theater’s 150-by-45-foot forecourt. The Hollywood Daily Citizen gushed that “the flood-lights of filmdom turned the night into brilliance brighter than noonday.…” Vehicles stretched along the street. Onlookers lined the walkway. Camera bulbs flashed. And suddenly Tinseltown had a sparkly new tool in its arsenal of pageantry.
Around 2,000 people attended the Los Angeles premiere. Tickets sold out before noon on day one of sales. Arthur P. Huntingdon, real-life heir to Robin Hood's Earldom of Huntingdon was slated to be "guest of honor" at the premiere.
Inside the $800,000 theater, outfitted with $5,000 projection equipment, the pomp grew only more pompous. Fred Niblo (actor and director) presided over the ceremony. Local leaders such as George Cryer (Los Angeles mayor), George L. Eastman (Hollywood Chamber of Commerce president), and Jesse L. Lasky (producer) made remarks.   
The premiere of Robin Hood marked the joint debut of Grauman Cineplex and the Los Angeles Theater. Today, the red carpet has become a staple of entertainment promotion.
"This night is a most auspicious one for Los Angeles, but it is still more auspicious for Hollywood,” Eastman decreed. “It marks Hollywood’s advent from the status of a small town to a city of metropolitan importance, where world premieres are shown.” It marked, too, the advent of two intertwined traditions that endure 100 years later.
