Canadian police arrested scores of 'Freedom of Convoy' protest leaders and others on Friday, leading to many saying that the demonstration that lasted weeks may finally end. The police have also towed away many trucks that the protesters stationed. 

Although they may be dispersing, for now, many protesters say that they plan to regroup or join future anti-government demonstrations in greater strength to force the government to see their point. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/02/19/canada-freedom-convoy-protest/)

Sam Hersh, an Ottawa activist who helped to organize a cancelled counter-protest to the Freedom Convoy, said that the right-wing's show of strength has encouraged them and that similar protests could take place even if the police gain the upper hand and put to stop to the current gathering.

The protests started after a November decision by Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau that all truck drivers in the country and from America would need to by double vaccinated by January 15 when they are crossing Canada. Since many right-wing truckers were opposed to the mandate, they rebelled and decided to bring their protests to captain Ottawa and choke the city. 

The problem on the Canadian soil reached the U.S. when protesters blocked the Ambassador Bridge linking Windsor, Ontario, to Detroit for a fourth consecutive day Thursday, putting the supply chain on the line.

The Canadian government declared an emergency and authorized police personnel to take all steps to stop the protests from disrupting normal lives. A day after the Ambassador Bridge was reopened, Trudeau invoked emergency measures banning public assembly in places and also freezing the bank accounts of protestors "threaten national security."
