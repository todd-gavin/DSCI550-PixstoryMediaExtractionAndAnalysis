Well i know I'm lil bit late for this , But As we all know ! " It's Never too Late " .

So The month of Ramadan is here , and i known its about to end . The season of feasts and fasting 😋

Let me tell you my healthy food items that i added to my Ramadan celebrations :

✅ 🍌Bananas: Bananas are rich in potassium, which suppresses thirst and keeps you hydrated for a longer time. Banana is also a great source of fibre and is ideal to help ease your system after fasting. In short, having a banana is a great way to keep your food intake low and avoid binge eating during Ramadan.

✅ 🫘Dates: Fasting during the day can really shoot up your craving for carbs and sweets. Dates can serve as an ideal dessert. Dates are also loaded with energy, fibre, and iron. The natural sugars in dates give you a burst of energy . Do not over-eat dates.

✅ 🌰Dry fruits: Nuts are a rich source of healthy fats such as Omega 3 and 6 that make you feel full for a longer time. Dry Fruits have nutrients condensed in a tiny package that can be ideal for a fasting stomach. They are rich in fibre .

✅ 🫙Yogurt: Our body produces a lot of heat when we are fasting because of the acids created in an empty stomach. To neutralise that effect, yoghurt or curd can be consumed. These are also rich in probiotics and aid in digestion. You can make a nice dessert with yoghurt and fruits. 

Well jokes apart , I use all the Above mention in my Iftaar ! Bananas keep me Hydrated for whole day .  I love the taste of dates ! But i take only 2 . Dry fruits are everybody's fav i know . Yogurt keeps neutralize the effect of acid in my stomach . Also i make desert with Yogurt nand fruits .

Guys i know i used Wrong emoji with Dates , Dry fruits and Yogurt !😂
