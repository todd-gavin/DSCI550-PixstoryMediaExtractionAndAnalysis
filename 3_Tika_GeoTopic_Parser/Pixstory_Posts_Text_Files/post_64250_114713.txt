I tell myself every day that this is what I will do I make a mental list of the tasks that I need to complete Every night when the time s mine I tell myself that tomorrow is going to be better than today But it isn t I see people living their lives I see them achieving their goals I see love I see anger I see hate I see everything And then I see myself I see all these things in me Still I am the same I feel sublime emotions I have weird thoughts I say to myself that it s just a phase it will go away but it isn t just a phase I think that I will write about it but I never do I think that writing will make it easier for me to figure out what s really wrong or what is it that should be different in me People say writing helps you when no one s there just write everything on a piece of paper and you will be good But I never do I never write when I am unlike myself or when I feel a constant buzz in my head reminding me of the callous reality that I live in or that has grown into me Soon this surfeit of emotions goes away and there s a spark about me something that wasn t before I find myself doing things I find myself laughing enjoying with people I find myself appreciating things that were bothering me before My days are not the same even if I don t do anything I have seen and heard so much I thought that I would write about it turn it all into a verse but I didn t I tell myself that maybe if I write about all these things people will understand me know what s going inside my head but I never do I never talk about it I wonder how it would be if I let people see what I see I don t know how things would have turned out if these small voices would have shut down But when I ll know maybe I will write about it
