By creating rituals and schedules that prioritise healthy, good quality sleep, you cancombat feelings of anxiety.
Your sleep habits, environment and daily schedule all from sleep hygiene that make bedtime a more pleasurable experience, allowing your body and mind to optimally recover.
IF YOU CAN'T FALL ASLEEP 👁️👁️
• If you've been in bed for 20 mins but can't get to sleep, it's time to get out of bed! Do something relaxing with little low to light. Go back to bed after 30 minutes or so (or sooner if you start feeling sleepy)
