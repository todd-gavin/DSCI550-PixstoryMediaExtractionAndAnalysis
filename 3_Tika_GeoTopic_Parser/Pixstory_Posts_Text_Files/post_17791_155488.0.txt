Elizabeth Hurley and Brendan Fraser reunite at a special screening of The Whale at The Ham Yard Hotel on Monday (October 10) in London, England.
The 57-year-old actress and 53-year-old actor starred in the 2000 film Bedazzled together.
Brendan played Elliot, who was desperate to gain the affection of a beautiful co-worker, striking a deal with the Devil, played by Elizabeth.
Brendan stars in Darren Aronofsky's film, The Whale. He plays Charlie, a 600-pound gay man who is making a last-ditch effort to repair his relationship with his estranged daughter.
Elizabeth Hurley is part of a huge new celebrity lawsuit joining Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, Sir Elton John and David Furnish, Sadie Frost, and Baroness Doreen Lawrence OBE, suing Associated Newspapers, publishers of The Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday and The Mail Online.
