If you know me, you know I am a sucker for international shows. Being an ardent binge watcher, i quickly exhausted all the English language shows which caught my eye. Soon, I discovered the mine of Italian shows and there is no going back for me.

Squid Game from South Korea and Money Heist from Spain may be the poster children for non-English-language drama's current success. However, it is possible that Italy was the first to arrive. 

Screen Daily has reported that the Italian audiovisual market MIA considers Rai's detective series Inspector Montalbano, which premiered in 1999, to be one of the most popular programmes ever. Inspector Montalbano, the apex of what some describe to as Italy's teletourism genre, has been seen by over 1 billion people in 80 countries over the last two decades, according to MIA estimates.

International viewers were next to notice Cattleya's 2008 crime drama Romanzo Criminale, which was followed by the same company's 2014 success Gomorrah, which firmly established Italian drama on the worldwide TV map. The Neapolitan criminal drama was sold to over 60 countries, including the United States. 

It doesn't stop there: HBO's My Brilliant Friend, Sky Italia's The New Pope (a sequel to The Young Pope), and many other Italian shows have done well abroad. As a result, Italian drama indies like Cattleya, Lux Vide (Medici, Devils, Leonardo), Wildside and The Apartment (The New Pope, My Brilliant Friend), and Palomar have entered the ranks of European production firms acknowledged as pioneers of scripted series that cross national borders.
