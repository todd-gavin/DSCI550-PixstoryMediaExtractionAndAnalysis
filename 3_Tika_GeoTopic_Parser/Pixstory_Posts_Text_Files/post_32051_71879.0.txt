Environmental change is any change in an environment to which an organism must adapt. Change can be gradual, such as when mountains or deserts form, other species die out, or new species evolve. These things can take millions of years. Change to an environment can also be quick, such as floods, volcanoes, or earthquakes. It can also be caused not by change to the environment itself, but by the organism's movement to a different environment.
