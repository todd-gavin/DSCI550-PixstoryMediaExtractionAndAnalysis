Manchester United are seeking to lure Real Madrid midfielder Casemiro to the club, per football transfer expert Fabrizio Romano.

In a bid to salvage the Red Devils sinking ship, the Erik Ten Hag-managed side have signified interest in signing the Brazilian midfielder. 

He has been offered a bid worth around €80m with the possibility of doubling his current salary at Real Madrid. 

The 30-year-old is under contract at Real until 2025 and played an instrumental role in their Champions League final victory over Liverpool in May.

Casemiro has won the Champions League five times with the Spanish giant and is a regular for the Brazil national team. On the flip side, United are bottom of the Premier League table having recorded their worst start to the season in 101 year by losing their first two games against Brighton and Brentford respectively and they will be competing in this year’s Europa League.

In light of United’s precarious situation, it remains uncertain if Casemiro will join the club or rather he and his representative are using the English club as a negotiation bait to strengthen their bargaining power with Real Madrid for an improved contract offer.

Barcelona’s Frankie de Jong has been Erik Ten Hag’s long term midfield target. But upon several week of unfruitful negotiations, they have officially withdraw their bid for the Dutch midfielder. 

United then opted for Juventus Adrien Rabiot as an alternative but due to an extravagant salary demand, the negotiation has ended in deadlock. Hence the more reason why the Red Devils are pushing hard for Casemiro with an optimism that a move will see the light of day.

Casemiro started on the bench in Real's opening weekend win at Almeria on Sunday but he lined up in last week's Super Cup triumph against Eintracht Frankfurt.
