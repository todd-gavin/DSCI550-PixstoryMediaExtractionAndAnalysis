Blake Lively walked the Met Gala red carpet in an Atelier Versace gown that surpassed all expectations and was inspired by New York City architecture. She chose a princess-style gown that she modified and added a second long train to with the help of assistants. Ryan wore a dark wine-shade velvet tuxedo and pant set with minimal accessories to accompany his wife.

Her strapless gown had a plunging sweetheart neckline, multi-colored embellishments, embroidery all over the bodycon form, and a long floor-sweeping train thanks to a huge bronze coloured bow connected to the waist.

A couple attendants joined Blake as she mounted the stairs and assisted her in removing her gown. They unravelled the massive bronze bow to reveal a magnificent aqua blue and rose-gold skirt, adding another layer to the train's stairway. Both the audience and her husband, Ryan, were taken aback.

Just like everytime, Blake stood out and looked like a Goddess with this creative masterpiece!
