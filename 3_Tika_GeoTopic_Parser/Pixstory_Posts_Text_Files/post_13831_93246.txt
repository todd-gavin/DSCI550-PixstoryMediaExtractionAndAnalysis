All India Football Federation President Praful Patel said a couple of months ago he wasn t ready to continue in his post as his term of years at the helm was already over But for the court case pending in the Supreme Court over the confusion of the constitution to be followed by for elections which incidentally was filed by the AIFF only he would have long vacated his seat Patel told the members of the federation in February Interestingly the sports ministry in an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court said Patel has no right to continue as the AIFF chief The ministry said It is submitted that as the term of the existing committee of the AIFF is already over and the existing president Praful Patel has completed more than years as president the Petitioner AIFF should hold elections without further delay as per extant instructions contained under Sports Code and the instructions issued by the Answering Respondent sports ministry from time to time The ministry further said that AIFF is set to lose its recognition in the eyes of the government for not adhering to the sports code As the last elections held by the petitioner was on as such the Petitioner is required to conduct fresh elections While recently the Answering Respondent renewed the Petitioner s annual recognition for a year with effect from such recognition is subject to the outcome of the special leave petition pending before this honourable court Furthermore the Answering Respondent in their renewal letter dated has categorically stated that the Petitioner needs to bring their constitution in line with provisions of the Sports Code within six months from the date of issue of the letter That thus the tenure of an office bearer of the Petitioner such as the president who has already served years as president of AIFF will be in violation of the Sports Code specifically clause iii of the Sports Code The ministry said Patel surely now has no moral right to hold on to his post He is clearly misguiding the AIFF members
