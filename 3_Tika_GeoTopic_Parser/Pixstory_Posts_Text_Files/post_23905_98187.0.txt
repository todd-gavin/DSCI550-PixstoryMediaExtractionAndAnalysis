Life-sized sculptures of Russian artist Svyatoslav Roerich (1904-1993) and his wife and former Indian actress Devika Rani (1908-1994) have been unveiled at the Roerich House Museum, located in the Kullu valley in the foothills of the Himalayas.

The ceremony held on Sunday was attended by representatives of the local authorities of Himachal Pradesh, public figures, diplomats and journalists.

These are the first life-sized sculptures of Roerich and Rani in India. The first sculptural image of Svyatoslav Roerich — his bust — was opened several years ago in the southern Indian city of Trivandrum, which also has a street named after him.
