When we talk about suicide, those struggling may feel less alone. Let's start having the conversation surrounding suicide.

Since it’s September and it’s suicide prevention and awareness month, this month alone is not enough to fight this illness. Everyday is crucial as the world is tough enough to breakdown easily. 
Being compassionate and considerate with sensitive people is something we all need to master and work for. 

As peers, loved ones, and friends, when we educate ourselves on suicide we learn how to respond. In addition to that, folks that are struggling first hand can learn more about themselves through research. It's important to remember that you cannot fight this fight alone. Research does not equal therapy.
If your loved one isn't in immediate danger, practice active listening. That being said, you are not a licensed professional. It's not fair to put that kind of pressure on yourself when you don't have the tools or experience to help.

You can practice active listening by:
Being completely present; put your phone down!
* ﻿﻿Steer clear of judgment Reiterate what was said
* ﻿﻿Keep eye contact

If you or your loved one is considering suicide, it's important to seek therapy.

You never know what could help someone. It could be as simple as asking, "Are you okay?"
