Republicans were not ready to leave the Child pornography case. All Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, excluding Sen. Ben Sasse, have resumed urging Chairman Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., to permit them to see several pre-sentencing reports in child pornography cases Judge Jackson handled, claiming they can't evaluate her judicial record without those records.

This was strongly rejected by Durbin claiming the confidentiality of the cases. His statement is fair in all levels; according to ABC News he said: "If you are a parent of some child who has been exploited, and you recognize this judge's name is perhaps presented at the trial, and realize that now the report that has been kept in confidence, all these years is not going to be handed over to the United States Senate Judiciary Committee, what would you think as a mother?”

‌Meanwhile, Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Rep. Joyce Beatty said Jackson's confirmation will give the right message. She said Jackson "will be a judge that will serve all of America and all of America can be proud of." She also said that Jackson will become an inspiration to many children. 
‌
‌Further, the court has been adjourned for four days. Her nomination is still on track for final consideration in the Senate before Easter; according to Sen.Chuck Schumer. Even though the White House expects some Republicans to vote for her. There is no guarantee by their impending criticism on cases and deflecting the questions asked to her.
