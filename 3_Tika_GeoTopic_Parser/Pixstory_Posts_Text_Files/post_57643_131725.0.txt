A super yacht sank off the southern coast of Italy in the Ionian sea.
The boat's name was My Saga, which was 40 meters long.
When the incident occurred, the boat was on its way to Milazzo from Gallipoli, and nine people had to be rescuedâ€”brought nine crew members and four passengers to safety before the ship sank by the Italian coast guard.
It is still unclear about what caused the boat to sink. Initially, the boat is seen floating, and the sea is rough around it. Then the rear starts to dip into the sea, gradually sinks and quickly vanishes under the water.
The Italian coast guard shared the video on Twitter, mentioning that all crew members and passengers were rescued from the boat.
