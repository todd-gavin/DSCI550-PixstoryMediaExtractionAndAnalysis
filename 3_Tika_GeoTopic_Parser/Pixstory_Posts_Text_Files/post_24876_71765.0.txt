Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke at the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Davos Agenda yesterday , calling India a "bouquet of hope" for the entire world. "The bouquet includes faith in democracy, technology to empower the twenty-first century, and the intellect and temperament of Indians," he remarked.

Due to the Coronavirus epidemic, the World Economic Forum's annual gathering, which has been held in the Swiss ski resort town of Davos for 50 years, will be postponed until early summer this year.


The virtual 'Davos Agenda' summit, on the other hand, would be held on the same dates as the real annual gathering for the second year in a row.
