Favourite pastimeI used to live almost mins from the airport and used to watch airplanes unlike bird watchers It s fascinating to watch planes that are about to land I d get binoculars and perch on my window and watch them fly getting ready to land I used to take notes as well And after a while I knew which flight was landing and where it was from pretty much became an obsession I d be playing outside and I ll see a plane and just know okay this flight is from so in so place people would stare at me what s wrong with her But still undeterred And now sadly I don t have the time for it
