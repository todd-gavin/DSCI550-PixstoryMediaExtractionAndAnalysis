Dirge in Woods BY GEORGE MEREDITH A wind sways the pines And below Not a breath of wild air Still as the mosses that glow On the flooring and over the lines Of the roots here and there The pine tree drops its dead They are quiet as under the sea Overhead overhead Rushes life in a race As the clouds the clouds chase And we go And we drop like the fruits of the tree Even we Even so The wind blows through the pine trees like a breath Below there is a stillness and the moss glows over the roots of the trees The pine tree drops its needles which are peaceful The clouds rush past overhead like a race is being held We as humans drop too when we die just like fruit Here simile is used to compare humans to fruit like there is also a time for them
