Alt News performed a keyword search on Twitter. This led us to a tweet by ANI on July 11 related to the landslide in Saputara. Next, we performed a reverse image search using frames from the viral video. This led us to a tweet from June 20 posted by one Devodatta. The video in this tweet is identical to the one aired by news channels. As per the user, the video shows a landslide that occurred on the route from Silchar to Mizoram. This confirms that the viral footage is old and is not related to the recent calamity in Saputara.
