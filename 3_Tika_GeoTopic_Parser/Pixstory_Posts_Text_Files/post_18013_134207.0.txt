After keeping her recording efforts well under wraps till now, Swift heralded the coming release in her climactic VMAs speech. It will be her first album of freshly written material since 2020's 'Evermore.'
Swift surprised fans Sunday night with an all-new album, "Midnights," set to come out Oct. 21. The announcement came during her MTV Video Music Awards acceptance speech. She waited until midnight ET to reveal the name of the forthcoming record on social media.
She wrote, "We lie awake in love and in fear, in turmoil and in tears." We sip alcohol while we ponder the walls. We writhe in our self-made prisons and hope that we aren't going to make some terrible mistake that will change the course of our lives right now. This is a collection of late-night songs that takes the listener on a journey through terrifying nightmares and delightful dreams. We pace the floors while battling our demons. For all of us who have tossed and turned and chosen to keep the lanterns light and continue looking in the hopes that perhaps, at twelve, we will run into ourselves.
