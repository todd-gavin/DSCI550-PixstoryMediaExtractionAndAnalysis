The FIFA-Asian Football Confederation (AFC) delegation has set a tough task for the Supreme Court appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) for All India Football Federation as well as the AIFF members by announcing a deadline of July 31 to amend the statutes of the constitution and conclude the elections by September 15, 2022. The FIFA-AFC panel has come to India to have a discussion with CoA and the federation members after the AIFF, under its then president Praful Patel failed to conduct elections, despite their tenure ending in December 2020, and found itself dismissed by the Supreme Court. The Apex Court, on May 18 passed an order removing Patel as the president and appointed the CoA to manage the affairs of the federation till the elections are held. 
In case the AIFF fails to fulfil these two deadlines, FIFA has threatened to ban India from international competitions. At the same time, it will completely jeopardise the Women’s under-17 World Cup, which is set to be hosted by India  in October. Sources said that in  case an elected committee doesn’t come in place by September end, the FIFA have the plan ready to shift the World Cup from India at the last moment. 
The CoA, represented by Justice Anil Dave (former judge, Supreme Court of India), Dr. SY Qureshi (former Chief Election Commissioner), and Bhaskar Ganguly (former India football captain), had a constructive and cordial meeting with the joint team of the FIFA and Asian Football Confederation in New Delhi on June 21, wherein everyone discussed working forward together for the cause of Indian Football. “The joint FIFA and AFC team is being represented by AFC General Secretary Datuk Seri Windsor John, AFC Deputy General Secretary of Member Association Division, Vahid Kardany, along with three members from FIFA -- Kenny Jean Marie, Nodar Akhalkatsi, and Prince Rufus, FIFA RDO. Purushottam Kattel and Yogesh Desai are the other members of the joint team,” the AIFF had said in a release after the meeting.
