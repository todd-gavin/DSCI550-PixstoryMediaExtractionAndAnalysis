Antonio Conte might have just done the unlikely with the Spurs. The Italian manager has taken Tottenham Hotspur to the cusp of Champions League qualification and everything is in their hands now.

Manchester United and Arsenal have self-destructed in the last couple of games. Owing to this Tottenham Hotspur have taken a major advantage in the top four race as they have made the most of their last two games. 

Arsenal were in pole position to qualify for the UEFA Champions League as we entered April. The Gunners had games in hand and a lead in terms of points over both the Spurs and Manchester United. 

But a shock 3-0 loss against Crystal Palace followed by a 1-2 home defeat against Brighton & Hove Albion has now put them in serious trouble. Owing to this, Mikel Arteta now has to make the most of their remaining games in the Premier League. 

Manchester United on the other hand have never got going this season. The Red Devils drew 1-1 against Leicester City at home to kick off April. But things went from bad to worse as they lost 1-0 to a struggling Everton side on Saturday!

With seven games remaining, the Red Devils have to play against Liverpool, Arsenal, and Chelsea in the Premier League. Hence in their current form, it is unlikely that they would be able to squeeze out wins from these games. 

Even if they manage to win those games, Manchester United are currently six points behind fourth-placed Tottenham Hotspur. The Spurs also have a +19 goal difference compared to Manchester United's +3. Hence only a miracle could take United to the top four from here! 




12th May would be the Champions League decider? 

Tottenham Hotspur would lock horns with Arsenal on 12th May in the Premier League. This North London derby would certainly be of the most important ones in recent years given the fact that the loser would probably miss out on the UEFA Champions League for next season. Hence this could be the decider between the heated rivals!
