After the defeat against Fiorentina, Napoli&#39;s vice-captain Kalidou Koulibaly spoke to Dazn&#39;s microphones Today we started the match well and put all the right energy into going forward The goal we conceded hurt us a bit but throughout the match we showed to stay in the match and we have always believed in it Too bad we conceded these goals on the counterattack but I think we gave everything We have to work because in games we always concede goals and this conditions us in front we create opportunities to not score goals In the back we have to be solid I see that behind we don&#39;t give the solidity and confidence that is needed in front and I&#39;m so sorry for this There is a lot of anger because we wanted to win this match at all costs We are disappointed but we have to take a day to put this defeat aside We have to go on because next Monday we have a great game against Roma not finished yet I believe in it until the end We are level on points with Inter let&#39;s see what Milan will do but we must not see the others we must do as at the beginning of the season and see game after game I think this is the path we must take Do
