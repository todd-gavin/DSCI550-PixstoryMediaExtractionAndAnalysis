External peace is a reflection of inner harmony of a human being, which comes with humanity, humility, patience, love and forgiveness. So, we as humans need peace for our own growth, which defines our thoughts and personality. And this expression collectively creates external peace in the society. Einstein once said that World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones. So it’s for international societies to understand that love and peace don’t have alternatives. What can be achieved through peace is more precious than a million diamonds bought by violence. In today’s world peace cannot be a choice but is essential for the civilization and mankind.  Shaivism or Sufism, and similar thoughts have highlighted the essence of peace through writings of saints and writers. In the search for peace, enlightenment and freedom, Shaivism is unparalleled in its thoughts, tolerance and mysticism. Lalleshwari, the 14th century Kashmiri saint – poetess, gave the message of universal brotherhood, peace and love based on the Upanishads. World over people, philosophers and sages  have emphasised on the essentially of peace for life yet it sounds like an unexplored theory still to be realized by some. But it is our duty to spread love and peace and talk about it to those who need to be explained and for that social media can be a great tool. Peace is knowing that the lord of the universe is by your side. May god bless all and may the dove of peace fly fearlessly singing songs of love…Abhay Rustum SoporiSantoor Maestro & Music Composer
