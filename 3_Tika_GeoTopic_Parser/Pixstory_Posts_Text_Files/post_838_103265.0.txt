Nice post Prakhar Dixit 
This made me Google a bit about the two brothers  whose amazing work is the basis of the documentary..

This report on them are very interesting. 

If you’ve ever had the opportunity to look away from your digital devices into the open skies, you probably would have witnessed a kite with its soaring wings. There are a few that rest atop high buildings; others even play hide and seek near the towering minarets in Delhi. These birds look majestic, giving us clear evidence as to why they’re christened the kings of the clouds. However, a visit to Wazirabad’s Wildlife Rescue and you’ll be forced to realise how vulnerable these birds of prey can actually be. The cases at this animal shelter—started by Nadeem Shehzad and his brother Mohammad Saud—will put things into perspective, and eventually make you aware of the serious threats that we, inadvertently, pose to birds and other animals.
