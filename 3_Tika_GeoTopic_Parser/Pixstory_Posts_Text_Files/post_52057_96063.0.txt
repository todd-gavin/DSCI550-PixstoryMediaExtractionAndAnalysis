Imagine you suddenly find yourself on an African savanna, and you’re given a choice. You can be a predator, or you can be prey. Which would you choose?

Predator, right? Because who wants to be creeping around, constantly looking over your shoulder and listening out for those fast-moving feet that can only mean one thing.

But Aussie actor Joel Jackson tells me it’s not that simple. In fact, he reckons it doesn’t really matter what you choose, because whether you’re running away from something or running towards it, you’ve got to keep moving to stay alive.

“There’s this brilliant quote about the gazelle and the cheetah, and how it doesn’t matter what they do, if the sun rises and they’re not moving, they’re dead,” he says.

“It’s intense, but I love that motto. In life, our body will forever be our greatest gift, but we’re also responsible for how good that gift is, so I try to serve it as best I can.

“The alarm goes off, my clothes are prepped, gym bag packed and I’m out the door so that when I come home, the sun is rising, the coffee is brewing, and the day can begin.

“It’s either a surf session, a run, a gym workout, a walk with the farm dogs or yoga with my partner. It doesn’t matter, I’m moving.”

It’s probably a little obvious by now, but fitness plays a big role Jackson’s life. The star of Ms Fisher’s Modern Murder Mysteries was raised by and in a sport-obsessed family, and so training hard is simply part of his DNA.

These days, though, his fitness focuses less on sculpting muscles and more on putting his health to use.

“A friend in the military told me recently that training in a gym doesn’t make you an athlete. It kinda shook me because I’d prided myself on my strength and conditioning, but I was never really using my fitness or challenging the entirety of myself, I was just really fit,” he says.

“Muscles are one thing, but they’re nothing without the expansion of your mind.”
