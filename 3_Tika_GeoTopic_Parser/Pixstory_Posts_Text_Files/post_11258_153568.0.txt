Every action has a reaction. Even when our reaction to an external event is not physical or verbal, it will at least be mental. Our observation is based on perception. What we perceive, in terms of the five senses of perception, is retained in the memory of our brain while it is being processed.
The mind comes up with a holistic image of an event. Whether we react to this or not depends on its relevance to us, as dictated by the intellect.
This process is not too far from the way a computer processes data. Inputs from one or more sources are stored in cache memory, while it is being processed by the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV). Whether results are merely displayed or stored permanently in the hard drive depends on the algorithm and, of course, the human input.
According to Vedic philosophy, human beings have the equivalent of a hard drive as well. In Sanskrit, it is called Chitta (the memory shell surrounding the jiva). It is this Chitta that informs our chetana or consciousness. The important question is: what exactly gets stored and what does it take to recall the stored knowledge?
Unlike a computerâ€™s hard drive, the Chitta is a memory shell that is almost permanently attached to the jiva or the soul. This enables the jiva to traverse through multiple lives and integrate the knowledge and wisdom acquired through all experiences in our lives.
If the brain starts to lose its memory strength, we may become forgetful. But if we lose the connection to the Chitta, we cannot recall past experiences. It should not come as a surprise then that the most recent experiences are at the top, which we can recall with relative ease. As time passes, our experiences get buried deeper in memory.
However, all experiences are connected to other similar experiences, and these connections can jog our past, while we observe the present.
