Juventus are the only Italian club in the top 10 when it comes to the most jerseys sold in Europe in 2021, but still more than Barcelona, Chelsea, PSG and Manchester City.

The results were calculated by Euromerica Sport Marketing, who are certified by FIFA, who found that Bayern Munich sold 3.2 million shirts last year on the continent, more than any other football club.

Real Madrid came in second place, with 3 million jerseys, followed by Liverpool on 2.4m shirts and Manchester United with 1.95m.

Juventus are the only Italian side in the top 10, coming in fifth place after selling 1.42 million jerseys.

They beat Barcelona into sixth, with 1.34m, then Champions League winners Chelsea sold 1.31m and Borussia Dortmund 1.18m.

Paris Saint-Germain no doubt got a boost with the arrival of Lionel Messi, but still sold only 1.18m shirts and Manchester City shifted 1.087m units.

With stadium restrictions during the pandemic, shirt sales have become one of the more important revenue streams for European clubs.
