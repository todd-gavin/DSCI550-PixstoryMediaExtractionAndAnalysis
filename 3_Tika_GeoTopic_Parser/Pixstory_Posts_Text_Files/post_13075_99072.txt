Take the world from me Not the mother s tablecloth The warmth and intimacy of our house should be understood from my mother s kitchen If you want to understand how much the mother s house longs for her family look at how much food comes out of her kitchen See how much time she spends cooking with good food and how bored she is He spreads it and puts the food on the table with what taste so that he draws every eye towards him and every person even if he is hungry sat down at the table tip My food is always ready when I go home from outside because my mother knows that I will return home hungry I can taste food except with my mother s hand You re my mom love you
