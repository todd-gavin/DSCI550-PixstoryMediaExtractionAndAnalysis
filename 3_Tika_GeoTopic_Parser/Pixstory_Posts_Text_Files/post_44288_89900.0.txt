David Moyes has spoken out about the mental health struggles he has faced as a manager, stating that he believes it is something that only fellow football fans can truly understand.

The West Ham manager is riding arguably the highest crest of popular form he has enjoyed in over a decade and a half since taking over at Everton, following difficult stints at Manchester United, Real Sociedad, and Sunderland, among others.

With the Hammers set to play in a Europa League quarter-final next month, the Scotsman is having a good time at London Stadium - but in an interview with Alan Shearer, he has reflected on the difficulties that managers face both in and out of the office.

What exactly has been said?

"Obviously when you’re not working, you find it tough," Moyes told The Athletic. "You always feel the criticism that you get when you leave your jobs, even if a lot of it isn’t quite correct and there’s a lot of untruths in it.

"You find yourself having to battle against things which you don’t think are fair, really. The biggest thing I did was make sure that I tried to go and retrain, relearn, keep myself busy. I think if you’re a real football person, you understand the levels people are at.

"People who have been professionals like yourself, players or managers in the game, understand that we can all have bad times and things can’t always go right, but I think there was a different level of media attention."

"It’s only if you’re in the business that you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about," he added. “There’s all the stuff we talk about with mental health nowadays, and I think we’re getting closer to understanding that, yet it’s still OK to discuss a football manager’s job on television or radio and people talk about it as if it’s a jokey matter.
