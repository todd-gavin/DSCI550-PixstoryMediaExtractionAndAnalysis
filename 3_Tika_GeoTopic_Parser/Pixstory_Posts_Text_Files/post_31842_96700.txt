A study conducted by the Institute of marine sciences of the National Research Council of Bologna Cnr Ismar has reconstructed the traces of a tsunami which about years ago hit the Mediterranean coasts including Sicily and southern Calabria. The research concerns an abysmal area in the Ionian Sea between Italy Greece and Africa where a deposit of marine sediments up to meters thick was deposited almost instantaneously by the catastrophic force of currents induced by a tsunami wave The study was published in Scientific Reports The Mediterranean Sea hosts two subduction systems along the limit between the African and Eurasian plates that have produced strong earthquakes in the past often associated with tsunamis Based on historical descriptions and the analysis of sediments taken from the bottom of the Ionian Sea one of these events occurred in AD and affected a large geographical area including regions about km away from the source area which is located in Crete explains Alina Polonia of Cnr Ismar The analyzed sediment samples made it possible to verify that the material which was in conditions of very low water was removed from the coastal area and deposited at a depth of meters The tsunami wave produced multiple submarine landslides along a front of thousands of kilometers from southern Italy to the African coasts The currents dragged coastal sediments into abyssal depths even in the absence of canyons probably through large tabular flows This allowed the deposition of a extraordinary volume of sediments of more than km throughout the eastern Mediterranean Very similar processes have also been described during the mega tsunami which devastated the Japanese coasts The characteristics of the deposit have made it possible to identify two other older events which represent the predecessors of that of Crete allowing to acquire useful elements for a more correct assessment of the tsunamigenic risk on our coasts
