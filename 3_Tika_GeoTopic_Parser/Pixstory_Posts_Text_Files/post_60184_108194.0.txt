The film Ram Setu, starring Akshay Kumar, will be released on an OTT platform rather than in theatres, as previously announced. According to some rumours, this is due to Akshay's recent films Samrat Prithviraj and Bachchhan Paandey's poor box office performances. However, Vikram Malhotra, Ram Setu's producer, has denied all of these allegations.

Jacqueline Fernandez and Nushratt Bharuccha also appear in Ram Setu. The film, directed by Abhishek Sharma, portrays Akshay Kumar as an archaeologist who is exploring the mystery surrounding the Ram Setu, a fabled bridge that connects India and Sri Lanka that is referenced in the Ramayana. On October 24, around Diwali, the movie will be released.

Akshay Kumar's previous two films failed to perform well at the box office. In its whole run, Bachchhan Paandey, which premiered in March, only made Rs. 49 crore. On the other hand, his most recent film, Samrat Prithviraj, is reaching the end of its run in India, having earned 66 crore so far. According to certain rumours, the makers of Ram Setu were hesitant to release the picture in theatres due to its poor box office results.
