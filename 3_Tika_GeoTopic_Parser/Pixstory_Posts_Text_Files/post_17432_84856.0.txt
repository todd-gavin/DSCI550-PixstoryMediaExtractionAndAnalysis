Paris Saint-Germain head to Spain for the return of their UEFA Champions League last-16 tie against Real Madrid defending a 1-0 lead from the first leg after Kylian Mbappé’s late strike. Ligue1.com presents three reasons why the Parisians will finish the job at the Santiago Bernabéu…

1) Mbappé is still a Paris player, for now

All the talk going into this tie was of Mbappé’s future with his contract up at the end of the season and Madrid determined to bring him to the Spanish capital. PSG still hope to persuade the World Cup-winning striker to sign a new deal and stay at the Parc des Princes, with Le Parisien reporting on Wednesday that they have offered him €50 million a year plus a signing-on fee of €100 million to commit his future to the Ligue 1 Uber Eats leaders. His display in the first leg summed up just why they are so keen for him to stick around.

Regardless of where Mbappé will be playing next season, for now he remains a Paris player and that was what swung the first leg in favour of Mauricio Pochettino’s side. There is a strong case to say that the 23-year-old is the best player in the world right now, and even Lionel Messi seems to have adapted his game to play for Kylian.

Last Saturday Messi produced two fantastic assists for Mbappé to score a brace in the 3-1 win against AS Saint-Etienne. Mbappé has scored 24 goals this season in all competitions. His pace is terrifying and his finishing has arguably never been better. The last time he went to Spain he came away with a hat-trick as PSG thrashed Barcelona 4-1 at the Camp Nou at the same stage of last season’s Champions League. With Real chasing this tie the spaces should open up for Mbappé to use that pace in behind, and that could make all the difference.
