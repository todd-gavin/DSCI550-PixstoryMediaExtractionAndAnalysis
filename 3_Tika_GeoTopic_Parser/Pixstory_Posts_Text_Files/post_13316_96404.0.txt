It speaks not with language but with words, like the  of the eyes that look at the sunflowers in the birds that sing the song of spring from memory.
It neither resents nor turns away, what it knows and forgives is kindness and friendship, its leaves are greener than all the seasons on the tree of thought.

Why?
Because I can access it at any time of the day or night.
Because I have no obligation to the book, I go to the book whenever I want and I put it aside whenever I am not bored.
I can sell it. I can borrow at least two to three books a week from the library for a small fee.
I can go to the book whenever I want, and we can not go to it whenever we are bored, without hearing any objection from the book.

I with the book
The book is a companion that does not make me bored and bored. It is a friend who does not deceive me. He is a friend who does not bother me. The book is older, more faithful, and more patient than all human friends, and it never turns its back on me in times of misery and hardship. In youth, it entertains and keeps people busy, and in old age and fractures, it offers consolation and consolation.
 The book is the only one that gives me all its information without a hint and wishes from the bottom of my heart the success of those around me.
