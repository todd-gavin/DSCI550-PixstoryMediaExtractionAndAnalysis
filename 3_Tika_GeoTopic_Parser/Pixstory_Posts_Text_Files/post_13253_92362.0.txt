World Health Day is more than just an occasion, it is an opportunity for the world to focus on important aspects of global health.
The themes for this day vary from year to year, from polio eradication to keeping the elderly active, mother and child care, climate change and even road safety, to the most important issues in people's lives.
All of these topics are so important that they need to be assigned a day off the calendar.
We are leaving the World Health Day behind, and in our country, Afghanistan, health problems are still one of the main problems of the people.
 3.2 million children in Afghanistan during the year (2022) will suffer from acute malnutrition. More than one million children die of severe malnutrition in Afghanistan. Hundreds of children and mothers die every day from various diseases in Afghanistan, this year this number has increased compared to previous years. In my opinion, the number of children who have perished is definitely more than what is out of sight of the authorities. The reason for this expansion is the lack of health facilities and treatment that is not available in many areas of children's hospitals, for example in western provinces, including Herat, which is one of the most important cities in the country.
