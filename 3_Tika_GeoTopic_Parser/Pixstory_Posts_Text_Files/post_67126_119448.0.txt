Just watched #RocketryTheNambiEffect. It is one of the best movies ever created in Indian Cinema. The life of Sir NambiNarayanan is clearly like a James Bond movie(as said by ActorMadhavan ).The adventures he experienced in his life are no less than any action/thriller Hollywood movie. The best part of the movie was that it focused more on his journey and accomplishments than the infamous scandal for which he was very wrongly accused. I request every indian who believes that this shouldn't happen with anyone else (also if you're interested in space then it's an icing on the cake) to watch and promote this movie. No agenda,no diversion
Only true story and facts.
Also Actor Madhavan,He's one of the most intelligent and intellectual actors in the Indian film industry. The efforts he took during the script writing and production of this film can be clearly seen.
In the end, I'll repeat "GO WATCH
