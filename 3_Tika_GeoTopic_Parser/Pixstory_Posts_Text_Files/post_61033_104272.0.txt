The main reason online exams became a global trend is due to the current pandemic. We all got to experience how online exams went. Personally, I found it more stressful than relaxing. The idea of an online exam sounds easy in preparing and giving the paper in our comfort zone, that is, our homes. What made it stressful was how no one was prepared for this situation. Also, since everything was happening in the same space, it was difficult to distinguish from when we were in class studying to having dinner at home; everything was mixed up. So it became a task to focus on studies or gather the knowledge from online classes. 
Online exams made me realize how much I missed offline classes and how I would instead attend college classes and give papers within the institution than stay at home in front of a screen 24/7.
