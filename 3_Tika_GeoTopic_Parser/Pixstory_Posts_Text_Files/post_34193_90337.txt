After the defeat in Palermo, the coach of Italy Roberto Mancini spoke like this in the press conference How this summer was the greatest joy now comes the greatest disappointment It&#39;s not easy to think of anything else I&#39;m very sorry for the boys I love them much more tonight than in July the disappointment was really great for them They didn&#39;t deserve it but this is football I don&#39;t even know what to say about the match as well as against Switzerland we had to win Unfortunately when one loses one has to suffer and keep silent One cannot comment on a match where we hit times against shots Then came the goal at the th are those games that have to go like this I am the coach because I am primarily responsible the boys no they have a great future they are strong players for the future of the national team It will be a difficult moment like this in the next few days The European remains the greatest joy received We managed to build and win deservedly not for situations We won match after match for two and a half years that&#39;s why I say that this national team despite the great disappointment of this moment is made up of very good players Unfortunately we miss the World Cup in Qatar and this is a great disappointment I am the coach and in football when things go wrong the coach is primarily responsible I suffer for this I don&#39;t think the boys deserved this Then it was such a match but we don&#39;t even know why we got to play these playoffs Against Switzerland we deserved to win big it probably had to go like this
