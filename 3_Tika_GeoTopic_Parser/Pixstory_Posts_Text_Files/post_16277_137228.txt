Cuttputlli movie review Positives Stays true to what a suspense thriller should be ensuring that neither the pace nor the tension dips for a moment Akshay Kumar not only bounces back with a quality film for the entire family after not enjoying the best of times with his last three releases but he also serves a timely reminder of his talent when given an author backed role The technicalities elevate the script with the location and camerawork playing a big part in striking the right atmosphere while the editing keeps you on your feet as an audience Rating out of Star Rating
