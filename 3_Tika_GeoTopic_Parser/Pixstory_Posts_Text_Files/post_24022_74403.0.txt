Regardless of the bravado, cracks have surfaced in the Samajwadi Party-Rashtriya Lok Dal alliance in western Uttar Pradesh over ticket distribution. The RLD supporters are up in arms as they feel that a major chunk of tickets are going to the SP while the Jats were "not getting their due." A number of seats in the RLD strongholds in Meerut and Muzaffarnagar have gone to the SP. RLD minority wing leader, Anudin Shah has come out against the party leadership saying that the party chief, Jayant Chaudhury has "succumbed to the SP pressure." Former MLA and RLD leader, Rajeshwar Bansal quit the party after his son was refused ticket from Shamli Assembly seat. Elections for 58 seats in Western UP will be held during the first phase of the polling on February 10.

Led by state president Rashtriya Jat Mahasangh, Rohit Jakhad, jats sat in protest under the statue of former Prime Minister, Chaudhary Charan Singh in Meerut. Jakhad went on to threaten that if the Jats were ignored during the ticket distribution, "Akhilesh Yadav's dream to become the chief minister would be shattered."
