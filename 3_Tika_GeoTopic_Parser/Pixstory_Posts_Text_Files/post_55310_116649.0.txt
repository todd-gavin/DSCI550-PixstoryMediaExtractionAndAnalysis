An #InvestInOurPlanet Earth Day Morning Assembly was conducted at Sheth Jotiprasad Vidyalaya, Daund, Dist. Pune, Maharashtra after a workshop of binding notebooks, to make paper packets from the unused papers.
1 tonne of paper is got from cutting down 17 big trees so we should consider how we use paper. So much paper from unused pages of studentsâ€™ notebooks are wasted every year. The 2970 students of the school from Class 5-12 are requested at the end the educational year to donate all their notebooks to save trees. All the 60 students of the National Green Corps (NGC) are involved in the Notebook Binding workshop. Pramod Kakade NGC in charge organised them into 6 groups. Group 1 tear out the unused paper, Group 2 make bundles according to the paper size, Group 3 staple or stitch the bundles, Group 4 paste the binding cloth and hardcover to the notebook, Group 5 stick on the cover page picture, and Group 6 cut the three sides of the notebooks. 1242 notebooks were made in the workshop. With the remaining papers, the NGC students took workshops in every class and showed the students how to make paper packets. All the students distributed these paper packets to local medical shops to decrease use of plastic bags. The notebook binding workshop and making paper packets is a great way to promote the message to #ReduceReuseRecycle and #upcycle to #EndPlasticPollution.
