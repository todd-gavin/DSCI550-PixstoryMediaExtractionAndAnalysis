Thinking about breakups And The very First thing Comes in my mind is - Anushka Sharma's Song *Mere Saiyyan Ji Se Aaj Maine breakup Kr liya* 😅❤️

Well jokes apart , We Always talk about Relationships , But we never talk about breakups ? Talking about breakup is equally important Just like We talk about Relationships ! 

I don't Have To tell you that Breakups are painful , no matter what brings them about and whether or not you want to break up . Whether you're the one who was left heartbroken or the one who ended the relationship, breaking up is hard to do .🥺🙃

Do you know ? breakup have Types ? Yaa , I'm serious ! sounds Interesting ? Lemme tell you Types of Breakup :

1 The Mutual Breakup - 
Eg - At dinner last night , you both noticed the spark had fizzled out . And You both mutually Decides to do breakup ! I can say that it is peaceful Breakup !


2 The Ultimatum Breakup - 
Eg - Marry Me ! Or We Breakup ! As Simple As that ! Straight and Short !


3 I know It was Gonna Happen Breakup -
Eg - The *talk* that you both have been avoiding for months . In this situation , it’s never a bad idea to distract yourself by putting all your energy into a new .


4 Breakup Coz They Cheated -
Eg - Whether you find out from them or some other way , it's the ultimate betrayal when they are cheating on you .


5 One Sided Breakup -
Eg - You’re not on the same page and you’re not sure you’ll ever be . But for now , it’s better that you just part ways .


6 Never Saw it coming breakup -
Eg - When You both plan Future together and Then One Day Boom ! Breakup ! And Its Over !


According to me , there's no right way to heal from a breakup — you have to give yourself space to explore what makes you feel better.✨🤍
