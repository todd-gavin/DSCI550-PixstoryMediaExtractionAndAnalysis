#2 Per Mertesacker
Arsenal's greatest defender ever, he was a protagonist at Emirates and played alongside many top defenders. Per Mertesacker enjoyed a memorable period with Arsenal, and how can someone forget his magnificent performance against Chelsea in the 2017 FA Cup final. 
 Mertesacker won three FA Cups and two Community Shields and played 221 games for the Gunners before retiring at Arsenal.
#1 Laurent Koscielny
Laurent Koscielny didn't have the farewell he expected, but Arsenal were his inhabitant, and he beats most of the defenders on the list of top center-back for Arsenal. He signed for Arsenal in 2010 and was there instantly became their mainstay. 
He was Arsenal's stalwart as his nine-year spell at Arsenal saw him appear in 353 matches, win three FA Cups, and leave the club in an acrimonious way.
