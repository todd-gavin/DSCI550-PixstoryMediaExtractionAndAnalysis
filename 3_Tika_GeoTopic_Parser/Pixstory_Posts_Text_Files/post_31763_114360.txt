A big leap so as not to lower attention to the drought emergency which in recent weeks has hit the entire peninsula, bringing Northern Italy to its knees in particular. Again this year, Legambiente is joining the Big Jump, the festival founded by the European Rivers Network which reconnects citizens with their rivers, lakes and wetlands, symbolically uniting them in a great dive. The aim of the event is to mobilize public opinion and institutions to protect inland waters threatened by human activities and the effects of climate change and precisely because of the profound water crisis that is affecting important portions of territory throughout Italy this year the initiatives organized by the Green Swan focused on the theme of drought With a first flash mob created by a group of activists from Legambiente Veneto and Legambiente Emilia Romagna who met on the bed of the river Po in Gaiba in the province of Rovigo Wake up You can&#39;t sleep on a river bed is the slogan chosen to draw attention to the urgency of timely interventions that help mitigate the effects of climate change underway and thus avert a point of no return The combination of out of scale temperatures at the beginning of summer and the drought emergency are severely testing our territories, considerably reducing the flow of rivers, declares Barbara Meggetto, president of Legambiente Lombardia With our flash mob we therefore wanted to raise a cry in defense of the watercourses affected by the drought which is endangering the ecosystem the economy and the life of the river communities Two events in Lombardy on Sunday July in view of the great jump which will take place simultaneously throughout Europe at Cremona The great flight into the river Po organized by Legambiente Lombardia and Circolo Vedo Verde with appointment at Societ Canottieri Bissolati on Lungo Europa on Lungolago di Laveno VA Legambiente Varese organizes Big Jump in Lake Maggiore because Ticino also passes through there as part of the Goletta dei Laghi campaign
