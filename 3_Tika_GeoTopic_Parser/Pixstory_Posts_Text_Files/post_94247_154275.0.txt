Everyday we hear about young people killing themselves, suicides, celebrity suicides and than the copycat acts followed by others. Media and social media just acts as a multiplying force, glorifying, trivializing, talking about everything but mental health of these individuals. As healthcare professionals we wanted to do something about this so that families don’t have to face heartaches, young people don’t have to die. We have realised that many of these people who ultimately killed themselves or died because of suicide, do not understand what's happening to them, they most of the time don’t have access to mental health experts or do not get the momentary support somehow. We wanted to provide that momentary support which was missing. So while people were there was so much talk about deaths and suicides, we offered to talk about Zindagi (life). Hence Zindagi is a helpline where you can talk about Zindagi and prevent deaths. Lot of people think that suicide helplines are solution to the problem, which is not entirely true. We understand that fully-this is just one of the many steps in this whole process by which actually we can save lives. Most of these deaths happen in very young people, otherwise healthy. As mental health professionals, we have to have a comprehensive mental health approach which might actually help save lives. We had to devise a counter narrative that to what was happening on media or social media.  Sometimes media/social media tries to trivialize these deaths, make them sensational or give some other twist where mental health is not talked about. Glorifying, showing visuals which otherwise should not be shown not following guidelines during reporting these deaths. The aim was to counter the above and also provide a support system to people who want to reach out.
