When the dolphin was spotted floating along a riverbank on February on the stretch of Mekong River in northern Cambodia on February 15, scientists tracking it for days knew something unfortunate had happened. 

The lone Irrawaddy dolphin was last seen in the province of Stung Treng. Its death marks the extinction of a species that lived along this stretch of the Mekong River. According to experts, the dolphin died because of injuries it suffered after entangling in a fishing net a few days back. The experts tracking the dolphin did not swim correctly because of the injury, and it had lost its weight. World Wide Fund for Nature Cambodia (WWF-Cambodia) were working to ensure that the dolphin survived, but that was not to be.

According to the World Wildlife Fund, only 90 left in this stretch. (https://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/49487/20220218/dolphin-population-extinct-member-entangled-fishing-gear.htm)
