Russell Westbrook’s first season with the Los Angeles Lakers ended in a huge disappointment, prompting questions over the guard’s future in L.A.

Westbrook averaged 18.5 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.1 assists and 3.8 turnovers during the 2021-22 campaign, which the Lakers finished without securing playoff basketball. The 2017 NBA MVP rarely seemed comfortable next to LeBron James and Anthony Davis on the floor due to chemistry issues caused by the many injuries that let the so-called Big 3 play in 21 games only — but also his questionable compatibility with the star duo.

Westbrook admitted to not being at his best in 2021-22. However, the guard said he “very rarely” felt like himself on the court.

“There were times and spurts,” Westbrook said. “I was just trying to find my way, honestly, just trying to do whatever it is that was asked of me. Whether, you know, it was best for the team, I just do whatever was asked of me.

“Sometimes I may not agree with it, but that I kept to myself and did what I could have for the team regardless. The frustrating part is losing. Like, making a big sacrifice and trying to find ways to play differently and do different things, and I’m putting in position, and we’re still losing — to me, [it] didn’t make much sense.”

Westbrook added he came to L.A. knowing he would need to change the way he used to play, primarily when it comes to ball-handling and his usage rate. But the 33-year-old felt like he was never given a chance to be himself in a way he thought could benefit the team. Instead, Westbrook said he had to constantly fight false narratives about him and his attitude.

“I would say, when I first got here and just being a person, unfortunately, that people create narratives of me and who I am, and what I do, and what I believe in that are, you know, just not true,” he said.
