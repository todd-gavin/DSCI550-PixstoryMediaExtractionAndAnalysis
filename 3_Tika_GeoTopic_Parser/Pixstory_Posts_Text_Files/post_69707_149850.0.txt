Vice Defense Minister Says BTS Military Exemption "Will Be Difficult"
Vice Defense Minister Shin Bum Chul has revealed that BTS military service exemption will be difficult.
On September 22, regarding the controversy over BTS military service obligations, Vice Defense Minister Shin Bum Chul said,
It is a firm position of the Ministry of National Defense
that it is clifficult to expand the scope of military service
exemptions."
On the MBC Radio show, Vice Minister Shin said,
In terms of fairness in fulfilling military service obligations, the Ministry of National Defense's consistent position was that it would be difficult to expand 'alternative service'."
Asked by the host why a poll was discussed, Vice Minister Shin replied,
It was a poll at the National Assembly level (not the Ministry of National Defense). I am grateful that we can confirm the will of the people through the polls, but there is nothing confirmed about what the Ministry of National Defense wants to do."
Vice Minister Shin said,
It is hard to say that the majority of the people are in favor of eligibility of BTS from the military service exemption, with only 40-60% of the approval ratio and 30-50% of the opposition ratio."
