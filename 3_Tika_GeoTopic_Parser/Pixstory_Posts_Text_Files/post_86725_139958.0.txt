FIFA World Cup Qatar ticket holders will be able to link their Hayya Card to bring in three friends or relatives who do not hold the tickets. This will allow them to enter Qatar and enjoy the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 atmosphere in the country. 
This was announced by the Director General of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy Eng Yasir Al-Jamal in a press conference. 
He stated that we will introduce 1+3 policy where by during the tournament's group stage (November 20 to December 6, 2022), the World Cup ticket holder will be able to link his/her Hayya pass to up to three non-ticketed fans so that they can enter Qatar. This will take effect starting next week. 
This policy is being introduced so that the tournament is a family event. There will also be a fee charged to add the non-ticket holders, but children under the age of 12 years can be added for free, he said.
