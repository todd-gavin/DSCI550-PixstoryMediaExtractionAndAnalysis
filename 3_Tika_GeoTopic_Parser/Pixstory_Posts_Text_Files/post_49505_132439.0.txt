The amount of student loan debt in the United States, which exceeds credit card or auto loan debt by a significant margin, is $1.7 trillion, owed by more than 40 million people. The amount of student debt graduates carry has increased as a result of higher education's skyrocketing tuition fee and stagnant incomes. From $12,000 in 1980, the average sum is now over $30,000.
In keeping with a campaign promise, President Joe Biden said on Wednesday that he will forgive $10,000 in federal student loan debt for the majority of debtors, providing millions of Americans with financial relief. Biden will waive up to $20,000 in fees for Pell Grant recipients.
What do you all think about this? In my opinion, it's a step in the right direction.
