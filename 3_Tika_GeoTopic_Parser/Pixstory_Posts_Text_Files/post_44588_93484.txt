The Snow Lion and the Dragon Tibet China Relations continues The next major development of this relationship was when Kublai who had become the Khan of the eastern part of the Mongol Empire appointed as his teacher Sakya Pandita s nephew Dogon Choegyal with the title Phags pa Noble Guru In CE he officially gave Phagspa political authority over all Tibet and appointed him Ti shi Imperial Preceptor In CE Kublai Khan made his Guru the spiritual leader of all Buddhists and proclaimed him as the Imperial Guru with numerous titles which included The Son of the Indian Deity Dharmaraja Arya Ti shi incidentally acknowledging India as the source of Tibet s knowledge of Buddhism Later during the Ming dynasty in China when China had no control over Tibet the Mongolian ruler of the time Altan Khan made the Head Lama of the Gelugpa sect Sonam Gyatso his spiritual teacher and bestowed upon him the title of Talei Lama now universally spelt as Dalai Lama beginning the use of this title Obviously the Ming rulers of China were not happy to see this ChoeYon relationship between the Mongol tribes and Tibet continuing to flourish However their main interest was not in subjugating Tibet but in averting any joint Mongol Tibetan military threat to China Thus the Choe Yon relationship worked well though there are periods recorded when it had broken down but it was essentially an Asian Buddhist religion based relationship in which the Guru was always senior to his Disciple the Patron and publicly demonstrated to be so except in certain specified temporal court functions at the Emperor s court in China It was used as well as misused at times by the subsequent Ming dynasty of Hans and thereafter by the non Han Manchu dynasty The modern PRC version of this history as given in their White Paper of is certainly a misrepresentation of history meant originally and primarily for their own Han public but being used to justify their conquest of Tibet in Since this PRC version of history also brings up the presence of Chinese Ambans in Lhasa this needs to be looked at as well To be continued
