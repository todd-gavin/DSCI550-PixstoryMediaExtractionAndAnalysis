After suffering a horrible and controversial defeat against Inter in the UEFA Champions League in their last match, FC Barcelona have finally striked back in La Liga with a big win against a very strong Celta Vigo side. The Catalunyans won by a narrow 1-0 margin but that was enough to maintain their position at the top of the points table. 
FC Barcelona head coach Xavi Hernandez picked a very confusing starting lineup ahead of tonight’s match, to begin with. The peculiar back-4 of Balde as right back, Pique, Alonso and Alba was the weirdest part. In the front three, Xavi went with Lewandowski, Raphinha and Ferran Torres. 
FC Barcelona are currently suffering due to a lot of injuries. Some of their biggest assets (like Jules Kounde and Araujo) are out injured and that has cost them a lot lately (especially in the Champions League). Although it was not a great game for Xavi’s men, they would be contented with the three points as it came in a very difficult time. 
Barca got an early goal in the came after Gavi’s assist was deflected in Celta Vigo’s box. It was an easy tap-in for Barca’s wonder kid Pedri. We must give special mention to Gavi, who particularly outshined all the other on-field players in today’s lacklustre match. Xavi’s questionable defense line was, fortunately, able to maintain a clean sheet for the rest of the match and thus they won by a 1-0 margin. 
Currently, both Barca and Real Madrid are tied at 22 points but Barca are ahead on the points table as they have a GD of 19 compared to Madrid’s 12. 
Barca will now take on Inter once again in the UEFA Champions League, but this time at home on 13th October. That will be followed by the much awaited El Clasico on 16th October.
