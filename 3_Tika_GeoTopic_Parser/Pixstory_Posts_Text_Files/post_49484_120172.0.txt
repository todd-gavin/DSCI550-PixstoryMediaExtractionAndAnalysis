According to a 2020 data, a total of $1.7 trillion in student debt is owed by around 45 million Americans. Many of these debtors are hoping that their debts would be erased because that paying that kind of money is a nightmare.

College expenditures have climbed by more than 16 percent in the last decade, while student debt has increased by 99 percent. You claim that America is providing scholarships for "deserving" candidates, but who, according to you, is undeserving of being able to afford a good lifestyle? Jobs for those without a college diploma are fast disappearing, and college graduates earn 80 percent more than those with only a high school background. The difference in average life expectancy between individuals with and without a college diploma is widening, owing to differing economic possibilities.

For the following six years, cancelling student loan debt may add $109 billion to annual GDP on average. 

Student loan debt cancellation might result in the creation of 1.5 million new jobs.

Up to 5.2 million American households could be lifted out of poverty as a result of the cancellation of student loan debt.

Consumer spending could rise by as much as 3.3 percent as a result of debt cancellation.

Current debt cancellation plans would help more than 35 million Americans who owe money to the federal government.

So probably it's not as much of a burden on America as people claim it is. In fact it will only help a lot of Americans. Using a superficial statement like "the value of education" as an excuse to drive Americans towards poverty is nothing but anti-american.
