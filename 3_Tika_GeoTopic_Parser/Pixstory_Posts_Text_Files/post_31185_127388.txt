Approximately the minors will be guests of the three centers involved but the number could undergo variations determined by family reintegration or adoption processes The inauguration of the spaces created thanks to the support of Ai Bi Amici dei Bambini partner of the three Bolivian orphanages was anticipated by a training activity on the Montessori methodology So far, operators of the technical educational staff of the centers have been trained overall but other training meetings are being organized for the operators of the institutions Bringing the method devised by Maria Montessori into orphanages means introducing a philosophy of respect for the child which involves the freedom to express one&#39;s spontaneity strengthens the possibility of choosing teaches the child to become independent and self-regulate Important experiences for the minors in orphanages who do not always have the opportunity to be listened to in expressing their wishes and who hardly learn to choose The introduction of the Montessori method within orphanages has found the full collaboration of the Bolivian institutions which have donated the spaces within the structures and by civil society with the involvement and training of some volunteers We are only at the beginning of a path that we at Ai Bi hope will be full of successes in which all child educators and staff of our partner orphanages together with Ai Bi volunteers can work together for the construction of a more inclusive world and for the right of every child to grow up in a family who love him Credit Amici dei Bambini press office
