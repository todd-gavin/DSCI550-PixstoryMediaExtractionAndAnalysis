This book is my current read. So far, I'm in love with the way it is written. 

Elif Shafak is a renowned British-Turkish novelist and her books mix facts with fiction. When I first discovered her, I knew I had to read her novels and picked up 10 Minutes and 38 Seconds in This Strange World. 

The book's protagonist is as unique as the title of the book. However, the circumstances she survives as a woman are heart-wrenching and through her character, Shafak highlights the oppression women face in society. 

I am yet to complete the book but it has been an excellent read so far. Have you read any of her books? How were they?
