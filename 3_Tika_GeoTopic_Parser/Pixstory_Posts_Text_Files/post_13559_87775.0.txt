A representative of the United Nations Population Fund says that every two hours, a pregnant woman in Afghanistan dies.

The fall of Kabul to the Taliban has had a serious impact on the situation of women and girls, and the rate of gender-based violence in Afghanistan has risen since August.

According to the United Nations, Afghanistan had one of the highest maternal mortality rates in Asia-Pacific even before the country fell to the Taliban.

At that time, for every 100,000 births, 638 children lost their lives. The organization warns that without additional funding, this figure could reach 963 deaths per 100,000 births by 2025.

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) says it needs $ 251.9 million to continue its humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan in 2022.

The money will be used to expand health services and protect 9.3 million Afghans, according to the fund's official website.

This figure will include 2.2 million women of childbearing age, 2.3 million adolescents and 289,000 pregnant women.

The United Nations says a total of 22.1 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, and $ 4.44 billion is needed to address them all.
