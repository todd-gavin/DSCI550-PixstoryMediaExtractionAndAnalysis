Arsene Wenger managed Arsenal from 1996-2018 and holds the record for the club’s longest-serving and most successful manager. The Frenchman was a legendary manager and enjoyed a lot of success at the North-London club. The most difficult task for a manager in football is to remain consistent and this is extremely difficult to do at the highest level. Wenger must be given massive praise for this as he proved he has the ability to remain consistent by rebuilding teams successively at Arsenal.
Arsenal won three league titles, seven FA Cups, and 7 community shields during his time at the club. Under his regime, they played brilliant football which many teams still implement in the modern era. In Wenger’s early years at the club he competed directly with Manchester United and Sir Alex Ferguson. Both managers created such a rivalry that even though the clubs are not geographically close, the rivalry continues to live on. Ferguson and Wenger dominated English football for a period of time with both clubs fighting for the league and domestic trophies.
Wenger’s biggest achievement at Arsenal was ‘The Invincibles’ era where the team went a whole season unbeaten. The streak came to an end when they lost to Manchester United at Old Trafford which once again emphasizes the dominance of both sides. Wenger received criticism towards the end of his reign from the Arsenal supporters who felt the manager’s time had come to an end and that the club needed fresher ideas. Amidst the criticism, Wenger managed to win a couple of FA Cups and ensured Arsenal finished in Champions League spots. This is something the club have failed to do since the Frenchman left the club. Some sections of the media felt the toxic nature around Wenger was harsh and unfair given how much success Arsenal achieved under the Frenchman.
