As an American, I am living vicariously my Victorian era dreams through the tv series Bridgerton. I mean, what’s not to love? Balls, dancing, illustrious gowns, and romance! But now it seems that Netflix is taking it up a notch and I am no one to complain! 
We are getting live events!!!

It is The Queen's Ball: A Bridgerton Experience is an immersive, Instagram-worthy confection presented in the ballrooms of the Millennium Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles for die-hard fans of the global Netflix phenomenon. Regé-Jean Page, the breakout star of the first season of "Bridgerton," who declined to return to the 19th-century drama, will not be able to meet the 200 to 300 guests. They can, however, bow before an actress performing her best Queen Charlotte impersonation (complete with haughty stare), learn a dance choreographed to a string quartet version of Taylor Swift's "Wildest Dreams," take part in a Lady Whistledown scavenger hunt, and possibly be dubbed the "diamond of the evening."

NY Times reported that The 90-minute experience will run for at least two months before traveling to Washington, Chicago and Montreal — is Netflix’s most ambitious real-world event to date. 

The streaming giant hopes it serves as a marketing tool for “Bridgerton,” the second season of which becomes available on Friday, and appeals to the show’s primarily female fan base, which is often ignored when it comes to fan culture.

Can you hear me squealing?
