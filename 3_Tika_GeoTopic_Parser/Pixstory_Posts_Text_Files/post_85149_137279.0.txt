Renowned journalist Fabrizio Romano has addressed rumours linking Chelsea defenderReece James with a move away from the club to Real Madrid.

James is already one of the best defenders in Europe at a young age, which obviously
brings many clubs looking to acquire his services.

As per Daily Mail, some European giants like Manchester City and Real Madrid are
interested in getting the signature of the right-back.

However, Romano has cleared the air and said that the defender is all set to sign a newcontract with his current club and he’s never been close to joining Real Madrid despiterumours.

His new contract will see him become the highest-paid defender ever for the English club,which will run until 2028 June. Negotiations between both the parties are in the final stages,with Chelsea willing to add the option of extending his contract for a further year.

“Reece James new deal will be valid until June 2028 — Chelsea want to include an optionfor further season. Negotiations progressing to the final stage. #CFC He’s never been closeto joining Real Madrid, despite rumours,” he captioned.

The England international had to work his way through the academy system to make a namefor himself. James, who was loaned to Wigan in the 18/19 campaign, made his debut for theBlues the following season.

Since then, there has been no looking back as he has cemented his spot in the team. Thus,it gives him very little reason to force a move away from Stamford Bridge. While he is aregular starter at club level, he is yet to solidify his position in the England national team forthe upcoming World Cup later this year.

The defender has made 87 appearances for the London club, scoring 7 goals and providing14 assists. He already has a goal and one assist to his name in five games this season.
