The best thing about my college is its campus. I love to spend time on this campus. My college campus is so big. It has a huge area with ten buildings.College life is known as one of the most memorable years of one's life. It is entirely different from school life.In my college life, along with studying, I and my friends enjoyed a lot of other things. We traveled to lots of places, had new experiences, and learned manyÂ new things and explore everywhere .We keep a friendly and brotherhood environment on the campus. There is a big playground in the middle of all campus areas. We play cricket there very often. As a good cricketer, I never miss any cricket tournament here. Sometimes we play football too.Our teachers and seniors are really helpful and friendly on the campus. It is a peaceful environment to enjoy with your friends. There is a library building in the west zone. I spend most of my time there reading books. I love reading books. In the same building, there is a science lab. I go there too for the chemistry classes. Overall my college campus is good and beautiful. Everyone loves to spend time here.
