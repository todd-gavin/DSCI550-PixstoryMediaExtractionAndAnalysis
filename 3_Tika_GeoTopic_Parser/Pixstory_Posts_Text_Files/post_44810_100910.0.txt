West Ham United reportedly look close to selling two defenders, Issa Diop and Arthur Masuaku not in David Moyes’ plans.

According to an Ex-West Ham United employee, these departures look set to go through at the end of the season with new signings already in mind to come in as replacements.

With Diop and Masuaku on the way out of London Stadium, we could reportedly see Man City’s Nathan Ake and AZ Alkmaar’s Owen Wijndal targeted to come in defence.

That would surely be some good business for West Ham United, who could do with upgrading a little after a promising season ended on a bit low.

The Hammers looked a bit serious shout to finish fourth at one point, and also made it to the semi-finals of the Europa League, but ultimately fell short.

Replacing the unconvincing Diop and Masuaku with Ake and Winjdal, they could be in a much better position next season.

What is the latest news involving Diop and Masuaku?

According to Claret and Hugh, West Ham could sell Masuaku for a 5 million euros deal when the transfer window opens.

The 28-year-old who joined the Hammers, for 6 million euros from Olympiakos back in 2016, has started just five league games and has had some serious injury issues during his time in East London.

As for Diop, The Sune claims he could also be axed as West Ham eyes up a move for Nottingham Forest defender Joe Worrall.

Should West Ham sell Diop and Masuaku?

If Moyes wants to then yes, but he needs some additional replacement for it. There is a good chance that the Hammers will be in Europe again in the next season, as they are currently seventh in the table.

They sold Sebastian Haller to Ajax over a year ago and have not replaced him yet, which has arguably cost them in their Champions League run.
