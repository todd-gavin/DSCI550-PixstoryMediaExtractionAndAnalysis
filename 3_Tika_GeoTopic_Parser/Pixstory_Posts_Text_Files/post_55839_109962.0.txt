People often come across Maria Tumarkin’s work by chance, but end up loving her and her writing style!

Traumascapes is an exploration of the fates of places that are marked by violence and loss, and the ways in which those places can hold that trauma for years afterwards. 

Her most recent book, Axiomatic, takes as its starting point different axioms: Give Me a Child Before the Age of Seven and I’ll Give You the Woman, You Can’t Enter The Same River Twice, etc. The book asks, fundamentally, how do we speak about the past? 

As per critics, using the axioms, Tumarkin forces us to grapple with how we tell the stories of our pasts, how we incorporate the past into our present. With Axiomatic, Tumarkin cemented her place as one of Australia’s best and most unflinching writers of creative non-fiction.
