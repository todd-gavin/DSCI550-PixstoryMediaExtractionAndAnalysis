When evaluating between the ICE vehicles and Electric vehicles one looks both the pollution being emitted during the driving time and during the manufacturing process The pollution caused by ICE vehicles isn t limited to the exhaust coming from their tailpipes The process of extracting oil refining it into fuel and transporting it to gas stations also generates a large amount of air pollution These emissions are given the name of well to wheel emissions These emissions severely impact the environment The production of Electric vehicles on the other hand prove to be more taxing on the environment than the ICE vehicles Thus one would assume that the electric vehicles generate the same or more pollution that the ICE vehicles However Electric vehicles still prove to be the cleaner option since their entire lifecycle is more sustainable overall
