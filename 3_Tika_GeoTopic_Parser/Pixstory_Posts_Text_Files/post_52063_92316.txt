You know how it hurts to hold a smile for too long Well that s because like many human facial expressions smiles rely on certain tiny facial muscles that can flex fast but tire quickly It now appears that dogs also have lots of these kinds of muscles in their faces too And this could be what helps dogs communicate with humans and why we find them so expressive and appealing researchers say The team led by Anne Burrows of Duquesne University in Pittsburgh previously found that fast twitching muscles above the eyebrows are what enables dogs to put on their famous puppy dog eyes That s the slightly worried vulnerable look that dogs get that makes us want to go Awww so cuute come and let me look after you Someone described it as a way of hijacking our emotions Dr Burrows said And it certainly works in dog shelters In their new study Dr Burrows and colleagues have looked further afield than the eyebrows and found there are a lot more fast twitching muscles in dogs faces These muscles also create other facial expressions that get us to pay attention to dogs It s all about the dog human bond said Dr Burrows who presented her preliminary findings at a scientific meeting held in Philadelphia this week Fast twitching muscles around the mouth are also important for the short sharp movements required in barking which is another tool dogs use to communicate with humans Dogs bark to be playful to protect their territory and warn us of intruders Dr Burrows said By contrast wolves which are essentially the undomesticated ancestors of dogs tend to howl rather than bark and it s to communicate with other wolves not humans Dr Burrows found wolves have relatively few fast twitching facial muscles and more slow twitching ones These are more suitable for howling which require facial muscles to contract for a long time she said Dogs only tend to howl in response to something like a fire engine or a musical instrument it s definitely not the norm
