A study of 300 top US companies published by the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) found the average gap between CEO and median worker pay jumped to 670-to-1. The ratio was up from 604-to-1 in 2020. Forty-nine firms had ratios above 1,000-to-1.

‌The wage gap between chief executives and workers at some of the US companies with the lowest-paid staff grew even broader last year, with CEOs earning an average of $10.6m, while the median worker received $23,968.

The report, titled Executive Excess, comes amid a tide of unionization efforts among low wage workers and the growing attention to the huge share buyback programs many corporations have been using to inflate their share prices.

 US companies declared plans to buy back more than $300bn of their shares in the first quarter of the year and Goldman Sachs has estimated that buybacks could top $1tn in 2022.

Share-related income makes up the largest portion of senior executive compensation and as buybacks generally improve a company’s share price, they also boost executive pay. Senator Elizabeth Warren has called buybacks “nothing but paper manipulation” designed to increase executive pay.


This report offers several policy solutions, including actions president Joe Biden, could take without the help of Congress. “The president could wield the power of the public purse by introducing new standards making it hard for companies with huge CEO-worker pay gaps to land a lucrative federal contract,” an expert said. The report also instructs Biden to ban top executives at federal contractors from peddling their stock for a multi-year period after a buyback.
