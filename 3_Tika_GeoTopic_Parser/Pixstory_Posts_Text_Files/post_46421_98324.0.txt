They say " keep yourself busy in order to avoid depression " but has anyone ever told you what you should do when it hits you up at 11 in the morning while you are in a meeting or class and you try your best to stay focused but you miserably fail ??🙃

When you are there laughing so hard with your friends but suddenly it hits you and your mind goes blank and then you can't utter a single word ?? How can you be at a party singing your heart out when suddenly that special song comes in and you cant help yourself but tearing unconsciously ?? or even having your headphones on while studying and it comes on shuffle so you just drop what you were doing and stare blankly ??🥲🙃

Even your daily conversations with people , it reminds you of an inside joke or even a certain moment that you can't get over it since then . How could you stay busy with a mind full of memories ?? and what about the coincidence that you can’t even control ??🙃

Do not do that to yourself because at some point , you'll lose control and you wont be able to gather yourself up again . Break down , cry or even scream . 😩🤭

Grab a paper and write down what you feel then burn it . Pour your heart out the way you want , but please do not pressure yourself until you are whole again . ✨

Busy wasn't ever a solution so do not be harsh on yourself . And believe me , nobody ever knows what it feels like to have 2 people struggling inside of you .🥲❌

And for those who advise us to stay busy , i bet you once were broken too , that being busy didn't help enough . I bet you lost control before you got yourself busy ; because it mattered to you ."✨🤍
