The drama of ABC TV s eight part s set series Barons is interrupted by repeated sunkissed montages that have a ruminative feel as if the narrative is collecting its breath as is the case with many surfing themed films and shows The Guardian says that in these scenes which juxtapose board riding individuals against wide blue ocean and glittering skies time seems to stand still offering pleasant vibes and a particular benefit for production design no need for era specific costumes or decor on the waves Officially the series follows a group of entrepreneurial surfers whose stories loosely parallel the formation of Australian surfing brands such as Rip Curl and Quiksilver It was created by Michael Lawrence John Molloy and Liz Doran Are you going to watch Barons
