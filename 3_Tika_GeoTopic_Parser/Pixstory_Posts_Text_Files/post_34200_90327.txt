Interviewed by The Telegraph Mason Mount wanted to send a message to his Chelsea teammate Jorginho who has just been eliminated with Italy from the World Cup in Qatar Don&#39;t make fun of Jorginho for what happened to Italy It&#39;s hard for me to see that a teammate I played with the last few years have gone through such a situation We all know how much hard work it takes to get there how disappointing it is not to be there I actually texted him right away keep my head up you have had a crazy season and I hope we can win many more trophies together in these months
