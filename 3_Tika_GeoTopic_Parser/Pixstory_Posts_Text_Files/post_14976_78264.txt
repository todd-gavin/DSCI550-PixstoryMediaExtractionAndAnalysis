Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive neoplasms characterized by a high mortality also because it is among the least responsive to treatment A new study coordinated by the University of Verona thanks to a multidisciplinary team involving numerous research groups has now demonstrated how an approach aimed at reprogramming the tumor microenvironment can favor the response of cells to immunotherapy treatments The research entitled Interrupting the nitrosative stress fuels tumor specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in pancreatic cancer was published in the scientific journal Journal for Immunotherapy of cancer and sees as first author and correspondent Francesco De Sanctis researcher of the department of Medicine and Vincenzo Bronte director of the Immunology section as senior author and correspondent Funding were the Cariverona Foundation the Airc the national PRIN call the Cancer Research Institute and the Euronanomed III of Madrid We discovered that pancreatic cancer recruits preferentially myeloid immune cells with high immunosuppressive capacity at the expense of T lymphocytes promoting an immunological state incapable of impeding tumor progression researchers explain Tumor infiltrating myeloid cells contribute to generating a highly hostile environment for lymphocyte entry and function T with anti-tumor activity through Arginase ARG and nitric oxide synthase NOS These two enzymes metabolize arginine producing high quantities of oxygen and nitrogen radical compounds such as peroxynitrites which cause a rapid and progressive accumulation of nitrotyrosines in the tumor microenvironment Nitrotyrosines generate a chemical barrier which hinders the entry of lymphocytes into the tumor by supporting a state of progressive immunosuppression To counteract this resistance to treatments, the group used a recently developed ARG and NOS inhibitor called AT demonstrating that it can reprogram the tumor microenvironment from pro-tumor to anti-tumor in vivo Administration of AT in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer reduces the infiltration and suppressive ability of myeloid cells and promotes lymphocyte entry into the tumor supporting the efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy of cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for the tumor antigen telomerase
