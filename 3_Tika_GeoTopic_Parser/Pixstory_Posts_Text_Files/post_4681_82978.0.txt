I grew up watching some of the greatest slam dunk artists in the world.

Shawn Kemp was one of my favorites, because he was freaky athletic and dunked so powerfully. Plus, he seemed so nonchalant about everything. It made his dunks look effortless.

Dominique Wilkins just jumped so high on every dunk. His limbs are long and he would windmill the ball so far around and then dunk hard on the rim like a sledgehammer.

Kenny “Sky” Walker was my biggest inspiration, because I felt as if we jumped alike, and he did a lot of 360s. He swung and whirled the ball about, kicking his legs and dunking aggressively. That’s why I liked doing those 360s on a 6-foot-high rim back in the 1990s when I was in elementary school.

I also drew inspiration from my dad. One day my dad and I were shooting baskets with a volleyball. I begged him to dunk it. Even though he was exhausted from a day of construction work, he dunked it hard, all his limbs outstretched. The impact ripped open his finger and he began to bleed. Despite the injury, I was just in awe that he had dunked the ball. I thought the whole thing was so cool.

Today, my fondness for dunking remains, but on a much higher plane. I study dunks, so that makes me a dunk scientist. Or you might say I’m a dunkologist.

So when I watch the NBA’s annual slam dunk contest – the next one is scheduled to take place at 8 p.m. EST on Saturday, Feb. 19, 2022 – I won’t be looking just to be entertained. As chair of the technical committee for the World Dunk Association – a group formed in 2020 to build more appreciation for the slam dunk – I’ll be looking to improve upon a new system we have developed offering a more scientific approach toward how judges score slam dunks.
