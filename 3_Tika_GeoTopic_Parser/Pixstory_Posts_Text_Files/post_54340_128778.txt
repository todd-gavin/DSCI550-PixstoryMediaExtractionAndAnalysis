The ocean floor is famously less explored than the surface of Mars And when our team of scientists recently mapped the seabed and ancient sediments beneath we discovered what looks like an asteroid impact crater Intriguingly the crater named Nadir after the nearby volcano Nadir Seamount is of the same age as the Chicxulub impact caused by a huge asteroid at the end of the Cretaceous period around million years ago which wiped out the dinosaurs and many other species The finding published in Science Advances raises the question of whether the crater might be related to Chicxulub in some way If confirmed it would also be of huge general scientific interest as it would be one of a very small number of known marine asteroid impacts and so give unique new insights into what happens during such a collision The crater was identified using seismic reflection as part of a wider project to reconstruct the tectonic separation of South America from Africa back in the Cretaceous period Seismic reflection works in a similar manner to ultrasound data sending pressure waves through the ocean and its floor and detecting the energy that is reflected back This data allows geophysicists and geologists to reconstruct the architecture of the rocks and sediments Scrolling through this data at the end of we came across a highly unusual feature Among the flat layered sediments of the Guinea Plateau west of Africa was what appeared to be a large crater a little under km wide and several hundred metres deep buried below several hundred metres of sediment Many of its features are consistent with an impact origin including the scale of the crater the ratio of height to width and the height of the crater rim The presence of chaotic deposits outside of the crater floor also look like ejecta material expelled from the crater immediately following a collision Read more
