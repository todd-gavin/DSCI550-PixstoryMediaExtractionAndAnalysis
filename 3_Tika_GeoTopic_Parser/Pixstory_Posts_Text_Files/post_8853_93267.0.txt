An experiment in Dyarchy and it's failure continues .....

At my suggestion the Central P. W. D. was entrusted with the task of building a bridge over the Ravi and constructing a tarred road to Jammu. They were helped in this by the Sappers and Miners of the Indian army. The road was still incomplete when I left the State. Mr. Sharma, the Superintending Engineer, did 
splendid work in this connection. Till the bridge was built, I suggested a Baile bridge over the Ravi to facilitate movement of armed 
vehicles and military lorries and other traffic. I undertook a number of trips in my jeep on this road to ensure speedy and smooth progress of the work. The airfield at Jammu was also covered with wire netting so that it could be used in all kinds of weather. 

The quickest way from India to Jammu was by air and this required an all weather airfield. I requested the army authorities to supplement transport by lorries with mules as the terrain of the countryside was such that motor vehicles could not always negotiate its difficult parts easily.
