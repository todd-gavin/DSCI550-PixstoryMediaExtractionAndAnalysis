#7 Aleksandar Tirnanic (Yugoslavia) – 18 years 365 days

The late Aleksander Tirnanic played a massive part in Yugoslavia's success in internationalfootball and represented at the highest football stage.

#6 Lionel Messi (Argentina)- 18 years 358 days
The biggest name in football history came close to winning the 2014 World Cup, but it wasn'tin his fate. He was criticised for not winning an international trophy; ultimately, he won the
Copa America in 2021. However, winning a World Cup still remains an ambition to cap off his
career in a beautiful way.
Lionel Messi wrote his name in the World Cup history book when he netted his first goal in
the 2006 World Cup at 18 years and 358 days, becoming the sixth youngest player.
#5 Dmitri Sychev (Russia)- 18 years 232 days
