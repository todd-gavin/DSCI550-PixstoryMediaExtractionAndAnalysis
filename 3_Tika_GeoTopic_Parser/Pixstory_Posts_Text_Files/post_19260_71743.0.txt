Like we previously discussed the importance about a certain role/position in football, now let us read something about being a cult hero.

Marcelo Brozovic of Croatia, coming from all the struggles while he was a kid to make it big in the game is something we all are here for. Another central defensive midfielder who is a strict professional and a tremendous performer, whenever he sets his feet on the pitch, he is the sort of midfielder who can suit himself to various roles and in various formations, in short he is his manager's go to guy. 

He has been making his worth known in Serie A and also created a wonderful and deadly partnership with Luka Modric (another magician) for his country and it's fairytale run during the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Brozovic did not get it spoon fed and easy coming in his journey to the top. Like most of the footballers, he did struggle to adapt to life in Italy with the Nerazzurri. But his peak came to light when Antonio Conte joined Inter. Brozovic, like I said earlier, became Conte's go-to guy for the midfield role. Considering all the injuries during the early phase of the season, Conte decided to use him in various positions in the midfield and yes, Brozovic came out with flying colours. 

So good that he became a vital part of the eleven and the first name on the team sheet can be said. All of which resulted in a title triumph come the end of the season.

Such stories attached with a defensive midfielder, is certainly something I adore after goalkeepers, which is my favourite position to play in.
