A paradoxical situation led Dorna to cancel all MotoGP track activity on Friday in Argentina&#39;s free practice and to reschedule all or almost all sessions to Saturday with a maxi program which for the MotoGP includes reduced PL PL PL and Qualifying over a period of of ten hours alternating with Moto and Moto The reason The war in Ukraine stopped the transport planes that are Russian and two aircraft that broke down on the way from Indonesia to Argentina had to make a stopover in Mombasa in Kenya without being able to be replaced A team has been sent to repair them but if that is not possible it could even miss the entire weekend as stated by Dorna CEO Carmelo Ezpeleta
