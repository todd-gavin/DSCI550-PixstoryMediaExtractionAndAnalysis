Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said the Aam Aadmi Party will 'quit politics' if civic body elections are held on time and if the Bharatiya Janata Party wins the polls. His statement came amid a row over postponement of Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) elections after the union cabinet gave its nod to The Delhi Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Act, 2022 - a bill that proposes to merge three municipal corporations in Delhi.
The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was the favorite to win the elections on the account of their landslide victory in Punjab and its anti corruption agenda. According to AAP the desicion of merger of the municipal bodies and the delay of the elections was just an excuse for the BJP as it was fearful that it might face defeat in the upcoming polls. As things stand the AAP might win the elections anyway. Winning the MCD elections will give the party even greater powers to establish their welfare model in more areas and will cement its position as a serious and major competition in the short as well as in the long term. 

The Union Cabinet on Tuesday approved the Delhi Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Act 2022 which is seeking to merge the three municipal bodies that Delhi has into one. This desicion has come after the Election Commission decision to postpone the MCD elections. The Election Commission did this in the in the view of the Center's intent to unify the three municipal bodies. The calls for the unification had been longstanding but the timing of the move, just a few days before the originally planned date of the MCD elections has left many thinking that wether this is a last ditch attempt of the BJP to curb the dominance of the AAP in Delhi.
