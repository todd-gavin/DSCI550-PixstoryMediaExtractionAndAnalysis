Arsenal are keeping close tabs on Man United superstar Marcus Rashford, sources have told Football Insider.
The 24-year-oldâ€™s Old Trafford future is up in the air with his contract due to expire next summer
United have the option to extend that deal by 12 months to protect the value of the forward but have yet to do so.
That is providing encouragement to suitors including Arsenal, who registered their interest in Rashford earlier this year before completing the marquee capture of Gabriel Jesus from Man City
The United academy product has shown signs of recovering his best form this season after a wretched 2021-22.
He has scored three goals and provided two assists in seven Premier League appearances so far this term.
