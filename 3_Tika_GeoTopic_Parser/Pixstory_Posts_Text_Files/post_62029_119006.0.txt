After an entire year of trying to sign the 23-year-old defender, Jules Kounde is still a Sevilla player. Chelsea have worked effortlessly in securing a deal for Kounde since the last summer transfer window. 

At this point, the two clubs have yet to come to an agreement on a fee. There have been several rumours indicating that Sevilla would accept a Â£56 million bid, but Chelsea are no longer the front runner in the player's preference.

It's between the Blues and of course, Barcelona, are in the race to sign Kounde. The rumours are up and down the scale and quite frankly, it's hard to keep up. 

One minute Chelsea and Sevilla are on the same page, the next, Barcelona are confident in signing the Frenchman. The Chelsea fanbase are rather fed up with the back and forth and I for one would rather just move on.
