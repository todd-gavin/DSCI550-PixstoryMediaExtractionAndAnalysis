On September 18th each year, a day dedicated to cheeseburgers is observed. Since the beginning of the Roaring 20s era, this annual celebration of one of the most famous and delectable cuisines in the USA has been held. Though its plain cousin, the hamburger, was probably created in the United States around 1900, it's thought that the addition of cheese didn't come about until 1924. Several restaurant brands, including Burger King, Slater's 50/50, Farmer Boy, Jack in the Box, Red Robin, White Castle, and many more, have previously offered complimentary or cheap cheeseburgers. To find out what kind of deals are being offered at your neighbourhood burger establishment during National Cheeseburger Day, just check online or go there.Source: DOY
