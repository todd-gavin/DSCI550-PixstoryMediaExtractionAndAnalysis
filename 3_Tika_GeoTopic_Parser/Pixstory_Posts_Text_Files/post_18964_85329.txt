From Salernitana to Salernitana Lautaro Martinez is back and he did it again as in the first leg against the last-placed grenade He hadn&#39;t scored for some time last night he made three after hitting the crossbar that seemed to indicate another difficult evening from the point of view realization Instead in the end he brought the ball home for the three goals he scored The victory was missing the team needed to score today We have scored five today and we are happy I personally experienced a difficult moment because a striker lives to score goals Today I I was lucky enough to score three goals I took to the field with a lot of desire and a lot of anger because it was an important match for us and an important period for Inter Lautaro Martinez did not hide his difficult period at the end of the game These three goals I dedicate to my daughter When I hit the crossbar I said to myself it was still not a match But my team mates were good at looking for space Barella was very good I have to thank my team mates who have always been close to me Criticism is part of the game When we win everything is easy when we lose we have to fight to win again I thank the fans who have been by our side and the coach and team-mates who play less it all starts from them
