If I have one childhood fear, it is the western brown snake! 

It is also called gwardar and the majority of mainland Australia is home to this species, with the exception of the wetter borders of eastern Australia and south-western Western Australia, where it is missing. 

Although the western brown snake is thought to be less aggressive than its eastern cousin, it nonetheless belongs to the group of snakes that kill the most people in Australia. 

As per experts, western browns typically have a quick and jittery temperament. When startled, they will flee for cover before quickly escaping if they are cornered and striking. 

Despite having less poisonous venom than the eastern brown, they have three times the potency. Due to the thin fang marks, bites are frequently painless and concealed. The victims will feel severe coagulopathy (blood clotting condition), headache, nausea, and possibly abdominal pain.

So safe to say, there is a high chance of death if you come across a western brown snake! So, watch out!
