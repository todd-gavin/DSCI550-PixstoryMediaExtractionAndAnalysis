One of World's best comic, superhero and movie. Batman has never failed to impress in any aspect. As they announced Rober Pattionson as the new batman people were going crazy for it. Everybody was very excited to see this new version of Batman. In the movie they tried to give the storyline and the Batman franchise a fresh start. Without putting much light on the origin of the story and focusing on the "World's Greatest Detective" aspect, we're seeing a side of Batman that has never fully been explored on screen before. Throw in some heavy film-noir vibes and a richly-detailed Gotham underworld, and Reeves has delivered an exhilarating spin on the character.They have shown how Batman as Superhero and saviour of Gotham fights back for the city despite of receiving so much hate by the government and some citizens. It's not fair to judge the movie against other Batman movies, because it's a new start of the storyline and they have tried to create a base plot to establish the whole storyline. The upcoming sequels will have a better way of depicting the story with more intensity. Overall its one of the best superhero movies of all time and also in the Batman franchise.
