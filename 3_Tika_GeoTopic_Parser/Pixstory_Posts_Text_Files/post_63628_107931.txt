Square Enix have just released the trailer for the new Final Fantasy remake project Enix have also revealed during a livestream celebrating the th anniversary of the world renowned Japanese fantasy RPG that the second part titled Rebirth would be the second in what is planned to be a three part trilogy From the looks of it the remake seems to be dope while the trilogy will be positioned as a chapter in the greater Final Fantasy Compilation in the recently announced Crisis Core Final Fantasy Reunion due for the winter of this fall As the middle chapter Rebirth is going to have some of the most extreme consequences for the narrative of the next game as the middle chapter is always used for the build up so time will tell how things will go Though things really do look dope The trailer shows Cloud and Sephiroth walking like a model in some lush vegetation and asks the question What is Sephiroth s endgame This whole trailer in summary is one giant question mark as to what can happen Possibilities are endless so let us hope that FF Rebirth goes smoothly so we can get to the third part quickly Hopefully that won t be too long as devs have already begun working on it
