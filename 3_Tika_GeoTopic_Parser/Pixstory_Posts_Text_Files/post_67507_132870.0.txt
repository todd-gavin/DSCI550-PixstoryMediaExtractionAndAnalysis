IRCTC: Now Order Food On Train Via WhatsApp
If you are someone who travels long distances in trains, then you know how important it is to have a good backup for food. We carry dry food, snacks and often full-fledged meals during such travels. But it often gets hectic to stock so much food at one go. Much agreeable? What if we say, you do not need to carry extra food now; instead, you can just order fresh meals while travelling by train. You heard us! Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) food delivery service Zoop helps you get hot food at the station, from your desired food joint. Recently, IRCTC made the ordering process yet easier. Reportedly, Zoop has collaborated with Jio Hapik to provide more convenient food delivery services on trains, via WhatsApp.
Hapik shared a video on YouTube, sharing the news and explaining how to order food via WhatsApp. You can watch the video here.
As per the video, a chat bot will be available on WhatsApp which will help the passenger order food using their PNR number. It offers real-time tracking, customer care, and more. 
Now you can enjoy fresh food on your journey!
