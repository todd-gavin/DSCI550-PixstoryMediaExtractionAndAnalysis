Asking to boycott the movie, a Twitter user wrote, “Don’t forget this film is also produced by Karan johar who hates Hindi culture and listen carefully Vijay’s words he didn’t care about anything so we must be unite this time also for boycott his upcoming movie.”😱😱💯
And yet, an upcoming film that has still managed to give people an added reason to boycott it, is Vijay Deverakonda and Ananya Panday’s Liger which will be seen hitting the screens on 25th August 🎬

The trend started after Vijay supported actor Aamir Khan and his latest box office failure, Laal Singh Chaddha.In an interview with India Today,Vijay stated, “When you decide to boycott a film, you are not only affecting Aamir Khan, you are affecting thousands of families who lose work and livelihoods. Aamir Sir is someone who pulls the crowd to the theatres. I am not sure why this boycott call is happening, but for whatever misunderstanding, this is happening, please realise you are not affecting Aamir Khan alone but the economy.” 😮😱🎬🎬

After the glorious failure of a movie like Laal Singh Chaddha, which seemingly had everything - from a killer cast to a strong script and more than enough promotions, one thing is clear and that is if people decide to kill a movie, they will legit do that, irrespective of the logic behind their reasons. 😱☹️😮😮

Vijay said on Monday that he stands with truth and on issue of boycott trending on social media,he asserted that he’s not scared of anything as he had faced a lot in life. He said he trusts God and has the blessings of his mother.“I have struggled a lot to reach here,”the Liger said here during a promotional tour.“I fought for money and respect. I also fought to get work. Before the release of my first film, I didn’t have much money and I even worked free of cost.” 🎥🎥🎥
Vijay said that when it feels you are right, there is no need to listen to anybody. Sharing his love for the country, Vijay added that he is not someone to sit in front of computers and tweet. ❌❌❌
