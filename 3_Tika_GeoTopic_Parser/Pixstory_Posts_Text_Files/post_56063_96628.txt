Many dramas and works of fiction signify that the human condition is essentially absurd which can only be represented by absurdist works of literature It has roots in movements like surrealism and expressionism After world war the disillusionment was so high that there was a rebellion against the traditional values and cultures which resulted in many moments including absurd literature They are cut off from the religious transcendental roots and all the actions of the protagonist become senseless and absurd like the human existence in this partially intelligible universe Humankind in this view is left feeling hopeless bewildered and anxious The ideas that inform the plays also dictate their structure Absurdist playwrights therefore did away with most of the logical structures of traditional theatre There is little dramatic action as conventionally understood however frantically the characters perform their busyness serves to underscore the fact that nothing happens to change their existence One of the major examples of absurd theatre includes Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett It is about the endless wait of an unidentified person called Godot and at the end the waiting becomes fruitless and he never shows up and even not whether is there such a person Other examples of absurdist Theatre include The Bald Soprano by Eugene Ionesco Rosencrantz Guildenstern Are Dead by Tom Stoppard
