Women's bodies don't do as well under
long, chronic periods of stress (daily 16+ hour fasting is a stressor on the body).

What we see happen first is that a woman's body will slow down the production of progesterone, which then leads to
estrogen dominance.

This can then show symptomatically as:

•Water retention

•Puffiness

•Cellulite

•Irritability

•Lower mood

•Adult-based acne

•Bloating, and more…


Therefore, it’s of utmost importance to regulate fasting schedule in a way to shorten the hours and to incorporate a healthier balanced diet to fulfill all the required vitamins and minerals.
