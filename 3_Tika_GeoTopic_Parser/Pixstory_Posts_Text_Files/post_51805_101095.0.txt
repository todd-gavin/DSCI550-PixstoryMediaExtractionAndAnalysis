With summer just around the corner, we’re shedding layers and incorporating colour and fun silhouettes into our looks. Take cues from the Korean fashion trends as the industry is gaining a solid reputation for being fashion-forward. Their fashion trends for 2022 provide many opportunities to experiment with new elements while showcasing some long-time staples that serve as a solid base for the hot season.

Matching sets have long been a favourite of the big fashion houses. It’s no surprise that K-pop stylists have embraced the style. Coordinating tops and bottoms is a fool-proof technique to look stylishly put together.

This fashion trend certainly adds a sense of elegance and luxury to otherwise ordinary apparel designs. Puffed sleeves have grown popular among Korean celebrities and have swept the country. This style is currently trendy in both dresses and shirts.

When it comes to Korean spring fashion trends for 2022, this one may appear to be the least novel. But denim shorts have been reinvented so many times over the last century. These shorts have been effectively incorporated into formal ensembles in Korea by stylists. They are the ideal spring/summer base piece, and you can explore a variety of outfits with just one piece. Find a way to mix and match anything from breezy blouses to fitted crop tops, oversized sweaters, and a good old graphic tee.
