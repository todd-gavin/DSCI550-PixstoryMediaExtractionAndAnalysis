Underwater torpedo, the list's newest sport, was created in 2017 by two retired Marine combat water-safety swimmers. Underwater football is played by two teams of five at the bottom of a deep pool. Players attempt to move a 10-inch "torpedo" into netting fixed to the defensive end of each team.The object of the game is to move the torpedo underwater and deposit it in the goal area without fouling. Three matches make up each game.
