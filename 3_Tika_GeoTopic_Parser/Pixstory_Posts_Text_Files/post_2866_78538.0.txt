On February 1 last year, Myanmar’s unsteady progress to democracy was halted when its military ousted the government of Aung Saan Suu Kyi. Citizens, however, have delivered a surprise. Having tested democracy after long decades of the Junta rule, they’ve been fighting for its restoration despite the army’s violent efforts to put down protests. A year later, the prospects of a return to democracy are not clear, though.

To mark the anniversary, pro-democracy activists plan a “silent strike” and have urged others to stay at home in daytime. The rulers have threatened sedition and terrorism charges against anyone who joins Tuesday’s protest: https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/31/myanmars-junta-threatens-protesters-planning-coup-anniversary-action

That is typical of the regime led by Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the military commander known as the Tatmadaw. He seized power, arresting Suu Kyi as well as leaders of her government and her party, National League for Democracy, which had won November 2020 elections. 

After winning independence from Britain in 1948, Myanmar was a democracy till 1962 when the military led by Gen Ne Win staged a coup d’etat. Suu Kyi, who spent years under house arrest (and won the Nobel peace prize in 1991 for leading the resistance), led her party to consecutive victories in polls held since 2011. 
 
The return of the military has been as surprising as the popular opposition against it, leading to a virtual civil war in which 1,500 people have been killed, 8,800 detained, and 300,000+ displaced: https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-no-peace-one-year-after-military-coup-1db3ac0e7b051098cd3268b8d16dcac4 The military has resorted to the kind of violence on masses that it had been perpetrating on the ethnic minority of Rohingya.

Suu Kyi, who as ‘state counselor’ (equivalent to prime minister) was cultivating a working relationship with the army, has been convicted of some of the grave charges the new rulers have slapped on her, and is likely to face a life sentence. That leaves the ‘uprising’ without any leader. Yet, activists have spontaneously created a network that has been sustaining protests.

Still, amid anarchy despite Covid-19 and economic hardships, in the absence of effective diplomacy by world powers, how long they can carry the torch is anybody’s guess.
