There are two versions regarding the origin of Mahagauri which means extremely fair As per the first story after Kaalratri had defeated Chanda Munda and Raktabija her skin had turned black Shiva on the advice of Brahma teased her by calling her kali dark skinned Enraged she prayed to Brahma to get her fair skin back Brahma advised her to bathe in the Mansarovar river When she did that her black skin separated from her body to become a female form Kaushiki and Parvati herself became fair again It was Kaushiki who eventually killed Shumbha Nishumbha thus bypassing their boon that no man demon god or deity could kill them Another version goes that when Parvati as Brahmacharini was undergoing intense tapas to please Shiva she got covered with dust and dirt After Shiva finally relented he bathed her in the river Ganga All the dirt from Parvati s skin was washed away in the water and the goddess emerged out of it with very fair skin The eighth day of Navratri is dedicated to Mahagauri and this year the colour of the day is peacock green
