A group of Afghan girls who study in secret classes have asked the world community not to forget their education.

In a letter sent to the Sunday Times, the girls wrote: "We are the only country on earth where secondary school girls can not go to school, let the world think about it."

The Sandy Times quoted one of those girls, 16-year-old Maryam, as saying: "I wanted to become president, not for position, wealth or fame, to build my country, to make Kabul beautiful like Paris, but now I can't go to school I'll go."

Maryam also added: "You may think that Afghan girls can live without dreams, but there are girls among us who want to become doctors, engineers and astronauts."

About a year has passed since the Taliban came to power, girls above grade six have been banned from going to school.
Although the Taliban have repeatedly said that the gates of schools will be opened for all female students, this has not happened.
Reopening schools and respecting women's rights and accepting women's freedoms are among the main conditions of the international community to recognize the Taliban regime.
