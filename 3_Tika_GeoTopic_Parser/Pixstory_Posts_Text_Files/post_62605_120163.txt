There s a viral foundation hack on many social media platforms doing rounds In this you take out some of your liquid foundation on a spoon take a lighter and heat the foundation and then apply it Tha claim is that it gives better coverage and glides more smoothly than it would otherwise But is that hack okay on your skin Have you ever wondered why every makeup product or any other drug for that matter comes with a warning to keep out of heat Store in a cool and dry place Ring a bell There s a reason for that it s not for nothing Extreme heat can cause formulas in the products to melt and the ingredients to separate So basically making your foundation pretty useless It gives a very cakey effect when on face and does not blend naturally Is that it Nope There s more things to be concerned about Most of the foundation uses several formulae and chemicals in them If approved they are safe to put on skin for small period of time or in a certain quantity When you heat it up you change the consistency of the foundation Especially if it has sunscreen in that Active ingredients tend to react to heat In my personal opinion it s a big NO Do not play with your skin or products like that Get a better foundation if yours doesn t give a good enough coverage
