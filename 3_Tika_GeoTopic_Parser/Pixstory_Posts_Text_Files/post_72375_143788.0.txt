Actor Sara Ali Khan was recently asked if she could play the role of her grandmother Sharmila Tagore in her biopic. The actor replied by saying that her grandmother is ‘too graceful’ and she doesn't know if she could fill in her shoes. Sara recently appeared on Roposo Live and was asked if she could play Sharmila on screen, Sara replied, “She's so graceful. I don't know if I'm graceful.” She added: "I speak to badi amma (grandmother) quite a lot, but I don't think I've actually spent much time speaking to her about her career as such. There are so many other things. She's so well-read, interested in current events, and has a great sense of general knowledge. She's such a classy lady and she's had such a life. She has world views and we've spent so much more time talking about that than actually her craft, which I think I should."Sharmila made her Bollywood debut in 1959 at the age of 14 with Satyajit Ray's acclaimed Bengali drama Apur Sansar. She later appeared in several hit films such as, Aradhana (1969), Safar (1970), Amar Prem (1972), Aavishkar (1974), Daag: A Poem of Love (1973), Tyaag (1977), and Raja Rani (1973).
