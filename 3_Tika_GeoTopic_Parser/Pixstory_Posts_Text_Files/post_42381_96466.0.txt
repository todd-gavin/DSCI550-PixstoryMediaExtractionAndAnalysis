After drawing the match against Lens by a scoreline of 1-1, Paris Saint Germain (PSG) wins the ‘Ligue 1’ league title but as a football fan I am not surprised at all because after bringing superstars like Sergio Ramos, Lionel Messi, Achraf Hakimi and Gianluigi Donnarumma in last summer transfer window, Nasser Al-Khelaifi’s (President of PSG) main target was to win the UEFA Champions League and that dream got shattered when Real Madrid beat them in Round of 16.

Winning the ‘Ligue 1’ title was never the topmost priority for the PSG’s board and Mauricio Pochettino (Manager) because they already knew that team of this quality will never fail to win the league. After all, the quality of playing 11 of the remaining 19 teams in the league is very low as compared to PSG.

Even before the start of the UEFA Champions League, PSG were the favorites to win the UCL because, in the last two seasons, PSG were the finalists in 2019-2020 and semi-finalists in the 2020-2021 season but because of a lack of team bonding and I don’t know why Manager was more reliable on individual brilliance and never worked on team performance.

The match against Real Madrid, where PSG got knocked out was the perfect example of team performance where, Real Madrid played like a team till the end and won the match and on the other hand, PSG had no clue on how to be compact and play as a team even when they are leading the match.

But, whatever is said and done, dominating the league throughout the season is no joke, and congratulations to all the players of PSG for winning the title, especially Sergio Ramos (my favorite footballer) and I hope, he plays well next season for PSG and helps them to win more titles.
