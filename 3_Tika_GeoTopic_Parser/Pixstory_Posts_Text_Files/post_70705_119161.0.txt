The manufacturer of electric vehicles disclosed last week that it has converted 75% of its Bitcoin holdings to cash.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday, Tesla stated that it had made a profit of $64 million (roughly Rs. 512 crore) from some sales of its Bitcoin holdings in addition to an impairment charge of $170 million (roughly Rs. 1,360 crore) against the carrying value of its Bitcoin holdings for the first half of the year. 

When an asset is no longer as valuable as it once was, it is said to have undergone a "impairment charge." Tesla stated when it bought its Bitcoin last year that it would review its BTC holdings on a quarterly basis to look for impairments.

Last week, Tesla sold $936 million (approximately Rs. 7,490 crore) worth of Bitcoin to increase its cash on hand following the closure of its Shanghai manufacturing due to the rising Covid-19 cases in China. The transaction amounts to almost 75% of the company's $1.5 billion (approximately Rs. 12,002 crore) in bitcoin that it started accumulating in Q1 2021.

According to a formal Form 10-Q filing with the SEC, the corporation realised a gain of about $64 million after selling 75% of its BTC stockpile for US Dollars in the second quarter (roughly Rs. 512 crore). We do know that Tesla did ultimately profit from its BTC acquisition in 2021, despite the fact that profits are only able to be documented after appreciated digital assets have been sold.
