 When one thinks of Kobe Bryant they imagine a tough competitor a ruthless machine but foremost they imagine a winner The Black Mamba was a true inspiration for us all showing us how hard work and dedication can overcome other factors and lead to success The Mamba had an insane work ethic He used to get up at am and start his day with a workout He dedicated his life to his craft and in turn ended up being one of the greatest ever to play the sport However it wasn t always this way for Kobe Just like the rest of us Bryant had his challenges and struggles In an interview Kobe once revealed how his dad helped him get through a very difficult childhood moment Growing up in Philadelphia Kobe knew he wanted to play basketball when he got older As a kid he went to a prominent summer league in Philly called the Sunny Hill league Just like any other or year old Kobe hit a rough patch He went scoreless the entire summer and that started to affect his morale and confidence Kobe recalled crying about it and being upset when his dad came and gave him a hug He then proceeded to tell Kobe Listen whether you score or you score I m going to love you no matter what Mamba recalls how that was the most important thing a parent could tell their child in the situation This gave him all the confidence in the world to fail However with Kobe being Kobe he decided to just go out there and score instead Having a parent support you like that is the best thing that can happen for a child Kobe used his dad s words to get the confidence he needed and put the work to go along with it On his birthday today we miss Mamba and we ll always use his words of wisdom to keep striving forward and getting better every day
