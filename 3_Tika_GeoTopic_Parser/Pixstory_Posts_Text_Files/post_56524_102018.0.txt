NFL-hall of famer and BYU graduate, Steve Young had a seemingly perfect life. But in his new book, QB: My Life Behind the Spiral, Young admits to suffering from anxiety disorder for much of his life. “At its root is this desperation, like, I gotta make something happen,” he said, in a television interview.

2. Donny Osmond-social anxiety disorder
Another local celebrity who suffers from social anxiety disorder, Donny Osmond has been battling social anxiety while performing since he was a child. It was in 1994 while performing in the lead role in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat that he realized he needed help.
