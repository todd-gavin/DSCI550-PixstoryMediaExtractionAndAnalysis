Bildungsroman is simply referred to as Coming of the Age Novels. This genre focus on the growth of an individual, mainly the protagonist on an intellectual and psychological level. The character realisation or change is an important factor in these novels. 

The plot conventionally develops around a naive person who goes in search of answers and finds the meaning of the world and his/her existence. The goal is maturity, and the protagonist achieves it gradually and with difficulty. Bildungsroman starts with the protagonist leaving the homeland into insecurities. Traditional Bildungsroman ends with a happy note. If the grand dreams of the hero’s youth are over, so are many foolish mistakes and painful disappointments, and, especially in 19th-century novels, a life of usefulness lies ahead. 

There are many examples including My Kinsman: Major Molineux, Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte, On Killing a Mocking Bird by Harper Lee, Little Women, by Louisa May Alcott, and The Kite Runner, by Khaled Hosseini, The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky and many more. 

Some subgenres of Bildungsroman include the Künstlerroman, a novel dealing with the formative years of an artist. 

 Erziehungsroman - the novel of upbringing 

Entwicklungsroman-novel of character development differ only slightly from the bildungsroman, and these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.
