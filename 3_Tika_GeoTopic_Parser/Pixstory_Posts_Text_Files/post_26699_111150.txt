The inspiration for the Spring Summer collection comes from Sandro Penna, a homosexual poet who lived in the times of Fascism whom Pasolini defined as scandalous but in a low voice. Penna is famous as a poet of awakenings and this same collection speaks of scandalous returns at dawn after a night of transgression.
