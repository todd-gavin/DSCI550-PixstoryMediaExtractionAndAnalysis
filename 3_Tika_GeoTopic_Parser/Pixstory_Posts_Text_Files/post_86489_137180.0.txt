Qatar Calling
Qatar controls about 13% of global oil reserves. The small population combined with the amount of petroleum production guarantees Qatar the title of richest country in the world.
Qatar has approximately 2.9 million people of which around 90% live in Doha, the capital. Foreign workers amount to around 88% of the population.
Qatar is a peninsula with a 563-km coastline jutting along the western coast of the Arabian Gulf. The country shares an 87 km land border with Saudi Arabia to the south. Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Iran are nearby.
The country is characterised by its flat and arid desertscape. Qatar has a desert climate with year-round sunshine, hot summers and mild winters. Average monthly temperatures range from 17°C in January to 36°C in July, sometimes reaching highs of 40°C+ during the summer months. Average annual rainfall is 70 mm per year, and falls in brief showers between October and March, rarely hindering outdoor activities.
Come and visit Qatar. The beautiful country awaits you.
