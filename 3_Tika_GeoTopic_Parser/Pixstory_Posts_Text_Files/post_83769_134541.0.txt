Have you ever been so hungry that you can’t think of anything but food? You might be really bored or just really hungry, but no matter what the reason is, food is the only thing on your mind. Sweet tooth is a common expression used to describe an intense desire for something sweet. So if you feel like eating nothing but sugar and other carbohydrate-based sweets, then you probably have a sweet tooth.
But everyone knows that sugar is bad for you. It’s empty calories, has no nutritional value and can lead to numerous health problems. So why do so many people love it so much? Because sugar tastes great. The human body craves sugar because it is the primary fuel source for our brains and central nervous system, as well as an excellent source of energy for when we need it most.
So Sweet tooth or not, we all have our moments. And whether you’re on a diet or not, it doesn’t hurt to indulge every once in a while.
