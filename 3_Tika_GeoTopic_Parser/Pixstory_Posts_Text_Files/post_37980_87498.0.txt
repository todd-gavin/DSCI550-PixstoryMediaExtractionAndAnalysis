The Tuskers have qualified for the 2021/22 Hero ISL finals courtesy of a 2-1 aggregate win in the Semi-finals against Jamshedpur FC

They will face the winners of the Hyderabad FC vs ATK Mohan Bagan game (tomorrow). 

This would be Kerala Blasters' third ISL finals. The Yellow's lost both the 2014 and the 2016 finals to ATK. Hence they would be looking to become the third South Indian team to win the ISL trophy when they step onto the field on Thursday. 



KBFC VS JFC second leg:

Kerala Blasters came into the second leg with a 1-0 advantage courtesy of a Salah Abdul Samad goal. 

The Blasters started the game positively and took the lead in the first half to get a 2-0 advantage in the tie. 

The ISL Shield winners did make a comeback in the second half but it was not to be. Pronay Halder scored a goal in the second half but Jamshedpur could not find a second as Owen Coyle's side crashed out of the competition. 


With fans available, KBFC will have a huge advantage over whoever they face in the finals on Sunday. It has to be seen if they can finally get their hands on the ISL trophy!
