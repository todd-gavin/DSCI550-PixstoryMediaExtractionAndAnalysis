Delhi Metro has taught me an important lesson. During class 12, metro travel was my most fantasized aspect of college life. The thought of daily travel inside the beautiful AC coaches and owning a metro card was enough to make me happy.
Fast forward to my second year of college, metro travel has become the most strenuous and time-taking part of my college life. With so much on my shoulders now, the travel feels like a waste of time and has become the most important reason for my absence in college.
Our planning might not work as we think. The thought of future pulls us away from the present. Let's not do it to ourselves:)
