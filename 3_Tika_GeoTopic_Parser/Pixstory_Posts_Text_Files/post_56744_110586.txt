It might be safe to assume that the Los Angeles Lakers would have been much worse if LeBron James wasn t on the roster last season For the most part James kept them alive averaging his highest point total since his third year in the league in what was an otherwise disappointing season for the Lakers The season was all about adaptation for LeBron At times he played center then point guard then forward then offered tips while on the bench It was all about making the fit work between Russell Westbrook Anthony Davis and himself Inconsistency and injuries hurt those chances but rarely did James falter in confidence He became eager about improving the team throughout the season But after a February loss to the Milwaukee Bucks James seemed to give in saying they can t currently reach the Bucks championship level As the Lakers struggled throughout the season James scoring never fell off It became one of the best statistical seasons of his career with the scoring title well in sight He scored over points in of the team s games between December and January including a point outburst against the Portland Trail Blazers That point total wasn t even the most memorable like when he passed Karl Malone for second on the All Time scoring list or highest like when he scored against the Golden State Warriors in March James energy during the season became huge motivation too for the losing side Injuries though caught up with LeBron as he missed the third most games of his career Leading in the MVP race before injuries it wouldn t have been a surprise if James had brought home another trophy While LeBron s ridiculous consistency at age still wasn t enough to push the Lakers into the Play In Game however he didn t view the season as a failure With a full offseason James will surely be prepared to run it back in He finished this past season averaging points rebounds and assists showing he still has a lot left in the tank
