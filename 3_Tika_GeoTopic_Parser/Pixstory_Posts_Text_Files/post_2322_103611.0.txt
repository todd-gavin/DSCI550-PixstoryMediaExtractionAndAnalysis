Kudos to former Bihar chief minister and union minister Lalu Prasad's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) for nominating a poor woman to the state legislative council.

Munni Devi alias Munni Rajak, a Dalit woman who makes a living by washing clothes in Bakhtiyarpur village of Nalanda district in Bihar, is the RJD candidate for the state legislative council elections. 

This is a very good initiative towards women empowerment and other political parties too should follow suit. 

Rajak was shocked to hear about her nomination. "I don't have a mobile. Laluji has given me such a huge gift. Initially, I was scared," she said after her name was announced. 

The move was hailed on the social media. Netizens praised the RJD and Tejashwi Yadav for nominating her to the Upper House in the Bihar assembly. 

A Twitter user informed that Lalu's son Tej Pratap has announced to make a film on him as her story is encouraging. 

She runs a road-side laundry, washing and ironing clothes. Munni Devi was spotted by the RJD leadership when she staged a protest against the Central Bureau of Investigating (CBI) for raiding Laluâ€™s bungalow. She later became a member of the RJD's shouting brigade. Not only did she participate in all the party protests and agitation programmes, she never missed to attend the welcome processions of Lalu Prasad in Patna.

The RJD top brass sent a vehicle to bring her to 10, Circular Road, the residence of Tejashwi Yadav, where she was handed over papers to file nominations as the RJD candidate for Bihar legislative council for which the elections will be held on June 20.

This is indeed a welcome move by the RJD and hope other political parties also walk the talk and make serious efforts to empower women, especially those belonging to the underprivileged sections of the society.
