Whole night, slept in a Tent. Blowing, chilling wind outside..
In the morning, you wake up by listening to Chirping of birds, sounds of monkeys from the Jungle .. ..
Along with your best friends, a fresh cold breeze to accompany you.. you open your eyes and get amazed by this beautiful surroundings...
This the most beautiful morning for me till today :)
