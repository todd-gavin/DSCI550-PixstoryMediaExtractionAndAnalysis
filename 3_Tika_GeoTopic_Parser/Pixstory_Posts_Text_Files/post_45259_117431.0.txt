Scottish Premiership side Rangers FC have completed the signing of English defender Ben Davies from Liverpool FC on a permanent deal until 2026. They will pay a guaranteed sum of £3 Million (plus £1 Million add-ons) for the player. 

Defender Ben Davies is a Furness Rovers academy product and made a name for himself in Preston U18. It was only in February 2021 that he made his big move to Liverpool FC but unfortunately he did not get many opportunities there and he was instantly loaned away to Sheffield United. In the 21/22 season, Davies played a total of 21 matches for Sheffield United and managed to score one goal for them. 

Rangers have made some significant signings in this transfer window ahead of the 2022-23 season. They have already signed Rabbi Matonda from Schalke, Antonio Colak from Salonika and Tom Lawrence and John Souttar on a free transfer and the addition of Ben Davies to that strengthens their team further. 

Last season, Calvin Bassey, Connor Goldson, Borna Barišić and James Tavernier were former Rangers’ 4-men defence. The addition of Ben Davies will definitely increase the competition for the defensive positions. Besides being a centre-back, Ben Davies can also play as a left-back if required. 

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was full of praise for Ben Davies on being asked about his departure to Rangers. He has said that it is an extremely smart signing for them, 

“It’s a smart piece of recruitment from Giovanni van Bronckhorst, to be honest. Perfect for all parties. He has himself an accomplished defender, who is entering his peak years and whose character is top drawer,” Klopp said. 

“We wish Ben nothing but the success he deserves and will be following from here as he goes on to make many achievements during the rest of his career,” he concluded.
