Liverpool somehow managed to sneak through to the quarter finals of the Champions league inspite of suffering defeat against a spirited Inter side at Anfield Inter entered this game knowing that they had to score at least goals if they wanted to take the game to extra time They were facing an herculean task of sorts because in previous European games Liverpool have always progressed to the next round after winning away from home in the first leg Against all odds it was the visitors who began as the dominant side with them confidently manouvering the ball skillfully opening gaps in the Liverpool defence with their slick movements and true touches and more alarmingly for the hosts Inter were easily bypassing their counterpress which is as rare as sighting Halley s comet All that was missing from Inter was the final touch In a game that Liverpool could really not afford to lose focus and concentration they were strangely a little off color Even then they did manage to create two clear goal scoring opportunities with Matip and Salah both hitting the woodwork A team like Inter cannot be left in with a chance and failure to convert those chances did exactly that and Liverpool were made to sweat when Lautaro Martinez let rip an absolute howitzer leaving Allison no chance whatsoever This was game on Simone Inzaghi s men were in with a genuine chance But their hopes of a comeback extinguished as quickly as they arose with Alexis Sanchez getting sent off almost immediately after Inter scored lunging in recklessly and taking out Fabinho in a challenge that reeked of desperation Even with men Inter valiantly carried on taking the game to the hosts hoping that they get one more chance because that was all they needed But that chance never arrived Liverpool managed the game as professionally as it comes and as the game wore on it was them who looked more likely to score with Salah hitting the post and Diaz seeing his shot blocked by Vidal While they did go through they will be hoping to guard against complacency in the later stages of the league
