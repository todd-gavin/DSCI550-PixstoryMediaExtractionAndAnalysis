What are stars without big, imported cars? It is the big imported cars that have lent sheen to stars in popular Hindi cinema from the very beginning. 

You can see Bachchan and Parveen Babi with a vintage  Opel Rekord (year unknown). The film released in 1974. 

Then there is Khanna with the grey Willys CJ3B, used in the song "Mere Sapnon Ki Rani" in Aradhana. The film was released in 1969. Khanna is also seen squatting atop a 1960s Toyota which he perhaps owned. His film "Haathi Mere Saathi" (1971) used a Chevrolet Impala, a very popular & premium name in India in those days. 

'Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi', with Ashok, Kishore and Anoop Kumar used a 1928 Ford Model A. Ashok Kumar apparently was the first major star to own a big American convertible. 

Divya Bharti is seen atop a Chevy Impala, which was used in Haathi Mere Saathi. It was used in many films. 

Dev Anand's 'Jewel Thief' used a skyblue 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air in the song "Ye Dil Na Hota Bechara". The film was released in 1967. 

Countless Hindi films have used Buick, Chevys, Fords & Toyotas, much before these companies formally entered India. 

As I said, what are stars without cars?
