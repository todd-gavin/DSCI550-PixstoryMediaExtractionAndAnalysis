Recent research suggests that zoom meetings obstruct the process of brainstorming in humans. It is observed that since people are so hyper-focused on the zoom meetings, they're unable to think of more ideas that can widen one's imagination.

The research mentioned that zoom meeting makes a person stare at the box, which is not suitable for creativity; one needs to move their eyes and mind wander to generate new ideas.

An experiment was conducted to find out the reason behind such a problem. Researchers observed 745 pairs of engineers in five different countries; they were asked to develop creative ideas for using a Frisbee or bubble wrap. 
People who were present in a room could generate more creative ideas than those in remote meetings. 

Melanie Brucks, an applied psychology professor at Columbia University, showed that it all depends on eye movement; people present in the room looked around more often than those present in remote meetings. 
Another professor, Adam Green, also agrees that eye movement plays a crucial role; he said it is not polite to stare at someone in person for a long time. Still, in remote meetings, one has to continuously look at the people present in the meeting.
