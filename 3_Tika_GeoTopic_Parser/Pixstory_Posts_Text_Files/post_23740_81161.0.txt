In the Lishan Nature Reserve in Shanxi Province, China, Qiang watched as two male golden pheasants continuously swapped places on this trunk - their movements akin to a silent dance in the snow.

The birds are native to China, where they inhabit dense forests in mountainous regions.

Although brightly coloured, they are shy and difficult to spot, spending most of their time foraging for food on the dark forest floor, only flying to evade predators or to roost in very high trees during the night.

Equipment used: Nikon D5 + 400mm f2.8 lens; 1/2500 sec at f/2.8; ISO 320.
