Even eating a McDonald's hamburger in peace without the threat of being the next victim of American policing is impossible for our kids. This cannot continue. We need to defund the police.
How is it acceptable at all? Police does not intervene when an armed man gets into a school, they do not intervene when that man open fires at children in school. Police does NOTHING to protect those children. And when we do see the police in action is them firing at a 17 year old eating a burger.
They're not protecting us, they're killing us!
