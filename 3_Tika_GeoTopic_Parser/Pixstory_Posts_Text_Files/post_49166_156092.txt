Now more than ever women must learn self defense Self defense will help women gain confidence empower themselves and find safety in potentially dangerous situations It is critical for women to do so they should not be forced to feel the way so many of them do It is imperative for women to learn self defense because men will try to take advantage of them when they are out and about It s unfortunate but it s the truth They should learn self defense in order to help themselves stop this It s remarkable how much you can learn in such a short amount of time If someone tries to seize a woman who has been trained take advantage of her or worse kidnaps her she will be armed with the required tactics to save her life We don t give enough thought to attacks because we want to believe that people are inherently kind and would never harm us But that s not the truth Looking at the statistics of violence and abuse against women it s crucial they are able to defend themselves Imagine what it would be like if every woman learned and practised martial arts It would be a game changer Females will be able to reclaim their right to a respectful and safe life
