Being a child, one is unaware and not pre-taught of how and what a relationship should be.
It is profoundly impacted by the images of relationships set in the surroundings.
It could be cruel, harsh and intimidating sometimes or joyous at others.
So it begins with parents and their teachings, the environment they're building for their little kids.
And here, most parents make mistakes; they believe in the fallacy that their relationship with their partners is independent of their bond with their child.
The sad part is that all of it is connected, and the image of fighting parents can traumatize and affect children's minds.
Many parents show that their fighting is normal, but unknowingly they tend to affect their child's minds, whose idea of relationship is annihilated and destroyed.
They take it hard to understand relationships with anyone, not just at present but in the latter part of their lives.

Children take the wounds of their parent's trauma. For children, understanding the idea and intricacies of relationships comes with their parents because they're their first encounter with how to form bonds and relations in their life. It's their crucial role to set a picture that doesn't traumatize or harm the child but instead encourages them to make healthy and long-lasting relationships.

According to the research, it is found that even a child as young as six months old can be negatively affected by the ambience of parental arguments. Moreover, it doesn't only affect their formative years, but they also face problems while growing up and turning into adults.

The constant quibbles and conflicts jeopardize their concept and understanding of home. It would seem like a regular fight to parents, as they show it, but it isn't as usual for their children. They are not fooled by seeing or looking at the images of violence as it is narrated or portrayed by parents.
Hence building a positive relationship image is essential so that children don't bear the childhood traumas.
