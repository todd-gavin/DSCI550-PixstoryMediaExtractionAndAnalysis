The European Institute of Oncology offers patients with lobular breast cancer the possibility of undergoing the LobularCard, the exclusive genetic test which, with a simple blood test, allows the analysis of ben genes compared to the genes of the standard test and obtains a reliable assessment of the oncological risk personal and family The goal is to guarantee better oncological surveillance paths for each patient and to identify any relapses early for an ever greater chance of recovery as well as protect family members in the event of an increased risk of developing a hereditary tumor Lobular tumors which represent the breast tumors are often orphans of target therapy explains Giovanni Corso scientific director of the research project financed by the Umberto Veronesi Foundation Molecular therapies aimed at the specific genetic mutations of these neoplasms are not currently available The world of oncological research therefore pays great attention to this tumor type in the shared belief that better molecular characterization would lead to important advances in personalizing the therapeutic management of patients The LobularCard test is a step forward in this direction because it offers the study of the largest panel of genes available internationally Risk assessment or stratification in technical terms, it is essential for the patient because it allows to develop a more effective treatment path based on her individual risk of developing a recurrence. Compared to other types, the lobular tumor has a slightly higher risk of recurring in the contralateral breast after some time from the first diagnosis Stratification is also important for family members to whom the test is extended in the event of the presence of hereditary mutations because they can choose to join a surveillance and prevention program
