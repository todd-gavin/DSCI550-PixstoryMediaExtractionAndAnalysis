Sandringham is the Norfolk estate where the British royal family traditionally congregate at Christmas. The area was mentioned in the 11th-century Domesday Book and came into royal hands in 1862, when Queen Victoria bought it for her eldest son, Albert Edward.

As befitting a royal establishment which used to exist in its own time zone – "Sandringham Time", for which clocks were set half an hour ahead of Greenwich Mean Time to allow for more evening light for winter hunting – the estate is immersed in traditions, some dating back centuries, some more modern.

And then, a bizarre tradition that apparently dates back to the early 1900s, sees each royal weigh themselves before and after Christmas dinner. The queen asks each guest who arrives at Sandringham to weigh themselves using a pair of antique scales — then to step on them again before they leave the estate.

The idea is apparently to ensure the royals are being "well fed". Which they certainly are, considering the royals apparently tuck into both a turkey dinner and an afternoon tea. 

The tradition of weighing guests at the start of the three-day festivities dates back to the reign of Edward VII, who was king from 1901 to 1910. Edward decided that weight gain during their stay was indicative of how much his guests had enjoyed themselves.

Guests were weighed at the start and end of their visit, with 1.4 kilograms the preferred amount for them to have put on, and it's a tradition Queen Elizabeth II has carried on.
