"I keep running back to the starting line because I don't want to be finished with you" - Leeds Gabriel
Another Colleen Hoover book finished in a matter of hours... LAYLA++++
I finally got my hands on her and omg I was not disappointed! CoHo needs to write some more thrillers because I am HOOKED!
Just from the first few lines I was sucked right into the book. For me, Layla is a 4.5/5. me, and is in my opinion a 1000000/5.
Colleen if you read this NEED MORE TWISTED DRAMA!!✰✰✰
I have no words for how much I enjoyed this book!
I've seen a lot of people comparing it to Verity and I do see the comparison between the both of them but In my opinion think there two completely different books Layla was perfectly written (everything Colleen writes is) but absolutely loved this book! Layla revolves around Leeds and Layla's relationship after an unexpected attack left Layla fighting for her life, there relationship from the point forward isn't as plain sailing as it was at the start, obstacles get in there way and there both faced with challenges that could possibly be detrimental for them both, the twist this book took was amazing honestly didn't see it coming at all! I won't say much more because i don't want to give much away but it's definitely worth the read in my opinion it's one of my favourite reads of the year so far
