Jesse Lingard has spoken out for the first time since Manchester United blocked his transfer away from the club in January Speaking on his personal Twitter account on February the rd the year old claimed that the Red Devils had told him to take some time off However Lingard insists he is fine and won t be doing that he also seemed to confirm that he would be committed to the Red Devils for the rest of the season The England international asked Ralf Rangnick if he could leave the club to play first team football The German said that Lingard could leave but the board at Manchester United blocked the move and the year old has now been told to have some time off Sky Sports From the outside looking in I would say that Lingard is unlikely to get much more game time for the rest of the season If the club are telling him to have a break that doesn t indicate that they have any intention of playing Lingard Also given that Rangnick was willing to let him leave I would say that the academy graduate isn t in the German s plans So we will have to see what happens with Lingard but it looks as if his time at Old Trafford will end as a damp squib This would be a huge shame for a player who has served the Red Devils well and it would have been nice if the club let him leave in January Instead he is just going to have to force himself into Rangnick s plans before his contract expires in the summer Lingard deserves to be playing first team football but I would be shocked if he plays much more for the Red Devils between now and the end of the season
