World prices of corn intended for animal feed have reached record values in the last decade, but wheat, of which Ukraine is a major producer and exporter, also stands at high prices. This is what emerges from the analysis by Coldiretti on the impact of the decision by the Ukrainian authorities to suspend the activity of the ports in the cities occupied by Russia at the weekly closing of the Chicago Board of Trade world point of reference for the trade of agricultural products The prices of corn are steadily well above the dollars per bushel kilo but at high values of over dollars per bushel kilo wheat also ranks as globally Ukraine underlines Coldiretti exports a total of over million tons of soft wheat intended for bread-making but also over million tons of corn The blockage of shipments from ports of the Black Sea due to the Russian invasion, moreover, it risks fueling interest in the agricultural raw material market of speculation which Coldiretti explains moves from the financial markets to precious metals such as gold up to agricultural products where the prices depend less and less on the real trend of supply and demand and increasingly from financial movements and market strategies that find in future derivative contracts an instrument in which anyone can invest by buying and selling the product only virtually to the detriment of farmers and consumers A global emergency that directly affects the Italy which is a country with a deficit and even imports its own wheat needs for the production of bread and biscuits and the corn it needs to feed the livestock according to the analysis by Coldiretti which also shows that Ukraine is our second supplier of corn with a share of just over a thousand tons but also guarantees the national import of wheat according to the Divulga study
