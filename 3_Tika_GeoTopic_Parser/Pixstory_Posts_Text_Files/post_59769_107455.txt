India is a country of extremes Deserts and high mountains Rainforests in the tropics and large agricultural fields The wealthiest and lowest people coexist Ancient temples and modern cities Trek along the shore and through the highlands It all depends on your destination The North East might be the greatest bet for exploring lesser known tourist destinations People are helpful and friendly People are still trustworthy in rural areas though not so much in cities You spend up to a month lazing trekking in a small village on a budget of Rs which covers food and housing In Nagaland I m referring to Dzulieke Tawang at a height of feet above sea level is breathtaking It s a little pricey Meghalaya offers some stunning scenery
