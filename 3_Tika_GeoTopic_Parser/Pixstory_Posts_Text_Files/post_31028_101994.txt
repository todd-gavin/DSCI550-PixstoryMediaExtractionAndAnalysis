Salernitana first doomed and then almost saved were able to celebrate their stay in Serie A in the most incredible way Travolta at home but from Udinese the team from Campania had to wait for the end of the match between Venice and Cagliari to breathe a sigh of relief The coach Davide Nicola he explained how yesterday&#39;s debacle was a very difficult game for both teams We felt too much pressure but we spent effort and sweat until the end wonderful audience for the director and for the president This is a wonderful place and I am delighted to have achieved an important goal in a square like Salerno it was the salvation of work and courage This company is the synthesis of what it means to become a team and achieve results in a short time It&#39;s been an impressive three months. For what the team, the club and this extraordinary fan base have shown, Salernitana deserved to be saved and now I&#39;m just thinking about enjoying it.
