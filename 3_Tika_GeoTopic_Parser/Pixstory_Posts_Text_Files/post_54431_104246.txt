Many cancer treatments are notoriously savage on the body Drugs often attack both healthy cells and tumor cells causing a plethora of side effects Immunotherapies that help the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells are no different Though they have prolonged the lives of countless patients they work in only a subset of patients One study found that fewer than of breast cancer patients respond to one of the most common forms of immunotherapy But what if drugs could be engineered to attack only tumor cells and spare the rest of the body To that end my colleagues and I at the University of Chicago s Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering have designed a method to keep one promising cancer drug from wreaking havoc by masking it until it reaches a tumor The promise of IL Cytokines are proteins that can modulate how the immune system responds to threats One way they do this is by activating killer T cells a type of white blood cells that can attack cancer cells Because cytokines can train the immune system to kill tumors this makes them very promising as cancer treatments One such cytokine is interleukin or IL Though it was discovered more than years ago IL still isn t an FDA approved therapy for cancer patients because of its severe side effects such as liver damage This is in part because IL instructs immune cells to produce a large amount of inflammatory molecules that can damage the body Scientists have since been working to reengineer IL to be more tolerable while retaining its powerful cancer killing effects Masking the killer To create a safer version of IL my colleagues and I took advantage of one of the main differences between healthy and cancerous tissue an excess of growth promoting enzymes in cancers Because cancer cells proliferate very rapidly they overproduce certain enzymes that help them invade the nearby healthy tissue and metastasize to other parts of the body Healthy cells grow at a much slower pace and produce fewer of these enzymes Read more
