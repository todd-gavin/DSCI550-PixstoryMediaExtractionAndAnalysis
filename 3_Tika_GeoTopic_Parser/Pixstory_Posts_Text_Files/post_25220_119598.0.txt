I love how the sky is ever changing, the clouds and the patterns but its always so so beautiful and it brings out the photographer in meğŸ˜‚ 
So whenever I look up and I see a wonderful sky, I just reach for my phone in my pocket and just snap a picture, no thought ğŸ¤ŒğŸ˜‚ its almost like an involuntary action nowğŸ˜¬
