What s most despairing is that we cannot simply pinpoint anyone Our killers aren t just one the ones behind our ruin are sadly not just non Muslims From up until Afghanistan was invaded by the Soviet forces creating mass destruction mercilessly Left their landmines for our Afghan children to fall prey to To combat this the US felt fit to appoint the Taliban jihadists getting their training from the Arabs and the neighbouring Afghans had placed their whole trust in This decision was made for Afghanistan as America could not allow the Soviets taking control over Central Asia this would ve been the case because of Afghanistan s geographical stance Of course the Afghan government also had its selfish gains to be fulfilled therefore they also deceived the people for which the price is a hefty and is still being paid As the Taliban got out of control after having a taste of victory and being the powerhouse of Afghanistan Americans lost control over them This means they had to fight and tame the evil they had created in the first place As history unravels Pakistan was a trusted face so the Afghans welcomed their fighters with open arms hoping their hearts were of Muslims so they wouldn t wrong us to this extent sadly we were proven awfully wrong We must stop turning to others for assistance stop waiting for help to arrive It is us against al we must act and we must help now Addressing the ongoing racial attacks we must refrain from causing further problems for our Afghans residing in Pakistan and Iran We must also take into consideration the fact that we re Muslims and how we carry ourselves how we retaliate has a immensely daunting effect on our dearest Afghans faced with these atrocities As angry and helpless as we may feel right now it is very human to lose touch with your sanity please focus on your mental health and check up on your friends and family It is a devastating and most painful times for us all but this too shall pass
