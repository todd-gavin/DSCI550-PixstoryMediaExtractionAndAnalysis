So, what went wrong?

1. Truth Social is already under federal investigation.

2. Despite debuting weeks ago, the app is only available to iPhone users on the App Store. Android users do not have access to the app.

3. Trump has about 80,000 followers on Truth Social, or about 0.0009% of his former following on Twitter.

4. Truth Social is losing to right wing competitors.
Gab and Gettr are two direct competition for Truth Social. (It should be noted that Gab isn’t even allowed on Apple or Google.)

There are two key metrics that advertisers look for on a platform: number of daily visitors and time spent on the app. Let’s compare Gab, Gettr, and Truth Social on these two metrics, courtesy of data from SimilarWeb.
Let’s examine number of visitors, daily average:
Gab: 650,000 daily visitors
Gettr: 300,000 daily visitors
Truth Social: 300,000 daily visitors
Now let’s examine average time spent on app/site:
Gab: 9 minutes
Gettr: 7 minutes
Truth Social: 1.5 minutes

5. Trump isn’t even using his own app.
As of today, Trump has posted just a single time, telling his followers to “get ready!”

Since then, Trump has yet to post anything else.
