Ukraine's President Zelensky has asked Vladimir Putin for one-to-one talks, saying this is the only way to end the war

He also appealed to the West to "give me planes" to fight invasion

Meanwhile Putin insists the war is "going to plan", despite taking only one major city

In Mariupol, a southern port near Ukraine's border with Russia, civilians are trapped by intense shelling

Russian forces have taken control of Kherson, also in the south

If Russia captures more southern cities, Ukrainian forces could be cut off from the sea

Kyiv remains in government control and a large Russian armoured convoy is some distance away

More than one million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began
