Bhansali uses symbolism to portray class hierarchy and the desire of the protagonist. 
In Gangubai kathiwadi song Jab Saiyan we can see Gangu and Afsaan the romantic interest in the movie we can see them playing with cards. 
Cards are often associated with luck and life and it is shown that Gangu wins the game by showing an ace, king and queen . 
The ace in card game symbolises human desire which is in the movie beautifully portrayed by Gangu(Alia) desire to be with Afsaan(Shantanu) yet they can’t be together that’s why she is shown in balcony as a symbol of higher class and caste difference.
The portrayal of romance is also portrayed with their body language and throwing of cards.
