1. Jung Il-hoon: The main rapper of K-pop boy band BtoB, was charged with consuming marijuana in July 2020, as first disclosed to the public by Channel A in December that year. He was sentenced to two years in prison and fined 133 million won (US$120,000).

2. G-Dragon: While Jung Il-hoon’s drug scandal has shocked many, it was way more shocking when the drug habits of BigBang member G-Dragon was first revealed. G-Dragon’s drug scandal went public back in 2011 when, during his appearance on SBS’ Healing Camp, he explained how he “took a puff of a cigarette from someone he didn’t know at the after-party in Japan in May 2011”. According to his account, after noticing the cigarette tasted weird, he says he threw it away.

3. Psy: The Gangnam Style king was arrested for the illegal consumption of marijuana in November 2001, though this didn’t attract much notice beyond Korea as K-pop was not popular internationally back then. According to KBS, he consumed illegal drugs five times and he said the pressure of making good songs in a short period of time was the reason behind this. He admitted his guilt and paid a US$5,000 fine.
