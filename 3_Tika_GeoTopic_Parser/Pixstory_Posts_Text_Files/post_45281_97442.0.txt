The 20-year-old attacker was first detained in January, and his Old Trafford career was put on
hold indefinitely. Mason Greenwood, the Manchester United forward who was arrested in
January on suspicion of rape, assault, and threats to kill, has had his bail extended, according to
Greater Manchester Police.

The 20-year-old was arrested for the first time on January 30 after a woman reported
occurrences of physical violence and posted photographs and video online. On February 4, he
was released on bond, although United had already made the decision to suspend him "until
further notice."

Mason Greenwood's police statement:

Greenwood's bail will now be extended beyond April 30 due to ongoing investigations.

A statement from the police reads: "We are continuing to investigate a report made to us on
Sunday 30 January of online social media images and videos posted by a woman reporting
incidents of physical violence.

A 20-year-old man arrested that day on suspicion of the rape and
assault of a woman, and threats to kill, remains on bail.

"An application has been made to the courts to have his bail extended beyond Saturday 30
April, but the hearing isn't expected to be until mid-June. The suspect will remain on conditional
bail until the date of the court hearing."

The hearing will not take place until the middle of June. Greenwood hasn't played for United
since a January 22 Premier League match against West Ham. Greenwood has had all of his
commercial relationships with Nike cancelled, in addition to being suspended indefinitely at Old
Trafford.
