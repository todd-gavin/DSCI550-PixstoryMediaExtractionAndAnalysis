Refrain
By Allen Ginsberg 

The air is dark, the night is sad,
I lie sleepless and I groan.
Nobody cares when a man goes mad:
He is sorry, God is glad.
Shadow changes into bone.

Every shadow has a name;
When I think of mine I moan,
I hear rumors of such fame.
Not for pride, but only for shame,
Shadow changes into bone.

When I blush I weep for joy,
And laughter drops from me like a stone:
The aging laughter of the boy
To see the ageless dead so coy.
Shadow changes into bone.

The refrain shadow changes into bone are noted here. It could refer to how a lifeless shadow is changed into a bone-lifeless like the before but now taken a form. The speaker of the poem weeps out their pain and agony. his shadow brings only shame to him. He isnâ€™t happy with himself. Such a depressive poem it is!
