The adjacent cave is in a more ruinous state. It consists of a rock-cut chamber, 22.5’ by 17’, part of its front having fallen. It had once a built up verandah in its front as seen in the existing traces of a platform and courtyard built of bricks. The roof of the verandah was supported on wooden beams as seen from the holes in the outer wall wherein they were originally inserted. Inside on the southern wall of the cave, are six small figures of Jaina Tirthankaras carved in relief and representing Padmaprabha, Parsvnatha and Mahavira. No inscription is reported from this cave and A. Ghosh would suggest that both the caves were excavated at one and the same time i.e. in the 3rd or 4th century AD, as indicated by the inscription of Vairadeva. Artistically the rock cut Jaina images may not, perhaps, be assigned to such an early date.
Architecturally this cave has nothing in common with the adjoining Son Bhandar cave. Its roof was not of “the arched shape” nor has its door any “sloping jambs”; and besides, there are no traces of polish on the walls.  The cave and its front are on a lower level and above it are traces of another storey built of bricks which was once approached by the flight of rock cut steps which exist even now. There is reason to believe that it was a much later work. It should be noted that a fine image of Vishnu riding on Garuda and belonging to the Gupta period, now in the Nalanda Museum, was found lying in the verandah of the cave. The point, therefore, needs to be examined carefully whether this cave was originally of Hindu or Jain origin.
