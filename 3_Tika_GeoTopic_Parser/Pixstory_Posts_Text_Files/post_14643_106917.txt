The links between climate and infectious disease are complex so the exact shifts in disease patterns are difficult to predict But consider the following facts Insects are the vectors for many of the world s worst scourges plague malaria Lyme disease yellow and dengue fevers just to name a few Warmer temperatures not only expand the geographical range of many insects they also lengthen their breeding season boost their reproductive rates and drive them to feed i e bite more frequently The patterns of insect borne diseases are also likely to change Mosquitoes have brought malaria to Texas Michigan New Jersey and New York Dengue fever bearing mosquitoes have spread as far north as Chicago and the Netherlands Lyme disease a tick borne disease has spread into Canada And as drenching rain and flooding becomes more common the rates of cholera and other diarrheal diseases are expected to rise This leaves us with diseases that could surprise us These could be completely new diseases or diseases that were thought to be well controlled But whether the infectious diseases are new or old their prevention and treatment will require the expertise of a new generation of epidemiologists health care professionals and microbiologists
