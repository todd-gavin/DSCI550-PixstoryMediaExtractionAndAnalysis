The news is a little old but I just want to refresh everyone s memory An investigation into a fundraiser held by former first lady Melania Trump has apparently been launched in Florida The New York Times reported that Trump was selling tickets to an April high tea event with proceeds going to a Be Best programme called Fostering the Future according to organisers According to the New York Times the project aims to award computer science scholarships to young people who have been in foster care Seems like a good facade Am I right The news regarding the former first lady s enterprise was revealed as part of a larger New York Times investigation into former President Trump his associates and his commercial transactions since leaving office The Hill reported that over the previous year Trump has continued to fundraise and back candidates for public office while hinting at a presidential bid in What s distinctive with Trump is that the business aspect appears to have penetrated everything Lawrence Noble a former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission told the newspaper According to the New York Times no charity named Fostering the Future or Be Best has been registered in Florida Now Mrs Trump has called this whole fiasco dishonest but frankly I don t believe her
