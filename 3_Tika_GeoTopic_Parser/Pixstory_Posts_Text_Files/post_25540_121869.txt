With no progress regarding his trade request Kevin Durant seems to be going nowhere Kevin Durant s anticipated departure from the Brooklyn Nets was one of the most discussed matters of the off season this year Prior to starting NBA free agency it was reported that Durant requested a trade specifically from Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai This came after fellow All Star and teammate Kyrie Irving opted into the final year of his contract Durant made it known to the Nets that he wanted to be traded to the Phoenix Suns or the Miami Heat both of whom finished at the top of their respective conferences last season The Nets respected the time All Star s request and started engaging with the teams he mentioned beginning with the Heat However after weeks of negotiating a deal Durant is still in Brooklyn and it looks like he ll be staying there for the upcoming NBA season The Nets tried talking with other teams which surprisingly included the Boston Celtics who swept them in the first round during the playoffs last season But the deal didn t materialize for the former MVP As of now there have been reports regarding Kevin Durant meeting up with Joe Tsai regarding his trade request Since his request reached a stalemate Durant s chances of making it out of Brooklyn this season have been slim However it is unclear to a lot of people what the meeting between the two will be about Obviously there will be some things that both parties need to clear out but it s hard to guess what such a meeting could entail
