It was a surprise move from Germany to halt the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline after Russia announced that it was moving into pro-Russia rebel-held areas of Ukraine.  

"With regard to the latest developments, we need to reassess the situation also with regard to Nord Stream 2," Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in Berlin, announcing the halting of certification of the pipeline. (https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/22/business/nord-stream-2-germany-russia/index.html)

Scholz has taken the step despite being under pressure on the gas prices in his country, which have been zooming because of shortage of gas supply from Russia. The 760-mile Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline has for long been touted as the panacea for all gas shortages. 

Running under the Baltic Sea, Nord Stream 2 is expected to double Moscow's gas exports to Germany, but it also circumvents Ukraine, which relies on existing pipelines for income and would be hard-hit by the loss of transit fees. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has described the new pipeline as a "dangerous geopolitical weapon" and had opposed it. (https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59306223 )

Many commentators have been arguing that Nord Stream 2 pipeline was equal to handing Europe's energy security to Putin. Critics of the pipeline have argued that Russian may turn off gas to get the upper hand in its geostrategy. By taking a pre-emptive strike, Germany has probably done something that not many people expected it to do.

President Vladimir Putin in the past, pushing for the pipeline had argued that it would ease Europe's natural gas crisis. In the past, he has been accused of deliberately holding back natural gas from the existing pipeline to create pressure to force Europe to accept Nord Stream 2.

Russia supplies almost 40% of all EU gas and it has a huge influence on the supply of gas and its price. But with the halting of the approval for Nord Stream 2, Putin's reaction could have a big impact now.
