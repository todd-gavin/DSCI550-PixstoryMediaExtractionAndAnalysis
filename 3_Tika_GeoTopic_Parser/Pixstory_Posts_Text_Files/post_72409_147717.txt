Ayan Mukerji s Brahmastra has been called a hit at the box office but things are still hazy when it comes to its real collection and the profit it made Speaking with trade analyst Komal Nahta about the same Ayan threw in some vague explanation It was Ranbir Kapoor who was asked the question but Ayan chose to answer it instead The truth is that the film has been made because of a lot of personal sacrifice It is true that the amount that Ranbir would make as a star actor he didn t take anything for the making of Brahmastra This is a very very big thing because it would not be possible to make this film Ayan also spoke about Alia When she joined the film this was she only had a couple of releases She isn t the star that she is today The amount that was fixed for Alia in this film was not a very big amount but even that small amount by the time we completed the film even Alia said that all of it has gone into the making of the film Ranbir however gave a clearer answer Aapne jo prashna pucha ki maine kuch charge kiya ya nhi kiya actually maine kiya You asked if I charged anything or not actually I did This is an equity I have for life I m also part producer of the film Meri nazariya aur soch long run hai I am thinking more long term Maine part one me paese nhi liye I didn t charge for part but eventually jo faith aur belief hai ki parts m jo yeh film bana sakti hai but the faith that I have about the amount that the film will make over three parts that is beyond anything I d get as an actor price as an actor
