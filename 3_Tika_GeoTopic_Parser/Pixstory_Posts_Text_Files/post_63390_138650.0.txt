Blood pressure and it’s dynamics.

Today in class, our nutrition professor mentioned how different people have varying blood pressure. And most of the people who consult their doctors for medication are normal but are prone to believe they have higher BP.

Many doctors are not patient and instead immediately prescribe BP medications. 

The right way to diagnose would be to maintain a log book recording blood pressure eat different intervals with different situations throughout the day and once this is been addressed to the doctor, right action can be taken. 

Our professor mentioned a very interesting type of BP , which is “ white collar BP”, which is as soon as you see a doctor your blood pressure will go high.  Which is why sometimes before visiting the doctors your pressure would be normal but it shoots as soon as you’re in the hospital.
