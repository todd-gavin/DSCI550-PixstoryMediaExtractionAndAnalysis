Christianity has produced obstacles after obstacles for anyone who wants to live a good and healthy life. Another instance of absolute insanity in Christianity is how it denies people accurate information about their bodies. 

Denying young people accurate information about their bodies is just plain evil.

U.S. government spent more than a decade and a billion dollars teaching children and young adults about abstinence and programs concocted by Bible believers who live in a fantasy land where virginity is next to godliness. 

Instead of medically accurate information and sex education in regards to intimacy and childbearing, teens are given promise rings and provided with dilemma that will make them prone to slut shaming and feeling ashamed about their bodies for the rest of their lives. 

Why won't the government fund teachers and pay them a decent wage or provide enough resources for children to learn and understand the many forms of intimacy or how their bodies are different, or how there are more than 2 genders, how there is literally a spectrum of sexuality. 

And spare me the lectures about how this is generalisation, when I have provided evidences of institutionalisation of Christianity with the help of government. There are no generalisations here, it's just plain facts that people are suffering because of Christianity and it's high time they took responsibility for it!!
