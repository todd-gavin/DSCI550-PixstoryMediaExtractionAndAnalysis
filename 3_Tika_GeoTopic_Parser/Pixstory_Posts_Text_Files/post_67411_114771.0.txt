"Perspective " is an important word which is commonly used but most of the time misjudged. We sometimes define it as a particular attitude towards something or a point of view.
                   Each individual differs in their character and way of approaching things. A perspective or opinion is based on ideas, opinions and insights. When an individual presents his or her opinion many factors misjudge them like due to ego issues even if the first person is correct, the second person will not accept this, education is another factor that is thought process of a literate individual and illiterate individual varies, life experience or field experience is also an factor which lead to miscommunication etc.
As an individual we all have different views. Perspective differences in some cases can even bring out good results. Therefore, each and everyone's perspective should be respected and viewed.
