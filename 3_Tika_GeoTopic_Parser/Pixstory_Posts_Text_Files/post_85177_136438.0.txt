It is the Group F amongst all the UEFA Champions League 22/23 groups that has a lot of drama left. Though the group consists of the reigning UEFA Champions League winners, it has huge surprise elements left in them. In this article, let us look at how the group might look at the end of six matches of the group stage.
Considering Real Madrid’s transfer window, previous performances, current performances and their ability to turn the game around in the crucial games, we predict them to easily qualify for the next stage of the tournament. They snatched the victories from the mouth of defeat in UEFA Champions League 2021/22 to win the prestigious title under Carlo Ancelotti.
For the second spot, it is a three-way competition between RB Leipzig, Celtic and Shakhtar Donetsk. RB Leipzig have found their mojo back with Timo Werner re-joining the team from Chelsea and they find themselves in a state where they can build momentum. They have started to win games in the German top-flight after a slow start.
Celtic are again on top of the Scottish League table with five out of five wins. They won the league last time and have the momentum at their disposal. They will look to translate the same form to the elite European competition. Though they might not be able to qualify for the  knockouts, they can make their way to the Europa League playoffs.
The final team in contention are the Ukrainian heavyweights, Shakhtar Donetsk. They have caused trouble for the opposition in the past and can continue this season as well. They have started the campaign on a good note with two wins from three games and are leading the points table. However, we expect them to not qualify for the next stage of the UEFA Champions League due to the competition.
Predicted Group F finish:
#1) Real Madrid
#2) RB Leipzig
#3) Celtic
#4) Shakhtar Donetsk
