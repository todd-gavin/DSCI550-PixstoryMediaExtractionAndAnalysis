Chelsea have replaced Thomas Tuchel with Graham Potter at the helm. But what has the former Brighton & Hove Albion manager achieved in his career that makes him special? 
Graham Potter did not have a "big club" on his resume before joining Chelsea. However, the wizard (Yep Harry Potter jokes are a norm here XD) has done brilliant things with Östersund, Swansea City, and Brighton & Hove Albion. 
Having joined Swedish fourth division club Östersund in 2010, the Englishman hauled the club to the Swedish top division in just 5 years. This also included two back-to-back promotions. 
Graham Potter then led the Östersund team to the Svenska Cupen (Swedish Cup) in 2017. He followed this up by taking his team to the Europa League knockout stage in the 2017-18 season. Östersund were eventually knocked out by Arsenal on aggregate, however, they did beat the Gunners 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium. 
To add to this, Potter also led Östersund to the Europa League knockout stage as well. 
Having joined Swansea in the 2018/19 season, Potter helped them to a 10th placed finish in the EFL before moving on to Brighton & Hove Albion for the 2019/20 season. 
From a 15th placed finish in 19/20 to a 9th placed finish in the 21/22 Premier League campaign, Graham Potter showed off his prowess with the Seagulls, impressing pundits and other coaches alike. 
Brighton currently occupy the 4th spot in the Premier League, 3 points above Chelsea in 6th. It has to be seen if Graham Potter's magic wand can help the Blues get on their Nimbus Racing Broom and jet set towards the top of the Premier League table. (Graham has to be a Ravenclaw doesn't he? XD)
