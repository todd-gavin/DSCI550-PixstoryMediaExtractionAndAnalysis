The speech by our Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi lists 5 pledges for India. 
The pledge includes:
1. Making India a developed country by 2047
2. Removing all traces of colonialism
3. Taking pride in our roots and heritage
4. Unity and Integrity
5. Sense of duty among citizens 

Hope these pledges really take effect to make India a better place and to make ourselves really free. Free from corruption, free from terror, free from nepotism, a true freedom in the hearts of every citizen of the country. 

Hope a better India comes soon!
