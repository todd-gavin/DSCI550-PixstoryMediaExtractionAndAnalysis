There's a list for me. I am not fond of too long dialogues. Like of course sometimes, it's necessary and I even enjoy it but I don't like when a person is speaking without a break. It's, for some reason, stressful for me.

Another thing that's a huge turn off for me is the obvious attempt at making something stand out. Like focusing too much on a certain thing just to shove it in our face. For example, speaking again and again how someone's a "nice guy" or "not like other girls". Like, we get it! I get it he's a nice guy and she's not like other girls or that he's a bad boy etc etc, stop bringing it up again and again, it ruins the experience of fluent reading.

Oh there's one more, trying too hard to put across a message. It's a lot like the previous one so I don't know if it counts but it's less about the character and more about a certain thing they keep repeating. Like some speech about positivity in life or something. One of the reasons I don't read many self help books.

What's yours?
