On the sidelines of the limited success against Salernitana, the Turin coach Ivan Juric spoke to the microphones of DAZN Below are his statements Finally Belotti played an excellent away game he played a fair match as he always has to do He was not lacking in other matches we have done better than tonight Sometimes episodes and referee errors were decisive just think of the seven posts we took or the goals conceded in the final I&#39;m satisfied it was a battle the boys got into the game suffering the right and creating chances Izzo He suffered a bit this year there are characteristics that he suffers in some matches He has always trained to the maximum Djidji and Zima have done very well but now he deserves the space he is having a big reward for a boy who is working well At one point I thought we could do more then we have been penalized by our mistakes and by refereeing wrongs But saving ourselves with nine games to go already seems like a success to me now we have to win as much as possible have fun and grow in the game
