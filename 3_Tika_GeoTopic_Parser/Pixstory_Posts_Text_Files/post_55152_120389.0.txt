The Sydney funnel-web is without a doubt the deadliest spider in Australia, if not the entire world. It produces large quantities of highly toxic venom and has large fangs to inject it. 

As per NatGeo, they can be found in New South Wales in both woodlands and inhabited urban areas, and they burrow in moist protected regions. Although they are rarely seen, they have been known to wander into backyards and occasionally fall into swimming pools. When threatened, they can also become quite aggressive. 

The Sydney Funnel-web is only 1.5â€“3.5 cm long, but it has fangs that are bigger than those of a brown snake and so strong they can even puncture toenails and nails. Their venom contains a chemical that can assault the human nerve system, change the way all organs work, and, when it comes from a male, cause death.

One in six bites causes a severe reaction, but since the antivenom has been made available, in 1981, no fatalities have been recorded.
