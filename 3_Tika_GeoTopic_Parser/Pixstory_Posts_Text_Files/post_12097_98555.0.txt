As covid had subsided the reports of Covid 19 statistics also started going down and this is turning into a concern that worries the experts. This action could effect the efforts that's made to control the virus and it could lead to major outbreaks. 

50 states were reporting on daily basis on the new covid 19 cases until a year ago. But the reporting gradually got low. Pennsylvania is the latest state that will start with weekly updates and just six states continues to report new cases of the virus on daily basis. 

Half of the states now report just once a week and Florida has practiced to do it every two weeks. 

Specifically knowing when the cases happened and reporting them frequently "equipped leaders to act quickly and save lives," stated Beth Blauer, executive director of the Centers for Civic Impact at Johns Hopkins University. The University have tracking the data of Covid 19 throughout the pandemic and this have been helpful for the government to function at all levels. 

"A possible seven-day lag for noticing changes in disease trends when states shift from daily reporting to weekly reporting can be incredibly detrimental during a crisis, limiting the government's ability to intervene and protect people," Blauer wrote. 

The Health Department of Pennsylvania says that they plan to reduce the frequency of Covid 19 reports that comes between a "move into the next phase of the pandemic."
