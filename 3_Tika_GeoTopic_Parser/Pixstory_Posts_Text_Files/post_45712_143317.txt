Even though scientists have observed the remains of numerous stars that have burst in the Milky Way and adjacent galaxies it is frequently challenging to pinpoint the exact timing of the star s destruction Astronomers have used NASA telescopes to examine the stunning remnants of a supernova in a nearby galaxy and have discovered enough information to help turn back time The relic of a white dwarf star s outburst is known as SNR abbreviated SNR The star was killed in a thermonuclear explosion after reaching a critical mass possibly by absorbing material from a companion star or merging with another white dwarf This type of supernova known as a Type Ia is used by researchers in a variety of fields Astronomers combined the data from Chandra and Hubble with data from NASA s retired Spitzer Space telescope to determine how long ago the star in SNR exploded and learn about the environment the supernova occurred in This data provides scientists a chance to rewind the movie of the stellar evolution that has played out since and figure out when it got started Source NASA TV
