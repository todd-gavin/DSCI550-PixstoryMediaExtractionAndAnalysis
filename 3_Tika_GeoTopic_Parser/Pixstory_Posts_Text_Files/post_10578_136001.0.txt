Indian F2 racer Jehan Daruvala hoping trouble-free weekend in Zandvoort

The 23-year-old’s season has been hampered by a streak of misfortune

ZANDVOORT, Netherlands: Indian racer Jehan Daruvala heads to Zandvoort  this weekend hoping for a trouble-free outing at the Dutch round of the Formula 2 championship.

The 23-year-old has endured a difficult run of races and a streak of misfortune that has hampered his F2 campaign.

The most recent stroke of ill luck hit the Red Bull youngster last week at Belgium’s Spa-Francorchamps.

Set to chalk up an eighth podium finish of the year with a second-placed start in Saturday’s sprint race, Jehan was sidelined on the formation lap itself with a fuel pump failure.

In the feature race on Sunday, a rash move by Roy Nissany led to a collision that damaged Jehan’s front wing, forced him to pit early and compromised his strategy.

Jehan said, “We’ve had a tough run of races recently and honestly I just want to put a straightforward weekend together in Zandvoort. It’s a track I know from my junior career and one I enjoy and I’m looking forward to a trouble-free run this weekend.” 

This year is the first time that Formula 2 races around the twists and banked corners of the seaside Zandvoort track. 

But Jehan, a three-time F2 winner, raced there while competing the the European Formula 3 championship.

He finished third there in 2018.

The venue will host a the second of a triple-header run of races on consecutive weekends, with Italy’s Monza bringing the curtain down on the championship’s European season next week.

The series is racing as a support event to the Formula One Dutch Grand Prix.
