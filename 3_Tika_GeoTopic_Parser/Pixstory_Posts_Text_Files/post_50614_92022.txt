The global average temperature has risen around C since pre industrial times This magnitude and rate of warming cannot be explained by natural variations alone and must necessarily take into account changes due to human activities Emissions of greenhouse gases GHGs aerosols and changes in land use and land cover LULC during the industrial period have substantially altered the atmospheric composition and consequently the planetary energy balance and are thus primarily responsible for the present day climate change Warming since the s has already contributed to a significant increase in weather and climate extremes globally e g heat waves droughts heavy precipitation and severe cyclones changes in precipitation and wind patterns including shifts in the global monsoon systems warming and acidification of the global oceans melting of glacier rising sea levels and changes in marine and terrestrial ecosystems In terms of water resource water quality is impacted by changing precipitation and temperature resulting from climate change Changes in water resources may affect chemical composition of water in rivers and lakes The greenhouse effect is a natural process that plays a major part in shaping the earth s climate It produces the relatively warm and hospitable environment near the earth s surface where humans and other life forms have been able to develop and prosper However the increased level of greenhouse gases GHGs carbon dioxide CO water vapor H O methane CH nitrous oxide N O hydrofluorocarbons HFCs perfluorocarbons PFCs and sulfur hexafluoride SF etc due to anthropogenic activities has contributed to an overall increase of the earth s temperature leading to a global warming The average global surface temperature have increased by oC since the late th Century and is expected to increase by oC oC by AD with significant regional variations IPCC The atmospheric CO concentration has increased from ppm to ppm CH concentration increased from ppb to ppb and N O concentration from ppb to ppb from the year and According to the fifth report of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC the average maximum and minimum temperatures over land have increased worldwide by an excess of C per decade since
