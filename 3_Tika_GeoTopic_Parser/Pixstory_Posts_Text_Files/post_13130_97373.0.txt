"Just as our people stood against the red aggression yesterday, they will never remain silent today against the black aggression," said Ahmad Massoud, led by the Resistance Front.

The front adds that "inspired by the selfless Mujahideen to protect the country's faith, independence and freedom, it reaffirms its resistance to the Taliban mercenary group."

In addition to the Taliban and the Afghan National Resistance Front, Afghan politicians have issued statements on the 27th and 28th.

Social media users have also exchanged views on the historical events of the two days.

The  28 April is a reminder to the people of Afghanistan of the coup led by the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan that took place in 1978 and the government of Mohammad Daud Khan overthrew the first president of Afghanistan.

Mohammad Davood Khan and his family were killed in the coup at the Presidential Palace. After fourteen years of rule in Afghanistan, the Soviet-backed government whose last head was Dr. Najib finally collapsed.

The news of Dr. Najib's resignation was published on the night of 27 April, 1992. Therefore, the  28 April is celebrated in Afghanistan as the anniversary of the mujhiadeen victory day .
