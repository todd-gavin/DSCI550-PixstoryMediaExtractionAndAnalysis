Pierre Gasly will team up with Esteban Ocon to form an all-French line-up at Alpine in 2023. 
The 26-year-old signed a multi-year deal with Alpine after being released by Redbull Racing 
“I am delighted to join the Alpine family and begin this new chapter in my Formula 1 career,” said Gasly. “Driving for a team that has French roots is something very special. I know the strengths of Alpine having raced against them over the past couple of years and, clearly, their progress and ambition is very impressive.
“I wish to thank Red Bull as this marks the end of our nine-year journey together. It is thanks to their trust and support that I became a Formula 1 driver, and what we’ve achieved with Scuderia AlphaTauri over the last years has been very special.
“Looking ahead, I want to give the maximum and utilise all my experience to fight for podiums and ultimately contribute to Alpine’s fight for championships in the future.”
