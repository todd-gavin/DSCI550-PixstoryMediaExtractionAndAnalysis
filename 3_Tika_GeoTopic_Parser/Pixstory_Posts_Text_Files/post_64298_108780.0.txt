Mantra is a paraalamb (external object) meditation. Every person does not possess the same capability for meditation. For a person with extreme fickleness of mind, mantra meditation is like a boon to develop concentration. Otherwise, deep meditation in the beginning may make him or her uneasy.

Therefore, for people with an unsteady mind, mantra meditation should be the first step. Mantras, if done with proper process, can enhance concentration and help enter
the state of meditation.

Words have a great power to bring transformation. It is commonly understood that the agent of change is not the gross sound but the subtle ultra sound. In Mantra chanting
we produce the subtle sound. Mantra chanting begins with loud recitation of the words, and then gentle recitation and finally mental recitation without producing a sound. In the
third step a rhythm is established and the mind becomes stable. At this stage the practitioner gets mastery on both sound and the mind. Achievement of this state provides an
excellent foundation for meditation.
