‌

I was unsure if this was okay,” they wrote in the post, adding later, their chest was groped. “Two years later, as I write this today, I feel and understand that I was sexually violated and molested by Sujeesh,” they added.
‌
‌The similarities of predator patterns are noted in almost every case, the tattoo artist is accused of asking improper questions about the ladies who come to him for tattoos, such as about their sexual lives and personal relationships.
‌
‌ He even gives women who are sexually assaulted discounts. He also deters the women’s friends from accompanying them into the room where he works on their tattoos.
‌

‌
‌Meanwhile, on social media, many are stinging on the survivors. They are being asked Why are women tattooing? Why are women tattooing on lower hips and chest? Why did not they react at the moment?

These very questions are the answers, when the survivors come out they are the problem! The way they dress, sit, the things they do. In this world living is a problem. The audacity of the violator to repeat his crime is the world we make for them.
