Missi roti is flavored flatbreads made with a mix of whole wheat flour, gram flour and spices. Missi roti is a North Indian specialty and is often made in various homes in the North Indian belt.
Missi roti is also known as besan roti as besan a.k.a gram flour is one of the key ingredients. Besan imparts a nice nutty flavor to the roti. It also helps in making the roti slightly crispy.
There are some variations of this recipe. Some people also make it into layered crispy and flaky missi roti. But we make it into a simple round roti and not the layered version.
We always add onions to the dough. With onions, the roti tastes good. If you do not want to add onions, then you can add fenugreek leaves, spinach or grated veggies like carrots or beetroot. The addition of veggies will make these rotis more healthy and a good way to include the veggies in the diet of kids who donâ€™t like them.
Missi roti can be served with a dal, aloo sabzi, matar sabzi or even a mango pickle or curd or butter.
Serve missi roti hot or warm with any vegetable dish, dal or with a pickle or curd or butter. It tastes so good that you can just have it plain also without any accompaniment. For best taste have them hot or warm.

Sometimes we have them as an evening snack with a cup of hot tea.
