Letting go is really hard especially when you have to let go of something you really want whether it s a great opportunity someone you really liked or loved or even any expectations you had about something I don t think anyone knows how to completely let go or not fall back from time to time if they do but there are definitely ways to make it easier for you to let go when you relentlessly don t want to let go Anything that feels forced or harder than it should be or causes you pain and distress is not meant for you Having this mentality or faith will help you overcome the reluctance that comes with making a decision of whether or not you should let go Things that are meant for you have a way of flowing smoothly into your life There is power in letting go a power that brings more peace and serenity than being stuck in situations that make your heart a bit heavier each and every day When you leave one door behind and lock that door you will be surprised by the number of doors that were waiting to be opened by you and only you Some endings are not bad sometimes they are not even endings just bridges to new beginnings
