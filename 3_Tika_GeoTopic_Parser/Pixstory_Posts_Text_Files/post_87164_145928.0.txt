8 Nemanja Matic
Matic was acquired from Chelsea to fill the role of defensive midfielder, as United desperately needed a holding midfielder, and Matic was an excellent fit for the role. Matic thrived in that position, contributing intelligence and tactical awareness. Before joining Manchester United, Matic had a 75% ackle success rate in 123 Premier League appearances, which was higher than N'Golo Kante, Ander Herrera, Fernandinho, and Jordan Henderson.
However, he became a fringe player for the club in 2020 and left in 2022, having made 189 appearances for the Premier League outfit.
7 Christian Erikson
With Pogba leaving and United revamping their squad under new manager Erik ten Hag, the club needed a playmaker with vision like Lionel Messi and the ability to break down any type of defence with through balls. Erikson was a free agent at the time, and United made a great move
by signing the former Tottenham player. Erikson and Fernandes could work well together. Hemay be the new addition, but he is one of the best playmakers of all time and has Premier League experience.
6 Ji Sung Park
One of the best Asian players in Manchester United history, he played a key role in the 2007 Champions League final. Ji Sung Park was known for his off-the-ball movement, work rate, and energy, and he was used all over the midfield. On numerous occasions, he was capable of
playing as an attacking midfielder or winger, and he was one of the major influencers who earned Alex Ferguson's trust.
Pirlo once said of him, "The midfielder must have been the first nuclear-powered South Korean in history, in the sense that he rushed around the pitch at the speed of an electron." Park was atenacious midfielder who appeared in 205 games and won four titles.
