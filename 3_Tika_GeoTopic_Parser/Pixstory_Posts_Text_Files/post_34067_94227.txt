At the end of the Olimpico match between Lazio and Turin which ended in a draw Maurizio Sarri commented on the draw between Lazio and Turin We suffered from the opponents&#39; aggression and physicality because we made few movements without the ball We always went towards each other but had to go deeper which they suffer We also allowed them too much dribbling we were long on the pitch and the distances weren&#39;t right today we had to transform their aggression in space by moving the ball quickly Instead we were slow and we suffered their one-on-one I was a little apprehensive about this match we suffer when c Aggression and pressure from opponents C I regret having equalized only in the last minutes I have always said that our goal is to finish the season in the best possible way and to have the feeling that we have laid the foundations for something important Then let&#39;s see if we can get a place in europe. We&#39;ve earned points in the last few races, we&#39;re doing well and we&#39;ll continue to fight
