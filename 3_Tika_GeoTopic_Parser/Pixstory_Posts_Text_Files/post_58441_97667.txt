Name Shriya Shravan Sareen Grade B School Sanskriti School New Delhi Group Ignorance it is not bliss For decades are carbon emissions have been dismissed Blindly cutting trees we paid no attention to this And now we have to look back and see where it all went amiss Our oil and gas production Needs to undergo major reduction We require a new reusable fuel so mass consumption Or the world will undergo destruction If not done we will have to face temperature rising the heat There will be multiple droughts There will be spontaneous fire threats There needs to be a decrease in our carbon footprint We need to decrease are use of CFCs And increase the amount of greenery Or there will be an increase in the level of the sea So we really need to shift to solar and wind energy We must heal our only home The only place safe to roam This is our problem That somehow we need to overcome So let s reduce the carbon dioxide Reduce the polluting vehicles we ride Reuse those resources to save nature from its painful silence Recycle as much as possible though it requires patience And to join us more people should be influenced Let s make sure history does not repeat itself And never again make nature cry for help
