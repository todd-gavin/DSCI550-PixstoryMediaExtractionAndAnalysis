In the last eight months, the Bollywood industry is struggling so much. Big budget movies like shamshera,samrat prithviraj,Dhakad and recently laal singh chadda and rakshabandhan.👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻

Be it an actor, director, or the huge budget, none of these factors managed to save these films or get the cash register ringing.💸💸💸

In the next couple of months huge budget movies are coming of ranbir and alia bhramastra,salman khan tiger 3 ,shah rukh khan pathan.✅

Can these movie can save Bollywood or this year is going to be Bollywood’s flopest year of all time?❌❌

Comment what do you thing these movies can save it or not???
