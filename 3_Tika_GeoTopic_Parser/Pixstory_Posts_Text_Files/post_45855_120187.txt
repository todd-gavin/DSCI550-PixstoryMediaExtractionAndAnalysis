NASA funded scientists have discovered shaded locations within pits on the Moon that always hover around a comfortable F about C using data from NASA s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter LRO spacecraft and computer modeling as reported by NASA TV The pits and caves to which they may lead would make thermally stable sites for lunar exploration compared to areas at the Moon s surface which heat up to F about C during the day and cool to minus F about minus C at night Lunar exploration is part of NASA s goal to explore and understand the unknown in space to inspire and benefit humanity Pits were first discovered on the Moon in and since then scientists have wondered if they led to caves that could be explored or used as shelters The pits or caves would also offer some protection from cosmic rays solar radiation and micrometeorites About of the more than pits are probably collapsed lava tubes said Tyler Horvath a doctoral student in planetary science at the University of California Los Angeles who led the new research recently published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters Lunar pits are a fascinating feature on the lunar surface said LRO Project Scientist Noah Petro of NASA s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland Knowing that they create a stable thermal environment helps us paint a picture of these unique lunar features and the prospect of one day exploring them
