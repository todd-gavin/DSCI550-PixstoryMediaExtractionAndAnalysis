In a shocking development, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) superstar Kylian Mbappe has informed the club that he wants to depart on a permanent basis in the January transfer window.
As per reports published by Spanish outlet MARCA, the relationship between the club and the player is completely broken and there’s no going back from here.
Mbappe is unhappy in Paris as he feels ’betrayed' by the club. He believes the club has failed to fulfill the promises that were made during his new contract, which will keep him until 2025.
The french striker is reportedly unhappy with coach Christophe Galtier’s attacking tactics as he prefers to play in the two-man system alongside a pivot. For the same reason, he had stated that he feels better playing in the national team setup than PSG.
Read Madrid is not an option
Real Madrid have been open about their interest in landing the 23-year-old attacker. They were very close to acquiring his services until Mbappe took a U-turn at the last moment to extend his stay at PSG in the recent summer window.
Although Mbappe now wants to leave the French club, the Whites are not an option as PSG will not entertain any offers from the Spanish club. With Real Madrid being sidelined, Liverpool are a feasible option for the talented forward.
Jurgen Klopp is a big admirer of Mbappe and wanted to sign him in the summer window. On top of that, Liverpool is Mbappe mother’s favorite club.
"We talked a little bit, but not too much. We talked a little bit," Mbappe told the Telegraph. "I talked to Liverpool because it's the favourite club of my mum, my mum loves Liverpool. I don't know why you will have to ask her!
However, the Red’s financial books might be a blockage in the path. It remains to be seen how this drama will unfold in the near future.
