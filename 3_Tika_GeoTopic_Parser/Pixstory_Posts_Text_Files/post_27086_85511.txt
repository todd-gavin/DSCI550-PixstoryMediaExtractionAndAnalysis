Promising Young Woman First off if you are into trailers of movies watch both the trailers of this movie When Toxic by Britney Spears plays in a trailer you know the movie will offend some people Promising Young Woman is offensive offensive in many ways but only for problematic and patriarchal men The movie does not necessarily have a very unique plot it is simplistic but wicked in its own way Promising Young Woman follows Cassandra who is on quest for revenge and finding out men who go to bars at night and take advantage of girls who are drunk and quite simply need their help It is great in its story telling and narrative when it tells the experiences of Cassandra Any woman can relate to the struggles and life of Cassandra and some might agree that what Cassandra does is something what they all want to do or have always wanted to do Promising Young Woman feels calibrated for in a way that could only be genuine It isn t breaking its back to be edgy or push buttons in an arbitrary effort to appear hip It is uplifting in its own ways while narrating a story which inspires people to do better calling out men and the supposed Nice guys To all the women out there I feel the urge to say that you are all very brave and courageous and mesmerizing in your own way and this Woman s Day if you decide to watch a movie to uplift yourself for an hour or two against the ever existing patriarchy and man s ability to get away with everything then Promising Young Woman is for you and you simply cannot miss this
