 I picked this one up because I greatly enjoyed Jemisin s Hundred Thousand Kingdoms but this novel was even better Jemisin blew me away with her world building and beautiful writing It s the tale of an alternate earth called the Stillness which is plagued by constant seismic activity This leads to frequent near extinction events called Fifth Seasons that keep humans on their toes The evidence of past civilizations litters the planet ruined cities incomplete stonelore handed down from earlier generations and strange obelisks that float through the atmosphere like low altitude satellites and serve no apparent purpose The civilization that we meet in this book the Sanze Empire has survived for centuries by harnessing the power of orogenes people born with an innate ability to control their environment The orogenes can stop earthquakes or start them They can save cities or draw power from living creatures and ice them Their powers are terrifying yet essential so the empire develops a caste of Guardians who have the power to neutralize the orogenes when necessary The orogenes are held in contempt and called roggas by ordinary humans Despite all their power they cannot control their own lives They are either hunted down and destroyed or sent to the Fulcrum to be trained and used by the empire Imagine Hogwarts if Hogwarts treated its students like chattel The world Jemisin creates is as horrific as it is brilliant My advice is to give the book at least fifty pages before passing judgment because it takes a while to understand what is going on There is a lot of terminology to get used to and the book is told in three intertwining narratives that at first don t seem to match up but once you get into the world and into the story it is a fantastically rewarding read I can t say much about the plot without giving away some of the wonderful surprises but if you want to read about a truly dystopian world that holds a mirror to the darkest of human motivations this novel will haunt you long after you finish it
