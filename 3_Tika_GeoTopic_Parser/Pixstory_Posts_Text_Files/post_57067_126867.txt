The urge to always focus on something negative can make your brain feel exhausted and always inclined towards the same kind of thoughts This can eventually lead to mental health problems making is difficult to deal with any situation as you have this knack for seeing darkness even if the light is abundant But this needs to be resolved to build a positive outlook on life and other things around you We often hear about self help and that no one can help us until we take little steps Undoubtedly this is true However how we perceive things what we learn from our surroundings and how we prepare ourselves for a situation depends on us So we need to look more into the thoughts that run in our minds and avoid negative self talk to aggravate them If you stop your negative thoughts whenever they begin it will help you fight the negativity bias When you ruminate on things look for an uplifting activity to pull yourself out of this negative mindset If you find yourself mentally reviewing some unpleasant event or outcome consciously try to redirect your attention elsewhere and engage in an activity that brings you joy Most importantly be grateful and give more importance to every little happiness that comes to you Though negative emotions are quickly stored in our brains if efforts are put to get the same effect as positive ones things will change
