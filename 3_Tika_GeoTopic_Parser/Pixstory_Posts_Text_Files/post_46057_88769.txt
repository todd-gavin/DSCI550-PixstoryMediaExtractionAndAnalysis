Citizens of the officially recognised Native American tribes in the United States have always relied on their tribes for news and information that affects their everyday lives because they have long been ignored by mainstream media Via news reported that tribal governments were prohibited from making or enforcing any law abridging the freedom of expression or of the press under the Indian Civil Rights Act ICRA Many tribes have statutes protecting First Amendment rights but enforcement may be inadequate and federal courts have no authority over civil rights abuses because tribes are sovereign In a article titled Protecting the First Amendment in Indian Country late Yakama journalist Richard LaCourse listed a number of interfering actions tribal governments can take to stifle press freedom including hiring unqualified reporters based on blood relation or political unity firing staff cutting funds censoring stories before publication and blocking access to tribal government records and proceedings The Native American Journalists Association or NAJA started the Red Press Initiative in asking members about the state of press freedom in their areas Not surprisingly A third said they were sometimes or always required to get tribal leadership s approval before publishing stories nearly a quarter said tribal government records and financial information were probably not open to journalists and nearly half said they had been intimidated or harassed by tribal officials or community members
