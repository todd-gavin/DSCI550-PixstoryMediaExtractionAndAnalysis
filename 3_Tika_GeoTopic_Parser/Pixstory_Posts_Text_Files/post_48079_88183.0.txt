May Allah forgive all your Sin and make you innocent as a new born baby. May this Shab-e-Barat, Allah bless you with more good than lasts and make your heart full with knowledge of deen. Letâ€™s pray for the forgiveness of Night and ask almighty Allah, the creator, to forgive our sins and make ourselves pure. ðŸŒ™
