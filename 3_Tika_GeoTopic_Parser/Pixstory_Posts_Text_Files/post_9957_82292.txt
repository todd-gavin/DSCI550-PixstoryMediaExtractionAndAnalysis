 year old Haidar has been trapped since days in a meter deep dry well in a village in Zabul province in southeastern Afghanistan where an operation is underway to rescue the child a we learned Thursday from an official source The exact circumstances of the child s fall into the well which was dry and earthy were not known at this stage Thursday in videos broadcast on social networks we see the young Afghan named Haidar dressed in a blue jumper sitting stuck at the bottom of the well shoulders against the wall and who can visibly move his arms and upper body slightly The images were obtained by a camera lowered with a wire into the cavity In one of the videos we hear the child crying and moaning and in another we hear him talking with his father in a more distant voice Haidar speak with me we are trying to get you out Are you okay my son Talk to me and don t cry we re working to get you out the father says Okay I ll keep talking the boy replies in a small plaintive voice Excavators opened large trenches in the earth to try to access the well The accident is reminiscent of that in early February in Morocco of little Rayan who fell to the bottom of a dry well and was found lifeless after five days of relentless efforts by rescuers
