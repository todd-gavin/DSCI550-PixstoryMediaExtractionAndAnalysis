Two four six eight bog in don t wait As children we learn numbers can either be even or odd And there are many ways to categorise numbers as even or odd We may memorise the rule that numbers ending in or are odd while numbers ending in or are even Or we may divide a number by where any whole number outcome means the number is even otherwise it must be odd Similarly when dealing with real world objects we can use pairing If we have an unpaired element left over that means the number of objects was odd Until now odd and even categorisation also called parity classification had never been shown in non human animals In a new study published today in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution we show honeybees can learn to do this Why is parity categorisation special Parity tasks such as odd and even categorisation are considered abstract and high level numerical concepts in humans Interestingly humans demonstrate accuracy speed language and spatial relationship biases when categorising numbers as odd or even For example we tend to respond faster to even numbers with actions performed by our right hand and to odd numbers with actions performed by our left hand We are also faster and more accurate when categorising numbers as even compared to odd And research has found children typically associate the word even with right and odd with left These studies suggest humans may have learnt biases and or innate biases regarding odd and even numbers which may have arisen either through evolution cultural transmission or a combination of both It isn t obvious why parity might be important beyond its use in mathematics so the origins of these biases remain unclear Understanding if and how other animals can recognise or can learn to recognise odd and even numbers could tell us more about our own history with parity Training bees to learn odd and even Studies have shown honeybees can learn to order quantities perform simple addition and subtraction match symbols with quantities and relate size and number concepts Read more
