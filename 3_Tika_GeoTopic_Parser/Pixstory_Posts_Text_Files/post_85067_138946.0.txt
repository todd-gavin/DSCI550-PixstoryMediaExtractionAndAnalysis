France went on to draw their match against Uruguay and they lost against Denmark 2-0 to get shockingly eliminated from the Group Stage itself. Back then, it was a rare event for the defending champions to be eliminated from Group Stages but it eventually developed into a curse for the 2000s. Ever since then, the defending champions in any FIFA World Cup edition have not been able to make it past the group stages. It happened in 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018. 
Senegal capitalised on the momentum that the win in the first match gave them and they played phenomenally in their remaining matches. They drew both matches and thus qualified for the Knockout stages as the second team from Group A. They faced Sweden in the Round of 16 and ended up winning 2-1 in that match as well. It was only in the Quarterfinal that they ultimately lost their match against Turkey and got eliminated from the tournament. 
Whatever the outcome, Senegal absolutely won over the hearts of every football fan with their performances in the 2002 World Cup, especially considering the fact that it was their first-ever World Cup! Senegal have played in a total of 2 World Cups so far (2002 and 2018) and they have impressed fans on both occasions. Many are considering them as the dark horses of the 2022 World Cup as well. They have recently won the AFCON Trophy and are currently the best African nation. They can do wonders at Qatar.
