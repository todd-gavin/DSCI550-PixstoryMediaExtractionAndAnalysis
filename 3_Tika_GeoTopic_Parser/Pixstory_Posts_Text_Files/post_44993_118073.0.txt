Ravel Morrison, a former Manchester United starlet, has reconnected with Wayne Rooney after
being signed by D.C. United on a free transfer. His contract has a 2023 expiration date with a
2024 extension option. The two guys were teammates at Old Trafford, and Morrison last year
also played for Derby County under Rooney.

Morrison's contract with the Rams expired, and he was released; nevertheless, he has since
followed his previous manager to Audi Field.

Rooney joined D.C. United as manager on July 12
after finishing his career with the MLS team. Since then, he has been hard at work recruiting
players to help the team advance.

Over the course of his 12-year career, Morrison has played for 13 different teams, beginning
with a brief time at Old Trafford from 2010 to 2012. He currently plays for D.C. United. The
29-year-old also played for West Ham and Sheffield United in the Premier League while on
Lazio's roster in Italy from 2015 to 2019.

Despite Derby's relegation from the Championship, Morrison excelled for them last season,
registering four goals and four assists in 36 games.

For D.C. United, who have formally started the team's rebuild under Rooney, Morrison is a
gamble worth taking. With the arrival of Morrison, who reunites with Rooney, the revamp that
started with the deal to transfer Julian Gressel to Vancouver is continuing.

To put it mildly, Morrison's career has been up and down, but he performed admirably under
Rooney at Derby and is currently seeking some stability under the former Manchester United
player. Morrison will join a midfield core that includes Russell Canouse, Chris Durkin, and
Moses Nyeman in D.C.'s anticipated 4-2-3-1 style under Rooney.
