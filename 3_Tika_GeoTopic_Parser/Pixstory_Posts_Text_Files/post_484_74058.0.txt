Government however was quick to deny the breach saying prima facie no evidence found . 
In a press release ministry of health said “there have been several media reports claiming that the data stored in Co-WIN portal has been leaked online.
It is clarified that no data has leaked from Co-WIN portal and the entire data of residents is safe and secure on this digital platform”.
The release also clarified that while Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare will enquire into the substance of the news, prima facie the assertion is not correct, as Co-WIN collects neither the address of the person nor the RT-PCR test results for COVID-19 vaccination.

Earlier also in June 2021 similar news about CoWIN app's COVID-19 Vaccination data of 15 crore users leaked and up for sale hit headlines Government had even than denied the breach.
