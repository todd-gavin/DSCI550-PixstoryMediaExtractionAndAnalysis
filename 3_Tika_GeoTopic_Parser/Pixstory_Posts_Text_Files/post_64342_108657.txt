Hi everyone My name is Ragini Gambhir I love to read books One of my favourites include Harry Potter written by J K Rowling I feel that I am a responsible person always committed to my work Some of my strengths include time management good communication skills leadership qualities etc One weakness that I would like to overcome in myself is that I tend to be overly critical of myself Whenever I complete a project I can t help but feel that I could have done more even if my work received a positive response This often leads me to overwork myself and leaves me feeling burned out
