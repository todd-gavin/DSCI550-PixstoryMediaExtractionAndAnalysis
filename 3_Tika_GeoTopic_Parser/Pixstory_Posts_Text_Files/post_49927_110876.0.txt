The highlight of the latest hearing of the Jan 6 committee was the blockbuster testimony from Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson.
Hutchinson has cooperated well with the investigation. She disclosed how then-President Donald Trump and his inner circle were warned about the potential for violence on January 6, and how Trump needed to join the crowds of his supporters at the US Capitol.

She said Trump was told that morning that weapons were being seized from some of his supporters who came for his rally. Later, when Trump and his team were at the Ellipse  Trump barked out orders to his staffers to "take the mags away" -- citing the metal detectors -- because the people in the crowd, "they're not here to hurt me."

Trump also said, "I don't f**king care that they have weapons," according to Hutchinson. This is the very same Trump who encouraged the same crowd to march to the Capitol while lawmakers were asserting Biden's win.

Moreover, Trump intended to go to the Capitol and pushed to do so until the last minute
 before the violence began to escalate.
It was previously known t the committee that Trump wanted to go to the Capitol, but Hutchinson's testimony solidified for the first time that people around Trump had a prior understanding of this plan!
