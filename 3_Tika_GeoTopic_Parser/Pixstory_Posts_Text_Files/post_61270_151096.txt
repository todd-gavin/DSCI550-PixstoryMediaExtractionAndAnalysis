Plan A Plan B is a rom com that wants us to believe in happily ever afters It is the story about a divorce lawyer Kosti played by Riteish Deshmukh and a matchmaker Nirali played by Tamannaah Bhatia who both happen to work together in a co working space And as you would have guessed by now both of them can t tolerate each other for even a second since they both live in an opposite worldWhile the storyline wasn t so bad the film is a constant reminder that how good the movie could ve turned if it were written by other writers Although we are used to seeing Deshmukh as a comic character who adds the fun part in his movies this film sees him as a uptight and nerdy character The film would have turned out pretty good if the story wouldn t have been so obvious and only if the film didn t lack on the humour department
