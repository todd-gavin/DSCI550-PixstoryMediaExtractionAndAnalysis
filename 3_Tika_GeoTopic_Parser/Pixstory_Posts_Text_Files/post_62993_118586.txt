I can t believe I m having to say this in but seriously stop trying to discipline your kids through fear It doesn t bring discipline it brings anxiety It s important to realize why children should not be scared of their own parents Their home should be their safe haven where they come from a tiring day to relax To feel safe Not to be anxious walking on eggshells just trying to dodge being bullied Whether your kid is well mannered or cranky you re not supposed to yell at them and especially not hit them They re kids you re the adult You re supposed to have control You can t expect them to be disciplined while you can t do that for your own self That s hypocritical
