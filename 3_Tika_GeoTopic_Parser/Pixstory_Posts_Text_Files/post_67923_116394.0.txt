The Commando Star and the team of the sequel of Khuda Haafiz visited our Campus to promote their movie, needless to say,the event was sensational for the students and staff at College.

The event was held in our campus auditorium which was jam packed with students full of excitement .The venue filled with cheers and clasps on the team's arrival .Everyone present rushed towards the stage to get one look of Vidyut Jammwal's well built physique and attractive personality.Aur maze ki baat toh ye thi ki ladkiyon se jyada toh ladko ke cheers the,they couldn't stop gushing over his looks and built.

But even though Vidyut was the megastar of this event,the surprise apperance of the 'Raataan Lambiyan' singer,Asees kaur,who introduced herself singing few lines of the song itself had us all mesmerised.Later on,she along with Vidyut sang 'Jaan ban gaye' the latest from Khuda Haafiz ,and we all joined in too.

It was amazing to witness and interact with these celebrities. Towards the end the lucky ones also caught merch T-shirts with the print "I train like Vidyut Jammwal".

I would like to end this post with something Vidyut Jammwal said to us ,which is really inspiring "Sapna aisa dekho jo kisine na dekha ho,aur usse pura karne jee-jaan se kaam karo".
