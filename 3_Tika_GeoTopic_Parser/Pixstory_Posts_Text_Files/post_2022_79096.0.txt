3k US troops are now en route to the Eastern Front near Ukraine. 

Tensions between Russia and the US are high. This is serious business. 

And yet I daresay not many Americans could tell you why American blood and treasure are on the line for a nation half a world away. 

I personally think our national security interests warrant this attention. We should care about this Russian threat to a NATO ally. 

But it is the Presidentâ€™s job to explain that dynamic to his constituents. Americans need to hear from Biden - and more than a few times.  Because if lives are lost in the cause of freedom, the incidents will seem like a waste. 

Biden and his White House must do more here.
