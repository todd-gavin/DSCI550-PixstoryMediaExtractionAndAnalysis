Group B

Teams: England, U.S.A, Iran and UEFA Playoff Winner 1 (Wales/Scotland/Ukraine)

England got lucky in the World Cup draw as they were with U.S and Iran along with the playoff winners. England have recently made it to the semifinals of FIFA 2018 WC and Euro 2020 finals. We expect them to go past the group stage comfortably. On the other hand, the U.S.A have struggled while qualifying and will hope to sort it out before November. 

Iran, under Skocic, are a hungry side and will look to leave an impact. They conceded just four in the last ten games and will hope to repeat the same despite a huge change in terms of quality. 
Expected Group Winner: England
Surprise Element: Iran

Group C

Teams: Argentina, Mexico, Poland and Saudi Arabia

It is the last chance for the Argentine talisman to lead his country in the quadrennial tournament. On the other hand, it might be the best opportunity as the team has built over the last four years. Lionel Scaloni has unified the pieces and there is no more chaos. 

Mexico struggled in the qualifying stages but were able to go past the line. Also, the team has not qualified beyond the Round of 16 in the last seven appearances. This is something that they will look to avoid this year. Poland had a poor campaign in FIFA World Cup 2018 and Euro 2020 with early exits from the tournament. However, the team showed some grit to qualify for the World Cup by registering a win in the play-offs. 

Saudi Arabia look like a weaker side in the group but never count them out. Herve Renard’s side will hope to be a stumble for the major sides in the quadrennial event. 
Expected Group Winner: Argentina
Surprise Element: Saudi Arabia
