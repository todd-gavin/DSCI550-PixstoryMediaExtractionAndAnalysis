Canva is one of the most simple yet best available online and free designing platform. Most of us don't know that it has an option of removing the background too.
Simple click on the image, go to "Effects" tab and select "Background Remover". The application will automatically remove the background and now you can easily create your beach image without even being on the beach :D
