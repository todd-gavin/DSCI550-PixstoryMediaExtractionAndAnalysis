Self-reflection is one of the most important steps in personal growth. It's through self-analysis that we can identify our strengths and weaknesses, as well as learn from our mistakes. And, importantly, thanking ourselves for all the progress we've made is a great way to motivate ourselves throughout the day.
There are many reasons why thank yourself every day: it makes you feel good mentally and physically, it reinforces your positive habits and values, and it helps to improve your mental focus. By recognizing your accomplishments—and taking time to appreciate them—you increase motivation and drive towards achieving future goals. 
So next time you find yourself struggling with something big or small, take a few minutes out of your schedule to say thanks to yourself. You'll be glad you did!
