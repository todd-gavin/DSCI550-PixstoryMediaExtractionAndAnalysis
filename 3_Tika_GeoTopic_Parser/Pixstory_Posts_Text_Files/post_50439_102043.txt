People s ability to avoid or cope with the health impacts of air pollution is influenced by their socio economic status i e income level and employment status Lower income households are generally more vulnerable to the health effects of air pollution both because of potentially greater exposure and because of increased susceptibility to its negative health consequences This might be because they are in poorer health to start with have limited access to high quality health care are more exposed to other risk factors like smoking and have limited ability to invest in protective measures such as air filtration systems and better housing quality Socioeconomically disadvantaged groups may be more exposed to indoor air pollution because they lack access to cleaner energy sources for heating In addition people in lower socio professional categories may be exposed to higher levels of pollution in workplaces Having said that socio economic disadvantage does not always correlates with air pollution exposure in the expected direction as in some cases wealthier households may prefer to live in more central and more polluted parts of cities Cournane et al European Environment Agency
