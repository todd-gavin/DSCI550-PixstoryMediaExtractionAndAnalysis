The World Health Organisation recognises World Mental Health Day on 10 October every year.
The theme of 2022's World Mental Health Day, set by the World Federation for Mental Health, is 'Make mental health and wellbeing for all a global priority'.
World Mental Health Day is also a chance to talk about mental health in general, how we need to look after it, and how important it is to talk about things and get help if you are struggling.
“A day dedicated to mental health renews the focus on the subject. The large number of activities, events and talks conducted on this day provide a boost to mental health awareness,” says Mumbai-based psychiatrist Dr Harish Shetty.
