After a moment of brilliance against Atletico Madrid, the midfielder received a lot of plaudits.

Former Manchester City defender Joleon Lescott praised Phil Foden, describing the midfielder
as "the best English player of all time."

On Tuesday, Foden came off the bench to find Kevin De Bruyne for the lone goal in City's 1-0
Champions League victory over Atletico Madrid. With so many trophies already under his belt,
Lescott believes Foden is on his way to having the best career of any England player ever.

“Phil Foden is associated with Man City and I know what it means for him to play for the club,"
Lescott told BT Sport. "If he continues at this rate, he goes down as the best English player of
all time with two trophies a season.

"His mentality sets him apart. If you compare him with someone like Wayne Rooney, you can
see players who are hurt when they don’t win. He is obsessed, I love what I do but he needs to
do it.

"We had to remove the balls from the hotel because you could not get him off the training
ground as he wants to improve all the time."
With Manchester City, the 21-year-old has already won ten trophies, including three Premier
League titles with a fourth on the way.

He's also established himself as a key player for England, earning 15 caps ahead of the World
Cup this winter. Despite not turning 22 until May, Foden has 42 goals in 159 games for Man
City.
