The site lies on a detour from the road leading to the Barabar Caves from the Patna Gaya Road near Bela It is sad to see that important sculptures have not been properly documented and the site has been almost neglected Several beautiful and some unfinished sculptures can be found lying in the fields totally neglected in a walk around the nearby village The place seems to have been extremely important as a religious site in ancient history Nothing is known of the group of men who sculpted such beautiful images on granite A lot of research is required as Hiuen Tsang is silent about these works as he is about the famous nearby caves of Barabar whose importance has been retraced from the inscriptions Concluded
