People with Thalassemia are themselves prone to receive regular blood transfusion. But surprisingly, some types of Thalassemia patients can still donate blood.

Thalassemia minor people are eligible to donate blood. Thalassemia minor people are less prone to the severe complications and do not require regular blood transfusions.

In thalassemia minor only one gene is mutated (inherited from only one parent), which makes the person a thalassemia carrier and thus is less prone to the severe form of the disease.

In a milder or minor form of thalassemia, the symptoms are either very mild anemia or not visible at all. Mild anaemia in thalassemia minor with normal haemoglobin levels makes him eligible to donate blood. 

Any person willing to donate blood must meet the specified criteria and have the required haemoglobin level. The medical history is taken into account and tests are carried out to make sure that the person does not have anaemia. Persons with thalassemia minor (thalassemia carriers or thalassemia trait) can donate blood, if they meet the required criteria.
