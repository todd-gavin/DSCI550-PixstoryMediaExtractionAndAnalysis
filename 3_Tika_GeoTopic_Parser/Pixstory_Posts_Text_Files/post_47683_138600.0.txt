New Delhi: Multi-starrer film “Brahmastra: Part One-Shiva”, slated to release this Friday, is expected to provide much-needed respite to the Hindi box office in the second quarter of the financial year 2023. So far, Q2FY23 is proving to be the worst quarter since 2016 for the Hindi box office.
Directed by Ayan Mukerji, "Brahmastra" features Ranbir Kapoor in the lead alongside Alia Bhatt, megastar Amitabh Bachchan, Nagarjuna and Mouni Roy.
Karan Taurani of security research firm Elara Capital said that the film is expected to have a strong opening in the range of Rs 20-22 crore net with lifetime Box Office collection estimated to be in a wide range of Rs 130-200 crore basis the strong advances. 
“We believe a positive word of mouth and audience acceptance can help the film breach the upper end. It will be tough to provide any concrete estimates unless we get to know reviews, as most recent estimates have been revised downwards post reviews. Hope it’s the other way round (positive side) for Brahmastra as it’s a very large franchise movie and Hindi Box Office desperately needs a hit movie,” Taurani said.
Being a sci-fi film dubbed in multiple languages, the film will get strong support from regional markets too and dubbed language collection for Brahmastra may be in the range of 15-20% of overall net Box Office, said Taurani. 
Brahmastra is the first sci-fi-based Hindi franchise and augurs well as the audience wants to watch large-scale content in cinemas with visual effects. The film has seen strong acceptance/ advances in the premium format screens (Imax, 3D etc), given the nature of its content.
