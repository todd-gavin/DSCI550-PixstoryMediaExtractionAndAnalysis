Our nomadic tribe had an unmarried daughter who was seventy years old.
She was an old woman who never married. He always had a bag around his neck, a piece of map with sand or dirt inside.
He always hung the map around his neck, taking it with him wherever he went.
I was always looking for the answer, what's in that bag? Why is a map so important to him?
One day I saw that he was sitting on the edge of his eyes and tears were flowing from his eyes. He put his cane beside him and stared at the hill in front of him.
I sat next to him; With a sense of ignorance, I asked like a young girl: Why are you crying, aunt?
He said nothing and smiled.
I wanted to talk to him, he told me about his pain. I wanted him to answer my questions. I took the opportunity to ask him about the small map he had on his neck.
Until I mentioned the name of the map, his eyes widened and he said: What do you want from my map?
I tried to answer him kindly: calm down is nothing; I just wanted to talk.
Behsuim stared at me and opened the story. Behsuim was staring and playing the reed. It was so beautiful that I could not hear the sound of it. His looks, calmness and singing took my heart with him.
I fell in love, I could not wait all night after the first meeting. The next day I came back to the same spring â€Œ. He was there again on that hill, starting to play with his cub again. These charms continued. We were two moments in the clutches of a wolf in the name of love. We had no way to escape. I was losing his heart more and more every day and he was my impatience!
Until I wanted him to come to the suitor. He also came. He came but my father was not satisfied, we were Pashtun nomads, and my grandfather was a nomad. But he was just a shepherd boy and anonymous.
