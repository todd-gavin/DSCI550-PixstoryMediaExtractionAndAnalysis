Minister for Superannuation Jane Hume has conceded the Coalition's recently announced first home buyer policy would increase house prices "temporarily".

The campaign promise to allow first home buyers to dip into their super to help pay for a home deposit has been criticised by economists and the opposition as a policy that would only drive up house prices further.

Under the plan, people who have saved a 5 per cent deposit will be able to access up to 40 per cent of their superannuation, capped at $50,000, but must return the amount taken out, plus capital gains, if they sell the house.

"We know that people will probably bring forward some of their decisions to buy a house earlier and for that reason it will probably push prices temporarily," Senator Hume said.

When asked how much prices would rise, Senator Hume said there were always a number of factors that drove price increases. 

"What we know that interest rates play a big effect, housing supply plays an enormous effect, that’s why it’s important to play all ends," she said.

Mr Morrison said any impact on house prices would be cancelled out by the Coalition's other policy pitch to encourage older Australians to downsize.

"The balance of policies we have … means we're freeing up housing stock with our downsizing policy," he said.

"We think [this] minimises any potential impact on house prices."

The policy of allowing people to access their super has been tossed around for years without much luck.

It was floated back in 2017 when Scott Morrison was treasurer and dismissed by then-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who in 2021 called it "the craziest idea I've heard".

Economist Saul Eslake said the Coalition scheme would do nothing to address the root causes of housing affordability.

"My initial reaction was that I wanted to scream that this reckless inflation of house prices must stop," he said.
