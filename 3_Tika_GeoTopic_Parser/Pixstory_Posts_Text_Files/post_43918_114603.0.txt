Lionel Messi, Angel Di Mara, Gio Lo Celso, Julián lvarez, and Matas Soulé all wore the brand-new Argentina national team jersey that Adidas unveiled on Friday. Additionally, the typeface and numbers have been made public.

The jersey will be worn by the reigning Copa América champions at the championship match later this year. The new kit's pictures were released by Roy Nemer.

The new top is a stylish effort from Adidas and has a few small variations on the traditional 
Argentina stripes.

Basically it is a white shirt with bands of sky blue, as we would anticipate from La Albiceleste.

The adidas emblem, which lacks the letters "adidas" beneath, and shoulder stripes are only two of the black accents on the design. The German outfitter's latest national team design trend appears to be the use of just the three-stripe symbol on the right chest.

A black stripe wraps around the back bottom hemline and runs down either side of the jersey. 

Black ring-neck collar that thickens as it wraps around the back to create a fake polo effect and black sleeve cuffs complete the outfit.

A delicate subtle diagonal dash pattern that runs the length of the top gives the design some added texture. The shirt's primary vertical stripe on the back is by far its strongest design element. With a center white stripe that runs the full body of the shirt and extends over the collar, it is divided into two blue stripes. The national symbol of Argentina (and Uruguay)—the "Sol de Mayo"—is a tiny, gold-embossed vinyl patch on the back collar that gives the of a vertically hanging flag.

The flag feature on the back of the shirt is an excellent design element, and the black fringe was a terrific option that always makes the entire shirt sparkle. This beautiful jersey, which has a classic appearance with a touch of modern flare, is perfect for one of the world's top national teams.
