Coronavirus virus is on its last legs in New Zealand, but a vaccine mandate has some sections of society up in arms. Anti-vaccine protesters pelted police with stones and threw "acid" which resulted in the hospitalisation of some police.

The demonstrators opposed to the country's vaccine mandate, inspired by Canadian protesters, have camped in the state's capital Wellington, with cars parked in central vista and living under the sky bringing the city to a virtual standstill.

New Zealand was presented as a model for protecting its citizens against Covid when the world was grappling with the virus in 2020 and 2021. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's strict implementation of lockdowns and international border closure for well over a year meant that the country didn't have to undergo devastating consequences of the pandemic like much of the world. Although the Delta variant sneaked in and spread fast, the virus was still controlled. New Zealand reported just 56 virus deaths with a population of 5 million.

Why has this spread, even if the protesters form a minority. Some experts blame "fake news" on the "dangers" of vaccines and freedom of choice, both exports from the U.S.

Like in Canada and other countries, the protesters include vaccine skeptics, far-right conspiracy theorists and those who lost their jobs because of long lockdown. (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/23/world/australia/new-zealand-protest-vaccine.html)

There is already talk of a Canada-like emergency to deal with the situation. But the government of Ardern is also looking for a way out that would not involve violence.
