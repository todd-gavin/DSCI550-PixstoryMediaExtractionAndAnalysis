Objectives In acute coronary syndrome ACS patients the focus is on major conventional risk factors CRF diabetes hypertension elevated low density cholesterol LDL C and smoking whereas others specific metabolic risk factors MRF high density lipoprotein cholesterol HDL C body mass index BMI waist hip ratio WHR and triglycerides and HbA c get less attention Methods This is a prospective case control observational study from tertiary care hospitals in India CRF and MRF in patients presenting with first incidence of ACS n were compared with matched controls n Results Propensity score matching PSM yielded cases and matched controls Risk factor prevalence in cases vs controls were CRF hypertension vs P diabetes vs P smoking vs P and elevated LDL C vs P MRF BMI vs P waist hip ratio vs P high HbA C vs P low HDL C vs P and elevated triglycerides vs P Adjusted Odds ratios by multivariate analysis were CRF hypertension P diabetes P high LDL C P and smoking P MRF waist hip ratio P high HbA c P low HDL C P and elevated triglycerides P Conclusion In India the risk of ACS conferred by specific metabolic risk factors High waist hip ratio Low HDL C and High HbA c is comparable to that caused by CRF Keywords Metabolic risk factorsAcute coronary syndromediabetesBody Mass Index
