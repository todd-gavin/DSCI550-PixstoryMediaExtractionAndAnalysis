Karan Johar's most loved show 'Koffee with Karan' will hit the screens on 7th this month.
Star couple Aishwarya & Abhishek will be seen on the koffee counch this month.

One of the hot topics that Karan discussed with the pair was Aishwarya's best co star. Abhishek was asked to pick his favourite one for her beloved wife where he said that he found Ash and Rajnikant's chemistry the best and when asked the reason, he said, " “Because he is just the dude, man."

He further added, " I have seen Duggu (Hrithik Roshan) and her together, and I think they make a wonderful pair. But unfortunately for both of them…what happens with somebody like Hrithik is that you find him so good-looking, you find it difficult to go past that. And when he is coupled with her, who is also the most sensational-looking person on Earth, it’s very difficult to go beyond the looks and look into the great work that they do. I think, with Shah Rukh, there was raw energy which was very nice and interesting. But, I think, with Rajini's uncle, it’s just fantastic. I loved Robot." Well, Abhishek is the most secure husband and expressed that he has no qualms about his wifey working with any actor in the world. 

Well, I do agree with Abhishek that these are some of the best co stars Aishwarya has worked with, what are you thoughts?
