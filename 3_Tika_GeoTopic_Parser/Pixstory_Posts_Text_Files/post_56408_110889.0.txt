Even in a healthy relationship, you might be feeling anxious. You might have been in a relationship with mutual respect, and communication, but still you may feel anxious. 

The reasons can be your past trauma which has not made you feel unsafe. So a safe and healthy environment might seem scary to you and you might succumb to what you are used to. 

You can be hypervigilant and constantly scan for threats and get triggered by small actions. You might feel you are worthless resulting in idealizing your partner and giving negative shade to yourself. You will be vulnerable and be attached anxiously-fearing your partner might leave you or avoidantly attached-scary of commitments or attachments. 

You can always communicate with your partner and amend the relationship, consider talking to a therapist and also know yourself and treat yourself well.
