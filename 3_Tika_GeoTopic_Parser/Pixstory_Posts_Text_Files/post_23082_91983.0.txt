Earlier today I got thinking about whose fault is it when it comes to drifts? Is it something we did or were we just not good enough anymore? Were they the toxic ones or were we? Were they good riddance or are we good riddance?

I could not figure out the answers to the above question. Should we just accept its our fault that caused the drift and not theirs? But even if its not our fault, we would be going over those events in our heads over and over again.

Why do we do that? Well, in my case, these people who we drifted from meant too much in our lives. They made everything seem easy and conquerable. I miss my best friend in college, I do.

We have our lives now but how did we let it get bigger than our friendship? All I can say is that it sucks to do things alone. Not that I don't have friends but it seems like I have not been able to change as quickly as everyone else.

I have been told countless times that we should not live in the past but many do that and it turns out, I am no different either.

I had a talk with someone wiser than I am and they say that its just life that has happened which led me and my BFF to drift apart and there is no one to blame here

I am happy for her and I guess, it is time to be happy for myself as well. And maybe, we would have to accept the fact that we have changed—whether we like it or not. And there is no fault in that. We change and so do the people around us and that's okay.

We are allowed to change. I am happy where I am and so is my BFF. And I only want the best for her. I have memories—and that shall do just fine.
