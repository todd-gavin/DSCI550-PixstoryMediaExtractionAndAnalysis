Barcelona will suffer not only mentally but also financially if they fail to breach the group stage in the ongoing UEFA Champions League As per reports published by Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo Barca will lose around million if they fail to reach the quarter finals of the tournament If the Spanish giants reach the next stage they would bank million followed by another million for reaching the quarter finals A ticket to the semi finals would add a further million An additional or million for ending up as runners up or winners respectively The Spanish club spent a massive million in the recent summer transfer window to bolster their squad and compete in all the tournaments Notably they had a poor outing last season as they were forced into the Europa League When the rebuilding was being done it was expected that the new squad would reach at least the last eight of the Champions League Fans also got hope in Xavi Hernandez s vision and new resources However things aren t going their way as they are on the verge of getting knocked out in the group stage once again The Blaugrana failed to beat Inter Milan on Wednesday at Camp Nou in a very crucial game How can Barcelona still qualify for the next round Following the draw Barcelona are finding themselves in a tricky situation as their fate is no longer in their own hands If Milan manage to beat Viktoria Plzen or Bayern Munich Xavi s side will automatically be sidelined However even if Milan fail to win their games Barcelona will be required to win both of their remaining games to throw themselves into contention Obviously the chances are very minimal for Barcelona to proceed to the next round They are likely to be demoted to the Europa League for the second consecutive season
