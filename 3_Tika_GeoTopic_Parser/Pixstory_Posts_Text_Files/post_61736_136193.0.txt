The soul within a human body requires as much attention as the body itself. Spirituality or Islamic Sufism means giving attention to it. When a person reflects on who he/she is outside the influence of people, society, and civilization he/she will definitely see that he is not his profession no matter how much he/she likes it. He is not his qualification whether happily or unhappily obtained. Who he/she is then? Let's exclude the people in one's life be it his family or friends. Outside name and genealogy who he/she is?  A person is kind, generous, brave, compassionate, intelligent, realistic etcetera or ……is he/she the opposite!!  Everyone has both good (spirituality) and evil in them. No one is perfect. In life be it student days, profession, relations, or solitude ….. Every moment of our life we are defined by the (spiritual) choices we make.
