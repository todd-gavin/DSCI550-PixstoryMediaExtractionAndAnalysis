The Delhi Police apprehended at least 33 AIMIM activists and residents on Thursday morning for allegedly causing a ruckus outside the Parliament Street police station. An FIR has been filed against the demonstrators, according to DCP (New Delhi) Amrutha Guguloth. The activists were holding a rally demanding that Nupur Sharma, a former BJP spokesperson, be arrested for allegedly making anti-Muslim remarks.

"We were peacefully demonstrating here," AIMIM Delhi President Kaleemul Hafeez stated. Nupur Sharma and Naveen Jindal are not seen by the cops. They've got an issue with us. We're not doing anything improper, and we're opposing Sharma's anti-Muslim remarks."
