Binge-watching is a concept of the 21 st century, which means watching a series or a genre of movies in a stretch. Is it worth it? 73% of Americans admit to binge-watching, with the average binge lasting three hours and eight minutes. 90% of millennials and 87% of Gen Z stated they binge-watch, and 40% of those age groups binge-watch an average of six episodes of television in one sitting. 

Binge watching however can lead to mental health issues. According is a survey by the University of Texas, binge-watchers were more likely to be depressed or long or have less self-control. Binge-watching can be so obsessive that they might not accept any relationship with others which increases procrastination in other aspects of life.

 Night binge-watching can also build the habit of not sleeping or having a healthy sleeping routine.  The body doesn't discriminate pleasure- like anything that gives pleasure Binge-watching can lead to addiction. A study found that rather than relieving stress, excessive TV watching is associated with regret, guilt, and feelings of failure because of a sense of wasted time.

 Some people mourn over their loss of time or the end of the show and might feel an emptiness inside. There can be more stress and anxiety than pleasure.
