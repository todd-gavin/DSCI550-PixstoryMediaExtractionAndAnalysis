Washington Post was presented with the Pulitzer Prize for public service on Monday for its coverage of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and its aftermath. Pulitzer Prize is considered the highest honour in American Journalism. The prize honours the contribution of more than 100 journalists across the Post’s newsroom, many of whom contributed reporting from the Capitol grounds that day as well as others who investigated the security failures that added to the crisis, the human costs of the attack and the larger ramifications for the nation.

Washington Post executive editor Sally Buzbee said: “I’m enormously pleased and very honoured that the whole breadth and sweep of the Post coverage is what was recognized,”

According to Washington Post, several editors agreed that the Post was unusually well-positioned to follow the story. While every other national news organization covered the insurrection, The Post — whose slogan is “Democracy Dies in Darkness” — also has a significant reporting staff dedicated to covering the District and surrounding region, including local events with national significance. 

The Washington Post has formerly won the public service prize five times — first in 1973 for its coverage of the Watergate investigation and most recently in 2014, an award it shared with The Guardian for disclosures about the National Security Agency’s global surveillance program. It is good to see the efforts of journalists being acknowledged.
