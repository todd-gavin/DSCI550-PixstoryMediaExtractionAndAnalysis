As far as my opinion is concerned, the option to edit a post on any platform should always be available. People occasionally make a variety of spelling and grammar errors that they do not realize until later. Or even recognise that what they tried to convey was badly phrased, and that others misunderstood what they meant.

I have seen tonnes of people wanting to convey a particular thing but ending up poorly wording it and receiving undeserved backlash. Not to mention, it would prevent a lot of misinformation from spreading. For example, how in 2016, Dallas PD ended up tweeting the picture of the wrong man post the deadly attack that killed 5 cops. An edit button would have allowed the police department to not only stop the dissemination of that damaging tweet, but also to amend the record, indicating that the man in the photo had nothing to do with the murder of the police officers.

I personally think an edit button on twitter would be really helpful. I mean, if it's about the integrity of the platform or changing the past—like people would put—there is always an option to mention that the tweet is edited and when it was edited, much like how it is there in the YouTube comments edit feature.

It is not as big of a deal as people are making it. Most social media platforms have an edit button and that has proven to only be helpful. I don't understand the fuss people are making about the twitter edit button.
