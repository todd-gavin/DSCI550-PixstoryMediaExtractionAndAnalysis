A conflict between the Chelsea's and Tottenham Hotspur's manager is getting viral. 
On the left side Thomas Tuchel and Antonio Conte on the right side. The clash after the English Premier League match between Tottenham and Chelsea.
Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel and Tottenham boss Antonio Conte were both sent off at the end of their side's 2-2 draw after clashing in an ill-tempered affair at Stamford Bridge.
Should FIFA add this as the cover of the 23 game edition ? What do you think ? Let me know in the notes...
