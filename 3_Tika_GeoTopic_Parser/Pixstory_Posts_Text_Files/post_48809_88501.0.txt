It is both concerning and disgusting that there are still people out there who think it's ever okay to call for violence on innocent people. I don't understand what kind of God asks his devotees to be so inhumane and merciless. Using scriptures as a cape to cover your own bigotry and rejection of basic human rights is as bad as it gets. If fear is all you have as an argument, maybe your argument isn't as strong as you claim it to be. If there's a God up there, there is no chance He would have people who call for violence be his spokespersons.

People commit so much of what is apparently forbidden in the Bible—from eating pork and shellfish to charging interest on loans—but being gay is where they draw the line? Stigmatizing homosexuality among other things does not make much sense. It is hypocritical. But keeping all of that aside too, how does two consenting adults who have sex with each other harm you? Where is the victim? Immorality requires some kind of harm. However, advocating for the persecution of others solely on the basis of how they naturally are sounds a lot more immoral to me. 

Religion, for the longest time, has been used as a cowardly excuse to oppress and exploit people—from justifying slavery to encouraging misogyny and queerphobia, and it is about time those ways are either reformed or abolished. There is no way someone in a privileged position should be able to decide what happens to those in the marginalized position. There is no excuse to advocate against the basic rights of others—not religion, not culture, not personal opinion. This is ignorant and this kind of nonsense needs to end.
