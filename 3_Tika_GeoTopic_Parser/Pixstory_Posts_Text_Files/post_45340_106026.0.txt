When Greece hosts Cyprus at the Panthessaliko Stadio on Thursday, they will be hoping to make it three victories in a row and extend their advantage at the top of Group C2.

Greece continued their strong start to the Nations League with a 1-0 victory over Kosovo on
Sunday.That outcome came after a 1-0 win against Northern Ireland in the group's first match
last Thursday.Greece now returns home, where they have gone undefeated in eight of their past
nine games, winning four and drawing four.

Cyprus, on the other hand, was held to a goalless draw by Northern Ireland last time out,
denying them their first win of the season.They had already suffered a disheartening 2-0 loss to
Kosovo in their group opener last Thursday.Since a 1-0 victory against Slovenia in the World
Cup qualifications in March 2021, Cyprus has only won one of their past 13 games in all
competitions.
