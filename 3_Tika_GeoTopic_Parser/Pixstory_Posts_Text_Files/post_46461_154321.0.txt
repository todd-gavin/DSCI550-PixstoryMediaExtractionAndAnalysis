Mental health .. what actually it is ?? According to me - Mental health is the impact that our actions , emotions , and thoughts have on our life ! Positive self-image and fulfilling connections with friends and others are correlated with good mental health . Making wise decisions and overcoming obstacles at home , work , and school are much easier when you have strong mental health .
But these day due to many reasons -  Teenagers experiencing issues with their mental health . Do you know ?one in five teenagers experiences a mental health issue at some point during the year . The issues can be minor or serious . Sadly , among teenagers , suicide ranks as the third most common cause of death ! Unfortunately , the majority of young individuals with mental health issues receive no care . There are effective treatments that can benefit people from all racial , ethnic , and cultural backgrounds ! 
But i don't know why people are ashamed of mental health problems and let it go untreated ! Why guys ?? Just imagine - if you broke your leg or came down with pneumonia , you wouldn't let it go untreated . But young people ignore mental health problems thinking they will " snap out of it " or that they are something to be ashamed of ! This kind of thinking prevents people from getting the  help they need . 
But it's high time now ! We all have to change this thinking . Sometimes getting help is a matter of changing your mind . ✨
