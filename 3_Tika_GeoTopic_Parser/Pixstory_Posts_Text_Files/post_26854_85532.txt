Demna Gvasalia is not afraid to take a stand he is not afraid of the economic consequences of gestures because intellectual honesty always rewards Balenciaga presents his Fall Winter collection retracing his experience as a Georgian refugee The Iron Curtain aesthetic that has led to the French maison for years now ago becomes more and more current given the situation Balenciaga has always talked about the social and the models parade under a snowstorm while fleeing with what little they have managed to save towards a better future Leaving fear, terror, blood and despair behind but also memories and what has been earned over a lifetime the representation of an escape from a search for refuge on a painful path towards hope but above all towards everything that is far and different from the prevailing evil A collection denounces but also a love letter to the resistance and fearless resilience of a people Evil does not win succumbs to itself and Demna Gvasalia knows it
