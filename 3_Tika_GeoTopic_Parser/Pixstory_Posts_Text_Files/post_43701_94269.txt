The patient was diagnosed with mild mitral stenosis narrowing of the heart s mitral valve He also had a mass on his neck area which was found to be tuberculous NG felt that the combination of the two was causing the blood in the sputum and a few transfusions along with tubercular treatment would address it He was definitely wary of bringing the guy to the operating table When the patient returned with the same problem I once again reiterated my suggestion of doing a valvotomy a procedure to open up the valve and ease the blood flow This once again fell on deaf ears and the patient was admitted for repeat transfusions which sometimes also help in opening up minor blockages This didn t work The next day I went and stood outside NG s house early in the morning This was a somewhat audacious act as junior doctors we didn t have the liberty of paying house visits to the Head After repeated pleas that I needed to meet him for something urgent his household presented me to him I again went over my rationale for taking a more radical approach a couple of times and he finally agreed though his reluctance was obvious Clearly I d stuck my neck out and this could spell bad tidings if things didn t go well The procedure done in the manner of closed heart surgeries of those days was successful The patient recovered well and the problem vanished From being the stubborn arguer I became a role model who was cited thereafter for his concern for patients astute diagnosis and the ability to stand up for his convictions As for the band waalah he was beside himself with gratitude we d saved his life and his ability to perform and earn He fell at my feet and kept asking what he could do I was mortified and kept mumbling nothing nothing this is my work He then drew himself up and putting his hand on his heart promised aloud that he would perform at my wedding singing the best songs ever Was that to happen As told to Priya Sarkar wife
