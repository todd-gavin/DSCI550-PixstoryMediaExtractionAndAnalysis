The defeat that didn&#39;t help Georgia, which has been wanting to enter the Six Nations for years and claims Italy&#39;s place with a system of relegations and promotions from Six Nations B, defeated the Azzurri for the first time in history. In the Batumi stadium, the hosts they started very strong with two tries and one who immediately put in Italy managed to get back ahead before taking the third try at the end of the first half We go to the locker room then a bad second half full of forward fouls free kicks goal posts and some converted kicks for part In the final minutes, the Georgians secure the result and end up triumphing in front of a very little rugby-oriented crowd. Not much will change in the Six Nations key but in the meantime this defeat is not positive for Italian rugby and for those who criticize it in Europe starting from by the Anglo-Saxons
