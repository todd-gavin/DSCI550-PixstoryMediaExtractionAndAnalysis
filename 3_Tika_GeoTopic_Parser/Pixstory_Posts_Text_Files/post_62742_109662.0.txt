As a man, I could never imagine the fear and neglect women and others affected by this unfair verdict are going through. Men with firearms and law enforcement are allowed to "murder" the unborn children in women's wombs but not the women themselves because the idea of women having actual goddamned agency over their lives and bodies is so foreign to our nation â€“ and that is bizarre and sad. We must fight for their rights, we need to.
