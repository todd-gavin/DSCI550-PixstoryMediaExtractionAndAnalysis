Hailey Bieber wants to put the rumors to rest. In an upcoming episode of the Call Her Daddy podcast, the model and media personality will talk publicly for the first time about her husband Justin's former relationship with actress and singer Selena Gomez — and reveal the “truth” behind those dating crossover rumors.
In a trailer for the episode, podcast host Alexandra Cooper asks Hailey about her experience being married to Justin Bieber, asking whether his intense level of fame has impacted her own identity. “Where do I start?” jokes Hailey.
Alexandra also asks Hailey about the rumors surrounding the timeline of her relationship with Justin. “Your husband was in a very public relationship," she says in the clip, referencing Justin's ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez. "People were obsessed with them being together. Were you ever with Justin romantically at the same time as her?”
“Um… This is so crazy. I’ve literally never talked about this, ever,” replies Hailey. “A lot of the hate and the perpetuation comes from like, 'Oh, you stole him!' It's about people knowing the truth, because there's a truth."
Fans have suggested that Justin was unfaithful to Selena, claiming Hailey "stole" him from her. Since 2018, fans have continued to send Hailey hate online for allegedly cheating on Selena.
Within the four years they have been married, Hailey has not publicly addressed the speculation around Justin's relationship with Selena or the hate she receives from fans of Jelena… until now. Hailey's Call Her Daddy interview, which promises the “truth,” will be released on Wednesday, September 28.
