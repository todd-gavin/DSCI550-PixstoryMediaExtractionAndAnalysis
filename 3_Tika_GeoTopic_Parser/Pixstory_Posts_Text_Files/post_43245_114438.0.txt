James Caan, the US actor best known for playing Sonny Corleone in The Godfather, has died aged 82, his manager said Thursday. James Caan, who also had roles in "Misery," "Thief" and "Rollerball," received an Oscar nomination for his tragic portrayal of a mafia family's eldest son in Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 classic The Godfather. "It is with great sadness that we inform you of the passing of Jimmy on the evening of July 6," Caan's family said in a tweet posted to his account.
Caan's manager confirmed the news to AFP.

"Jimmy was one of the greatest. Not only was he one of the best actors our business has ever seen, he was funny, loyal, caring and beloved," wrote Matt DelPiano.

Later standout roles included a violent athlete in Norman Jewison's Rollerball, a jewel thief in Michael Mann's Thief (1981) and a kidnapped writer in Rob Reiner's Misery (1990).

"So sorry to hear the news. I loved working with him," tweeted Reiner. Caan's publicist also confirmed his passing, but declined to provide any further details including cause of death.
