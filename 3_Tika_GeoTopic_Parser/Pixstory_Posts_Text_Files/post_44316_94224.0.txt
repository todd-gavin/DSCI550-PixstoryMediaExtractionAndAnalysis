Saturday evening's round of Premier league fixtures went the way of Manchester United's fans. With both Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur having lost their respective matches the Reds are now in a good enough position to compete for Top 4. Last week, Ralf Ragnick's team looked down and out following a defeat at Goodison Park. Cristiano Ronaldo was in the news for all the wrong reasons then, but his hat-trick rescued his team yesterday.

That just so happened to be the Portuguese's 50th hattrick in club football. 10 others have come in Portuguese colours. A loss against Norwich would've most certainly meant doom for the home side. Old Trafford was stacked and kept cheering their stars on, and Cristiano Ronaldo did not disappoint. Most brilliant of all was that third goal, a free kick that flew in to the far post leaving Tim Krul with tiny margins to work wirh.

One crazy statistic that resurfaced on Social media after full time was of Ronaldo's longevity and consistency with age. 30 of his all time hat-tricks have come after the age of 30, while the other 30 came before that â€” at a time when most would've considered him to be at the peak of his powers. Physically, CR7 is no longer in the running for the title of the best player in the world but his mentality keeps him primed and on the top.

Although his first full season back at Old Trafford will likely end in disappointment, fighting for European football and getting that will definitely mean he continues for the season that follows. Ronaldo rescued his team in similar manner last month versus Spurs, a direct rival for Top 4. Even his most outspoken and blunt critics cannot deny the single handed quality and prowess on show out there against Norwich.
