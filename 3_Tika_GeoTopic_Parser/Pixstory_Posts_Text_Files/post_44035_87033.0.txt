president Joan Laporta has hinted that the Catalans' chase of Borussia Dortmund starlet Erling Haaland may be coming to an end.
Since joining the German giants, the 21-year-phenomenal old's goalscoring record has made him a top target for numerous premier European clubs. He has been identified as the Blaugrana's top objective moving into the summer transfer window.
Laporta and Xavi have been working hard to close the deal, with the president visiting the striker's agent, Mino Raiola, several times and the Barça manager travelling to Germany to meet the Norwegian striker.
However, recent speculations suggested that Haaland was getting closer to joining Premier League champions Manchester City this summer.
Laporta has now placed doubt on Barcelona's pursuit of the former Red Bull Salzburg striker, claiming that the club will not make any moves that might jeopardise their financial situation.
It's no secret that the Blaugrana have had financial difficulties in recent months. And an acquisition of Haaland would easily cost approximately €300 million.
And Laporta's evasive responses when asked about Barça's interest in the Norwegian could indicate that the club is pulling out of the contest.
“Even if we had the best financial situation in the world, we wouldn’t do some deals for the sake of the club”
He added “We won’t complete any deal that puts the club at any further risk.”
It'll be interesting to watch if these remarks prove to be the final nail in the coffin for the La Liga heavyweights' pursuit of Haaland.
While he appears to be upbeat about new signings, Laporta refused to discuss Borussia Dortmund star Haaland specifically, but he did not rule out a transfer.
It is unclear whether Haaland will play for the Catalan giants next season, but his €75 million (£63 million) release clause becomes active, making him more affordable.
