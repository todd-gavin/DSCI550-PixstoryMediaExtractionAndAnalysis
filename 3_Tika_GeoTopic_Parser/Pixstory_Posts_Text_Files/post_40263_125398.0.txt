The process of returning Native American remains and memorial items stored at the Alabama Department of Archives and History's archives has started. It’s great to see that the natives and their history are finally getting the respect they deserve!

AlJazeera reported that the department also disclosed that it had taken Native American funeral artefacts out of exhibits where they had been on view for years to visitors and school groups. 

According to data maintained by the National Park Service, 870,000 Native American artefacts, including nearly 110,000 human remains, are still in the ownership of colleges, museums, and other institutions around the United States as of last month, the Associated Press news agency reported.

“The origins of those materials and the way they came into our possession is really quite problematic from today’s perspective,” Steve Murray, the director of the Alabama Department of Archives and History, said on Thursday.

“We very much honour and agreed with Native perspectives on what is and isn’t a proper type of material to show in a museum exhibition,” Murray said.
