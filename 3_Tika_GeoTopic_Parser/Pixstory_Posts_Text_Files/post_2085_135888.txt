Shortly before her term concluded the United Nations human rights chief produced a report concluding that the Chinese government s treatment of Uyghur Muslims may constitute international crimes in particular crimes against humanity The Chinese government is notorious for forcibly incarcerated Uyghur Muslims in labor camps destroying tens of thousands of mosques and separating hundreds of thousands of children from their parents There are also claims that Uyghur Muslims are undergoing sterilization due to their declining fertility rates Predictably the Chinese government continues to deny that Uyghur Muslims are being mistreated Worse however this genocide and these human rights violations have been continuing for years without a word from the United Nations or individual countries and China has suffered almost no penalties It is a fascinating contrast how certain nations are handled when they are only suspected of participating in discriminating or simply improper conduct The United Nations for instance formerly investigated systematic racism in the United States but they continually fail to take action against serious and well documented violations of human rights like in China The reason for the disparity in treatment is evident they fear China They are aware that China is irrational and ready willing and able to use its vast resources to wage war against other nations whereas the United States despite its similarly vast resources is perceived as timid and level headed enough to only make vague threats about leaving the United Nations and not engage in bloodshed
