Best Player: Aleksandar Mitrovic

This is a no-brainer price, and the EFL's awards committee agreed, naming him Championship
Player of the Year. It's nothing short of incredible to score 43 goals in a season – no one has
scored more in England's top four divisions in over half a century.

Last year, it appeared like the Serbia striker was on his way out, but his comeback, one of many
in this team, has contributed to the team's success. Mitrovic is more than simply a goalscorer,
and his overall performances suggest that he will finally confirm his top-flight talents next
season.

There have been a slew of other notable performances. Harry Wilson had 19 assists, and he
and Mitrovic shared 13 goal combinations.

In midfield, Fabio Carvalho defied his 19 years, while
in defense, Tosin Adarabioyo proved he was the league's best defender alongside Tim Ream.

However, Mitrovic's exploits in 2021–22 were memorable and will be remembered at Craven
Cottage for a long time.

The biggest surprise of the year: Neeskens Kebano

Silva has brought out the best in a few members of the team. Although Mitrovic is the star,
Neeskens Kebano has had his greatest season at Fulham in six years and will be a part of the
Premier League team next season. The restoration of Jean Michael Seri, though, has been the
biggest surprise of the year. After half a season unregistered in the Premier League and the
next half away at Bordeaux, the Ivorian midfielder, nicknamed "the African Xavi," appeared to be
on his way out last summer.

Seri struggled at Fulham, but after four years, he has finally found fans. Silva persuaded him to
stay, and he has been outstanding, tying Fulham's attacks together at the base of the midfield.

Seri is increasingly popular on the terraces as well. For a 30-year-old, that's quite a turnaround.
