After the long summer and the slow summer transfer window, it is time for the return to football action. The clubs across the globe will go head to head from this week which brings the fan activity back. Not only the French Ligue 1 but also the other leagues across the globe are set to kickstart from this week.

The clubs across Europe have played the cups at the start of the season and few clubs have 
kickstarted their 2022/23 campaign on high. The French champions, Paris St Germain, started their campaign with a win over Nantes in the Trophee des Champions. PSG defeated Nantes 4-0 with multiple goal scorers for the team. Lionel Messi, Neymar Jr and Sergio Ramos were on the scoresheet for the team. Neymarâ€™s outrageous freekick goal sent fans down memory lane.

Ligue 1 was unavailable for Indian PSG fans a few years ago. However, it is available because 
of the emergence of the OTT platforms. The Paris St Germain games will be live for Indian fans through Voot. Viacom 18 holds the broadcasting rights of the Ligue 1.

The Paris St Germain fans can also buy the subscription of PSG TV premium if they are to 
watch the full replay of the game. One can also watch the ten-minute highlights of the game on the same application. PSG TV Premium is not only for the Ligue 1 fixtures but also for the UEFA Champions League games as well.

Under Mauricio Pochettino, PSG won the title last term after they amassed 86 points from 38 
fixtures. They had 26 wins and four losses in their 2021/22 campaign. The French league 
champions will start their campaign against Clermont Foot on 6th August. The team will look to not only bag another title but also challenge for the elusive UEFA Champions League title.
