Manchester United Football Club, over the last decade has seen a lot of changes happening. Be it behind the scenes, off the field or on it.
Another change of figure at the manager's chair has come to the supporters as a sign of positivity around a dire situation and miserable end to the season. Erik ten Hag from Netherlands, the ex Ajax boss has taken over the coaching duties for the Mancunian club.
His incoming means a lot of work to be done and it has well begun with the outgoings of a few already been confirmed by the club. Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata, Nemanja Matic are among the big name departures along with some academy players leaving as free agents. The other players to be assumed to leave include Eric Bailly, Anthony Martial, Phil Jones, Dean Henderson and Andreas Pereira if the fee is right or transfer targets are achieved. The latter can be seen get able going deep into the window but these players are the ones with uncertain futures at the club.
Every player is to be given a chance to prove during the pre-season under ten Hag and there might happen for more players to be included in the list of outcast. The names mentioned above have very little or next to nothing chance of staying as either they want to leave for more game time and a significant role in the team or they're just a deadwood at the club.
Hopefully the right decisions will be made and things start kicking off for MUFC to be the club they used to be.
