After one of them was abducted by her own family and forcibly put into conversion therapy last week, a lesbian couple in Kerala was reunited at the Kerala High Court on May 31. Surprisingly, when the abducted woman's partner and activists went to the Thamarassery police station in Calicut to register a complaint against her family, the police declined to assist them, claiming that the matter was an internal family matter. The partner and activists were forced to submit a habeas corpus petition in court and were finally able to meet the woman on May 31.

Adila and Noora, both in their early twenties, have been together for some years. On May 19, they came out to their families. Their family were against their love, so the pair eloped and sought refuge at the Vanaja Collective in Calicut, which assists marginalized populations, on the same day. Both sets of parents arrived at Vanaja Collective the same night and attempted to abduct their daughters. While Noora's parents were unable to persuade the couple to accompany them, Adila's parents were successful in convincing the pair to accompany them, promising the couple and Vanaja Collective that they would look after Noora as if she were their own daughter.

After Vanaja Collective and Adila filed a habeas corpus petition, Noora came at the Kerala High Court on May 29. According to Dhanya, who has been assisting the couple, the court did not allow anyone other than the couple to attend the hearing. "Adila and Noora were asked by the court if they wanted to live together in a five to six minute court hearing, and they replied yes. Now that they've been reunited, "Dhanya stated More information about what happened to Noora after she was abducted is awaited.
