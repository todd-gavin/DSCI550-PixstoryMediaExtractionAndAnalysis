The 2022 World Cup is set to kick-off in Qatar in less than three months. As the excitement builds, the Qatar are motoring full steam ahead to ensure no stone is left unturned in the build up to football's greatest extravaganza.
All the eight stadiums for the World Cup have been unveiled and tested for their operational readiness. The latest stadium to be unveiled was the Lusail Stadium which hosted the Lusail Super Cup match between Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal and Egypt's Zamalek last Friday.
The Lusail Stadium, interestingly, will host the World Cup final on 18 December and is Qatar's biggest stadium with a capacity of 80,000.
Lusail Stadium is a futuristic venue with state-of-the-art facilities. The stadium's iconic design is inspired by the interplay between light and shadows which symbolises the famous Arabic lantern called Fanar.
The stadium's facade and shape also depicts decorative motifs on vessels and bowls used in the Arab region and pays tribute to the craftsmanship of the Arab world.
Lusail Stadium will host a total of 10 matches during the World Cup, including the biggest of them all - the 2022 World Cup final.
It will host six group stage games and matches in the Round of 16, quarterfinals and semifinals before the final. The first match to be hosted by the Lusail Stadium in the World Cup will see Argentina take on Saudi Arabia in a Group C clash.
Lusail Stadium is set to be a prominent community hub after the World Cup. The stadium is located in the Lusail Sports City which will feature a host of civic facilities, including housing, shops, food and beverage outlets, a health clinic and school.
The stadium was built using sustanable practices and technologies including waste water recycling. In fact, Lusail Stadium's construction saw 40% more water conserved than other similar projects. The recycled water was later used to irrigate plants around the stadium.
