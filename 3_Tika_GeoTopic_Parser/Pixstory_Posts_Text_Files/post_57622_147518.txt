You know what the gym was made for a somewhat different purpose I mean undoubtedly yoga will help you gain peace of mind and internal well being but the gym s goal is to work more on building cardiovascular health and toning it has nothing to do with mental health Although some exercises will keep you mentally healthy as well the aim is entirely different so there can t be any comparison Moreover people often choose a gym for weight loss that can quickly be gained through the techniques and exercises used at the gym And also something about being in a gym sweating along with everyone else boosts you We often draw energy from others and it can even push us to work harder You don t want that guy next to you running faster than you That s how the gym can make you competitive and instead help you achieve your muscle building goal faster
