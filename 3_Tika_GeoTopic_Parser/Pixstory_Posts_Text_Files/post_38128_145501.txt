The FIFA World Cup is set to kick off in just over two months The best footballing nations in the world have already cemented their place in the marquee event But out of the lot who are the three teams that could eventually emerge as the Champions We take our pick here Brazil The mighty South American nation has an attack that consists of the likes of Neymar Vinicius Jr Rodrygo and Richarlison amongst other top players The ranked team in the world are equally balanced in midfield and defence To add to this they also have the likes of Allison and Ederson in goal Need I say more France Can the defending champions retain their crown I would say that Le Blues would certainly be the strongest team out of Europe France do have injury concerns in the midfield as Kante and Pogba have struggled with fitness However they would again be a force in the edition If the Group Stage curse does not affect them Argentina The Copa America champions pip nbsp England for the final spot in my list Argentina are currently on a match unbeaten run and this should certainly send tremors among their rivals in the world cup Lionel Messi and co are coming into the World Cup on a serious run of form Hence I believe that they have a really good chance of going the distance
