An avid reader, philomath in the field of economics and mathematics and a bibliophile, that's me, Nishthi Bhatia. My favourite pastime is reading, writing and orating.
Being completely knowledgeable about any subject is not possible, so I am proactive and continuously seek opportunities to develop and grow myself as an individual. I am a tenacious and firm believer in hard work. 
In all,Â  I am an analytical, hardworking and detail-oriented person.
