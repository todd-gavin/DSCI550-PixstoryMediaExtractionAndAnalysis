For the first time, a clinical study coordinated by Sapienza University reveals that the daily use of tadalafil, a drug currently used for erectile dysfunction, improves the cardiac situation of male-only diabetic patients while promoting immune and renal function in both men and women. The results of this research are published in the journal Science Translational Medicine Men and women do not respond in the same way to drugs Although the differences between the two sexes in various pathologies are well recognized, for example in cardiovascular diseases, for years clinical studies have neglected this aspect also in terms of study design involving predominantly male patients For the first time a randomized placebo controlled trial was expressly designed to investigate sex differences in male and female diabetic patients with diabetic cardiomyopathy in response to tadalafil a drug initially tested as a vasodilator for fight some cardiovascular diseases and is currently used to fight erectile dysfunction It often happens in scientific research that a drug tested against one disease proves effective against others as well This is the case with PDE-i type phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as Viagra and Cialis For this reason the indication of PDE i vir to the andrological field determining the end of the commercial interest in research in the cardiovascular field However, the research group coordinated by Andrea Isidori of the Department of Experimental Medicine of Sapienza has highlighted the potential benefits of PDE i also in the treatment of diabetes complications identifying those who could benefit from this class of drugs men affected by pathology-related microvascular problems erectile dysfunction cardiomyopathy kidney disease and menopausal women at risk for kidney disease opening interesting scenarios on the role of estrogen in mediating the effects of drugs at the cardiac
