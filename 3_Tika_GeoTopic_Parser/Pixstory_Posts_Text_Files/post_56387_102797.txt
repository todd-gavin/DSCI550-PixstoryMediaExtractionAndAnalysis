Talking about anxiety is very important as most often it is not being understood and ignored only to lead to more severe issues Social anxiety is a concern Often we see judge people who aren t socially active or refuse to be a party of gathering have you ever wondered about the cause rather than judging or bullying them Social Anxiety is more than just being shy in public It is also having to cancel a plan simple or complex because you feel overwhelmed and anxious Unexpected phone calls or even thought of it is horrible for a socially anxious person Over planning preparing for every single thing in life as they are afraid that they will end up in trouble Replaying conversation in your head and convincing that you have embarrassed yourself the difficulty in saying no utmost difficulty in communicating with others and expressing yourself always worrying that someone will notice the physical manifestation of your anxiety Got an idea Do they deal with this struggle every day Who is responsible for this Every single person who made a socially anxious person uncomfortable in public is responsible for their trauma They feel they aren t good enough for the society and find ways to fit in which becomes extremely difficult for them hence they choose to be inside their comfort zones end up having unnecessary thoughts So instead of bullying or judging an individual just give them space let them be and try to talk respecting their boundaries
