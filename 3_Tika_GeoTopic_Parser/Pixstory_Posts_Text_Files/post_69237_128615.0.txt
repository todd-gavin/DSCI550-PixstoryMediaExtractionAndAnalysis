The Kashmiri Red Chili, also called "Marchwaagun" locally, is the greatest seasoning for regular dishes. It can make any dish redder when added, has a strong, spicy flavour, and has a rich vine colour. You would be fascinated to see hundreds of Red Chilis stretched out over a sizable sheet known as Dastarkhuan in any Kashmiri home during the height of summer and left out in the sun to dry. These are either used whole or powdered after drying. These spicy and zesty chillies are a necessity for any kitchen!
You can use Kashmiri chiles fresh, dried, whole, or in powder form. It is one of the chilli powder options Iâ€™d suggest having on hand because you can store it for later use and to add spice to any recipe.
