Learn America. Supreme Court of India gave landmark abortion right verdict. 

All women, including unmarried and minors, can undergo abortion up to 24 weeks!! 
Something which other countries should learn and implement.
The Supreme Court Thursday ruled the rights available to married women under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act,1971, to abort a foetus will also be available to unmarried ones.
A bench presided by Justice D Y Chandrachud held while the 1971 Act was concerned with married women, the statement of objects and reasons to the 2021 amendment does not differentiate between married and unmarried and therefore, “all women entitled to safe and legal abortion”.
The bench said the artificial distinction between married and unmarried women cannot be sustained and that women must have the autonomy to have free exercise of these rights.
