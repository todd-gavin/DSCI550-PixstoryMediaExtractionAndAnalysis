Several bridges old and new crisscross over the rivers Mula and Mutha in Pune Some of them are old and stately like the Lakdi Pul built over years ago or the beautiful Shivaji Pul I try to walk across these bridges on most evenings the river interests me but more so the people Especially people walking on the bridges Not all of them stop to watch the river but many do School children college friends families I do not know what they think as they look at the river I do not even know if they watch the river or are lost in their thoughts There are hardly any spaces left in the crowded city to get lost in one s thoughts It is special that in the midst of constant traffic loud honking and hurrying pedestrians people find a moment to themselves with the river I cannot help but think that if the rivers below are healthy and flowing these people might feel better in their solitude As they return to their worlds their thoughts might be a shade brighter
