Muzammil H Syed Charlesde Mestral Abstract Background Diabetic foot ulcers DFUs are common and disabling necessitating lengthy hospitalizations In this study we sought to identify potentially modifiable determinants of high intensity hospital care use among adults with DFUs Methods Three related case control studies were conducted using Canada wide cohorts of adults hospitalized with a DFU from to In study cases comprised the top with the highest cumulative year acute care hospital costs controls were randomly selected from those below the top Study comprised cases controls within below the top for cumulative acute care hospital length of stay LOS Study included cases controls within below the top for cumulative number of acute care hospitalizations Using generalized linear models predictor variables were tested between cases and controls while adjusting for age and sex Results In study mean acute care costs among cases and controls were and respectively Sepsis conferred the greatest excess cost mean confidence interval CI to followed by chronic kidney disease mean CI to and major lower limb amputation mean CI to In study mean LOS was higher among cases days than controls days Lower limb amputation conferred the greatest adjusted excess in mean LOS mean days CI to days In study there was a mean of hospitalizations among cases and among controls Peripheral artery disease conferred the greatest excess number of hospitalizations more hospitalizations to Conclusions Early aggressive treatment of chronic kidney disease and peripheral artery disease alongside guideline based amputation prevention strategies may reduce high intensity hospital care use among adults with DFUs Sources
