From midnight till about three in the morning on Thursday, the 7th August 1941, time rolled by slowly and wearily, with the shadow of death lurking overhead; the Poet struggled on somehow, but after that it was only waiting for the inevitable.

A bulletin issued at 2:30 AM stated that the Poet's condition "is causing greater anxiety"; and the bulletin at 3:30 AM said that it had "slightly worsened since the last bulletin and is causing grave anxiety".

Dawn peeped in, and there was no trace of life in him excepting the gasping breath. Friends and relations began to pour in at the Jorasanko house; the rooms overflowed, and a large crowd gathered outside the house. Prayers were being offered at the unconscious Poet's bedside and hymns sung. At about ten, Dr. B. C. Roy and Dr. L. M. Banerjee came and examined him for the last time .. 
 
The sound of breath became fainter and fainter, and shortly after twelve, it ceased, once and for all..

At Thirteen Minutes Past Twelve on Thursday, the 7th of August, 1941 (corresponding to the 22nd Shraban, Bengali Era 1348), the Poet breathed his last, aged 80 years 3 months, in his ancestral home in Calcutta - 6, Dwarkanath Tagore Lane - the house where he was born on Tuesday, May 7, 1861.   

  When death comes and whispers to me
                   "Thy days are ended,"
       let me say to him, "I have lived in love
             and not in mere time."
   He will ask "Will thy songs remain?"
   I shall say "I know not, but this I know
         that often when I sang I found my eternity".
