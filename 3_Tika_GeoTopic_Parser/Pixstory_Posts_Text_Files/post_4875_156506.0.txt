In a viral video, a man is seen tied to a two-wheeler and made to run for about two kilometres on a busy road in Odisha.
The incident took place in Cuttack City Odisha, where a 22-year-old man identified as Jagannath Behera, had his hands tied to a 12-feet-long rope reportedly and forced to run by two others as he failed to repay Rs 1500 to them on time, as per Police reports.
The video is widely circulated on social media.
Locals also intervened when the 22-year old was forced to run and rescued at Sutahat Square, as he borrowed Rs 1500 from one of the two accused last month for performing his grandfather's last rites, police sources said.
The two were arrested during the day after the matter was reported to the police
