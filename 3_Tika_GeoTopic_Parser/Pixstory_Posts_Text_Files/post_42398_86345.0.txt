Nowadays, we see many teenagers, either they are in school or just entered college are buying a DSLR camera because they are interested in photography and videography. But the question is, do they know which type of camera they want and after buying the camera, which type of lenses will help them to increase the quality of their pictures or videos. Today, I will explain the types of lenses that are available in the market and what is the use of them.

1. Normal Lenses - In Normal Lenses, cinematographers get the depth of field which means that all subjects/objects in the frame are in perfect focus. The focal length of normal lenses is between 25mm and 50mm.

2. Zoom Lenses - Zoom lenses have variable focal lengths due to which they are also known as multiple purpose lenses. Photographer can cover the subjects/objects which is near or which are far away with the same lenses. Zoom lenses are used by news photographers, wildlife photographers, and sports photographer. Generally, zoom lenses cover the range from 50 mm to 300 mm.

3. Telephoto Lens - A telephoto lens is used for shooting the subject/object from a long distance. The telephoto lens helps to give a shallow depth of field which makes the background in the frame, blur. Telephoto can cover the range, that starts from 85 mm and ends on 300 mm.

4. Wide Angle Lens - Wide angle lens helps in widening the frame size. While shooting, a cinematographer/photographer should always remember to shoot in the safe working zone, otherwise, the image will become blurred or distorted from the edges of the frame. A wide-angle lens has a focal length of 35mm or shorter.

5. Macro Lens - Macro lens comes in the use for table talk photography, product photography, healthcare photography, and wildlife photography. The macro lens also gives us a shallow depth of field. The common focal lengths of the macro lens are 50mm. 100mm and 180mm.
