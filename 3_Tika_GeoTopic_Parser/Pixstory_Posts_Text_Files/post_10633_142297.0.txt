Gary Hunt and Molly Carlson got off to a flying start in Switzerland, taking the lead after two rounds of diving at the sixth stop of the 2022 Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series in Sisikon.

Hunt, who followed up a solid opening dive with a near-perfect Forward 4 Somersaults ½ Twist Tuck in the second round, holds a six-point lead over second-placed Aidan Heslop.

“It's great to have a lead when the other guys have got more difficult dives than you,” said the Frenchman. “In the lucky draw, I chose the 12th starting spot, I wanted to play with confidence and finish the show, which is what I did today.

“I just love it here. It's a good mixture between the cliffs and the crowds. They really get hyped up, especially with Matthias helping them along. The water's fresh, it's not too cold and it keeps you alive.”

England’s Heslop, meanwhile, has been in remarkable form from 27m during his first season as a permanent diver and continues to apply the pressure on his more experienced rivals. The 20-year-old has two big dives in his arsenal on Sunday and he’ll certainly be one to look out for once again during the final rounds.

Ukraine’s Oleksiy Prygorov completes the top three as things stand, while the current World Series leader, Romania’s Catalin Preda, lies 16 points adrift of Hunt in sixth spot.

Down on the 22m platform, it was the unwaveringly consistent Molly Carlson who performed best on day one. Having seen the usually perfect Rhiannan Iffland falter slightly during her second-round dive, the Canadian took advantage and edged into a 3-point lead over her Australian rival with a solid Forward 3 Somersaults ½ Twist Pike.

“Wow, I didn’t know that I was in the lead for day one,” said the 23-year-old. “I'm really excited. I'm trying my new big dive tomorrow. So, to push myself to these boundaries and to already have the up on Rhiannan makes me feel really confident and so hopefully it continues.”
