Liverpool midfielder Thiago Alcantara heaped praise on fellow teammate Sadio Mane for his team’s 3-2 win over Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-final.

Sadio Mane scored a brace (17,45) and this along with Ibrahima Konate’s opener was enough to help the side get past Manchester City who netted twice through Jack Grealish and Bernardo Silva.

Thiago Alcantara praising the winger said “He [Mane] is a fighter with a lot of technique so he knows how to mix it up and to do what we need. He was unbelievable," and went on to talk about the hunger of the team which lead to an overall top notch performance “Yeah, it talks about us, it talks about our hunger when we have to press, like (Sadio Mane’s) goal, it talks about the players we have in terms of (Sadio Mane’s) second goal and also the great passers we have, our full-backs were amazing [on Saturday] as well.” he told the official site.

Meanwhile, Pep Guardiola refused to blame goalkeeper Zack Steffen whose hesitancy to clear the ball led to Sadio Mane’s first goal and said it could happen when one tries to play out from the back "It is an accident; Ederson was close in the last game as well. It happens. 

We need that for our football.Of course, you should review if it happens often but the way we use our keeper and move them in different situations, I’d say the average of the way we create from there, this can happen”

He went on to add that the keeper will keep his place in the side as the squad’s domestic cup keeper ”Zack deserved to play and he made good decisions and good saves after that. He’s an exceptional goalkeeper”
