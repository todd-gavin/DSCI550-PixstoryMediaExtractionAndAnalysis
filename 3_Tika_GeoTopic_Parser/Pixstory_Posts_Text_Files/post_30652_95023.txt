On the eve of the Coppa Italia semi-final at Juventus awaiting the return match against Fiorentina on Wednesday evening The coach Massimo Allegri took stock of the situation these are his words Zakaria is fine but Arthur is dead I have two midfielders who are enough and advance then there is also Miretti Danilo we will see him on the pitch where to decide The changes will be important whoever takes the field from the start will have to keep a high pace Perin and Bonucci will play as starters I haven&#39;t yet decided who to deploy between Morata Dybala Vlahovic and Kean but all four will certainly be needed Allegri who sportsfully received Lapo Elkann&#39;s critical tweet the day after the home draw against Bologna he explained that reaching the final of the Coppa Italia is a goal but the result won&#39;t change the climate around the team Tomorrow&#39;s game doesn&#39;t make you change the season but allows you to play in a final At Juve you are always under pressure you have to get used to it and live with it
