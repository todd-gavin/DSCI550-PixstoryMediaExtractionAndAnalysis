Mice, rats, rabbits, and guinea pigs are the most common animal "test subjects" for cosmetics, according to Fine. The purpose of the testing is to determine a product's toxicity. This testing process causes significant injury to some of them, and in some cases, the reaction is so strong that it can lead to death. To see if there is an allergic reaction, guinea pigs are shaved before being coated with cosmetic ingredients. Rats, on the other hand, are compelled to consume or inhale cosmetic chemicals. They, too, are massaged with potentially hazardous substances, which can last up to three months. The same tests are performed on pregnant rats, who are ultimately euthanized together with their unborn kids after about 21 days. In their ears, mice are subjected to nearly the same treatment as rats and guinea pigs. Rabbits are exposed to the same compounds as the other animals, but because they are tougher, they are forced to endure the treatment for at least 28 days and up to 90 days, according to Cruelty-Free International. After testing, pregnant rabbits and their pups are also euthanized. Animals who do not die during the testing process are usually killed afterwards, sometimes in brutal ways and without any pain relief. Animal testing is futile when it comes to determining the safety of cosmetic ingredients, according to the Humane Society. When exposed to the same substance, different species react differently. There's no certainty that a certain type of lipstick will damage people if it harms rats.
