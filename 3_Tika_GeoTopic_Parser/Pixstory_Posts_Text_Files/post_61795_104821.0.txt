Last week kickstarted a War of words as the Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant and the NBA media got involved in a series of tweets which continued this week stemming from Stephen A. Smith’s comments on ESPN's "First Take." 

Smith went on a rant as he stated that Michael Jordan changed the game of basketball for the worse because he "individualized the sport." Smith argued the NBA focused more on players rather than teams after Jordan's ascension which negatively changed the dynamic of the game. 

Durant took offense to that idea and claimed in a tweet that media personalities like Smith, Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe actually changed the game for the worse, and that the players had nothing do with it. 

That ignited a hot debate in which fans and journalists alike got involved to share their hot takes. 

The first being, of course, Smith himself. The ESPN analyst exclaimed that he wasn’t the only one, there were thousands of analysts like himself and even went on to fan the flames by saying that the analysts are "not going away." 

Eddie Johnson, an analyst for the Phoenix Suns, disagreed with Smith's argument but went on to frustrate Durant by calling today's athletes "too dam sensitive." Durant rightfully clapped back at him and said that media members are actually the ones who are too sensitive and "can't take what ya'll dish out." 

This isn’t Durant’s first duel with the media personnel. He has had very public feuds with Media Personnel about their bias of the sport and portrayal of Durant in the media.
