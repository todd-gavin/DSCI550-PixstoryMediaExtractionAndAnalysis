There's no doubt elephants are extremely empathetic beings, so much so they are said to have risked their lives to protect their human friends. But unfortunately, this picture is not so true as much as we'd want it to be.
On April 1st of 2018, Kruger National Park created the image of the elephant holding a lion cub in its trunk and posted it to the official Twitter account of the South African organisation, Kruger Sightings. The words "Sloof Lirpa," which are "April Fools" when written backwards, were added to the original posting.
So yeah, this story is not exactly real.
