While we can never truly say what is the greatest guitar riff of all time given just how many there are we can certainly sort them out on the basis of certain characteristics such as the time of their release legacy recognition influence and composition While some certainly are worthy not every guitar riff identified as genre defining and ultra influential deserves the title of the best riff ever There are a couple of underdogs on the bench who have an even greater right to that claim no matter how much the media may blow certain riffs out of proportion Some bands like Black Sabbath have riff gods like Tony Iommi who have made entire albums that can fill such a list on their own In order to make a comparison with other bands only one song from one artist was picked on this list some highly influential and well known and some underdogs in the race who very well deserve that place What are your personal favourite riffs Or how would you arrange this list Top greatest rock and metal riffs of all time Symptom of the Universe Black Sabbath The Hellion Electric Eye Judas Priest Ain t Talkin Bout Love Van Halen Am I Evil Diamond Head Smoke on the Water Deep Purple Crazy Train Ozzy Osbourne Layla Derek and the Dominos We ll Burn The Sky Scorpions Whole Lotta Love Led Zeppelin Without Judgement Death Stone Alice In Chains Hall of the Mountain King Savatage Creeping Death Metallica Holy Wars The Punishment Due Megadeth Angel of Death Slayer Cowboys from Hell Pantera The Number of the Beast Iron Maiden Stone Cold Crazy Queen Helter Skelter The Beatles Paradise City Guns N Roses
