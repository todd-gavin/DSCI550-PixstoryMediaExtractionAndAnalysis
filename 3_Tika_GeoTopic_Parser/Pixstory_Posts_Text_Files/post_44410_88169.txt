FC St Pauli Rivals Hamburg St Pauli have had a terrible reputation as a counterculture club since the s and this derby is undoubtedly defined by its politics Their stadium is located in Hamburg s red light district the Reeperbahn and their supporters are loud vociferous and highly left leaning St Pauli has spent its history hopping between the Bundesliga and the lesser levels therefore their fans have never had a winning club to cheer for Hamburg on the other hand has never been out of the Bundesliga having won six titles so far As a result the derby hasn t been as hotly contested as others owing to the fact that the two teams operate in distinct sectors In comparison to Hamburg which has defined itself solely by its on field success and little else St Pauli has a considerably stronger identity an extremely progressive club that supports its team in large numbers even when they are in the Bundesliga Patrick Thistle Rivals Celtic and Rangers Thistle have only two trophies to their record one Scottish Cup in and one Scottish League Cup in although their larger city neighbours have shared the majority of Scottish league titles The latter occurred in a memorable win over Jock Stein s fantastic Celtic team at the time but it s one of the few times Thistle fans have had to brag about over the years While the majority of fans support the other two teams Thistle has a smaller fan base primarily made up of middle class and student residents in Glasgow s north end When Celtic or the New Rangers visit Firhill it is the most eagerly awaited game of the season for Thistle supporters yet the same cannot be said for opponents who see Patrick Thistle as simply another team to play against
