The Arsenal are well and truly back. Let’s not get it twisted – Brentford away is not meant to be an easy fixture, but the way Mikel Arteta’s side handled the Bees made it a rather comfortable affair. This was arguably our best performance of the season so far; every individual played well in a well instructed side that travelled to a tricky away day, and left with three points, three goals and a clean sheet. What more could you want! Here’s some player ratings from the game…Ramsdale – 7 – Didn’t have a whole lot to do but kept a clean sheet.White – 8 – I hope Gareth Southgate was watching. Another top performance.Saliba – 9 – An excellent goal and another excellent display from the young Frenchman.Gabriel – 8 – Toney is a top, top striker – and Gabi dealt with him well today.Tierney – 8 – Looked back to his best today, a really pleasing performance.Partey – 8 – Great today.Xhaka – 9.5 – MOTM - This guy continues to amaze me. He is unbelievable.Vieira – 8 – A great debut for the lad. Lovely strike for the goal, too.Saka – 8 – That’s five G/A in his last four now. 2 assists today. On fire.Jesus - 9 - He just is unbelievable, isn’t he? So so good.Martinelli - 7.5 - Not his best performance but still a very good display - he’s always a threat.Congrats to Ethan Nwaneri, the youngest ever Premier League player. 15 years old. That’s mental.Come on you Gooners.
