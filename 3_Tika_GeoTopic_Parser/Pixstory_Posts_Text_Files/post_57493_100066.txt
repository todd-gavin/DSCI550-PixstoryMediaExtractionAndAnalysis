The situation seems quite ironic as the time when all this fuss was created was similar to when the draft was released from the Supreme court that stated Roe v Wade would be overturned So on the one hand women are forced to give birth while on the other hand when the baby is born there won t be any food to feed him There have been questions hovering around why women can t breastfeed to nurture their babies It is apparent from this question that people in general can t understand womanhood or motherhood and those who sit in power barely have any idea about it Breastfeeding is a tedious process and the women who are not breastfeeding currently can t do it suddenly It takes time for a woman s body to produce enough milk that can nurture their babies This would seem irrational to many people who would not understand how difficult pregnancy is and how hard it can take to nurture and care for a baby It s been a month since the formula shortage was warned and nothing has been done to tackle the situation it has reached the extent where feeding a baby is a big concern for all mothers and parents Both the situations have made it difficult for women from being forced to give birth to a baby then again where there s no food left to feed those babies Lawmakers need to understand the severity of the situation instead of mocking or playing with it unnecessarily
