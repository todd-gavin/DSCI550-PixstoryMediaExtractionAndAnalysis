On the eve of Juventus Lazio, the Bianconeri&#39;s last home game this season, Paulo Dybala entrusted his long greeting to the fans of the Old Lady to social networks. The Argentinian wrote that it is difficult to find the right words to greet you. I thought we&#39;d be together for even more years but fate puts us on different paths I will never forget everything you made me experience every game every goal With you I grew up I learned I lived and I dreamed They were years of magic of trophies and goals that no one will ever take away from us Thanks for supporting me in difficult moments Thanks to those who have accompanied me in these years from the first to the last from the fans to the people who work within the company all coaches and fellow employees and managers Dybala concluded by expressing his pride for the captain armband worn Wearing this important shirt together with the captain armband has been one of the greatest prides of my life which I hope to show one day to my children and grandchildren Tomorrow will be my last match in this shirt hard to imagine but it will be the our last farewell It won&#39;t be easy but I will enter the field with a smile and head held high knowing that I have given everything for you
