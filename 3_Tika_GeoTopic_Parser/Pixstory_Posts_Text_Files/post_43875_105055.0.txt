Georgia will be looking to continue their fine start as they face Bulgaria away at the Stadium Ludogorets Arena for their Group 3 of League C UEFA Nations League match.  

Bulgaria will be looking to make it back to the League B, after relegation last time out. However, failing to win against Georgia would make it a very difficult prospect for now. 

Georgia come into this match with a six match unbeaten run across all competitions, with promotion to League B in their sights as well. 

This should be an interesting fixture, with two teams with similar strength and ambition looking to square off against each other.
