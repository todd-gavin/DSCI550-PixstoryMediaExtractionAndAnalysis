This is my interview in the Global Indian website I intended to stay in this country only for a year when I arrived at Sao Paulo in But I could never return and that is one decision I will always be proud of Growing up in Ramapuram village of the Kottayam district of Kerala Shaji was third of the six kids in the family His father was a local politician and his mother a housewife Home tutored in the initial years of his life the environmentalist was brilliant with numbers I even passed the Indian Sainik School entrance exam but my mother was not in favour of sending me far away he shares adding that nature intrigued him even as a child But he equally enjoyed school I was a good student and participated in scouts and guides and NCC We had agricultural land on which we grew cocoa rubber coffee coconut paddy and pepper says Shaji However when his father asked him to join local politics he packed his bags and left for Mysuru University to pursue social science politics and economics At the same time he received a degree in philosophy from the Institute of Vidyaniketan in Mysuru During college I got an opportunity to visit Odisha where I lived with tribal communities adds Shaji Upon his graduation he got the opportunity to do a year of an overseas training programme in Sao Paulo by the Religious Institution Society of Divine Work With no direct flight to Brazil from India at that time he spent a week travelling to his destination No one came to pick me up and I didn t have enough money to pay for a cab Almost no one spoke English and I didn t know Portuguese Fortunately a taxi driver took mercy on me and dropped me at the institute reveals the environmentalist Although it was his dream Shaji found Brazil very strange in the beginning From falling sick after gulping down a cup of caipirinha which he thought to be a juice to learning Portuguese from a Japanese teacher he had his share of peculiar moments
