Manchester City boast probably the most incredibly in-depth midfield in world football, let alone the Premier league.

Pep Guardiola's side have fought valiantly for both their Champions League hopes and the Premier league title this season, all thanks to the number of capable players they have playing in different positions. One of them being Germany International Ilkay Gundogan.

The 31 year-old brings balance, stability and a goalscoring presence off City's bench.

Although, not starting many games he plays a considerable part in organising City's midfield. 

With brilliant players like Bernardo Silva and Kevin De Bruyne ahead, Gundogan is able to 
set the pace of the game by sitting a little deeper in Central midfield. Since 2016, Gundogan has had considerable effect over City's season's of success. That however, might be coming to an end with his current deal at the Etihad ending in 2023.

He was recently questioned about the possibility of his future being away from Manchester.

In response, the German discussed the prospects of playing abroad very calmly.

"Because of my roots, Turkey is naturally interesting. I also like the USA, I've been there on vacation several times."

Ilkay Gundogan remains in Germany manager Hansi Flick's plans, but the possibility of retirement after the World cup isn't entirely out of question.

"However, I'm not worried about that at the moment. I still have a contract in Manchester 
until 2023, I'm very happy there both in sporting and private terms and I can theoretically imagine ending my career at City."

Now in his early 30's, this feels like a stage of his career to be able to make such calls. On the current Premier league title race, he remarked "It is a very exciting and nerve-wracking race for both us and the fans."

Some big calls ahead. England, Turkey, USA or elsewhere?
