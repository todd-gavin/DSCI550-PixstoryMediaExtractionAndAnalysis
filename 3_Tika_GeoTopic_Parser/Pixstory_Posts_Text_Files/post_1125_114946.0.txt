What are the health benefits of circumcision? Can it reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections? And most importantly, does it make any difference in the way we experience/enjoy sex? 

In today’s video, I will be analysing some
of these questions with noted urogynaecologist and vvox expert, Dr Sarita P. Naik. I will also be looking at some of the research studies conducted on circumcised men, from around the world, to find out how realistic the health benefits are.
