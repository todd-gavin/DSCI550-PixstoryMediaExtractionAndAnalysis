Roman Reigns has held the Universal Championship for 660 days now in his historic title reign. 

The man who came up in a legendary trio called The Shield, was destined for greater heights right from the beginning, with his imposing personality and the looks of a silent assassin. 

He went on to main event 4 wrestlemanias before he found a character that made him feel comfortable. That's when Reigns donned the persona of 'The Tribal Chief'. He instantly became a mainstay of Smackdown. A character that people were highly invested in. 

And thus began his dominant reign, when he wrecked The Fiend Bray Wyatt, and The Monster among Men, Braun Strowman. He went on to feud and defeat the likes of Kevin Owens, Edge, Daniel Bryan, Cesaro, Rey Mysterio, Brock Lesnar, John Cena, Seth Rollins, Drew McIntyre among his title reign, really solidifying his claim as THE CHAMPION 

While an argument can be made for Samartino, Cena and Hogan, there are very few superstars who can convinceably be considered as a rival to his GOAT claim. 

None of this men except Samartino have held the title in a single reign for as long as Roman Reigns. Samartino wrestled one night a month in MSG, while Roman carried the title through Pandemic. 

So it's really tough to say, but for me Roman Reigns is the Greatest of all time.
