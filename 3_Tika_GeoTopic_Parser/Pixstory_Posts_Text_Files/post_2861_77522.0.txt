Earlier this month, French President Emmanuel Macron was accused of using divisive language after using a slang term and said he wanted “to piss off” the unvaccinated that he would like to carry on with it in the future too. (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59873833)

With three months to the French presidential elections, many thought that Macron was rude and would lose many voters for his comments. There were large scale protests too. Macron has been following a hardline against those who don’t want to get vaccinated with the Covid-19 dose.

Now the head of a Paris hospital group, Martin Hirsch, has set off another storm after suggesting that people who refuse to be vaccinated should pay more as opposed to the present system. All Covid-19 patients in intensive are covered entirely by the state. According to some estimates, each day’s treatment costs $3,340 per day.

According to Hirsch, at a time when health costs have hit the roof, the unvaccinated should not be allowed to avail the free service of the taxpayers. Many are now calling for Hirsch’s head for suggesting this.

Hirsch has not suggested anything new though. In fact, Conservative Les Républicains leader Sebastien Huyghe first suggested that the unvaccinated should pay some of their medical costs. French parliament rejected his proposal. 

Despite facing heavy criticism for his government’s stance, Macron is finding support in the country. For instance, less than a fortnight ago, Parliament of France gave a green signal to the government strict measures to control Omicron, including a vaccine pass that mandated people to show proof of vaccination to gain access to public places, including restaurants cafes, cinemas and long-distance trains.

With the latest polls showing that Macron is leading the polls, most people could be siding with him in the war against the unvaccinated. (https://www.france24.com/en/video/20220128-french-presidential-election-latest-polls-put-emmanuel-macron-ahead-of-his-rivals)
