Lionel Scaloni, Argentina's coach, says fans should enjoy Lionel Messi while they still can because he will retire at some point.

Following Friday's qualifying triumph against Venezuela, the 34-year-old hinted that he would retire from international football after the 2022 World Cup.

After the tournament in Qatar, Messi claimed he will have to "rethink a lot of things" and may decide to leave the national team.
What's been said so far?

When asked about Messi's words on Sunday during a press conference, Scaloni confessed that the day will come when he decides to retire.

“After playing in a World Cup, everyone makes assessments. I’m not in the heads of the players to know what they’re thinking," he said.
"In any case, you have to enjoy it. You don’t have to think about the future, enjoy their spectacular present.

"It’s the rule of life and at some point, it will happen. It’s useless to think about what will happen after the World Cup."
Angel Di Maria, a fellow Argentina great, has stated that he does not expect his career with the national team to extend beyond the World Cup. After Argentina overcame Venezuela in World Cup qualifying, the Paris Saint-Germain player announced on Instagram that he had likely played his final home game for Argentina.
“I didn’t see the post but I understood it as being about this team, I would imagine," he said.

"I spoke with him some time ago. That it’s the decision of the coach [for him to stop playing] and not them that leave us. There is an age for everyone, many trips have passed and matches, which I would imagine is difficult.

"I hope he said that about this year. I don’t know what is going on in his head. If it was the last, it could not have been any better. It came out like he would have dreamed it.

"He didn’t just play, he had a goal, an assist and he got the ovation from the entire stadium.”
