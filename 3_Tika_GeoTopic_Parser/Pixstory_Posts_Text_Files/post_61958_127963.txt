For me personally it s questionable whether it can It depends on what his arch ends with in Endgame If he dies I am not sure I Will be so willing to continue watching upcoming movies If He survives and it s RDJ s last movie As a major character But leaving the possibility of him returning in cameo appearences then I Will be up for it But ultimately I hope He survives Whether it will be his last movie is not important to me I Think Tony deserves a happy ending and that s what I hope for If I look beyond my own feelings and views then yes I Think it Can survive without Tony Maybe not in the same as popular Way As it has the past years But that really is not just because of the lack of Tony It s a contributing factor But I fear that the general populace outside the Marvel fandom is getting tired with superhero movies And seeing as they are promoting Endgame as the final chapter it makes it look like to those who have no clues about Marvel s future plans it was merely a marketing stunt for a dramatic effect But that s just from a business point of view of course From the fandom s point of view they might think that something more familiar will be missing if they take away all of the characters from the past years Ergo here it would be fitting to continue with those characters who can in cameo appearences To ease the transition if you will
