Gemma Owen, Michael Owen's daughter, has been confirmed for the forthcoming series of Love Island.


The 42-year-old former Liverpool player may want to keep his eyes closed for the next ten weeks when the 19-year-old joins the other prospects in the Spanish villa hunting for love on the hit ITV2 dating programme.


Due to her big internet following, international dressage rider and company entrepreneur Gemma is already a star in her own right.
Owen told ITV that, like her father, she is competitive and is looking forward to participating on the show.


"Sport has always been a huge part of my life and that of my family." "My father was a pro football player," she explained.
"I've been competing for Great Britain in dressage since I was 11 years old. I've competed in large venues all around Europe in major tournaments. I consider myself to be a fierce competitor.I always go for what I want when it comes to relationships, she stated"

"At the same time, I'm not going to ruin anything for someone who is in a committed relationship or stand in the way of a couple that is in love."
"I'd never do something to another female that I wouldn't want someone else to do to me."


"I would say I'm lively, flirtatious, and feisty," she said of what fans should anticipate from her. I think I'm good at offering advice, a good listener, and a really honest person.
