ðŸ‘‰Doing any physical activity is better than doing none. If you currently do no physical activity, start by doing some, and gradually build up to the recommended amount.

ðŸ‘‰Be active on most, preferably all, days every week. 

ðŸ‘‰Accumulate 150 to 300 minutes (2 Â½ to 5 hours) of moderate intensity physical activity or 75 to 150 minutes (1 Â¼ to 2 Â½ hours) of vigorous intensity physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both moderate and vigorous activities, each week. 

ðŸ‘‰Do muscle strengthening activities on at least two days each week.

ðŸ‘‰ Follow clean and lean diet
