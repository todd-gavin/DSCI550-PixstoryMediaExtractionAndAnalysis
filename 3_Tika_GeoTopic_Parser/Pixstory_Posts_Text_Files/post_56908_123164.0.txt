Well, it isn't easy to feel positive if all the negativity encompasses you but what if you try to change those negative emotions into positive ones?

You reached your office late and didn't eat anything for the whole day, it seemed like the worst day, but still, you carried a smile to tackle all the challenges that came your way and surprisingly, it helped. Making every effort to focus on the situation's positive side can improve it.
You would give your brain a place to breathe, so try it.

Self-talk is the best way towards self-awareness and knowing yourself.
So what you talk to yourself about is essential. When we talk badly about ourselves, we start to believe what we are saying, perpetuating bad feelings. When you start saying things like, "I am a terrible person," change that line into something like "I am a great person!" your brain will process what you said and react accordingly within a few seconds.

The surroundings can torment you or help you feel happier, so it's upon us who and what we keep in our surroundings.
Keeping ourselves around people with positive energy would bring a good vibe. Similarly, clean and better surroundings would keep the brain calm and at ease.

Another step toward building positive thinking is to be grateful.
We often forget to accept and acknowledge what we have, but doing it could bring significant change. Even if all seems to be falling apart, take a moment to appreciate people and things in your life. You'll see how accessible your brain would feel.

Accepting and processing negative thoughts or emoticons can be difficult, especially when the situation inflicts you. Still, life could be easier if we begin to take it as a part of our journey.
