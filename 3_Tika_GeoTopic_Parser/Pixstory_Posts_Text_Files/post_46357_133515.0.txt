I cannot accept the idea that someone could not like energy balls . Unless they’re one of those annoying people who “ doesn’t like healthy food ” ! The only reason I can think of for why someone might not love protein balls is because they have yet to find their flavor combo ! This is the reason why I am always trying to come up with new , creative recipes . I am absolutely convinced that there is a flavor out there for everyone ! 😋😍
