Who hasn’t fantasised about chucking their job in, buying a one-way plane ticket and travelling the world so they can be one of those envy-inducing influencers who post a stream of amazing travel photos?

Tyson Mayr not only followed through on that impulse 13 years ago, (and has travelled to more than 60 countries since), but he’s made a career out of it, turning his passion into a series of TV shows, including I’m A Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here!, National Geographic’s Only In Oz — and a 900km stand-up paddle board adventure for Bear Grylls’ Eco Challenge.

For a bloke with so much on the go, it’s no huge shock to learn that Mayr’s daily routine is as regimented as a military operation.

“Within three minutes of waking up I have brushed my teeth, chugged 500ml of water and am outside walking towards the beach with my dog Willow,” he says.

“We walk for a couple of kilometres, followed by either 500m of beach sprints or a one-kilometre light soft-sand jog. This is followed by a 10-minute mobility routine I have developed for my specific needs, a quick ocean swim and then a coffee at home while I write my morning journal.”

Besides new fitness goals (beyond trying to convince his dog to ride at the front of his paddle board (“I plan on incorporating stand-up paddle boarding into my morning routine twice a week, as I find it to be one of the most mind-emptying activities that also provides a full body workout”), Mayr also has plans for — you guessed it — more travel adventures.

“I have a travel company that I have been developing for many years now, one which will provide truly life-changing experiences for travellers across the globe, while helping make the world a more equal and sustainable place, but especially for those communities and parts of the world that need it the most,” he says.

“Covid provided me the first opportunity to sink my teeth into this project and while I am still building my team and have a lot more work to do — I am beyond excited.”
