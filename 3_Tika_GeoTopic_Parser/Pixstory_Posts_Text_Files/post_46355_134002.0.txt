Weekends ?? Simply means having fun , dressing up , doing parties and much more ! 😍✨
Today i dressed up myself in this Lemon Yellow Off shoulders Frock ! I'm not a fan of frock dresses , so i was bit confused about this dress but then i thought let's give it a try ! 💛
This fit turned out soo beautiful ! When i saw myself in mirror i was like - Ohh ! wow , not bad 💛😍! And with my go - to hairstyle ( Straight open hair ) i felt like a doll with pretty white hair pin 🧚‍♀️😍 ! A shoe has much more to offer..than just to walk ! So i paired up my frock with white shoes and i guess it's perfect . Surely gonna buy more frock dresses now ! 😍✨
Went out today for a movie with my friends to spend my weekend and i had a great time ! ❤️
What do you think about my outfit ? Tell me in notes ! 💭💛
