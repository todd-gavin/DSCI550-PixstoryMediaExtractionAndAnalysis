From today Wednesday July the video clip of Non Siamo al Centro del Mondo feat Fanfara Station is available on YouTube, the new single by the singer-songwriter SGR in collaboration with the cosmopolitan trio that blends wind instruments and electronics with the rhythms and songs of the Maghreb Distributed by ADA Music Italy Non Siamo al Centro del Mondo is an invitation to move away from the safe and comfortable calculation of one&#39;s daily life. Also on a musical level, the song calls for discovery and contamination with the fusion of two very different worlds: the more singer-songwriter one of Sgr and the more world music one of Fanfare Station Realized with the support of Italia Music Lab and with the artistic direction of Carlo Alberto Giordan, the video of Non Siamo al Centro del Mondo speaks of borders Through the theme of travel, in fact, we find ourselves inside an unknown geographical map that reflects on the inner landscape of those who has decided to cross its borders A new physical geography therefore corresponds to an equally new emotional geography The panoramas outside us dialogue incessantly with our inner scenarios until they merge and contaminate one another This fluidity is effectively rendered by the changing primitive and evocative features by Luca Di Battista illustrator and animator of the video In the video of We are not at the Center of the World thoughts become visible What we see and then what I would like to experience are all these possibilities left to tan outside in the sunlight Possibility of a journey of discovery of contamination In short of something that makes me go beyond my confines Metaphoric and self-deprecating intimate Sgr released his first album last November Macedonia an unusual and evocative sensitive gaze on everyday life The singer-songwriter&#39;s voice at times apathetic yet always very expressive offers us with these songs his fruit salad his emotions cut into small sour and sweet pieces On a musical level the heart of the project is a deep love for the productions of Battisti and Battiato between the seventies and eighties with more contemporary stylistic references which are a sort of precious spice to the within the songs
