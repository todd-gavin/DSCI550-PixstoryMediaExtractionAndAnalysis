India has asked its citizens including students who are living in Ukraine to return if their stay in the east European nation "is not deemed essential". Family members of Indian embassy staff in Ukraine will also be sent home, sources have told NDTV.

The earlier advisory asked students to leave Ukraine as soon as possible.

"In view of the continued high levels of tensions and uncertainties with respect to the situation in Ukraine, all Indian nationals whose stay is not deemed essential and all Indian students, are advised to leave Ukraine temporarily," the Indian embassy in Ukraine tweeted.

In a second advisory on Sunday, the Indian embassy in Ukraine said Indian citizens should look for any available commercial or charter flight to get out of the country amid tensions over a possible invasion by Russia.
