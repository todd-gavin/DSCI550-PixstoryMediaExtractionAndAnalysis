So I had this dull regular day, which was not letting me think of anything optimistic that could make my day better. 

Monsoon is my favourite. It's raining today. Playing in the rain is the best feeling. Every drop touches your soul. But I m not a big fan of consequences after playing in the rain like cold AHHHH!
But this particular movement, I needed to do something which could calm my heart and sense things better. "So the hell with the consequences. I can deal with it !" I went to my roof terrace with the umbrella and paused for a proper movement and dropped the umbrella. Every single raindrop that touched me made me feel alive. I Never felt as calm as in that movement. If I go filmy then in that particular stir, I desired for a person who could see how cheery I was in that movement. Yeah! Okay fine! I should stop watching Netflix Teen dramas. I get it.
