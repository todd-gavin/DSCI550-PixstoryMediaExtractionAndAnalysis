Writing is everything to me. But over the last few weeks, I couldn't quite gather myself to write anything. It's not that there was a shortage of happenings around the world but I just found it difficult to write something or as a matter of fact, anything. 

I am a very emotional person and for me, the case is, if I don't feel it, I can't write it. But that was sadly not the case this time. The words were just not coming. What seemed natural now seemed strange to do. I don't know what was up. I couldn't figure it out.

I'd often criticise myself and infact, be disappointed in myself for not being able to spring a few words in to a sentence. I felt that it was my incompetence. I felt as if I was a writer for show. Sure I tweeted stuff but we all know that tweeting is not writingâ€”it is simply ranting.

Why I didn't write anything for so long? It's been a month since I wrote anything. 

And just like that... I realised that I should write about my inability to write in these last few weeks. And as I type this post out, I realise that writing about anything cannot come by pressuring myself. I learnt that sometimes, it can take a lot of time for something good to come by. 

Well, earlier I had a shortage of ideas on what to write adding to that, the inability to express and lastly, the joy of writing.

I hope, that through this post, you would be able to understand my inability to create something with words recently.

I am still in the process of coming out of this block but I am a lot better now. I couldn't help but wonder what is it that brought me here to this place. How did I get to this blank space?

I guess, I would never know the answer to the same.
