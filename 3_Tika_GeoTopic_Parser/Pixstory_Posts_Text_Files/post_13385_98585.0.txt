Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif has called on the international community to help the flood victims in Afghanistan immediately.

Heavy rains and floods in parts of Afghanistan have killed at least 22 people and injured 40 others. However, Taliban leaders have remained silent on the incident.
A Taliban official told the Taliban that hundreds of homes were destroyed and thousands of hectares of farmland destroyed by heavy rains and floods.

Twelve provinces of Afghanistan have witnessed heavy rains and floods in recent days, but the floods in Badghis, Faryab and Baghlan provinces have caused more damage.

 "500 houses have been completely destroyed and another 2,000 have been destroyed, 300 head of livestock have been killed and nearly 3,000 hectares of agricultural land have been destroyed," a government spokesman for the Taliban's ministry told Reuters.

He said the Red Cross had reached out to the victims, but called on other international organizations to help those affected by the floods.
