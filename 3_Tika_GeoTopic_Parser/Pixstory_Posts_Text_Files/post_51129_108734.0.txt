International Yoga Day is celebrated annually on June 21. üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
 
PM Modi, during his speech at the UNGA, said, "Yoga is an invaluable gift of India's ancient tradition. It embodies unity of mind and body; thought and action; harmony between man and nature; a holistic approach to health and well-being. It is not about exercise but to discover the sense of oneness with yourself, the world and the nature. By changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness, it can help in well being. Let us work towards adopting an International Yoga Day." üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Importance of Yoga: üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Practiced in India since the 5th century, Yoga has been beneficial in keeping the body and mind in sound health. A holistic approach, Yoga targets all the different systems of the body and mind. It is said that the asanas make the body strong and flexible, as health improves; the mind too is renewed with confidence. The practice of Pranayama regulates the purification of the internal system , acting as a superior and able supplement to asanas. The energy that is generated in the body through these physical practices is then channeled into meditation or Dhyan for stability, peace and calm.
