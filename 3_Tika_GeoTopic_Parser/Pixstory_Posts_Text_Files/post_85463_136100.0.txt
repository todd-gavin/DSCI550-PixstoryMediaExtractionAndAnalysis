The transfer window is shut, so we now move on to our next fixture against Manchester United.

United are 3 in 3 for victories, and they are slowly adjusting to Ten Haag's style of play and system. We have already seen they can raise their performance for a top side like Liverpool, so they'll have early season proof they can perform. For us, we are yet to face a top 6 side so far so this will be a great test for us.

Key injuries in the centre of our midfield should see Sambi Lokonga keep his place, with perhaps Zinchenko returning. We should expect to see the same lineup as we saw against Aston Villa, pending updates on Ã˜degaard and Ramsdale's fitness.

For United, we may see Casemiro and Antony take part in some way - their fans will make their presence known so we need to be fully prepared.

What I'm most intrigued about is the approach from both sides. Do United step back, hit us on the counter, or play on the front foot as they did against Liverpool? Will we go with Plan A again and go for the fast first-half energy? The form of both sides make this match-up even more interesting.

History suggests our record at Old Trafford isn't great, however Mikel Arteta has already tasted victory as a coach at Old Trafford so the mental barrier shouldn't be as heavy. Victory against Utd will do wonders for our side, but I'm more keen to see what type of performance we can deliver which will show us 'progress' as fans. Both sides will want victory, so I'm expecting a great game. Personally, my nerves will be through the roof - but I'm confident!
