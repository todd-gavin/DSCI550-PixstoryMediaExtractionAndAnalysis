Who isn t ready to watch the next big sports dramatic picture in Bollywood and that to this time it will be on soccer that s right Amitabh Bachchan as coach with some real actors of Slum Soccer in India Directed by Nagraj Manjule JHUND hits theatres on th March A similar slum or backward society related sports film that I personally really liked watching is Coach Carter based on the true story of a California high school basketball coach who placed ahead of sports for a secured future of those kids Samuel L Jackson plays Ken Carter owns a store and chooses to take on a new job for a pittance coaching the Richmond High Oliers a ragtag basketball team that has been losing for years The year is and some of the records he set as a top athlete at the school are displayed on the walls Carter is a strict and ethical man who believes he can make a difference in the lives of his teammates who are largely poor African Americans He requires that everyone address each other as sir and that the players sign a contract promising to maintain a minimum grade average attend all classes sit in the front row and dress in a suit and tie on game day The team players are enthusiastic about their new coach s routine They develop a winning run once he inspires them to believe in themselves Everything appears to be well until Carter realises that the lads have not kept their end of the bargain when it comes to their academics Many of them are failing or not attending classes on a regular basis He locks the gym and compels the basketball players to catch up on their schoolwork much to the chagrin of the professors at Richmond High and the parents of the players Coach Carter played by Samuel L Jackson is a very moral guy whose charisma and values make him a tremendous force in the lives of these misbehaving teenagers This inspirational picture joins the ranks of notable sports films such as Hoosiers Remember the Titans and Friday Night Lights
