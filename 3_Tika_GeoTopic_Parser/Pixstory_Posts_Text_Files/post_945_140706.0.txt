Television anchor opened  champagne for announcing Queen Elizabeth's death. 
Though Britain lost many of it's colonies, including the jewel in the crown, India, by the time Queen Elizabeth came to power. 
For Argentina the memories of British imperial mindset are not a distant experience. 
For example, the Falklands war. 
The Falklands War was a ten-week undeclared war between Argentina and the United Kingdom in 1982 over two British dependent territories in the South Atlantic: the Falkland Islands and its territorial dependency, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Island
So the  news of the death of Queen Elizabeth II wasn't received by everyone around the world with the same level of shock and grief experienced by many in Britain. 
In Argentina, for reasons that many woulr agree, TV host Santiago Cúneo popped open a bottle of champagne live on air while announcing the passing of the British monarch. 
This is something.
