Strict security protocol has been put in place to ensure the safety and security of everyone who will be in Doha during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022, HE the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohamed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani has said.
He made the observation during an interview with Singapore's CNA Asia channel.
"We are very excited to host the FIFA World Cup in Doha in a few months from now. We are really looking forward to bring the world together post-Covid," HE Sheikh Mohamed said, noting that it is an event that brings happiness to people and "we are really keen to see that happening. We hope that everyone comes to Doha to see our country and enjoy our hospitality."
Regarding security during the event, he said: "Our security protocol that has been put in place is very strict to ensure the safety and security of everyone who is in Doha during the tournament."
He also highlighted the security co-operation that Qatar has with different countries and the crowd management protocol, which will help minimise any negative impact that might be associated with fan experience. "We are focusing on how to provide the best fan experience for all the fans that are coming. Qatar is a peaceful country. I believe even those people who get overexcited, when they see this peaceful environment, they will act peacefully as well."
