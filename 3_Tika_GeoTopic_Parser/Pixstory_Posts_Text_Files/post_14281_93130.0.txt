It seems natural to starting Juve's rankings so far this campaign from Saturday's match winner. Dusan Vlahovic is the top scorer at the Bianconeri with 22 goals (taking into account those scored in the first half of the season). DV7 now trails Ciro Immobile in the overall top-scorer standings. On Saturday in Sardinia, Vlahovic struck his fifth goal against Cagliari, the team he scored his first Serie A goal against - and now his favourite victims. His goals this season have earned a massive 20 points in total.

Just like on the pitch, Juan Cuadrado pops up everywhere in the rankings of Juventus players after the 32 league matches played until now. Juan is first for crosses (125), chances created (52), and successful take-ons (41). And one of his favourite go-to-guys is Matthijs de Ligt. Three of the Dutchman’s last four Serie A goals have been headers from a Cuadrado cross. Talking about de Ligt, he is the Juventus player that has completed the highest number of successful passes, 1372, just in front of Cuadrado, with 1323.

Despite being between the posts, Wojciech Szczęsny has still managed to recover the ball 190 times this season. The first outfield player in this ranking, meanwhile, is Manuel Locatelli with 153. Adrien Rabiot is the Bianconero that has won most tackles, 48, while Dybala is the leader in the team when it comes to shots attempted, 87, and on target, 33. In both of these last two rankings, in second place is Alvaro Morata, once again available after serving his one-game suspension.
