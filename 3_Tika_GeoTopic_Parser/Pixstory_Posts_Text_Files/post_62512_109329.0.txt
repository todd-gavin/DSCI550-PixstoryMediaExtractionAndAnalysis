Hahaha, you got me! Good one. But there's actually a very interesting fact about whales – actually, a lot of them but this fascinates me a lot – that not a lot of people know.

One of the most intriguing things about whales is their contribution to limiting the effects of climate change on the earth. Now, how do they do that?

Whales' regular movements help to transport nutrients throughout the ocean and support a healthy ecosystem by the development of phytoplankton. At least 50% of the oxygen in our atmosphere is produced by phytoplankton, that are small creatures that capture significant amounts of carbon from the atmosphere.

Therefore, the more whales we have, the more phytoplankton we'll have in the ocean, and the better off our seas and environments will be, which is exactly why the reducing population of whales is a matter of concern.
