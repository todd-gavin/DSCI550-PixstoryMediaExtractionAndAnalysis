Lorient vs Reims Probable Winners
Lorient have been a force to reckon with in this year’s Ligue 1 2022/23 campaign. They have just lost one game this season in the league and with a weak Reims touring them this weekend, we expect Lorient to win another game and build pressure on PSG at the top of the Ligue 1 points table.
