Share The Load ad by Ariel breaks stereotypes and challenges age-old traditions. Why is the Laundry only a mother’s job? This campaign encourages men to share the load and help out at home. Such ads bring hope for an egalitarian society.

The shift in the portrayal is evident in the latest Cadbury dairy milk chocolate commercial. They recreated a dairy milk chocolate ad of yesteryears where a woman is seen cheering her partner when he is playing cricket, and he hits six by introducing a small change, now it’s the man cheering his partner while she plays cricket. 

The idea of a perfect woman has been crystallised, polished by marketers, and presented to society. Misrepresentation, marginalisation, and misogynistic stereotypes have to change.

Communication creators should discard archaic thoughts, recognise the worth of women, and celebrate their life.
