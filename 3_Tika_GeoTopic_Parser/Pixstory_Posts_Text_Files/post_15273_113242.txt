A new study coordinated by the Vittorio Erspamer Department of Physiology and Pharmacology of Sapienza has identified some bacterial strains that mediate the beneficial effects of an enriched environment on the plasticity of the central nervous system. In recent years it has been demonstrated that an environment enriched from a motor, sensory and Social interaction can have a beneficial effect on the central nervous system as it promotes brain plasticity and cognitive function However, the possible role of intestinal microorganisms in mediating these beneficial effects had not yet been investigated A new study coordinated by Cristina Limatola of the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology Vittorio Erspamer of Sapienza University analyzed the changes induced by environmental stimuli in an enriched environment with respect to the standard conditions of the animal enclosure on the intestinal microbiota and its metabolites in an experimental mouse model. This research made it possible to identify some bacterial strains and the products of their metabolism in particular short chain fatty acids that mediate the beneficial effects of the enriched environment on the plasticity of the central nervous system Pasteur Italy the Italian Institute of Technology the Cnr the University of Trieste and the IRCCS Neuromed of Pozzilli Our work explains Cristina Limatola coordinator of the study adds two fundamental elements to current knowledge The first is that microglial cells i.e. cells of the central nervous system with immune function represent the interface between the environment and signals from the intestinal microbiota The second is that the changes in the environment in which we live and the stimuli we receive from it contribute crucially to determining the composition of our microbiota
