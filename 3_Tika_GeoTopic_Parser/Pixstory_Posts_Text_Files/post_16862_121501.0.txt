Shah Rukh Khan's Pathan, ❤️❤️

Ramesh Bala said that the film can be a blockbuster. "It’s been a long time since Shah Rukh Khan had a release. In the last few years, his movies have not done well. But Pathan has a huge star cast including Deepika Padukone and John Abraham, plus Yash Raj Films backing it so it can create wonders. However, they are yet to finish up the shooting, a lot is pending. But again, if the film is anything like his previous film Don or Raees, a complete action entertainer, then it could be a blockbuster," 🤯🤯🤯❤️❤️❤️


Now, Salman Khan's Tiger 3 ,produced by Yash Raj Films. Speaking about thebig-budget film, Ramesh said, "Tiger 3 again is a successful franchise. It has Salman Khan, Katrina and Yash Raj Films coming together, so it's good. Salman Khan has proved successful with the first two Tiger movies, so there is a big possibility for Tiger 3 to open well and the movie to do well at the box office."🔥🔥🔥❤️
