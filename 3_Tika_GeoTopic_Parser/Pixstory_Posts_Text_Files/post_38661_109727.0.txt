Even though Jose Mourinho won 3 titles with United namely UEFA Europa League, Carling Cup, and Community Shield. It's been 5 years since United won any titles and 10 years since they won Premier League.


United have been engaged actively in transfer with players linking like Frenkie De Jong, Anthony, Pau Torres, David Raum, and so on. But we have not been able to get any plus 11 million dividends paid to Glazers family has infuriated the fans even further. Yes, it has been a heartache for me with Rivals strengthening up with Manchester City getting Julian Alvarez, Haaland, Kalvin Philips, and Liverpool hijacking the United deal for Darwin Nunez. It has nothing been short of a disappointment for the United fanbase and I bet for Erik Ten Hag.


Manchester United has been my life and soul. It was with me during the high and lowest low. Watching United play overjoyed me, it bought a little kid in me alive seeing United play. I’ve been with United through high and low. I am a Mancunian through and through and no matter if United gets relegated I will stick with United till my last breath.
