Denmark and Spain will face each other at Brentford Community Stadium on the Matchday 3 of the Group B Euro 2022. Both teams are fighting for a spot in the knockouts and winning is crucial for both European heavyweights.

In Group B, Denmark find themselves in the third position with one win whereas Spain find 
themselves in the second position with the same result. However, the positive goal difference has kept Spain ahead of Denmark.

In the previous fixture, Spain lost 2-0 to Germany after rallying 4-1 against Finland. The team is marred by injuries as they miss out on Jenni Hermoso and Alexia Putellas for the crucial fixture.

On the other hand, Denmark ensured a 1-0 win in a closely contested game against Finland. 
Denmark had lost their first game to Germany but Pernille Harderâ€™s 72nd minute strike seemed to be enough for them to earn all three points. Denmark will also have Kathrine Moller Kuhl available for selection as she had received a red card in the first game.
