Diego, who is eight years Cavani's older, retired from football in 2018 following a two-decade career in which he was a big success.

Forlan won two European Golden Boots, one at Villarreal and the other at Atletico Madrid, and was awarded the 2010 World Cup's best player after helping the South Americans reach their first semi-final in 40 years.

Cavani was playing in his first tournament with the two-time champions, and he was ecstatic to have the chance to play alongside and learn from Forlan, who has established himself as one of Europe's most fearsome strikers.

“Yes, I was fortunate enough to have played alongside Diego,” said Cavani of his former team-mate. “For those of us who were starting out our development as players, seeing players like Diego who had already made a name for themselves in the football world was just fantastic!

“Because they were the kind of players who, back home, you would really follow closely, in order that one day in the future you might just be able to be like them.

“I then had the chance to play in the national team with him, so then it was a real honour for me to pick things up and learn from him, just like you always try and learn stuff from all those players who make their name in the world of football.

“So, as I say, it was a real pleasure and an honour for me to play alongside him and, in addition, we got to share some really big moments too, like playing together in big qualifying matches and then World Cup finals in South Africa.

“It was really special, and they were really great memories which will stay with me forever, as part of my life and my career.”

Diego had some memorable moments at Old Trafford, including a match-winning double against Liverpool in December 2002.
