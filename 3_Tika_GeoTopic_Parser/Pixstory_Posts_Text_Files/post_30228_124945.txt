Marc Marquez will make his return to the MotoGP next weekend. The Spaniard will not be at the start of the Austrian GP but will personally follow the Honda HRC team to stay close to the team and breathe the air of a grand prix for the first time after the complex intervention at the right arm to which Marquez has undergone in recent months updated on his situation in an interview with Deportes Quatro I have the experience of previous operations and it seems to me that I am on the right track Before the surgery I really wanted to do it because there was no alternative or I I was operating and had to retire My dream and my goal at the moment is not to win but to go back to having fun riding the bike again and do it without pain I know that if I succeed the rest will follow as a consequence At the moment it is not yet possible for the Spaniard make predictions about the timing of his return to competition I don&#39;t want to set times because they will be decided by the checks I&#39;ll do I&#39;m working hard I feel fine but it&#39;s hard because I still have doubts about my arm
