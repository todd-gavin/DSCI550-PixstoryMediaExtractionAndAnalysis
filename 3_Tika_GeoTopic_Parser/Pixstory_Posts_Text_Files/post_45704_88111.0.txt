NASA said that While an asteroid the size of a refrigerator was discovered hours before it collided with Earth's atmosphere, it was the fifth time in history that an asteroid was discovered just before it collided with our planet. 

On March 11, astronomer Krisztian Sarneczky of Hungary's Piszkesteto Observatory detected an asteroid. Sarneczky reported it to the Minor Planet Center of the International Astronomical Union, which confirmed it was the first time the asteroid had been seen. 

The asteroid's orbit was calculated by Nasa's "Scout" system, which constantly searches the Minor Planet Center's database for any potential impacts. The asteroid's orbit was found to be certain to hit Earth. The device then alerted Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California's Center for Near Earth Object Studies about the impact systems.

Luckily for Earth, the asteroid, named 2022 EB5, was around two metres long, a size “too small to pose a hazard to Earth”, Nasa said in a statement.

The asteroid would hit Earth's atmosphere around Jan Mayen, a Norwegian island about 480 kilometres (300 miles) northeast of Iceland, according to "Scout." At 5.23 p.m. ET, two hours after Sarneczky first spotted the asteroid, it collided with Earth's atmosphere, exactly as "Scout" predicted. 

It was the fifth occasion an asteroid was discovered hours before it collided with Earth, and the first since 2019.
