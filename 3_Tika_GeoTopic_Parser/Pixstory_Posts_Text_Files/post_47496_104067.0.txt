Burnley tried a brand of expansive football
after sacking Sean Dyche - and they did win three on the bounce. But, not having players
equipped the carry on that playstyle was ultimately what cost them.

Some might argue Burnley
were unlucky, and had they scored the same amount of points they did (35) last year - they
would have survived in the league. But that was more to do with how bad the relegated teams
were last year and how good the teams were this year. Well, except Norwich of course.

Standout Performer

1. Nick Pope

In such a disappointing campaign, it is goalkeeper Nick Pope who could hold his head high at
the end of it all. The shot stopper was in great form for the club, keeping opposition strikers at
bay to secure Burnley pointless draws consistently.

Pope managed to record 9 cleansheets this
season, with an average of 3.4 saves per game, at a success rate of 72%, with just one error
directly leading to an opposition goal. After Burnleyâ€™s relegation, Pope could move onto better
things as many clubs in the top flight looking to make a deal.

What's Next For Burnley?

Sadly, Burnley will have to turn their attention on rebuilding their squad to return to the Premier
League. They would be focused on hiring a manager perhaps with a more expansive style of
football to make their success more sustainable in the long term. Burnley will face a busy player
both to buy and sell players, as they adapt to life in the Championship after 6 years.
