My round up on a bittersweet afternoon up at old Trafford We went into this game full of confidence after winning on the spin in the premier league and you could see that confidence in the minutes something we haven t seen us do away from home against a top team for some time Utd started well but after minutes I think we played some absolutely spectacular football we scored a beautiful goal with martinelli latching onto a Saka through ball to cooly slot the ball away to make it however that goal was disallowed by VAR softly What bugs me with VAR not just regarding this game but most games they look like they re trying to disallow goals rather than look for clear and obvious errors however that s neither here nor there we didn t get the decision and we move on Against the run of play Gabriel got caught out of position and United punished us with new signing Antony slotting a nice finish past Ramsdale After that we absolutely bossed the game and we finally got a breakthrough this time Saka slotting away after we pinched the ball again in midfield this time legally I think this is where our confidence killed us we thought we re going to go and win this and instantly got cut open and rashford slotted away to make it Now I was a midfielder who played and your job is to not follow the ball but to anticipate danger Lokonga didn t do that and I don t want to blame him however we got carried away thinking let s get them and lost the basic principles of sniffing out danger and letting the ball do the work rather than forcing it Arteta then rolled the dice way to early for me minutes left and threw all attacking players on which lost our shape and conceded again instantly Overall this team for me is going places Beautiful football Naivety and overconfidence killed us We go again Thursday UP THE GUN
