This film is ... Confusing. The dialouge seems like gibberish and everybody is alluding to things that they think everybody already knows or doesn't know... I don't actually know, the dialouge was confusing in the previous films but I could just follow it, this one is another level. The action scenes arn't as focussed on martial arts anymore (until the end fight anyway) instead they focus on gun fights, spaceships and super human powers which isn't bad, still some exciting scenes but I've always been more a fan of the martial arts fighting as seen in the the previous films. Even though the film was only released 6 months after Reloaded, the CGI and special effects look noticably better and even though they digitized Neo again for the final fight something about doing it at night helped make it look more acceptable - probably because it was dark and could hide the imperfections better. The plot of this film feels more like a war movie at times, there's less time spent in The Matrix and more time focussed on protecting Zion from immenant attack. Its a nice change from the previous films and just as exciting I felt, certainly more suspenseful especially when the robots break through the roof into Zion. The design of the armoured war machines isn't necessarily unique I feel but they were well generated and the actual look of them was intimidating. The love story between Neo and Trinity is still centre stage and I understand its actually the crux of the film but as with the other movies, the on screen chemistry feels forced. Love plays a big part in the film as well, and even the computer programs start to feel "love"... It's interesting to think of machines feeling love but I hate love stories at the best of times so it was my least favorite plot point. 
Final Verdict: A visual marvel, but very confusing and a slighty underwhelming ending to the trilogy. It's still a decent sci-fi film, but it can't compare to the first film and is probably on par with Reloaded.
