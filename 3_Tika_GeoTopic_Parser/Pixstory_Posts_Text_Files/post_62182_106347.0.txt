Just like in turbulent waters, anchor helps the ship to navigate and tread to safety, Breath is the most essential aspect of meditation. 

Breath acts like the anchor which helps us through the turmoils of meditation. It is fascinating how our body is such a complex piece of machinery, and it's equally fascinating to note that Breath is one of the most dynamic aspects of our body. 

It has been studied, that all the emotions of our body trigger a very specific breathing pattern, which is not duplicated not even in the slightest. When we are angry we take shallow repetitive breaths, when we are anxious we take shallow warm breaths, which heat up our body. While happiness, triggers long deep and cool breaths, which stabilises our body. 

This is the main reason, why our parents tell us to take 2 deep breaths when we feel anxious of angry, coz deep breaths trigger happiness in our mind, which makes sure that we take our decisions with due care and not in haste which may result in regrets down the line. 

Hence breath is one of the most important aspects of not just meditation, but also our life.
