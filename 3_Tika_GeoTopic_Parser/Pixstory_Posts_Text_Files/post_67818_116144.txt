BCCI announced India Women s T I squad for the upcoming Commonwealth Games in Birmingham The member squad looks well rounded when it comes to quality and talent but there have been a few inclusions and exclusions that have left many wondering and surprised To start with Taniya Bhatia who hasn t played a T I since March has been included while the likes of Richa Ghosh and Poonam Yadav are in the stand bys Looking at the squad it is clear that the selectors have looked for batting depth by picking Sneh Rana who was rested for the recently concluded Sri Lanka tour Rana s off spin coupled with some brilliant lower order batting has helped her make it to the squad again Not that she is a bad pick but leaving out a wicket taker like Poonam Yadav can turn out to be fatal for India Very few must have forgotten the way the leg spinner ran through Australia s line up in the opening game of T World Cup in against Australia Also with all the matches set to be played at Edgbaston in Birmingham the venue which has already hosted a lot of cricket this summer the pitches are bound to get slower and be conducive for spinners The veteran has played T Internationals in her career since making her debut back in and has picked up wickets But over the course of time she has gone down the pecking order having last played in the format in February this year However it is startling to see her not getting picked much in the shortest format given the fact that Poonam has gone wicketless only on six occasions in last innings Also among those innings times she conceded runs or less per over during her spells Interestingly though she has never played a T I in her career but then not many from the current team have that experience either Clearly Poonam Yadav should ve been part of the line up for the Commonwealth Games
