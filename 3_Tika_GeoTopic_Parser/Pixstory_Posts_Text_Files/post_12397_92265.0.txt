Embrace Yourself And Find The Courage To Be Yourselfâ€¨
Fear can stop you from talking to a loved one or joining a new class. If you let it, any unpleasant emotion (such grief, anxiety, or rage) can get in the way of your goals.

Nobody wants to be uneasy. So we avoid unpleasant emotions at great cost.
You might avoid applying for that promotion for fear of rejection. You might avoid moving to a new city for fear of becoming sad and lonely. You may have hung onto a bad habit or relationship out of fear of change.

But sometimes experiencing difficult feelings is the best thing for you. Working through your emotions may not only help you feel better, but you may also learn that your sentiments aren't as bad as you thought.



People can learn to handle distress in several ways. While there is no magic cure for unpleasant feelings, there are steps you may do to make them more bearable.

Keep a Positive Attitude
People often assume you're either born brave or not. While it is true that some people are more naturally brave than others, it does not indicate that you are doomed.

Find Your Strengths
To live a courageous life, it helps to first identify your strengths and achievements. People who recognise and develop their strengths are happier, less sad, and more resilient, according to study.

Leave Your Comfort Zone
Fear might prohibit you from having fun, pursuing your dreams, or expressing who you truly are. And if you want to alter that element of your life, you must be intentional.
