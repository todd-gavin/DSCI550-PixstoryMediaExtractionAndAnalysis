Which book comes to your mind when people ask you, what’s your favourite book?For me, it’s a tie between two books by the same author Mr Khalid Hosseini. The Kite Runner & A Thousand Splendid Suns are two marvels. I think about these books so often, comparing the lives of Amir and Miriam to so many others. I see myself in Amir, the sensitive kid with a sense of entitlement. I was so much like him growing up that it baffles me. Both these novels have given me something my very own even though I’m not from Afghanistan. Maybe its the reflection of the subcontinent’s culture in smallest of details or maybe its the relatability from our day to day lives or more. Crazy how novels can move a person and change them.
