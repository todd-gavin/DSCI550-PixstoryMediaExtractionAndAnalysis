EMPLOYMENT, it very tricky, many have gotten out of bed, drank some coffee, put on there clothes, and say the immortal phrase....DAMN I HATE MY JOB.....but let's say you lose your employment? You have no money, can't find a job, nobody is calling you, then it hits you, yeah my job did suck in so many ways......but at least I had one. I've learned over the years to NEVER complain and your employment, because they're some out there that can do you job, maybe even better.....ALLHANDSWITHROBERTO.GMX.COM
