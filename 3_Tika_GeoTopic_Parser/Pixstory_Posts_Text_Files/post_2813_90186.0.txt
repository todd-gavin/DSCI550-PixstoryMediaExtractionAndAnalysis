It’s the Oscar Sunday. The film industry is again gripped with its seasonal anxiety. But  the Oscar show is not what it used to be. Its ratings have been in decline for a decade. Is it the end of movies – is it goodbye to the movie experience as we know it? 

Oscar viewership has been declining since linear TV viewers are switching to streaming video, which gives them more and better choice. On top of that, for two years, the show has been affected by the pandemic too. So it was not surprising that last year, its viewership touched a new low: https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/awards/oscars-ratings-plunge-all-time-low-dropping-58-percent-last-n1265412 Only 10.4 million people sat before their TV sets to watch the best talent in the industry being honored. According to Nielsen data, that was a nearly 56% drop from the 23.6 million viewers the previous year: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/02/oscars-2021-nielsen-data-shows-viewers-have-lost-interest-in-award-shows.html

But other marquee award shows – Emmys and Grammys – have been losing audiences too: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/21/emmys-2020-primetime-awards-show-ratings-drop-to-all-time-low.html#:~:text=The%2072nd%20Annual%20Primetime%20Emmy,to%20early%20estimates%20from%20Nielsen.

Then, it may not be the end of movies as such, but of award shows on TV. But what happened to the magic of the Oscar night? The pandemic alone cannot be blamed, as the trend had been on before the outbreak – though Covid-19 would have certainly pushed it further.

NYT commentator Ross Douthat’s “favored theory is that the Oscars are declining because the movies they were made to showcase have been slowly disappearing”: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/25/opinion/oscars-movies-end.html 

Yes, there was a time when the Oscars meant “Titanic” competing with “LA Confidential” or “Saving Private Ryan” pitted against “Shakespeare in Love”. In this year’s ten contenders, some have that old-fashioned big-screen charm (for example, Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story” and sci-fi epic “Dune”), but many like “Don’t Look Up” are more like small-screen dramas.

Gone are the days of going to the theatre with friends, munching popcorn and watching “the world’s largest metaphor hit the ice-berg (as ‘The Onion’ headlined the Titanic tragedy: http://edition.cnn.com/books/news/9904/01/onion/titanic.html) A three-hour Japanese film about the complex relationship between a widowed thespian and his young female chauffeur (“Drive My Car”) is something you watch and even enjoy but on a streaming platform.
