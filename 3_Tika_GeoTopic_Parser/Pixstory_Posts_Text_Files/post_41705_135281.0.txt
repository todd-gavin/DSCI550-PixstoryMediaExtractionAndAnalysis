Ricky Ponting, a legendary figure in Australian cricket, has backed Aaron Finch and offered the white-ball captain of his country some advice as he nears the conclusion of his playing days. 

Fox Sports reported that the near-36-year-old Finch will play a key role in leading Australia to success in the T20 World Cup later this year, but the veteran from Victoria has been inconsistent over the previous 18 months, which hasn't been enough to quell his detractors. 

Since the beginning of 2021, the potent right-hander has averaged 17.55 in ODI cricket, only reaching 45 once in his past nine games. 

Even during last year’s unforgettable T20 World Cup triumph in the United Arab Emirates, Finch ended the tournament with a series of low scores – 9 (11) against the West Indies, a second-ball duck against Pakistan in the semi-final and 5 (7) against New Zealand in the decider.

I guess it’s nice for him to have some support!
