As an avid gamer I have played many games and there are some games I have a tendency to revisit no matter how much I play them Some of these games include the Dark Souls franchise Dawn Of War franchise Republic Commando Jedi Outcast Jedi Academy the Metro series Crisis Witcher Diablo and And while it is not my absolute favourite I have found that there is one game I have revisited more times than any other game accumulating nearly hours and that is Skyrim Why is it There are many games that I prefer over Skyrim which include Dark Souls and Republic Commando Witcher and Metro Exodus to name just a few But why Skyrim then considering the game s age and flaws I guess it is just more relaxing As much as I love the Souls series and Elden Ring the last thing I want is to subject myself to intense gruelling nerve wracking gameplay after a tiring day at work Instead I enter my PC and play a year old game when I have access to games Well journeying across the harsh and dangerous but beautiful world of Skyrim as a heavy armour and weapons wielding badass Dovahkin the slayer of dragons and a mortal with the power of gods stealing sneaking putting buckets over people s heads killing bandits giants Stormcloaks Thalmor Draugr and dragons is a bash Of course the greatest fun is modding Though I have about only a few mods creating new weapons armour buildings adding new characters changing the designs of certain enemies and going about either being a law abiding protector of Skyrim or a murderous madman and killing everyone from dragons to citizens is the greatest piece of relaxation there is I have probably played Skyrim about times by now but I always seem to come back to it despite all of its problems whether it is the bugs glitches or lack of detail And I never get sick of returning to it every two months for whatever reason recently even more so
