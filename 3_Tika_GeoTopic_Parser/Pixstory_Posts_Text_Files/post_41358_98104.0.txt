A special grand jury was formed on Monday to investigate whether former President Donald Trump and others attempted to sway Georgia's 2020 election illegally. 

US News reported that the inquiry has been ongoing since early last year, and Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has taken the extraordinary step of soliciting the assistance of a special grand jury. In a letter to the chief judge, she stated that the special grand jury would be able to issue subpoenas to those who had previously refused to cooperate. 

The extraordinary grand jury will be seated for up to a year, beginning Monday, according to the chief judge.

It has been stated that her team is investigating a phone discussion between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in January 2021, in which Trump pressed Raffensperger to "find" the votes he needed to win the state. She's also said they're looking into a phone call between U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham and Raffensperger in November 2020, the abrupt resignation of the U.S. attorney in Atlanta on Jan. 4, 2021, and comments made during election hearings in Georgia in December 2020. 

It's unclear what allegations, if any, Willis would bring against Trump or anybody else.

Let’s see what happens next!
