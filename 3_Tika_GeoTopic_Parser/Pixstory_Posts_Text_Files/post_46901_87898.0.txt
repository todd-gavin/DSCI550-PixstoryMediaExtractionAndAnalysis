Mildred Ella "Babe" Didrikson Zaharias, the American Athlete is regarded as one of the greatest athletes of all time. She showed her excellence in golf, basketball,  baseball, track and field, softball and was an expert diver, roller-skater, and bowler.
‌
‌Didrikson set four world records, earning two gold medals and one silver medal for track and field in the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics.
‌
‌She is still, the only track and field athlete, male or female, to win individual Olympic medals in separate running, throwing and jumping events.
‌
‌Although she showed her prowess in many fields she was most known for Golf. She competed in the Los Angeles Open, a PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) tournament. She shot 81 and 84 and missed the cut, after which she became America's first female golf celebrity and the leading player of the 1940s and early 1950s. 
‌
‌ By 1950, she had won every golf title available: she won the 1947 Titleholders Championship and the 1948 U.S. Women's Open for her fourth and fifth major championships. She won 17 straight women's amateur victories, a feat never equalled by anyone.
‌
‌She suffered from colon cancer; at a time when many Americans abstained to seek diagnosis or treatment for suspected cancer, she advocated for cancer awareness. She used her fame and position as the spokesperson for the American Cancer Society to raise funds for cancer patients. 
‌
‌During her time, women were not so common to compete in sports, and Didrikson faced much sexism as well as claims that she might actually be a man.
‌
‌Her extraordinary conviction and talent became an inspiration to many women to become active in participation in sports and to break the female athletic norms.
