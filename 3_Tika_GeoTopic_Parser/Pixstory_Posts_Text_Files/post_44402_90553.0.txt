Manchester City and Manchester United are two of the Premier League's most powerful clubs. Their rivalry extends back years, and some of the city's biggest names have played on both sides. However, several players have represented both teams. We look at five such players who have represented both Manchester clubs in this article.

Owen Hargreaves
Hargreaves is one of the players that has lately played for both United and City, despite not having played much for either side. In a Â£16 million transfer, the midfielder joined United from Bayern Munich in 2007. Injuries hampered his playing time at Old Trafford, and he only made 39 appearances for the club in four years, with only 27 of those in the Premier League.

He did, however, leave United with a couple of accolades. In the 2007/08 season, he was a member of the team that won both the Premier League and the Champions League. After his contract expired in 2011, he went across Manchester to join City, but injuries limited his playing time there as well. During his stay at the club, he only appeared once in the league, falling short of the required number of appearances to earn a Premier League winners' medal.

Peter Schmeichel
Schmeichel's name has become synonymous with Manchester United as a result of his remarkable success there, but few people are aware that he also spent time in the Blue half of the city. The Dane spent eight years at Old Trafford, where he cemented his reputation as one of the best goalkeepers in Premier League history.
With United, he won five Premier League titles, three FA Cups, and, most notably, the Champions League in 1999. Three years after leaving Old Trafford, he completed his career with a season with Manchester City. In the 2002/03 season, he made 29 appearances for the Citizens.
