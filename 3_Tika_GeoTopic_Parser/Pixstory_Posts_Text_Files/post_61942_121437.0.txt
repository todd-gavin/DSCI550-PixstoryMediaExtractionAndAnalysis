T

he upcoming ninth season of The Flash on the CW will be its last. It will debut in 2023 and consist of 13 episodes, making this the shortest season of its run.

As Deadline reported, speculation that Season 9 could be The Flash‘s final chapter started in January when star Grant Gustin agreed to a one-year deal, capping his Season 9 involvement at 15 episodes

The 13-episode midseason order would put The Flash series finale just weeks ahead of the planned June 23 release of Warner Bros.’ The Flash movie starring Ezra Miller as the title character. Coincidentally, the long-delayed film originally was announced just a week after The Flash series’ October 7 premiere on the CW. The series’ ending is expected to wrap its own storyline and not set up the movie in any way, sources said.

The CW brass has been diligent about giving its signature series a proper ending, when possible. The Flash is one of two legacy shows whose next seasons will be last, along with Riverdale.

After ranking as the CW’s top series for the first half of its run, The Flash has remained one of the network’s strongest performers, with Season 8 finishing as one of the network’s most-watched shows of the 2021-22 season, with 1.03 million viewers, and ranking among its most streamed shows on its digital platforms.
