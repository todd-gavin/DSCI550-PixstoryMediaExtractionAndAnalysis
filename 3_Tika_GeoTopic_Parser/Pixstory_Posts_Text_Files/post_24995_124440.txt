The year old felt uneasy in north London for a number of reasons one of which was that after Arsenal sought to use him as a swap deal for the Thomas Partey trade he was ultimately loaned out to Atletico Madrid for the campaign Mikel Arteta should have attempted to persuade him to remain now that he was prepared to return Thomas Partey s season ending injury caused the Gunners to struggle in the middle of the field which contributed to Arsenal s failure to reach their top four goals Although Mohamed Elneny just extended his contract Partey s fitness remains unpredictable and supporters have been urging the team to bring in a defensive midfielder Long term desire Yves Bissouma s million move to Tottenham angered Arsenal supporters Bissouma was always eager to join Arsenal but despite their sincere desire they were unable to sign him According to recent speculation playmaker Youri Tielemans is close to joining Arsenal As a deep lying playmaker Tielemans will probably face off against Granit Xhaka Arteta started to use Xhaka in an advanced position relieving him of his defensive responsibilities Torreira s continued presence might be advantageous particularly given that Arsenal will play more games this year than they did last Arteta ought to have persuaded him to stay unless the team intends to bring in a top notch defensive midfielder Image credit LTorreira
