In every domain of life, black people have to face struggles that white people can’t even comprehend . One would think that education and sensitivity towards the topic of racism would make people more aware but alas, no! 

Some even say that racism is only prevalent in the uneducated sector of society but that is not the case according to me. The most brutal of racist behaviour always happens in plain sight and in the most prestigious of places.

U.S News reported that top colleges are accused of violating Black Athletes' Rights! 
NCAA Division I colleges are allegedly violating the civil rights of Black basketball players and major college football players by barring remuneration, according to a court complaint filed by a nonprofit that advocates for college athletes. 

Moreover, the National College Players Association said on Tuesday that it has filed a complaint with the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights. According to the NCPA, NCAA restrictions barring colleges from rewarding athletes harm Black students disproportionately.

“I believe it’s important to first acknowledge the reality of the business that is college football," Stanford football player Elijah Higgins said in a statement through the NCPA.

Furthermore, The NCPA claims that relative to the revenue generated by their sports, Division I football players and men's and women's basketball players have been denied tens of thousands of dollars in compensation annually. The group has also pushed for college athletes to receive employee status, a step university officials largely oppose.
