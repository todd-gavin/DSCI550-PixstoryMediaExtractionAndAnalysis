The ban on stun guns and tasers by Rhode island was struck down by the US District Judge William E. Smith. 

The decision was based on a lawsuit filed by two stun gun buyers in Rhode Island. These residents contended that stun guns act as a measure of self-defence and actually reduces the violence as stun guns only provide intense electric shocks. 

Smith’s ruling said the law was a violation of the second amendment, which authorizes Americans to bear arms.

As per Boston Globe, Frank Saccoccio, a Rhode Island gun-rights attorney who represented the two people who challenged the law said:“I’m very happy we’ve prevailed,What this does is allow individuals that do not want to carry a firearm to carry a less than a lethal form of protection in the state of Rhode Island.”
This law actually bars people from carrying or possessing “any instrument or weapons like blackjack, slingshot, billy, sand club, sandbag, metal knuckles, slap glove, bludgeon, stun-gun, or the so-called ‘Kung-Fu’ weapons. However, the judge has only lifted the law on stun guns and tasers.

According to smith the state has failed to prove that stun guns and Tasers cause public nuisance and abuse. As the ban on Rhode island is lifted, Hawai remains as the only state that prohibits the possession of stun guns in the US.
