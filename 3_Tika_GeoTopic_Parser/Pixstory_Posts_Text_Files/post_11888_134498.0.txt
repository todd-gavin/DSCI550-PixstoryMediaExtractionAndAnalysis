They say - So many marriages aren't working out nowadays , what's wrong with you girls and womans ? ðŸ¤”
My answer to this question is so simple ! And it's - Because today's girls and womans prefer to walk out rather than tolerating everything silently ! âœ…
Do you know what is the hardest decision for a woman ?? Leaving her marriage , leaving her relationship ! Womans invest a lot in there relationships and always make efforts to save it ! But the truth is Sometimes it really does not matter how much efforts womans do ! Because sometimes relationships gives us pain rather than love !
Walking out of toxic relationship is a sign that you are stronge and brave enough ! âœ…
Lastly i really want to say that - Wedding ring is the smallest handcuff ever made , so choose your prison mate wisely !
