RRR, it’s not just another movie for fans all over India but it’s the emotions and today when I attended the Press Event of the movie “RRR,” I saw the hype among all the media, they are cheering to every dialogue of the trailer, cheering to every beat of the songs and when the star cast of RRR including Ramcharan, Jr. NTR and Alia Bhatt with the director of the movie S.S. Rajamouli arrived, all journalist started applauding and didn’t stop for two minutes at least. 

When the entire cast of RRR settled down, the Managing Director of PVR (Sanjeev Bijli) welcomed them and then they announced that PVR and RRR are launching six NFTs (Two posters and four Memorabilia) and will gift to the people who will win the contest that will be run by PVR in near future. 

Then, the Cast of the RRR started giving answers to the Journalists who are present there. 

The first journalist asked Alia Bhatt What do you learn while working with Rajamouli and what’s your process to prepare for any movie? 

Alia answered this question by saying that, I learned one thing from Rajamouli Sir that ‘Make silence your biggest strength while acting’ and Alia answered the second question by saying that ‘There is only one process for me to prepare for a movie and that is, to listen what the director is saying to you and do it.’

Then another journalist asked Rajamouli Sir that going by the trailer, fans didn’t get to know much about Alia’s role, is this the strategy of you and producers? 

S.S. Rajamouli answered this by saying, ‘No, there is no such strategy from my and producer’s side, it’s just that Alia is doing a cameo in the movie but her role is very important and impactful.’

I will write about the press event in parts where there will be more questions related to the movie, preparation, and how the cast of the movie get along with each other while shooting.
