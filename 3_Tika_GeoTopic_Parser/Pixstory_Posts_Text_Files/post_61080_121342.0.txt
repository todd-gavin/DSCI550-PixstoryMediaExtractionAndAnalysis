Yoga is globally recognised as an effective workout regime to instill healthy and happy wellbeing. Breastfeeding mothers need extra care and attention to their diet, workout routine, and overall lifestyle.

Yoga may pose helpful in improving the health of breastfeeding mothers. Below, I have listed some yoga positions that have been proven helpful for lactating women.
1. Cat-Cow Stretch (Chakravakasana)- Get on your knees and hands.Lift your back upwards, forming a mountain-like structure.While you do that, make sure you push your face inwards, looking at your own torso.Now, push your back inwards, forming a 'U' position with your back.While you do that, look towards the ceiling.Repeat mountain motion with face inwards and then â€˜U' structure with face upwards for a minute.Do not speed up, In fact, you are advised to switch positions slowly and gradually
2. Downward Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana) - Lay flat on the ground facing the floor.Slowly lift your torso and form a mountain-like structure with your body.Your palms need to be farther apart and reaching outwards.
