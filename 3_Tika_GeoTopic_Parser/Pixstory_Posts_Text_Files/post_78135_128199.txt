Even though my favourite food is a burger I enjoy other foods as well like Pizza and Pasta However I feel when it comes to eating daily nothing beats homemade food The food we eat daily is what helps us gain energy We cannot eat our favourite food daily as it will become boring then but our staple food is something we enjoy eating on an everyday basis Here are the some foods which I really like my icecream as well as gola in summer But but but Favourite foods are meant to be enjoyed when there is any special occasion or when you are tired of your regular homemade food Eating too much of your favourite food will make your taste buds adjust to it and eventually it will not remain our favourite Excess of anything is bad and the same goes for our favourite food Thus we must eat it occasionally so that it remains our favourite
