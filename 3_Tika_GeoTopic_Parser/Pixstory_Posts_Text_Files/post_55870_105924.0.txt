Targeted tax credits are nothing but a way for the government to attract investment from corporates. In short, they’re nothing more than subsidies doled out through the tax code. Not only is this fiscally inconsistent, but we have no guarantee that Congress would provide services to these energy technologies and companies in the long run by subsidizing them.
‌
‌Moreover, the renewable industry says they are no longer needed. Federal subsidies for renewables have not lowered consumer electricity costs and a large portion of subsidies are sent overseas.
‌
‌Artificial governmental incentives such as subsidies, tax credits, mandates and tariffs should be removed. In the search for alternate energy sources, we are nicely served when firms in the competitive marketplace seek profits at their own risk.

In the competitive marketplace, firms can only obtain profits for themselves by bestowing benefits on others. However, with government assistance, firms can make themselves better off without conferring any benefits on anyone.
