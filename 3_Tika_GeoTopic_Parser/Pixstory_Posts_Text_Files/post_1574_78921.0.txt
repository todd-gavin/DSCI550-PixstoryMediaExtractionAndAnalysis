The Philadelphia 76ers don't want to part with additional pieces in a potential swap of guard Ben Simmons for Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal.

According to David Aldridge and Josh Robbins of The Athletic, the Sixers have "held firm" in their stance that they specifically don't want to make guard Tyrese Maxey or wing Matisse Thybulle part of a package for Beal.

Despite that, the 76ers have "made no secret" that Beal is among the players they would be willing to take in exchange for Simmons.

Despite not having Simmons available, the 31-19 Sixers are currently second in the Eastern Conference, just one game behind the first-place Chicago Bulls.

Superstar center and MVP candidate Joel Embiid has undoubtedly been the driving force behind Philly's success, but he is far from alone.

Maxey, who is in his second NBA season after going 21st overall in the 2020 NBA draft, has taken a huge leap forward in 2021-22. The 21-year-old guard is third on the team in scoring with 16.8 points per game, and he's averaging 4.7 assists, 3.5 rebounds and 1.4 three-pointers made while shooting 46.7 percent from the field and 40.1 percent from beyond the arc.

Meanwhile, Thybulle is one of the NBA's best young defenders and he is a key part of the Sixers' rotation, averaging 26.1 minutes per game. His averages of 5.8 points, 2.4 rebounds, 1.8 steals, 1.2 assists and 1.1 blocks per game don't necessarily leap off the page, but he is the type of player that winning teams need.

At the same time, the Sixers likely need a player of Beal's caliber to become true championship contenders.

The 28-year-old Beal is a three-time All-Star who averaged over 30 points per game in both the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons. His scoring average is down to 23.2 points per game this season, but he is averaging a career-high 6.6 assists per game.

Washington would likely want more than just Simmons in return for Beal, though. If the Sixers are unwilling to part with any of their other young pieces, a trade may not be in the cards.
