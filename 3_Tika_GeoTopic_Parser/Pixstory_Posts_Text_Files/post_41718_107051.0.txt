After a 0-0 draw against Peru in Doha, Qatar, Australia qualified for their sixth consecutive World Cup with an incredible 5-4 penalty shootout win. 

As per the Sporting News, substitute goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne, who was brought on for the shootout only to replace captain Maty Ryan, made two saves, one of which was the game-winner, to send the green and gold to Qatar 2022 against all odds. 

Despite being the better team for the entire 120 minutes, the Socceroos, like Peru, struggled to produce many clear-cut chances. 

After being fed by Awer Mabil, Ajdin Hrustic had Australia's greatest chance in the 88th minute, but he smashed his effort across the face.

Edison Flores did strike the post for Peru in extra time with a shot from a tight angle but the green and gold managed to get through to penalties.

After Martin Boyle had his first penalty saved by Peru goalkeeper Pedro Gallese, it looked like it would be an uphill battle for Australia to get through to Qatar. But Redmayne managed to save Peru's sixth penalty on to the woodwork, taken by Luis Advincula, to even up the shootout as it headed into sudden death.
