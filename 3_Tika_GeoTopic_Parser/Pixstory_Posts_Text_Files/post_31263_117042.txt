The persistence of the water crisis that is affecting the whole of northern Italy has dramatic repercussions on the state of health of the lakes and rivers that cross our region This was revealed by the Lombardy Lakes dossier drawn up by Legambiente Lombardia which collects the results of the monitoring carried out by the Goletta campaign of the Lakes in relation to the water flow data of the basins The reduction of rainwater in the first six months of the sensitive state is calculated as a water deficit higher than according to the ARPA data which translates into an absence of water supply in the lakes equal to over billion cubic meters since the beginning of the year The situation is made more serious by the lack of replenishment of the rivers by the Alpine basins which in this period should still benefit from the meltwater the snow this year disappeared more than a month and a half earlier even at the highest altitudes and with the heat pushing the freezing point to altitudes above meters what is melting are the snow and ice that we once called perennial Already for over a month most of the residual flows that still feed the pre-alpine lakes formed by meltwater from glaciers, a resource that is paying a heavy toll in terms of loss of non-renewable glaciological accumulation, motivating concerns that concern not only the continuation of the summer but also the growing severity of water crises in the coming years in which the water of the Alpine glaciers will be progressively more and more dilapidated Of the large lakes, Garda is the only one that still has more than its reservoir volume, while Lake Maggiore, whose basin has received a moderate contribution from summer rains, retains the amount of water available for the regulation of effluent flow in Ticino Since the beginning of the year, according to the measures of the Lake Regulators, the Verbano water accountancy has lost almost million cubic meters of inflows, while over millions have been lost in Sebino millions in Eridio and over millions in Benaco
