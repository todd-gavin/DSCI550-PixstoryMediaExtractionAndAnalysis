Once again, Harry encapsulated us in his magic. Harry's House is a beautiful album. All the pieces were amazing, with different tones. My favourite one however is 'Matilda', the heartbreaking beauty of the album.

It's about a person finding a family to call her own. Building her own new world. She acts like it's no big deal but in reality she's carrying some heavy past, a burden on her shoulders. A burden of abandonment and abuse from family, something that is supposed to be your home. 

The song tells us, or Matilda, that it's okay to grieve and feel pain. It's okay to move on and find someone to love. Someone who is not blood. That it's okay to let them go who don't make you feel safe and make you feel loved.

"You can let it go,
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family."

It also says about not being able to protect someone from trauma, the pain of knowing you weren't there. But in the end, the experience is not yours, nor the burden. You can just sit and listen and give them a shoulder to lean on. Matilda will find her happiness and so will you.
