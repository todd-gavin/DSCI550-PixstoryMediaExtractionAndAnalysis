Star Wars has once again headed off an in the right direction with the first three episodes of Andor representing a move to a different side of Star Wars that is both rather fresh and surprisingly good This is indeed ironic and funny because Andor is in fact a prequel to a spin off prequel movie and Rogue One tells the story of a character in that movie i e Cassian Andor By the time of Rogue One Andor was a Rebel spy and assassin and joins a squadron called Rogue One where he along with other members of the squadron are killed while assaulting a key Imperial outpost Seeking to tell a story completely set apart from the Skywalker saga the conflicts of the Jedi and the Sith or the conflicts of the Force Andor shows the early life of Cassian Andor his childhood his upbringing and the experiences that influenced the man that he grew up into Representing a necessary change Andor tells the life and story of a normal man with a strong heart and what drove him to become a warrior and rebel With this the show packs a sense of maturity not seen for a long time in the Star Wars universe almost packing the aesthetics and sensibilities of a novel Pretty much the best Star Wars show since The Mandalorian Andor is a grounded dark and gritty Bourne Identity type spy thriller which is rife with a good sense of world building not relying on any type of nostalgia The show feels alive with all the background characters actually being in focus and having something to do instead of being focused on one man alone A bit of a slow burner content on taking its time on developing the plot Andor tells the story set between the events of Obi Wan Kenobi Rebels and Rogue One By this point the Empire is well entrenched in its position with Imperial officials daily abusing their power there is anger and restlessness in the galaxy as flames of the Rebellion have begun to spark Score
