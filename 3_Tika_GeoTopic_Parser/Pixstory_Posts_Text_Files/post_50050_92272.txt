 Since The American Library Association ALA stands with attempted to remove or restrict materials Challenges are reported to ALA and in most years of them are banned The books are mainly challenged by parents teachers and political or religious groups There are many reasons stated to ban a book such as explicit sexual content violence and religious reasons Isn t it a restriction on the freedom of speech of an individual As a literature enthusiast I want all kinds of content in books Books should be openly criticised for the contents or style of writing This revolves around creative and free space to address opinions Banning books is never an option Let books of all kinds emerge and let the audience decide whether to accept or reject it s their sense of opinion Similarly an author s opinion or freedom of expression should not be curbed Moreover the contents been burned and banned in past are the matters of discussion in the present This will surely be repeated Restricting content on children is another issue parents ban content from children especially studies on sexual orientation which is completely objectionable Children are individuals regardless of their age yet if parents want to control the content they could regulate its access It doesn t need to restrict the content to many who wish to see it Also this would enable the children in need to access it in future after all it s their choice to read whatever they want Many frequently challenged books enable people to get a better idea of the world and their place in it Instilling a utopian concept of the world would not prepare the next generation for the future Different perspectives should be discussed so that empathy can be developed in certain matters Moreover books are the best teachers Access to all kinds of books is needed for a person s mental growth and to have an opinion Curtailing the creativity of an individual is not fair let more books be born on anything and everything in the world
