•In Stockholm, it was estimated that the Congestion Charges, introduced on a pilot basis in 2006 and on a more
permanent basis in 2007, resulted in a 15% drop in vehicle miles travelled, leading to emissions reductions of 8.5% for
nitrogen oxides, and 13% for PM10.

•In Berlin, a speed limit of 30 km/h was imposed in several areas with particularly high air pollution levels in 2018, with
the aim of decreasing both the number of road accidents and air pollution. According to one evaluation, a speed limit
of 30 km/h in Berlin has resulted in the reduction of NO2
pollution levels by 10 to 15%.

•In Paris, the municipal authorities have announced the intention to phase out the use of diesel cars by 2024 and petrol
cars by 2030, with only electric cars being allowed. In 2019, all diesel vehicles aged 13 years or over were banned
from streets in the city centre. Likewise, the region of Brussels has decided to ban diesel cars from 2030, and all petrol
cars (although not trucks nor vans) from 2035.

•Low emission zones are implemented in a number of European cities. For example, in Belgium, to enter parts of
Antwerp, Brussels or Ghent, drivers have to check in advance whether their vehicles meet the emission level
thresholds, and in certain cases register their vehicles on relevant websites.
