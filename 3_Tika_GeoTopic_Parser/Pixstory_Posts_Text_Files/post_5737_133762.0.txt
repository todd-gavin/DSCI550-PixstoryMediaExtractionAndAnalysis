Supertech Twin Towers at Sector 93a, Noida, Uttar Pradesh are set to be demolished today at 2:30 pm. The 100 meter structure will be brought down in an act of implosion. 
This will be the first time in India that a tower of this height will be brought down. 
The towers will be brought down after the Supreme court order of finding it to be in violation of norms.
Around 3700kg of explosives will be used to brought down the structure. Mumbai based Edifice engineering has partnered with South African Jet demolitions for this task.
Residents of the nearby socities have been evacuated and will be allowed to return to their homes in the evening today.
The demolition of the twin towers will be carried out through the waterfall implosion technique which would bring them down within a few seconds literally like a house of cards.
The big bang would leave behind a whopping 55,000 tonnes of debris, even as some estimates put the figure at 80,000 tonnes. The debris would take an estimated three months to be cleared and disposed of.
