Escaping Conviction is Greer Rivers debut novel and I’m so glad I got to read an ARC copy! I love romantic suspense novels and this one was the perfect blend of romance and the suspense plot woven through.

Jason has returned to Ashland after being away for years fighting the bad guys. When he left, Jules was heartbroken but channeled that into becoming a BAB (Boss Ass Bitch) and dominating the legal field. Jason is arrested in connection with his sister’s disappearance and calls the best defense lawyer in the county. Jules and Jason must work quickly trying to find out where and what happened to Jason’s sister while Jason is being framed for various crimes.

The story is so beautifully told and the second chance romance between Jules and Jason is perfect. It’s told from a few different character’s point of view which is so nice to see the suspense piece unfold.

his book has it all! Second chances, heart pumping action, moments so heartbreaking it will make you scream at the book (and maybe at Miss Rivers a bit too) Sexy scenes so hot you will want to melt, and an ending soooooo good you'll be flipping the pages or swiping franticly at your kindle because you wish there was more.
Jules and Jason are perfection together. Separately, they are two strong amazing characters
