Actor Kareena Kapoor Khan who is a mother of two sons - Taimur Ali Khan and Jeh Ali Khan - has launched her debut book, Kareena Kapoor Khan's Pregnancy Bible, based on both her pregnancy phases, complications, ups and downs. 👩‍👦‍👦❤️

She also written a book on it, kareena kapoor khan pregnancy bible🤰🤰

During the book launch, she had a chat with her bestie Karan Johar on an Instagram Live session where they spoke at length about parenthood, her kids and of course, her book on pregnancy. KJo asked Kareena about breastfeeding and the conjectures around the subject. He also asked if mothers should feel guilty if they are not able to breastfeed their kids.😔❌

To these questions, 

Kareena said that there’s no crown like 'the best mother of the world’ as a mother is one regardless. She said, “Just because there’s so much societal pressure on how it has to be done, I think there’s no crown for wearing 'the best mother of the world', everyone is the best mother in the world. The fact that you have given birth to another human being and you had the ability and capability of doing that then you’re the best mother in the world. There’s no formula that you have to breastfeed for a certain time, of course, but six months is what they say, ideally that can go up to a year and a half if you have that kind of milk, it would be amazing.”✅✅❤️

Addressing the complications due to physical and mental health during and after pregnancy, 🤰🤰

Kareena further said, “But for some mothers or women, due to hormonal changes, thyroid, mental state of mind, they don’t get enough milk. Sometimes, if you have to do an emergency Caesarean, it takes time for milk to come because when you do normal delivery, they say it comes faster and when you operate it takes time. Mother should have the patience to see that through but I feel that just do the best you can, what works for each woman at that time.”😌😌❤️
