Man Utd are trying to sweep in to capture Malacia along with Frenkie De Jong. As they both share the same agents, Man Utd will try to get their man and beat Olympique Lyon. 


Lyon had secured the signature of the young Dutchman with £11 million plus £2.5m but United made an improved bid to snap up the young versatile athletic defender. He would give Alex Telles and Luke Shaw a challenge and he might hold down the starting berth.
