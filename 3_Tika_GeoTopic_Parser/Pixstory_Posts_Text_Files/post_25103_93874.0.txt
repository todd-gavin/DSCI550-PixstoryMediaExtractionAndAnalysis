Just six days after their breathtaking encounter at the Etihad Stadium, Liverpool and Manchester City will lock horns against each other in the semifinals of the FA Cup on Saturday. Both teams managed to reach the semifinals of the UCL, after coming through tough outings over the midweek. Liverpool safely held onto their 3-1 lead, as Benefica fought valiantly in the second leg to take home a 3-3 draw. 

However, Jurgen Klopp played the right cards at the right time, as he rotated his playing 11 heavily in the second leg against the Portugese side. With four back to back crucial and big games lined up for the Reds, it was vital for Klopp to ensure that his side remained injury-free, and capable of competing on three fronts. The likes of Trent Alexander Arnold, Andrew Robertson, Sadio Mane, Van Djik, Fabinho and Mohamed Salah were all on the bench on Wednesday evening. Liverpool have been pretty solid at home, especially when it comes to European games. Hence, Klopp took a gamble which certainly did pay off for him.

A few of them were called into action in the second half, but they did get some good rest after a high intensity battle against Manchester City on Sunday.

As a result, Liverpool might just have the edge over City in their second visit to Etihad Stadium in under a week. Pep Guardiola fielded his best playing 11 against Atletico Madrid, in what was a very enticing second leg. The Blues have now had two high intensity games in a span of just four days, with a similar looking playing 11. This could take a huge toll on the players, who are required to be at their best again on Saturday.

Meanwhile, Klopp can welcome back the likes of Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane to the starting 11, as the German manager will hope to see the former back among the goals. As for City, they might consider resting the likes of Kevin de Bruyne, and a few changes in the backline.
