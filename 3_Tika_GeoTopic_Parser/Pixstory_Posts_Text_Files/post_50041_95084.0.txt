from Spring and All (1923)

so much depends
upon

a red wheel
barrow

glazed with rain
water

beside the white
chickens


The poem is a typical example of imagism. The poetry represents an image. It concentrates on the objective representation of objects. The poem is free-verse in form. This poem is also a good example of enjambment which are break between the lines which gives a meditative nature to the poem. Here the form of the poem is also responsible for the meaning it conveys.
 Whatever you may decide the poem means intellectually, as art it holds on to its memorable shape and colour. Its images are so powerfully conveyed as what is registered in the mind of an individual reader is exactly what they should expect from the poem.
