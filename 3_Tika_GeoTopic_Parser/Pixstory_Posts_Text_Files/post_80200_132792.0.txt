Most of us love clicking pictures, the Instagram and Snapchat filters bring in the much needed glitz , glamour, aesthetic and what we think the ‘perfect’ photo. But when we meet our loved ones in real life, they adore us as we are. With those dark circles, acne, spots and all of which we consider our imperfections . Then why can’t we love ourselves like that? 

The constant obsession of being fair, have the perfect body, height, weight and the list is an endless one. Today’s youth can make the world go round.

They have really understood the need of the hour is conscious advertising. I won’t drag it further and put my message and intent simply-

Every woman is beautiful 
Every woman is equal
