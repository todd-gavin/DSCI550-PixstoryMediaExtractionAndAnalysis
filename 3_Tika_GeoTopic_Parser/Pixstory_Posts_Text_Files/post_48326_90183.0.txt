"Who is David Raya?"

This question was the one which was making the rounds in Spain. As the Spain squad arrived the Las Rozas HQ for their preparation for the upcoming friendlies, there was a face among them who was unknown to many. It was David Raya, the 26 year Barcelona born goalkeeper whose name was in the news papers this week as he took David De Gea's place in the Spain National Team.

His name is what most people know about him. He has come out of nowhere and emerged into the spotlight. Raya has only 15 top flight football games under his belt. Raya started his footballing journey in Cornella in Spain and left for Blackburn Rovers in England at the age of 16 in 2012. Not too long ago he was playing in the English Conference, the lowest tier of English professional football. Yet his progress has been so immense that he is already a part of the Spain National setup. Last year Raya was a part of an exciting Brentford team who were promoted to the Premier League. His immense rise is a football fairy tale.

Raya's selection in place of the mercurial David De Gea shows what the Spain coach Luis Enrique really values. Not phased by superstar names the Spain coach has preferred to select players based on their performances and the way they fit his team. David De Gea is an excellent shot stopper but Enrique likes playing out from the back and keeping a very high defensive line. In both these areas Raya is far superior to De Gea in terms of distribution and sweeping behind his back four. Raya was the best goalkeeper in terms of passes completed in the Championship. Raya's selection shows how the Spain NT setup is gradually changing with the superstar influence fading and the emergence of new players.
