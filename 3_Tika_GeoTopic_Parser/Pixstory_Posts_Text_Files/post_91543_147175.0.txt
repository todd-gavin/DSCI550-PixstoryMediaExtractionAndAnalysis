I hail from Udaipur! 
Though i could not think of anything that i wish to change about it as the city is as perfect and beautiful, but one thing that can be considered is cleanliness.
Being a tourist place, the city is not so clean as it should be .
A bit of cleanliness will just enhance its beauty and make it more serene than before.
