Day 6

It was our last day in Manali so we wanted to use it to the full. While having our morning tea with the host of the cottage, she suggested we should stay at Jispa. It was the first time we heard this name. Clueless as to what it is, the host told us that Jispa is a quiet little village located on the Manali Leh route. It is not known to many as it mostly acts as a stopover for people traveling to Ladakh. 

We all got excited as it was going to be the unexplored and offbeat destination for our trip. The travel time wasn’t an issue as the recent opening of the Atal Tunnel has made things much easier and the distance shorter.

We took our car, stuffed all our bags, and were all set to leave to witness some amazing views and the beauty of nature. As Jispa is at an altitude of 3,200 meters so the weather here remains cold throughout the year. It was a mesmerizing village, 20 km north of Keylong and 7 km south of Darcha along the Leh-Manali Highway and on the banks of Bhaga River. 

In fact the views we saw on our way before reaching there were total bliss.

After reaching there, we booked two camps to stay in. The camps were located parallel to the river. The cold winds with rays of sun falling on our faces in the afternoon with some pakoras to eat was an unbeaten combination. 

It was our first time staying in the camp. The camps were neat and clean with all the necessary items available. They were constructed in a way to give us the feel of a proper self-set up camp but with all facilities and comfort, we could ask for. As it was getting darker it was getting cold too. We sat next to the bonfire and had dinner there. Later, we spent our night singing, dancing, and enjoying literally every moment while we were there.
