Progressive rock has always been the black sheep among rock n roll being constantly ostracized for its insistence on change and fascination with sonic experimentation From the s up till today rock bands have tried to reinvent themselves in different ways by making their music more varied in terms of structure rhythm style approach and overall genre They do this by either being musically more experimental than their peers leading to a more complex form of music seldom appreciated by most Not all experiments pay off and sometimes artists aiming to go prog enter the premium douche club but overall prog is not the kind of music you can ever really enjoy if you are looking for background music Rather than hearing you must listen and that can prove to be a bit taxing Nonetheless if you are willing to dedicate a bit of time you will enter into a whole new world of music which you would have never experienced otherwise Progressive music does not have a standard sound besides artists trying to experiment with various sounds for example a hard rock band can experiment simultaneously with pop symphonic music jazz arena rock etc There are far too many great artists and albums to choose from so These are the top greatest progressive rock albums to choose from to start off with Magnum Chase The Dragon Rush Pink Floyd Animals Opeth In Cauda Venenum Magnum A Storyteller s Night Rush A Farewell To Kings King Crimson In Court of the Crimson King Pink Floyd The Wall Kansas Leftoverture Hawkwind Warrior on the Edge of Time Opeth Damnation Porcupine Tree Fear of a Blank Planet The Mars Volta Frances The Mute Kansas Point of No Return Rush Hemispheres Porcupine Tree In Absentia Jethro Tull Thick as a Brick King Crimson In The Wake of Poseidon Gentle Giant The Power and the Glory Genesis The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway
