Flashback to the first game week of the season Manchester United put past Leeds United with Raphael Varane unveiled to a roaring Old Trafford A little less than a month later Cristiano Ronaldo made a romantic return to the Theatre of Dreams as United put past Newcastle United with CR scoring a brace Even the most pessimistic of United fans would not have pictured that months later the hopes of Europa League qualification for the Red Devils would rest in the hands of Brighton and Hove Albion That Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would be sacked and the replacement manager would have the lowest win percentage in club history That the locker room would be in complete disarray and new leaks about player unhappiness would come out on a daily basis However the facts remain that this is how the season unraveled and that Manchester United face their most important summer window since Sir Alex something that has been said about every summer window The less said about this season the better but it is crucial to go back and reflect on how everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong It is crucial to understand the reason behind the humiliating collapse and how it can be avoided in the future something I am sure that ETH will put a lot of time and effort into dissecting It is also important to make sure that the issues are not reduced to a blame game All parties are partially responsible for the utter humiliation of a season The Glazers for the awful club management throughout the years OGS for his managerial performances to start the season and his insistence on playing out of form players Ralph Rangnick for failing to salvage an entirely achievable fourth place in the league and his subpar performances as an interim and ultimately the players for some truly pathetic individual and team performances throughout the season
