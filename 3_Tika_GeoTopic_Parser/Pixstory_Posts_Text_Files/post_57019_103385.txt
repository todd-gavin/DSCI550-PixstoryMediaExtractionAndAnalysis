If we speak of grief and bereavement there won t be a single definition that would define it perfectly The way we experience loss differs and how we heal from it also varies So how can people judge someone who is grieving If the loss is personal then there won t be an only way to manifest it The intensity could be more or less depending on how long it takes a person to accept that someone is gone For the past few years after the proliferation of social media in every corner of the world people have taken that judgemental approach to comprehending grief But unfortunately most of it happens with known faces and celebrities Although it also occurs in families and known circles where people tend to describe the process of ideal grieving Someone who hasn t posted a condolences note or a mourning message on social media is often vilified and judged for not mourning correctly and is instead considered inhuman There are some misunderstood ideas about grief that people need to follow and show that they re mourning to bulwark themselves against these comments and judging What someone feels in their loss should be accepted in every way Of course it could stay for a longer time or maybe for a short time when they understand death is inevitable but the healing process cannot be confined or decried because it doesn t follow the set notions
