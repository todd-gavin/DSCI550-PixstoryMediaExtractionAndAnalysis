It is sometimes incomprehensible how earlier artists and writers could envision or predict the future world and the time that is about to come. 

Their art portrayed a picture of the future or a subtle similarity that exists in them when compared to their work.
That's how kafkaesque resembles today's world, the nightmarish and surreal world of the writer Franz Kafka. 

It is "when you enter a surreal world in which all your control patterns and plans begin to fall to pieces when you find yourself against a force that does not lend itself to how you perceive the world. You don’t give up, you don’t lie down and die. What you do is struggle against this with all of your equipment, with whatever you have. But of course, you don’t stand a chance.’ the words of Frederick R. Karl, a biographer.

What if the world was already created to represent surreality? What if we already are a part of that world. And the existence of a constant bureaucratic force that never ceases to inflict you.

People are oppressed, prosecuted and struggle against it, but eventually, they must bear it. Kafka defines hopelessness in his work as anger, fear, confusion and inability to deal with the situation someone is present in because there's no other way to come out of it.
