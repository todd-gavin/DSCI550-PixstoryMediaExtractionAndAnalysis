Real Madrid put up a show at the RCDE Stadium at Barcelona against Espanyol as they cruised past the Periquitos in a feisty affair. 
Karim Benzema's magical brace and some Vinicius Jr. brilliance did the job for Real Madrid in taking their revenge from last season when they lost 2-1 to Espanyol. 
The match was a great spectacle as Ancelotti's men now sit top of the pack leading Laliga and is on course to defend their title. 
Ancelotti heaped praise on gamechangers like Fede Valverde, Camanga as well as Rodrygo in this post match press conference, here is what he said:
"Camavinga was already instrumental last season. When the game is stretched his energy gives us a boost, just like that of Rodrygo, Valverde or Vinicius. The reason we won the game was because we had more energy than our opponents on the pitch".
ON HAZARD
"Hazard might have been an option, but I didn't want to unbalance the team. We already had Rodrygo, Vinicius and Karim playing. Bringing on another forward could have been risky. He has my full backing and it's not a problem if he doesn't play, doesn't get on the pitch or doesn't warm up.  He will get playing time. I'm not Hazard's, Benzema's, Mendy's, Camavinga's or Valverde's coach. I'm Real Madrid's coach.
