Australia is known around the world as a dangerous country where it seems like everything is out to get you. Large spiders hide in toilets, crocodiles lurk in estuaries, and some of the most dangerous snakes in the world live in our suburbs. 

Many people are particularly afraid of and fascinated by snakes. But the fear is more often tha n not, unfounded!

Snake bites are very, very rare [in Australia] and often the fault of the person being bitten. Most bites occur when people are trying to kill a snake or show off.

Most snakes would rather slither away from humans than fight them. “Snakes don’t perceive humans as food and they don’t aggressively bite things out of malice. Their venom is used to subdue prey that would otherwise be impossible for a snake to eat,” says Dion Wedd, curator of the Territory Wildlife Park, NT. “If their only escape route is past a human with a shovel, then they are likely to react in the only way they can.”

So, let’s break this myth and celebrate snakes for the beautiful animals they are!
