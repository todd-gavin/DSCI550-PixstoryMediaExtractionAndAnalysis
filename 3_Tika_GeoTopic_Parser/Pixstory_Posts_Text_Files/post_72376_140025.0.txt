Kareena Kapoor, who tied the knot with Saif Ali Khan in 2012, recently recalled that she had rejected his marriage proposal twice or possibly more than that before saying yes. Kareena said though she took some time before agreeing to get married, she always knew that she was going to marry Saif.

Asked what was the reason behind her initial resistance to Saif's proposal, the actor said, â€œI was still in love. Maybe I thought it was too soon, or that we're just kind of getting to know each other a little bit. I think it was because of that, that's all. But I think I was always sure that I was gonna marry him."

Kareena and Saif welcomed their first child-- son Taimur Ali Khan, four years after their marriage in 2016. They welcomed their second child Jehangir Ali Khan in February last year. The couple will celebrate a decade of their marriage in October this year.
