O Sorrow!
Why dost borrow
The natural hue of health, from vermeil lips?–
To give maiden blushes
To the white rose bushes?
Or is it thy dewy hand the daisy tips?

O Sorrow!
Why dost borrow
The lustrous passion from a falcon-eye?–
To give the glow-worm light?
Or, on a moonless night,
To tinge, on siren shores, the salt sea-spry?

O Sorrow!
Why dost borrow
The mellow ditties from a mourning tongue?–
To give at evening pale
Unto the nightingale,
That thou mayst listen the cold dews among?

O Sorrow!
Why dost borrow
Heart’s lightness from the merriment of May?–
A lover would not tread
A cowslip on the head,
Though he should dance from eve till peep of day–
Nor any drooping flower
Held sacred for thy bower,
Wherever he may sport himself and play.

John Keats
