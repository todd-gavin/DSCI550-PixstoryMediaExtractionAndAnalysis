When I first started reading I thought Thrillers were the best genre since they capture your attention and keep you guessing about what would happen next After a while I started reading informative and non fiction books about science and technology history philosophy and so and so These books not only appeal to your mind but they also help you improve your general understanding But then I switched to reading fiction I discovered how much I adore that genre and all of the options it offers From a parallel universe to a historical paradise we ve come a long way I enjoy reading romantic novels on occasions I really like science fiction as well At this point I m just reading whatever looks interesting to me and piques my interest but I have to admit fiction has a hold on me What genre of books is your favorite
