Styling is a way to present yourself to others in a different and unique manner. It all starts with evaluating someone's figure and silhouette to see which clothes fit best. Good styling helps you shape up your unique identity and your own personal brand which is so important in today's day and age. The purpose of the stylist's work is to help you become an expert in shaping your image, so you can connect with your style through your own “I”. ❤️
