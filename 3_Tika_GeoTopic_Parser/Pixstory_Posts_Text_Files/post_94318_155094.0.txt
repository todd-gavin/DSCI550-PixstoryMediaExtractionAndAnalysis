Spain began their U-17 Women’s World Cup 2022 campaign today against Columbia at the DY Patil Stadium. They eked out a narrow 1-0 win and although the 3 points are what matter at the end, praise must be given to the Columbian who played phenomenally well. No one had really expected them to perform so well against the strong Spanish side. They could easily have tied the match had they been a bit luckier. 
Spain’s number 10 Camacho started dominating the Columbian defence line from the very beginning. Within just 11 minutes, she broke past the defence dribbling past two defenders and had a clear shot at the goal but a goal-line clearance saved Columbia. 
Columbia, however, were quick to respond. Their no.9 Munoz Rojas attempted a brilliant long-distance shot which was fisted away by goalkeeper Fuente Andres at the last moment. 
It was a pretty open game with both sides having back-to-back ball movements but it was Spain that dominated for the majority of the game. For instance, Spanish midfielder Lopez missed two back-to-back chances in a span of 10 minutes between 20’ and 30’. Spain looked really unlucky in the first half of the match. Just before the half time, the ball pinballed in the Columbia box at one particular instance but they somehow survived. 
Spain finally broke the deadlock through super-sub Jone Amezaga Martinez at the 85th minute. Following a long ball in a counter-attack, Amezaga jolted her way into the empty opposition box. She smoothly cut inside to trick one defender before beautifully finishing at the near post. 
With this, Spain kicked off their 2022 FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup campaign in style with a win. They are placed in Group C alongside China, Mexico and Columbia. 
Up next, they will face the Mexico U-17 team on 15th October. Earlier today, Mexico suffered a shocking 2-1 defeat against China.
