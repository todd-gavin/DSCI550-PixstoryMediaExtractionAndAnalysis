Racism has been a social devil since always Inequality and prejudice against black people and other immigrants were ingrained in the United States and there have been many instances to prove it The phrase white supremacy has permeated the mind of individuals who think their race and identity should be kept on a pedestal that shouldn t be equal to someone do not match that superiority The problem is not new and learning begins from a tender age However to change the root cause of racism it is essential to see what children are taught about these terms of oppression and superiority in their schools and by their parents Ideologies are construed by the milieu where someone is brought up It is not innate or integral in humans so to change it we need to comprehend the cause that is inflicting everyone The killing of innocent lives in Buffalo is another picture of how deeply racism is embedded in American society The murder of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd which gained too much controversy was some other example The construction of racial categories that segregates people from a particular group as they don t fit in there aggravates the views of racism Here the disparities are created by the ingrained qualities of hierarchy and power that supports people to think of their status first and discriminate against black people Even media have a role in picturing the biases and igniting the hate people have for others These crimes driven by hate or racism can only be eradicated if the work is done to remove the causes that eventually embolden racism
