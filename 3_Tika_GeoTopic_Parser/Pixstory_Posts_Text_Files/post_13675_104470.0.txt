My school years have ended for many years. I remember the last day of the exams every year well, I ran from school to home with great enthusiasm.ðŸ§š
How the sound of the school bell reminds me of that time ... I remember well. After that, I had to look for several different hobbies to fill my hot summer days with them. I thought to my friends that the days under the hot sun at the bottom of our alley would turn the loneliness of the noon into a crowd of our childish commotion ...
These days, when June is half over and the feeling of hot and slimy summer is reviving those good days in my memory, I think of children and teenagers who have reached the end of school exams and should spend their free time in the best way. . These days, however, computer games have replaced many of the leisure trainings, and of course, many trainings are done only for the purpose of spending time on a part-time basis. But I, like many others, believe that everything that starts from childhood and adolescence will have a tremendous impact on the future of our children and, above all, on the future of our loved ones, and how good it is for parents to guide and choose the right education. Encourage your child fundamentally and truly that is the correct and fundamental education of childhood and adolescence
