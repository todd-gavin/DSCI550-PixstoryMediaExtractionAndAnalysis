 Scientists have discovered a new SARS CoV like virus in Russian bats named Khosta This virus has the ability to resist the current COVID vaccine It is believed to be competent at infecting human bodies by penetrating into the cells of human and it is resistant to all the existing coronavirus vaccines The Khosta and Khosta viruses were discovered in Russian bats in Khosta was found in Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and Khosta in R hipposideros bats The initial examinations on the viruses suggested that they were not a threat to human bodies But later tests showed Khosta could not be neutralised by the serums and Covid vaccines A team at Washington State University s Paul G Allen School found that the Khosta can spike protein to infect human cells while being immune to monoclonal antibodies and existing vaccines against SARS CoV Unlike the COVID causing coronavirus the Khosta virus is incapable to cause serious diseases in humans But it could cause serious diseases in human beings if it gets mixed with genes of COVID By now the virus has shown no signs of spilling over to humans But if it happens the natural COVID immunity may still be able to neutralise the virus However Scientists have now called for the development of universal vaccines against the viruses found in the fauna or else new viruses and their transmission rates might become another headache for health spectators
