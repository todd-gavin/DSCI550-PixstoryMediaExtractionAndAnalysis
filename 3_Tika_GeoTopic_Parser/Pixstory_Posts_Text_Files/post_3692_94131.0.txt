Viacom18 announced the launch of Sports18, the network’s dedicated sports broadcasting channel.

The pay channel will be available for subscription at an MRP of Rs 8. BestMediaInfo.com was the first to report about the launch on March 24, 2022.

Sports18 will be the new home to the sports properties, including the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022, NBA, LaLiga, Ligue 1, Serie A, Abu Dhabi T10, and top ATP & BWF events. Apart from premier picks from the world of football, basketball, tennis, cricket and badminton, the channel will provide fans access to programming covering international sports news, magazine and highlights shows..

“We are pleased to launch a dedicated sports channel for an audience across demographics and geographies,” said Viacom18 Sports CEO Anil Jayaraj. “Sports18 will strive to be India’s most-coveted broadcast network by providing fans easy access to a comprehensive bouquet of international and premier sports content.”

Recently, it was also reported that ViacomCBS Inc will sell 39% of its joint venture shares with Reliance industries to investment firm Lupa Systems. Lupa Systems is a private investment company which is run by Uday Shankar, the former Chairman of Star India and President of Walt Disney Company Asia Pacific, and James Murdoch, son of media baron Rupert Murdoch.

Earlier it had been reported that with BCCI opting for an e-auction, instead of closed bids, in the name of transparency for IPL media rights, Viacom18 led by Uday Shankar is the front runner to win IPL media rights.

Although there will be big players eying the upcoming IPL media rights, Uday Shankar’s re-entry with Reliance is being seen as a game-changer.

Shankar is expected to build Viacom18’s Sports network with Jayaraj, who along with Shankar won the last IPL media rights for Star India.

The industry is expecting that the coming together of Shankar and Jayaraj is almost a surety that Viacom18 will bag the IPL media rights.
