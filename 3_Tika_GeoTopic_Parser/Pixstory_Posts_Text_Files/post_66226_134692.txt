 Although my measures cannot be counted on a large scale I can assure you that they can be followed easily Please excuse me if you find them to be too repetitive First and foremost if you are person who cannot survive without the tap of water being on the whole time Eg Face wash shaving brushing then I would suggest you go for a mug of water This will enable you to keep track of the amount of water you spill and measure your need If you are looking to conserve water then I would suggest you to ditch showers and get yourself a bucket and a small mug Keep reducing the amount of water you spend on a daily basis and keep it strictly to your need If you are a person who uses RO water purifier at home then please be informed that for every glass of water that is purified more than glasses of water is wasted So please store that water and use them to clean the floors car bike or flushing An average flush tank is around Litres So every time you flush look at the amount of water being utilized Use wisely Personally my diet consists of rice and dal on a daily basis So I store the water that is being used to cleanse the rice and dal and water my plants The water from the AC outlets can be used to wash your outdoor flooring Never I repeat NEVER put down plastic wrappers straws on the ground They are going to stay there forever and never let a grain of grass grow Worse if it is going to be consumed by stray animals Reduce your usage of tissues and stick to carrying handkerchiefs If your nearby places have trees like eucalyptus rubber then please be informed they suck out ground water in large quantities Remove them if they do not hold any value Implement rain water harvesting if you haven t already Do not burn plastics tyres they are highly toxic
