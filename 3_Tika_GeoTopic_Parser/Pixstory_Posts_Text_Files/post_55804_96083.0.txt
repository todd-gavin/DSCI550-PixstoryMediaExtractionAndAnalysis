On Tuesday night, the federal budget for arts and culture was bleak. 

With the end of the Morrison government's fiscal stimulus programme for culture, the RISE fund, governmental financing for cultural creation will be rapidly withdrawn. 

This year, the arts portfolio budget line would shrink by 19 percent, or roughly A$190 million. The budget's forecast estimates also cut funds for a number of funding programmes and cultural institutions. Regional arts, community broadcasting, contemporary music, Screen Australia, and the National Library of Australia all face cuts.

It should come as no surprise that in such a tight budget, there was no room for publishing or literature. There were no new announcements to aid in the writing process. 

The Australia Council for the Arts is getting a small boost in funding, as is the vital public lending right subsidy, which helps authors and publishers whose work is borrowed in libraries and schools. These minor gains, however, are significantly below inflation, which is expected to be 4.25 percent this year, resulting in real-term decreases.

Letâ€™s see what the future holds for the publishing industry!
