CAT AND MOUSE By Ted Hughes On the sheep cropped summit under hot sun The mouse crouched staring out the chance It dared not take Time and a world Too old to alter the five mile prospect Woods villages farms hummed its heat heavy Stupor of life Whether to two Feet or four how are prayers contracted Whether in God s eye or the eye of a cat The poem shows the point of view of a mouse There is no major reference to the cat in the poem however this animal is there as God This existence of the cat is the source of the fear of the mouse like how God like existence puts people in fear Moreover the citation to the cat depicting the violent face of the creator is at one hand ironic and interesting on the other In fact the poet summarizes the emotional turmoil inside a mouse s heart Ted Hughes has handled a very controversial theme in a subtle way
