How to shop for your collagen? 🛒
Here are three important things to look for when you are purchasing a collagen supplement.✨
1. Always look for a collagen with vitamin C as it aids in collagen production and maintenance.
🍊 Vitamin C is the glue that binds collagen fibers together.
2. Make sure your collagen is third party certified and free from additives and fillers.
3.  Check if hydrolysed on lable.
Structurally, collagen is a relatively large molecule that your body cannot absorb as such and therefore needs to be broken down into smaller peptides.🔘
Hydrolysed collagen is broken down into smaller, easy to process particles.💦
There are other multiple factors that go into choosing a collagen supplement that's unique to you and for the health benefits you are looking for.🔍
