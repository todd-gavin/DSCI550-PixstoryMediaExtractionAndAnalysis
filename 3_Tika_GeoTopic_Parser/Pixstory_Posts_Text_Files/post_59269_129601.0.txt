After narrowly escaping death at the hands of the Dames Blanches, Lou, Reid, Coco, and Ansel are on the run from coven, kingdom, and church—fugitives with nowhere to hide.

So, I have some seriously mixed feelings about Blood and Honey.

After reading Serpent and Dover earlier this year, Blood and Honey was high on my most anticipated reads.

But here’s the tea – Blood and Honey suffers from second book syndrome. There’s just no way to sugar-coat it. The religious undertones and feminist themes dissipated as the crew scoured the countryside looking for allies. And unfortunately, it felt like that obligatory filler book where not a lot happens.

That said, I still really enjoyed Blood and Honey. I just wasn’t blown away, like I’d originally expected.

Blood and Honey picks up right where Serpent and Dove left off. Lou, Reid, Ansel, Coco, Beau and Madame Labelle are hiding underneath the canopy of the La Fôret des Yeux after fleeing the Chateau. Right of the bat, Shelby draws you in with witty bantering and bickering as Lou attempts to cook bread over the camp oven. But don’t expect a recap – I would highly recommend brushing up on Serpent and Dove before starting Blood and Honey.
