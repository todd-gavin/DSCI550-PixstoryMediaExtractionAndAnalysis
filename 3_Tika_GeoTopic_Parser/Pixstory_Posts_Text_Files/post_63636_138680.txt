One of the most famous female fronted metal bands today Deceivers is the th album by Swedish melodic death metal band Arch Enemy and is essentially turbo charged thrash metal with loads of melodic death metal riffing Deceivers offers more or less the same brand of metal we are used to with Arch Enemy it marks a slightly more expansive and slightly more dramatic approach with the album featuring a more thrash metal influenced approach featuring a mixture of infectious melodies heavy riffs thrashing grooves and strong female guttural vocals with some clean vocals from time to time Musically it is very typical of Arch Enemy with no notable additions or any radical experimenting in their style Alissa White Gluz s vocals are always a pleasure to listen to while the guitar work of Michael Ammot and Jeff Loomis is crazy though nothing else should be expected of them Daniel Erlandsonn s drumming is like machine gun fire while Sharlee D Angelo does quite a good job on the bass Starting all out from its opener Handshake with Hell the album does not let up featuring a bunch of amazing riffs vocal and instrumental performances Deceiver Deceiver is a killer track while In The Eye Of The Storm provides a nice change of pace going from thrashing fast to slightly slower pace Songs like The Watcher and Sunset Over The Empire prove there is no lack of aggression or energy in Arch Enemy Spreading Black Wings and Exiled From The Earth are two really brilliant tracks bound make you headbang like crazy Possessing crazy riffs awesome melodies thrashy drumming cool bass work and sexy vocals Deceivers shows a level of musical progression that does not stray too far from the usual Arch Enemy sound Overall not overly ambitious or too experimental or unique Deceivers has just the right amount of variety to keep you engaged while at the same time it is not overly complex Score
