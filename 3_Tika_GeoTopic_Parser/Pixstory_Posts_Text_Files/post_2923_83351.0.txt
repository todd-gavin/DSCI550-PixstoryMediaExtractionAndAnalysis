When Putin finally started action this week, the West was confounded. If Russia recognizes two regions of Ukraine as independent republics and send its army to support the ‘rebels’ there, can it be called ‘war’, ‘invasion’ or something else? Russia has not declared a war yet. 

There’s no formal commencement of action, so there can’t be formal end of it either. Time was when wars were wars and there were rules of the game. Since the 1990s, things have become complicated. In Ukraine, Putin is taking that complication to a new level. 

It began in 2014 when men without any military insignia entered Crimea and captured it – without any formal war. Then some men – variously described as armed thugs, Russian forces or Russia-backed rebels – emerged in the region of Donbas, claiming to fight for independence. The recent weeks have witnessed a build-up of a traditional war, with quite untraditional escalations: Cyber attacks and false-flag operations (supposed attacks on Russia which can be blamed on Ukraine, justifying retaliatory action). The formal warfare is yet to happen, but a lot more has already taken place.
 
Experts studying such novel kinds of conflicts around the world have come up with new names and taxonomies for them. ‘Hybrid war’ was the term Frank Hoffman, a former US Marine and a defence scholar, coined in 2007, based on a researcher’s thesis. He was describing insurgent groups and weak states like Iran: https://www.potomacinstitute.org/images/stories/publications/potomac_hybridwar_0108.pdf

Another term is ‘nonlinear warfare’, coined by Russian strategists, after a short story by Vladislav Surkov (who happens to be among Putin’s closest advisers). Russia’s chief of armed forces, General Valery Gerasimov, also spoke of unconventional methods. Though he was referring to the West’s alleged hand behind Arab Spring and similar “color revolutions”, it has come to be known as ‘Gerasimov doctrine’: https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/09/05/gerasimov-doctrine-russia-foreign-policy-215538/

Elisabeth Braw of the American Enterprise Institute calls this new variety of conflict 
“gray-zone aggression”: https://www.aei.org/the-defenders-dilemma/ 

In a sense, labels are the only thing new about it, otherwise subterfuge is as old as warfare itself. India has always claimed Pakistan is fighting a ‘proxy war’ with it by supporting terrorists.
