"OLD BEAUTY"
Waves of the sea like wrinkles painted on her face. And her eyes as deep as the ocean,
I stare into her eyes & float into those bottomless pools.
Words flow from her mouth like poetry as we lay intertwined. I wish to spend a lifetime to view the beauty that remained unspoken.
Her smile grew soothing with her decreasing pace. Her hairs flew in air like those oceans which have whirlpools,
Revealing her kind face.
Still she stands there, Calm but determined. And I? I've witnessed all her journey,
Actually she was my GRANNY!!!
