The year 2022 also welcomes a fresh beginning for WTI with the "anti-snare walk" at the Valmiki Tiger Reserve, Bihar. Valmiki Tiger Reserve proudly boasts of being the only tiger reserve in the state and is home to a recorded population of 33 tigers, as per NTCA! 
WTI, along with the Sashastra Seema Bal, stationed to protect the Indo-Nepal border, has conducted a total of 2 anti-snare walks along the sensitive fringe areas of the park. The WTI team and SSB officers recovered 13 huge nets, targeted at capturing birds and other smaller mammals for poaching. Additionally, the team also found bows and arrows, spears as well as 4 snares and 1 electric wire, all camouflaged in the thickets of the fence, aimed at capturing wild animals.
Anti-snare walks play an instrumental role in preventing, and eliminating, the chances of grave injuries and fatalities to wild animals, whether it is a wild boar or a tiger, leopard or an elephant!
WTI expresses heartfelt gratitude to SSB for their enthusiastic participation in the anti-snare walks and their indomitable spirit for guarding the borders, ensuring all illegal activities threatening national security are kept at bay.
