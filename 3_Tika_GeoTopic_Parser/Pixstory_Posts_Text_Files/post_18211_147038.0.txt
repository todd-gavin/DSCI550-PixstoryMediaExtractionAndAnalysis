The comedians were accused of making minors perform inappropriate sexual acts on camera.
The Jane Doe lawsuit accusing comedians Tiffany Haddish and Aries Spears of forcing a woman and her brother to separately perform inappropriate, sexually suggestive acts on camera when they were minors has been dismissed, according to a filing provided by the defendants' lawyer.
 In a statement obtained by TMZ, which first reported the news, the plaintiff said, "My family and I have known Tiffany Haddish for many years — and we now know that she would never harm me or my brother or help anyone else do anything that could harm us. We wish Tiffany the best and are glad that we can all put this behind us."EW has reached out to the plaintiff, Haddish, and Spears for comment.In a complaint filed last month, the 22-year-old plaintiff, identified as Jane Doe, accused Haddish (Girls Trip) and Spears (Mad TV) of intentional infliction of emotional distress, gross negligence, sexual battery, sexual harassment, and sexual abuse of a minor, claiming that the comedians made her and her brother film sexually themed comedy sketches when they were underage.  The incidents were alleged to have occurred when Jane was 14 and her brother, identified as John Doe, was 7.
The comedian's lawyer said the claims were meritless. Spears' attorney said her client would not be "shaken down" by a "bogus" shakedown.
A few days after the suit made headlines, Haddish said she deeply regretted the sketches in a statement posted on social media.  She said she deeply regretted the sketch in a statement on social media. I'm right there with you. Unfortunately, because there is an ongoing legal case, there's very little that I can say right now, she said.
