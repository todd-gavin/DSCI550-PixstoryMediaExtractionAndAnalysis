FIFA banned Honduras player Wisdom Quaye from soccer for 18 months on Tuesday for doping with a steroid at a World Cup qualifying game against the United States.
Quaye tested positive for clostebol after Honduras lost 3-0 to the U.S. in February, FIFA said. The game was played in severe cold in St. Paul, Minnesota.
FIFA said the 24-year-old Quaye admitted the doping rules violation and made an agreement to serve a ban that applies retroactively and will expire on Aug. 1, 2023.
Quaye, a defender with the Real Espa√±a club in Honduras, has made three appearances for the national team, which did not qualify for the World Cup in Qatar.
Honduras placed last without winning a game in the final eight-team qualifying group in the North American region known as CONCACAF.
