Olivia Rodrigo's massive hit single Driver's License broke a lot of records. The song's success can be credited to its lyrics, Olivia's emotional singing, and well... drama. 

In a recent interview, Olivia's ex, Joshua Bassett revealed that he was hospitalized with heart failure from stress after the release of the single.  

"I was sleeping 16 to 20 hours a day," he said after noting that he was feeling worse "every day." "I couldn't even stand up for longer than 30 seconds." 

"I felt my heart literally failing,” he recalled. “I was like, ‘This isn’t just anxiety. This is bad.’ The doctors were like, 'If you hadn't checked in within 12 hours, you would have died in your apartment,'" he said.

His interview has sparked up the drama  surrounding him and his ex, Olivia once again. Bassett's fans have started accusing Olivia for trying to "kill" him. 

However, it seems a bit absurd to blame a teenager for writing a song about her ex boyfriend and then blaming her hit song for being "injurious to health."
