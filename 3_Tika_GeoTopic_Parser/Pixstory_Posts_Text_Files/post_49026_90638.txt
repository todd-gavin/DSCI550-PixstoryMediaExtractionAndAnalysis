There is nothing extra ordinarily activist in being a decent human being Somebody suffering from a chronic disease is going through a struggle everyday something that abled bodied people will never understand while they sit and write down jokes to tell at an international award show Especially when disabled people women mostly face the worst of consequences for just existing To make jokes about it because a comedian s job is not to be an activist is not only overlooking the trauma faced by disabled people but also perpetuate the already existing discrimination against them What Will Smith did being right or wrong is debatable however the main post is not about Will Smith It is about hundreds and thousands of women facing discrimination of many sorts on daily basis because they aren t able bodied according to the conventional standards It is derailing the topic by making it about anything else There s an open debate out there discussing the morality of Smith s actions The LEAST that we as able bodied people can do is not make the struggles of disabled people and the stigma around disability worse Like literally that s just the bare minimum However the standards these days for the privileged sect is so low that being decent has started looking like taking up the burden of activism There are hundreds of topics under the sky that we can joke about and people s vulnerability is not one of them Not wanting to uphold regressive behavior is not being too progressed You talk about making society a better place for disabled people emotionally yet defend something which cannot be put in a different category than middle school bullying Not just Jada but many women including children and teens suffering from alopecia would have been affected by it When you have a public platform you are supposed to use it responsibly That joke was tasteless and was rooted in misogyny ableism and texturism no matter how you d like to paint it
