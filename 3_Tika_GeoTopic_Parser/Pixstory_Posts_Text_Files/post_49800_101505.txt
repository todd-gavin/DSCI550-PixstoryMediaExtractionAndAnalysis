The house recently passed a bill that would create domestic terrorism units in the FBI Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department The bill is Democrats revived push against domestic terrorism and racist extremism in the wake of the racist attack on a grocery store in a Black neighbourhood in Buffalo We must act said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler New York Democrat The Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act which sits before us today is the least we can do to signal our opposition to White nationalism and this rising menace of organized intolerance As a society we centre around the conversation on the issue but do we act to prevent this tragedy Why can we make a stronghold on the mental health services and then insight social media offer to the people who pose a threat Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have assigned fact checkers to take down posts with fake news but they have fallen short of observing users with posts and videos that exhibit signs of untreated mental illnesses that pose a danger to others as well themselves Isn t it obvious that multi million dollar social media platforms can track down individuals who post threats Why aren t they doing so At least why isn t the law making it mandatory or seeking the help of this platform to find the threat With the current state of technology we can use algorithms for our benefit The question of privacy comes here we know nothing is private online could anyone imagine the consequences if a school was aware of a student s threats and ignored them Won t the school would be held accountable Why does a social media platform not take the responsibility then We saw the hatred that the year old had in buffalo the aggression in killing people and the post he had online These all incidents can be prevented
