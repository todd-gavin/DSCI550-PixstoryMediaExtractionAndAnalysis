Is this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity,Flames and ether making a rush for my veins,Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly different from myself,On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,Behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,Depriving me of my best as for a purpose,Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture-fields,Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,They bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me,No consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger,Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while,Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.The sentries desert every other part of me,They have left me helpless to a red marauder,They all come to the headland to witness and assist against me.Walt Whitman
