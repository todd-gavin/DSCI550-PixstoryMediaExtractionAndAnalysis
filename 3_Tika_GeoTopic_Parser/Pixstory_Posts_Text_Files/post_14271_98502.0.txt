Genoa have won two of the last six Serie A matches, both at the Luigi Ferraris stadium - as many as from the previous 31 league games.

After a series of eight matches without loss (one win and seven draws), Genoa have lost four of their last five league games, including the most recent in the Derby della Lanterna.

Genoa have failed to net more than one goal in the last 13 home games of this tournament (eight without scoring). The last match in which the Rossoblu scored at least twice dates back to 17 October 2021, 2-2 with Sassuolo (2-2). Over the same period however, the Ligurian side has collected seven clean sheets - as many as in the previous 46 outings at the Ferraris.

Genoa have the worst attack in the league with 25 goals, an average of 0.7 per game - only in two seasons in its history in Serie A has the Grifone managed a lower average (0.5 in 1973/74 and 0.6 in 1959 / 60 - both seasons resulted in relegation).

Genoa is the team that has conceded the most headed goals (14) in Serie A 2021/22. On the other hand, no team has concede less headers than Juventus (three, all from corners).
