Every mother s day I am surrounded by this perplexing thought what should I do to make her day special I can make breakfast write a poem for her take her out for dinner or maybe buy something for her this will make her happy But as much as I think of it I realise nothing more or less can be enough for the love and warmth she gives me every single day And just a few things done for a day would not suffice to reciprocate it in an equal amount I eventually decided to pen down my thoughts and everything I wanted to tell her to let her know how grateful I was for her presence in my life She will read it and love it but at that moment I realised how rare it is Barely do I tell her that I am grateful She would have wanted to hear it more not a penned down appreciation but an acknowledgement of everything she does Thanking her for remembering what I would like to eat in the morning thanking her for never forgetting to ask me if I haven t reached home on time thanking her for checking on me whenever she felt something was wrong and most importantly thanking her for being that epitome of ideal and unconditional love I think motherhood is ineffable and every day should be celebrated to show the reverence and love we have for our mothers
