Bold and sincere, the Missoni Adv campaign dedicated to Fall Winter presents itself as the story of several lives and several eras in constant conversation with each other A dialogue that is possible thanks to the use of the most universal and evocative of languages: color Each shade thus has a story as given that it finds its full evolution in the individual textile processes and then becomes part of a larger group within each garment All this is rendered visually by the suggestive monolith around which the fashion show that presented the collection developed the imposing monument of a utopian square in the where past and future meet and mutually contaminate a neon uroboric scenario which is also the background for the images of the advertising campaign
