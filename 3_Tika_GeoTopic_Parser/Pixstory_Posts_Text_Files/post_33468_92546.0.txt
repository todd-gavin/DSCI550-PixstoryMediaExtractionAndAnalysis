Even as Jaimanglagarh retains its religious importance, the flow of tourists is confined mostly to those from the local region. Since the vast Kabar lake in itself with its diverse avian population and unique wetland vegetation along with its precious heritage surely present a remarkable excursion for visitors, it has enormous potential to attract tourists from far and wide, if properly preserved and promoted. The poaching of birds by some active gangs also needs to be fully controlled by the local forest and police authorities.

  At present, the nearest Airport is at Patna, from where the site can be reached after a drive of about 3 hours. Begusarai is also well connected with railways and roadways with the rest of the country and local conveyances or time bound local buses can also be  taken to reach the site. However, what is most lacking at the site is proper infrastructure for accommodation and sightseeing. A guest house of the forest department is available but has only the bare minimum facilities, with only 2 rooms and no permanent kitchen or restaurant, which surely would not serve to attract the modern tourist looking for a cosy stay and for creating lifetime memories. 

The lake requires modern ecotourism boating infrastructure along with some watchtowers for sightseeing. As most important sites lie in a periphery of only four square kilometres, they can collectively be integrated into a day long itinerary which could include refreshments along with a guided tour.
