After he strutted into the room Russell Westbrook showed two of the unmistakable traits that have marked his NBA career Westbrook showed off his fashion sense sporting a bright open buttoned shirt as if he were walking down a fashion runway than sitting down for a postgame news conference Westbrook also displayed his defiance A reporter suggested Westbrook could not have envisioned the Lakers turbulent season one that included Thursday s loss to the LA Clippers and marked the Lakers fourth straight loss Then Westbrook fired back with the same kind of feistiness he often shows to an opponent or a call that annoys him I had no expectations That s why you don t know what I envisioned Westbrook said I come into every situation the same Last four years I ve been on different teams four times My vision of thinking everything would be peaches and cream that s not realistic That s not life For me I come in every situation starting from ground zero and trying to figure it out the right way Westbrook s explanation highlighted two things The first part Westbrook offered a misleading explanation that borders on revisionist history After the Lakers acquired Westbrook from the Washington Wizards last offseason Westbrook surely had some uncertainty on how the season would play out or how exactly he would co exist with LeBron James and Anthony Davis But make no mistake Westbrook came to the Lakers with high expectations Consider his actual words in his introductory press conference AD and LeBron are friends of mine first Westbrook said then Me being a teammate it s my job to come in and uplift them They ll do the same to me and vice versa As the season prolongs there will be ups there will be downs That s normal That s okay But we ll figure it out on how to play the best way that we want to play to win a championship The second Westbrook has not lived up to his own expectations He has failed to uplift others often playing his own style one that has yielded more headaches than highlight reels And he has certainly not lifted the Lakers to help them remain in championship contention
