DALL-E is aÂ software utilizing artificial intelligence that can produce art from a single-sentence instruction. The program was released on openAI; however, despite the fact that openAI is intended to be publicly available, its makers have not made it so.

Advanced artificial intelligence algorithms can now create realistic artwork in almost any style with just a single line of human input. The artificial intelligence is so sophisticated that it would be difficult to determine if a work of art that was prompted to be created in the manner of a certain artist was indeed a fake.

This technology's opponents oppose it for many reasons. Many artists argue that there should be copyright concerns since the algorithm must be trained with specific photographs, even if not a single pixel of the original images is utilized in the final product. There is, of course, the additional concern of artists losing demand, since it is possible to generate even poster designs and other forms of graphic art with the program.

Here is an example of artwork done by DALL-E. Everything in the painting on the right is original, as if created by an individual.
