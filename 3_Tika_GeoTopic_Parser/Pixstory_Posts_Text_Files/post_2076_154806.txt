Kanye West s behavior has once again made news Not long after he was spotted wearing a white lives matter T shirt alongside Candace Owens a conservative commentator Kanye West was criticized for the following anti Semitic tweet I m a bit sleepy tonight but when I wake up I m going death con On JEWISH PEOPLE The funny thing is I actually can t be Anti Semitic because black people are actually Jew also You guys have toyed with me and tried to black ball anyone whoever opposes your agenda In addition to this on Friday Kanye West posted a text exchange with P Diddy where he said This ain t a game Ima use you as an example to show the Jewish people that told you to call me that no one can threaten or influence me I told you this was war Now gone get you some business While I didn t disagree with Kanye West s choice of clothing especially given that he has two daughters who are half white this seems excessive Anti semitism has been on the rise in the United States and the escalating tensions between Israel and Palestine have further aggravated the problem by fueling anti Israel sentiment Celebrities especially international celebrities like Kanye West should be mindful of the ideals they instill in others through their utterances
