Trauma doesn’t discriminate, it can happen to anyone at any time, but it’s especially damaging when it occurs during our childhood. Those who suffer loss, abuse or neglect early-on in life can often suffer from serious psychological and emotional disorders for decades to come, changing who they are and destroying their ability to foster caring and nurturing relationships even decades after the traumatic event. Childhood trauma holds us back and bricks up our potential in truly unimaginable ways. When our hearts are damaged at such critical developmental stages, it makes it easy to put up walls and harder to find the healing that we need.

If you want to resolve your childhood trauma, you first need to understand it. When you’ve started to understand your trauma and how it affects you, you can start implementing change — but not before then. If you still don’t know where to begin your healing, then don’t worry. You’re not alone. Childhood trauma is complex in nature and the healing it requires is even more complex. Understand that this journey takes time and there will be missteps along the way.

Reclaim your power by taking back responsibility for your life and accepting that the perpetrators of your past have no power over you anymore. That lonely, broken child inside is safe now, but she needs to be reminded from time to time.
