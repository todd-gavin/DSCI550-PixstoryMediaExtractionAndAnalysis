Mikel Arteta’s relationship with Oleksandr Zinchenko since his days at Manchester City played a key part in helping Arsenal land the Ukrainian. The 25-year-old has four Premier League titles to his name but did anyone consider him to be an important cog in the Etihad wheel? Yes, he came on and changed the game on the final day of last season when it seemed Manchester City could collapse and hand the title to Liverpool but it was only his 15th appearance of the Premier League campaign. The Ukrainian was a solid albeit unremarkable part of a City side filled with superstars.
However, it was very clear from early on in the window that Arteta wanted him and Zinchenko also wanted the move after being a peripheral figure at Manchester City. The informed opinion on the move was that the 25-year-old would be used more as a midfielder than a left-back at Arsenal this season. But he has started the first three league games of the season at left-back and has consigned Kieran Tierney to the bench. The Ukrainian’s ability to maraud up and down on the left flank has played a big role in Arsenal’s solid start to the season.
Zinchenko has the experience of winning the league and that counts for something. Yes, he was a fringe player and never really cemented his place in the Manchester City side but he has the mentality of being part of a winning machine and in a game of margins, it often means a lot.
He is also Ukraine’s captain and in an Arsenal team who have often been slated for lacking leaders over the last decade, his leadership skills are going to come in handy for Arteta to control the dressing room and keep things rooted.
Yes, Arsenal have signed two players from Manchester City who were not major players for Pep Guardiola but the duo know what it means to be part of a winning juggernaut. Sometimes, you need those mentality monsters in your team.
