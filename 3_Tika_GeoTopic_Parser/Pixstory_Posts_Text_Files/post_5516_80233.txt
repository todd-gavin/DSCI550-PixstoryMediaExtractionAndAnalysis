We remember having conversations even sparring with our late saathi colleague Rizwana Tabassum on the hijab In she moved from her urban village in Banaras to cosmopolitan Delhi with the feminist organisation we were working for She didn t wear a hijab in Banaras but she made a conscious choice to do so in Delhi Many urban feminists gently mocked her chided her for choosing to cover up when she was tasting her first real freedom away from home Rizwana always said this is what I choose respect my choice look past my clothes We think that patriarchal anxious masculinity is part of the problem why women exercising their choice and speaking their mind is perceived as an existential threat The other problem we see is the comfort so many of us feel with the discomfort and distrust we have in the hijab and the burqa that it is most easily and most often targeted Don t keep calm but go on Muskaan Art unknown will update with artist details
