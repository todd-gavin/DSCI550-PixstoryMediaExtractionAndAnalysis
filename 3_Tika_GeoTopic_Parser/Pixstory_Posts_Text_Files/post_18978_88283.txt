Seven years later and after successive defeats, Rugby&#39;s Italy is back to winning a Six Nations match And it does so not on a friendly field but on a pitch that it had never violated until now that of Cardiff Against Wales arrived a last gasp victory at the end of a great game and at the end of a perfect first half good defense in lineout good breakdown Azzurri thrust into attack when they have the chance with an eloquent kick signed by Garbisi Padovani Many mistakes by Wales that for in the second half they return to the match Italy however does not give up and almost immediately puts their head back on with yet another kick from Garbisi from the end The finish seems to be Welsh-branded two wrong blue tackles allow Adams to find the third try and Mac still time and Capuozzo makes a large number on the out on the right he makes a vacuum and serves Padovani the ball for the winning goal After seven years Italy can rejoice again
