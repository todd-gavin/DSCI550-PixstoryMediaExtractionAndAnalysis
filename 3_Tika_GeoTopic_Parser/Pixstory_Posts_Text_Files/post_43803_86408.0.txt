This week, four teams, including the Hammers and Eintracht Frankfurt, will play in the city.

On Wednesday night, rival fans battled in the streets of Seville, with video footage showing many supporters fighting outside a bar. The event is said to have occurred in the city's streets surrounding Paseo Colon, a major location in Seville that has an Irish bar and is adjacent to the city's main bus terminal as well as the famous bull ring.

Eintracht Frankfurt faced Real Betis on Wednesday, while West Ham will face Sevilla on Thursday in Europa League action.

It was suggested that the brawls took place between West Ham and Eintracht fans, who had just defeated Betis 2-1 on Wednesday.

The clubs are not playing each other, but Frankfurt was in the area on Wednesday night, playing Real Betis in a Europa League last 16 clash.

Given that the Spanish rivals are only a few miles away from Sevilla, UEFA had shifted the Frankfurt game to a day earlier to avoid the two matches meeting.

Glass was shattered and some fans engaged in hand-to-hand violence in the unsavoury scenes from both supporters.

MARCA, a Spanish journal, also reported on the situation in southern Spain:

“There were signs of possible altercations because the radical fans of the Frankfurt team have been causing incidents in the Andalusian capital all day,” the report read.

“The police have advised and forced the closure of bars in the area to prevent it from going any further.”

One clip showed what appeared to be Frankfurt ultras running at the West Ham fans armed with sticks, while missiles were then thrown between the groups.

West Ham won their Europa League group stage earlier this season, advancing to the competition's Round of 16 automatically.
