Look its not like we get tired of the book we've currently started, it's more like our mind wants more, and it wants more first, not as a second serving. Like I need all the books I like and want to read to be with me, already a few chapters in, and going simultaneously, just at different paces😂 
Some may have been left a bit too behind 😂
But, I have to find another few first🤷‍♀️😂
