At the end of a match against Fiorentina, the Italian was able to enjoy three points, but only after losing his cool at one point. 

During a Serie A match against Fiorentina, Salernitana manager Davide Nicola was less than thrilled with some of his team's defence, hurling his shoe in rage at one point.

He was able to celebrate a hard-fought 2-1 victory at La Viola, but he lost his cool on the sidelines as the hosts struggled to a tight home triumph. 

When Fiorentina threatened to find the target, Nicola decided that the best way to get his message across to the players was to take off his shoes and throw them towards the dugout.

Milan Duric scored the first goal for Salernitana against Fiorentina in less than nine minutes. Riccardo Saponara equalised in the 64th minute, but Federico Bonazzoli scored the game-winning goal 11 minutes later.

Nicola's attitude will have improved after the final whistle, as his side moved to within six points of safety with six games remaining, and he has demonstrated that a lack of passion will not be the cause of his team's relegation to Serie B.

After overcoming Fiorentina with goals from Milan Djuric and Federico Bonazzoli, Salernitana can witness a remarkable escape from relegation.

Back-to-back victories lifted Davide Nicola's team off the bottom of the standings with a game remaining, so excitement was high at Stadio Arechi amid hopes of a miraculous comeback. Ivan Radovanovic has been added to the injury list, although Pasquale Mazzocchi and Milan Djuric have been reinstated following their suspensions. 

With Gaetano Castrovilli and Lucas Torreira sidelined, the Viola were coming off a 2-0 Coppa Italia semi-final defeat to Juventus in midweek.
