Legally the Maoist outfits are banned with even membership or support of the banned outfits being a cognizable offence But the organisation of the Maoists continues to operate at various levels and targets all sections of society including NGO s media and human rights groups to further their cause As a result whenever the Police target the Maoists opposition is felt from several unexpected quarters Several ways have been tried to control the Maoist menace in the tribal forest areas The traditional police solution looked at the problem from a law and order angle In this approach the problem is seen to be against the law and hence needs to be crushed with absolute force It relies in carrying out anti Maoist area domination operations and targeting the members and supporters in targeted raids If we analyse closely as per law it can be seen that the rebels are indeed on the wrong side of law and thus need to be tackled firmly The armed members should be engaged in encounters and killed in organised raids This will also increase the professionalism of the police But there is a heavy risk of suffering casualties on the police side due to the unequal nature of the combat A second approach has been to look at the problem from a economic perspective and an economic disparity reducing strategy is proposed This is done in the way of more developmental grants for the Maoist affected areas But the grants allotted are often siphoned off by the intermediaries which plagues the actual flow to the affected areas Also when more developmental projects are launched then the contractors are targeted and even killed by Maoists to create terror and thereafter extract levy for the maoist organisational cause This leads to further financial strengthening of the maoist organisation and emerges as a stronger threat To be continued
