 Qatar the new destination of World football, the little peninsular nation in the Persian Gulf has used its economic might to bring about a radical transformation in its outlook and identity. 
From being an immensely rich nation with its huge petroleum resource wealth, Qatar has used its affluence in bringing up its sports infrastructure to a magnitude that very few countries can match. This is certainly going to alter the way it is often perceived by the rest of the world.
The FIFA World Cup, which is barely a couple of months away, will bear testimony to this notable metamorphosis as more than a million fans from across the globe converge to experience “La Eeb,” the cherubic mascot that means a super-skilled player in Arabic.
The dress rehearsal of the biggest event of world football happened recently in the form of the Lusail Super Cup which provided a prelude to what the global fans are going to experience between November 20 and December 18, when the FIFA World Cup will be played out. 
The Super Cup was a one-off match between the top teams of Saudi Arabia and Egypt – Al Hilal SFC and Zamalek SC – that in reality put to test many aspects related to the successful organisation of the upcoming matches in the World Cup. 
The Lusail Stadium, which will host the maximum number of matches (10) including the final, was the chosen venue and proved its merit with its most modern and impressive facilities.
