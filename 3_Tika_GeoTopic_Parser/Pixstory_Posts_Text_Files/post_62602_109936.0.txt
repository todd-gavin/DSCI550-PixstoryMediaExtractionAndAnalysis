They want us to protest in a way they stay comfortable. Except, that's not how you bring change. Your oppressors being okay with your activism is the testimony that your activism is weak and is doing nothing for your cause. Make them uncomfortable. They've endangered the lives of millions of people, our protests are not to appease them.
