On matchday 3 of the UEFA Nations League fixtures in 2022-23, Wales will face Belgium. On Saturday, June 11th, this match will take place at Cardiff City Stadium in Cardiff.


Wales may have recently accomplished a dream by qualifying for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, but if we are talking especially about this competition, they have been very disappointing. Rob Page's team has lost both of their first two matches, and they are currently ranked last in their group.


Belgium's experience, on the other hand, has surprisingly been one of stark contrasts. They began their campaign with a humiliating 4-1 loss to the Netherlands, but made up for it with a thrilling 6-1 victory over Poland in their final match.



Wales vs Belgium: Probable Playing XI


Wales : Adam Davies; Neco Williams, Ethan Ampadu, Joe Rodon, Ben Davies, Rhys Norrington-Davies; Jonny Williams, Joe Morrell, Aaron Ramsey; Gareth Bale, Daniel James


Belgium : Simon Mignolet; Leander Dendoncker, Toby Alderwiereld, Dedryck Boyata; Timothy Castagne, Alex Witsel, Hans Vanaken, Yannick Ferreira Carrasco; Leandro Trossard, Dries Mertens, Thorgan Hazard




Wales vs Belgium: Prediction


With Wales likely to go as full-strength as possible, they should have enough quality to push their stronger opponents all of the way. However, this game could go a similar way to the one against the Netherlands, with Belgium potentially edging the contest in the closing stages.


Prediction :Â  Wales 1-2 Belgium
