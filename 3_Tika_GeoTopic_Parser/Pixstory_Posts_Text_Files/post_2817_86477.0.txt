India’s ruling party, the BJP, has won in four states, in the election results announced on Thursday, surprising commentators. Given its stunning performance in Uttar Pradesh, the party can only expect to win the next national elections, due by 2024, with no significant challenge from the opposition in sight.

Among the five states where polls were held in February-March, all eyes were on Uttar Pradesh – India’s most populous state (larger than all countries except the top four), also the one with most political weight.

It is only in Punjab, where it was anyway a minor player and where the farmer agitation was bound to resonate, that the BJP could not make inroads. 

Thursday’s results are arguably the most important indicator to the next general elections. If the ideology of Hindutva has found acceptance with masses overcoming older equations of caste, then Modi is most likely to win a third term in 2024 – and would be on his way to become the longest serving prime minister.
