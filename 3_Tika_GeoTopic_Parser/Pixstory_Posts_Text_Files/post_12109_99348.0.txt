The US Food and Drug Administration announced that the Johnson & Johnson's vaccine have a restriction imposed on its circulation and now it is given to only a certain group of people. The vaccine can only be used on people of 18 or above for whom the other vaccines are not accessible or for those people who would not get their Covid 19 vaccine. 

In the statement it included that the new limitations have come up because there is an increased risk of blood clotting condition thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) which is a rare disease but it has a fatal side effect and this can happen after 2 weeks of taking the J and J vaccine. 

"We recognize that the Janssen [Johnson & Johnson] COVID-19 vaccine still has a role in the current pandemic response in the United States and across the global community," Peter Marks, MD, PhD, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in the statement. "Our action reflects our updated analysis of the risk of TTS following administration of this vaccine and limits the use of the vaccine to certain individuals." 

The vaccine was paused in April 2022 with TTS concerns, and more time was needed to review the data for the health officials. But eventually within days the pause was lifted. 

The new restrictions are due to the "robustness" of the FDA's safety surveillance systems and the agency's "commitment to ensuring that science and data guideâ€¦decisions," Dr. Marks said. "The agency will continue to monitor the safety of the Janssen COVID-19 and all other vaccines, and as has been the case throughout the pandemic, will thoroughly evaluate new safety information."
