Due to his inexperience in this position, he has failed to be beneficial to the team in terms of supplying the box with balls and creating goal scoring opportunities. 


He has amazing passing and ball retention awareness. It won’t be surprising if Ten Hag uses Timber as a defensive midfielder, due to his excellent range of passing. The manager said that in the foreseeable future, he might use him as a central midfielder. 

From the above dashboard we can see that he has made most of his touches in the middle third and attacking third, with him contributing 55.08 per 90 in the middle third and 7.75 per 90 in the attacking third. 

There is a slight jauntiness to his game which is reflected in his tackling, which is quite poor. Timber ranks only 1.50 tackles/90 while conceding 0.82 fouls/90 leading to way below 70 percentile in tackles won. He has made 1.63 interceptions/90. However, he ranks 99 percentile in stopping the passes by standing on its path. The Dutch international excels in blocking the shots from his feet or another part of his body, as he ranks 2.31 blocks/90.


Timber, standing at only 5 ft 9 inches, could lack the height to play as a center-back in the long term. He has only won 1.09 Aerials duel/90. That's why Ajax Manager Erik Ten Hag switched him to right-wing-back this season. 


One thing he excels is in dribbling past players on and off the ball. One thing in which Timber excels is physical contact and can hold his one-on-one defensive duels on the ground. 

Despite his shortcomings with respect to his height, he is not afraid to contest for the ball aerially.

From the figure, we can see where Timber has made most of the defensive actions. It is mostly in the defensive half and the middle third. What makes him successful defensively,  is his positional sense. Timber’s ability to read the game helps him in anticipating the opposition movement and move into spaces so he can pressurize his opponents and block their attacking efforts.
