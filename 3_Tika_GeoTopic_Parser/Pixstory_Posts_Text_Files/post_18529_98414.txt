New details emerge on Walter Mazzarri&#39;s exemption from Cagliari In reality it would not be a matter of exemption but of dismissal for just cause This is what we read about the Unione Sarda Apparently after the defeat against Verona the climate would have warmed up and Mazzarri would have insulted quite a bit both the president and the team defining the dressing room made of worms Hence the just cause for the dismissal which would allow Cagliari to pay the rest of the salary to the coach who had signed a contract up to for millions of euros At this point there could be a dispute legal precisely because there is a lot of money at stake
