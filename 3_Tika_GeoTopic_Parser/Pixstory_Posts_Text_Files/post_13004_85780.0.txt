In a report on the Global Terrorism Index, the Institute for Economics and Peace ranked Afghanistan at the top of the list of countries affected by terrorism for the third time.

According to the report, Afghanistan witnessed 837 terrorist incidents in 2021, as a result of which 1426 people were killed and 2199 others were injured.
The Institute for Economics and Peace says there were 91 hostage-taking cases in Afghanistan last year.

ISIL suicide bombing at Kabul airport during an evacuation operation in Afghanistan in which more than 180 people were killed and at least 200 others were injured, has been declared the deadliest terrorist attack of 2021.
Fighting between the Taliban and ISIL in Afghanistan is likely to escalate this year, the report said.

The Taliban were responsible for most civilian attacks and casualties before they took control of Afghanistan. The Haqqani Network, led by Sirajuddin Haqqani, now the Taliban's interior minister, has been the main cause of suicide attacks.

Taliban reaction

The Taliban have criticized the Institute for Economics and Peace, saying the agency's report on the Global Terrorism Index is incorrect.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the report by the Institute for Economics and Peace was "biased".

Mujahid says Taliban forces fought for the liberation of Afghanistan, now the country is safe and there is no war.
According to him, ISIL has no activity in Afghanistan.

Afghanistan's neighbors estimate that more than 5,000 ISIL fighters are active in the northern provinces alone.
