We have several grounds and basketball courts because our university encourages people to actively participate in sports and activities.

We have several clubs we can choose to be part of for extra curriculars but we also have sports teams with trainers for those who are interested in playing games and participating in various competitions.  The grounds are huge and can simultaneously be used for Football, cricket and/or volley ball. Other than that we have two separate courts for basketball.

Whenever we have free periods or on our breaks, we tend to sit in the audience and spectate an ongoing game. It's always a marvelous sight when strangers come together to support teams and players they don't know of when there's a game going on. It truly reflects our campus culture of camaraderie and sportsmanship.
