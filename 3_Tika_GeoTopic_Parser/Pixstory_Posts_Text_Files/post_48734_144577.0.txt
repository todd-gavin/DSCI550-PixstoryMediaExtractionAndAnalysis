"It's unfair to have your entire existence focused on your gender." is rich coming from someone who keeps countering my posts about feminism every other day to teach me why traditional gender roles are important or why I should let men be men or oh the "stop feminizing boys."
With all due respect, sir, you should be the last person telling people to not worry about 'gender identification' when your entire account is dedicated to being an emblem of "traditional masculinity." So maybe read your own post a couple of times and practice what you preach?
