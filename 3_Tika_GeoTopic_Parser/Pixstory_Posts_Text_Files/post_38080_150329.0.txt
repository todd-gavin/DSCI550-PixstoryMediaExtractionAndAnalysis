Portugal go into the FIFA World Cup 2022 as one of the top ten teams in the world. However their talisman, Cristiano Ronaldo is currently out of form. With less than 60 days left for the elite event, this is a big concern for the former European champions. 
Cristiano Ronaldo had a difficult summer transfer window where the Portuguese was adamant to leave Manchester United. No Champions League club however showed their interest to sign CR7, hence he was seemingly forced to remain at Manchester. 
To make things worse for CR7, United manager Erik Ten Hag has removed the striker from his starting XI, replacing him with Rashford and Anthony in recent Premier League games. Owing to this, Ronaldo has started just 1 Premier League game for his team this season. 
Ronaldo's only goal this campaign has come against Sheriff in the Europa League in the form of a penalty. CR7 started both the Nations League games for Portugal but the striker failed to score a goal in these games. To make things worse, his nation's 1-0 loss to Spain on Tuesday saw them being knocked out of the competition. 
With the FIFA World Cup approaching, CR7's form is a big concern for the West European nation. Ronaldo has a possible 13 games with Manchester United to rediscover his form before the marquee event in Qatar. Only time will tell if the 37-year-old would be able to rediscover his old self!
