Two men were arrested recently in Washington for impersonating as US federal security officials and cultivating entry to the Secret Service, which protects Joe Biden, claimed ties to Pakistani intelligence, a federal prosecutor told a judge.

Justice department assistant attorney Joshua Rothstein pleaded a judge not to release Arian Taherzadeh, 40, and Haider Ali, 35, the men arrested for posing as Department of Homeland Security investigators.

The men were also accused of providing lucrative favors to members of the Secret Service, including one agent on the security detail of the first lady, Jill Biden.

Here Ali is said to have ties with Pakistani Intelligence.The Department of Justice (DoJ) is dealing with the case as a criminal matter and not a national security issue. But the Secret Service suspended four agents over their involvement with the suspects.

They both made this easy as they lived in an apartment where federal officers lived and made them believe they too were special homeland security investigators, giving evidence for their claims.

Taherzadeh extended a $2,000 assault rifle to the Secret Service agent who worked on Jill Biden’s team, and did favors for the agent’s wife, including lending her his car. This is a serious issue of national security and I don't know why this is not taken seriously by the state. Is it so easy to infiltrate the federal agents in US? Is there a threat to Joe Biden and his wife Jill Biden?
