Constitutional Adviser to Bikaner continues...

Another matter that was creating a good deal of stir in the administration of Bikaner and in which the States Ministry felt interested 
was the smuggling of cloth across the borders of Bikaner to Pakistan. 

A huge file had grown up on this subject which was being dealt with by the Officer Commanding the State 

Force, the Director General of Civil Supplies, the Director General of Custom and Excise and the Inspector General of Police. I was asked to look into it. I felt that it was not possible to stop border smuggling. 

Due to the nature of the terrain at the border, the expense of building customs check posts in this tract would be enormous. 

There was considerable corruption in the lower cadre of the Bikaner Civil services. The matter came for discussion in one of the cabinet meetings. The ministers were asked -how best to stop corruption. 

They asserted that if given a free hand, they could stop corruption at once by dismissing on the spot persons whom they found to be corrupt. When I was asked to express my views, I said that it was impossible for popular ministers to stop corruption for the simple reason that they themselves had indulged in corrupt practices during elections. Such persons could hardly uproot corruption. Moreover, if any of their supporters were charged with corruption the ministers would be the first persons to defend them.
