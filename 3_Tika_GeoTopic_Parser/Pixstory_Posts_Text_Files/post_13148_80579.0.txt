The new shirts use cultural, natural and ancient symbols of Afghanistan.
In this plan, from the rare leopard of Afghanistan to the snowy mountains of Spin Ghar can be seen.
The cricket board added that the leopard dots on the national team players' uniforms represent Afghanistan's rare snow leopard and the red color symbolizes the spirit of the game.

Also, the golden color in the players' training uniforms refers to leather, which is used in Afghanistan, in vests and old clothes.
In addition, the costume is embossed with a mountain with white markings that evoke Spin Ghar, a famous and snow-capped mountain.

Also, triangular shapes in these garments are used in Afghan carpets and rugs.
The uniforms are scheduled to be worn in the next 5 matches of the Afghan national cricket team against Bangladesh, which will be held from February 23 to March 5.
