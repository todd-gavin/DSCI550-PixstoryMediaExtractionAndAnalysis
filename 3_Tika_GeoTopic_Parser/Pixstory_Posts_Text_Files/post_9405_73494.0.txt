Burger actually get it's name from Hamburg, Germany, home of a cut of beef called the Hamburg steak that eventually evolved into what we now consider hamburgers. Still, a hamburger does provide some nutritional value. It is a good source of protein, iron, phosphorus, and several other nutrients. If you choose to eat your hamburger on a whole grain bun, it may also provide healthy, filling fiber.
