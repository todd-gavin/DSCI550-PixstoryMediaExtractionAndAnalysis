Manchester United have officially announced the signing of Antony Santos from Ajax The reported fee is an intial million according to transfer experts Fabrizio Romano and David Ornstein The player has been linked with United throughout the transfer window and rumours heated up in the last couple of weeks as Antony attempted to force the move In an exclusive interview with Fabrizio Romano the year old revealed he informed Ajax of his desire to leave this summer back in February and urged the club to listen to reasonable offers Ajax were hesitant to let the winger go so late in the window as it would prove to be difficult in finding his replacement but they eventually negotiated with Manchester United and reached an agreement Erik ten Hag labelled Antony as main priority and here are three reasons why Antony adds depth to United s attacking department After Ronaldo told Manchester United of his wish to leave earlier in the summer it was clear United needed options in attack While Ronaldo is still at the club a cloud of uncertainty remains hanging over the forward s future Anthony Martial seems to be in Ten Hag s plans for the season but the Frenchman s fitness issues will be a problem as he is currently unavailable after suffering an Achilles injury Marcus Rashford has been deployed as a number with Jadon Sancho and Anthony Elanga operating in the wide positions Elanga broke into the first team last season and impressed however he is not ready to start for the Red Devils week in and week out yet Antony will most likely play on the left of United s front three but he can also play on the right which gives Ten Hag options When Martial eventually returns from injury this will give the Dutchman the luxury of rotating his forward which is extremely important this season due to fixtures being congested Ten Hag also spoke about the high intensity he wants the team to play at means he needs options to give players a rest The signing of Antony means he is now able to do this with his forwards
