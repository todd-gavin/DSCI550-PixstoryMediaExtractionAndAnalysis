It was a very difficult year for Maverick Vinales The Spanish rider had started the MotoGP season very well with the success in Qatar but subsequently his relationship with Yamaha worsened until the sensational summer divorce At the end of September Vinales also had to face the death of cousin Dean Berta who died when he was only years old during a Supersport race on the Jerez de la Frontera circuit In an interview with GP Spirit the Spaniard said Dean&#39;s death was a hard blow for me I couldn&#39;t understand life I thought about it for a long time also because he was like a younger brother I sincerely reflected on retirement Vinales skipped the GP of the Americas scheduled shortly after the tragedy before being able to mourn and resume his career with the new adventure that had just begun with Aprilia I asked myself together with my wife Raquel what was the reason for continuing my career After all I have a family and I&#39;m financially well In the end I answered myself that since I was a child I dreamed of becoming world champion And I want to succeed
