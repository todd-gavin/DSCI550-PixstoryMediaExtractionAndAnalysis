On Sunday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken promised America's assistance for Moldova, a small, Western-leaning former Soviet republic that is coping with an influx of migrants from Ukraine and keeping a wary eye on Russia's escalating conflict with its neighbour. 

U.S News reported that Blinken spoke with senior Moldovan authorities, who are requesting international aid in dealing with the more than 120,000 Ukrainian refugees that the country is now housing, as well as security assurances against Russian aggression. 

Since the battle began 11 days ago, more than 230,000 individuals have fled to or passed through Moldova. Moldova's welcome of refugees, according to Blinken, is an example to the rest of the globe.

“We admire the generosity of hospitality, the willingness to be such good friends to people who are in distress, and, indeed, I want to do everything we can to help you deal with the burden that this has imposed,” he said.

Russia has troops stationed in the disputed province of Transnistria in Moldova, a country of 2.6 million people, and they are being closely monitored as Russian President Vladimir Putin pushes ahead with his invasion of Ukraine. 

"This is a really vulnerable subject, and we are keeping a close eye on it," Moldovan President Maia Sandu stated. She stated that there had been no sign that the roughly 1,500 Russian forces stationed in Transnistria had changed their posture, but that it was a cause for concern given the situation in Ukraine.
