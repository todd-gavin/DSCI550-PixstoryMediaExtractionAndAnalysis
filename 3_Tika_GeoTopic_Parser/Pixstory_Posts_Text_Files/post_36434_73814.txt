Bollywood and Hollywood are two of the most well known cinematic giants in the world with movies music dancing drama and most importantly storylines that have captured the hearts of billions of people These two industries are at the pinnacle of their respective film businesses and they are fierce rivals As a result it s difficult to compare them but you can t deny that Hollywood vs Bollywood is the most hotly debated topic I have used Hollywood here in place of international cinema for the simple reason that it is the biggest source of comparison when it comes to Indian cinema however there are other movies in the international arena that have given staunch competition to the Indian cinema and an apt example is the South Korean Film Parasite An honest answer to the above question would be yes that the quality is definitely dwindling Simply put producers are not devoting enough time and resources to scripting and screenwriting They want to make glossy films with hot bold actors and actresses and pay them well but are unwilling to loosen their purse strings for writers It is also a chicken and egg conundrum here people watch low quality movies and hence the impetus to such movies India has never even come close to winning the best foreign film award let alone the best picture of the year honour And it isn t because of a lack of attempting Since the award s inception in it has submitted more than entries Only a few cinematic giants such as France and Italy have submitted more films and they have won the Golden Globe numerous times The best foreign film prize went to films from different nations including Iran Chile and the Ivory Coast India s defenders give a slew of justifications The committee that determines Indian entrees made poor choices Content that appeals to an Indian audience does not appeal to a global audience But truly is not time enough that we acknowledge that maybe the quality itself is not good enough instead of running away with a plethora of excuses Thank you
