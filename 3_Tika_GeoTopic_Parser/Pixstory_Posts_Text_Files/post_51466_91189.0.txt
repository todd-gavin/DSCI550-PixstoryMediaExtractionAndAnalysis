There is no dearth of sports talent in our country. What we lack is the facility to train, based on the latest training techniques. So in 2018, I started a talent club called  Kalinga daredevils, where we can bring together all the sporting talents under one roof and provide them the necessary training.

Today we have 150 members in total, from all over the country. There are also some members from the UK, Ukraine and Philippines. The club is not restricted to any particular sporting activity. So we have a mix of sportspersons, mountaineers, martial artists, dancers and so on. 

We regularly conduct talent hunt programmes in Odisha slums to attract talent who do not have financial resources to pursue their passion. We have many members who have been international coaches and referees. Their expertise has been of great benefit to aspirants. In addition to this we also provide coaching in mountaineering and skiing.

My next goal is to start a sports academy in my home district Kalahandi. We have identified a suitable land and are currently in the documentation phase. The district collector is helping us with this project. Our dream is to produce Olympic players from Kalahandi sports academy by bringing in some of the best coaches to train players.
