Google has agreed to pay $118 million to settle a class-action gender discrimination lawsuit that included over 15,500 women.
In a press release, it has also announced providing an independent third-party labour economist to analyse the company's pay equity and hiring practices to ensure equality and fairness.
A judge still needs to sign the agreement, with a hearing set for June 21.

In 2017 three women filed a complaint accusing Google of underpaying its women employees and violating California's Equal Pay Act.
"The amended Equal Pay Act prohibits an employer from paying any of its employees wage rates that are less than what it pays employees of the opposite sex, or of another race, or of another ethnicity for substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort, and responsibility, and performed under similar working conditions." according to the California Government's Department of Industrial Relations website.


"As a woman who's spent her entire career in the tech industry, I'm optimistic that the actions Google has agreed to take as part of this settlement will ensure more equity for women. Google, since its founding, has led the tech industry. They also have an opportunity to lead the charge to ensure inclusion and equity for women in tech." Holly Pease, a plaintiff in the case, said in a statement. 

Google is not the only tech giant questioned for equal pay; instead, Microsoft and Oracle have also been challenged.
