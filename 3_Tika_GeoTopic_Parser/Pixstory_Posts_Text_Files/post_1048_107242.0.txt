The body of Argentine-born guerrilla leader Ernesto “Che” Guevara is displayed in the village of Vallegrande, Bolivia, on Oct. 10, 1967. 

Guevara was executed a day after being captured near the town of La Higuera. Marc Hutten of AFP had taken this pic. 

He was a fighter who never gave up even when faced with a certain death. 


"Do not shoot! I am Che Guevara and worth more to you alive than dead,” he said as U.S.-trained Bolivian forces closed in. The Argentine-born doctor and Marxist rebel leader who helped Fidel Castro seize power in Cuba was finally captured after 2 1/2 years of living in secrecy.
A Washington Post article in 2017 perhaps aptly summed up his last moments. 

 "Guevara was secretly buried in a mass grave, Bolivian soldiers laid out his scrawny body and put it on display for the media in the Bolivian village of Vallegrande. His corpse was placed on a hospital laundry sink as photographers took pictures that were later published internationally. The Bolivian commander also ordered both of Guevara’s hands cut off so authorities could run his fingerprints and give Castro undeniable proof that his ally was dead."
