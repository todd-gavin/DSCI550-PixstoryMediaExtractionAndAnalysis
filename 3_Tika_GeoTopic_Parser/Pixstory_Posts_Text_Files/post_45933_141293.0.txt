Apparently, Prince Charles (now King Charles III) had warned his younger son Harry not to take his wife Meghan Markle to see Queen Elizabeth before she passed away. On Thursday, September 8, 2022, Harry was the last person to arrive at Balmoral Castle as the queen's closest family members rushed to be with her in her final hours. Harry was also the first to leave on Friday, indicating that he is no longer a close member of the family. 

“Charles told Harry that it wasn’t right or appropriate for Meghan to be in Balmoral at such a deeply sad time,” a source told The Sun, SKY News reported. “It was pointed out to him that Kate was not going and that the numbers really should be limited to the very closest family. Charles made it very, very clear Meghan would not be welcome.”

It was a complete coincidence, according to the Reuters article, that Harry was in Britain when Elizabeth passed away. According to reports, he had no intentions to meet his family while on his visit from the United States before she passed away.
