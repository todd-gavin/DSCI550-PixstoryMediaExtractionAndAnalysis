ISLAND HOPING - Juventus have accumulated 43 wins from their 81 Serie A meetings with Cagliari. Of these victories, 18 have been secured in Sardinia - no team has won as often at the home of the Islanders.

HOLDING FIRM - Juventus have kept eight clean sheets in the 11 most recent meetings with the Rossoblu in Serie A. Also, the Bianconeri have not conceded in three of their last five league games in Cagliari, as many as from the previous 12 visits.

HANG TEN - Furthermore, the Bianconeri have won 10 of those matches from the 2016/17 season onwards. In five of these victories, Juve have scored at least three goals, including Cristiano Ronaldo’s hat-trick last season.

TRAVEL HAPPY - From the beginning of November to today, Juventus are one of two teams in Serie A, along with Inter, to remain unbeaten away from home. Of these nine games, the Bianconeri have won six and drawn three, with 18 goals scored.

TO THE MAX - Massimiliano Allegri has won 14 and drawn two of the 16 Serie A matches he has faced against Cagliari as coach, collecting all-three points in each of the last seven fixtures. Only against Bologna (15) and Chievo (16) has he achieved more wins in the top flight.
