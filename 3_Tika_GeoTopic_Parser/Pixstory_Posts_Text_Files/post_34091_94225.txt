Salernitana triumphs at Marassi and reopens the race for salvation In the post match, Campania coach Davide Nicola commented on the match If we hadn&#39;t managed to win today, how would we have evaluated this It is the battle I have been carrying on for so long to convince an environment that we are the ones build a path to get to safety Conquer the three points against a team that forced us to have a low center of gravity in the second half We never gave up on restarting but we knew very well that the stakes were very high for us and for them Having said that, I think it is right for us to check what will happen in the next races It won&#39;t be easy but I tell the guys to dedicate themselves to what they are doing I was called to reach these goals maybe I could have the chance to fight for another goal it would be interesting It won&#39;t be easy we are as realistic as dreamers and the most beautiful part of this adventure is the extreme difficulty of having to do something truly extraordinary, but I see that the kids have acquired what I like, that is, building a path that leads them to feel capable of what they are doing
