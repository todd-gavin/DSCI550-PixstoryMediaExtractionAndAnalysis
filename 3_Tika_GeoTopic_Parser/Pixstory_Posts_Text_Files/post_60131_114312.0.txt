A body has been discovered in the sea off the coast of Japan belonging to Kazuki Takahashi, whose well-known manga comic series Yu-Gi-Oh! created a global franchise that included TV shows, movies, and a hugely popular card game.

Following what appeared to be a snorkelling excursion, the 60-year-old passed away close to the southern Okinawa Island.

He was discovered off the coast using an underwater mask, a snorkel, and fins.

A spiky-haired teen named Yugi, whose name translates to "King of Games," receives an ancient puzzle that causes his inner Egyptian pharaoh to come to life. This is the story of Yu-Gi-Oh! Finally, he uses games to resolve disputes.

Between 1996 and 2004, it appeared in the Japanese comic book magazine Shonen Jump. A trading card game adaptation was made of it in 1999.


With sales of more than 22 billion cards a decade later, the game, according to its creator Konami, set the Guinness World Record for the best-selling trading card game ever. Video games, books, toys, and miniatures were also added to the franchise's range.
