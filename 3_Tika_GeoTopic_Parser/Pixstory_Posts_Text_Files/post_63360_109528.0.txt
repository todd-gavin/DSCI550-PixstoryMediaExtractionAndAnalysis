Have you ever fallen asleep before 10pm, woken up around 6am & felt well-rested? Have you ever fallen asleep around midnight & slept in until 10am or later but didn't feel rested? Have you ever woken up puffy or your symptoms felt worse in the AM? The explanation for this is the sacred sleep window.

* Between 10pm-2am your body does most of its healing.
If you're able to sleep during this period, your body will heal at an accelerated rate. Even if you only catch 10 minutes, those 10 minutes are potent. If you work night shifts or have difficulty lying down in this window, you can
nap or lie down with your eyes closed between 10am-2pm.

This four hour daytime window is the equivalent of the 10pm-2am for healing.

* There's a common belief that once you miss an hour of sleep, that sleep is gone & you can't make it up or get it back. The truth is we have a divine sleep account that is owed to us from the minute we are born. Every time you
miss a minute, hour, or day of sleep, that time is automatically put into your sleep account to save for a later date.

Upon waking, be sure to drink 16-32 oz of lemon water to flush out the liver & lymphatic system. 1/2 lemon (squeezed) per 16 oz of filtered water. This will also help with any puffiness or swelling.
