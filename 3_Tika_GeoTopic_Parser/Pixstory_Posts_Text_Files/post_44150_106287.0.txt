English club Everton have decided to extend Asmir Begovic’s stay at Merseyside, triggering the
optional extension they have in his contract. Manager Frank Lampard has decided to trigger it to
keep him around the club at Goodison Park for another season.

Begovic, who is the second keeper for Everton, featured only six times for them last season -
with two appearances in the Premier League and 4 of them in other domestic competitions.

The
veteran has kept two clean sheets and has made himself readily available whenever needed by
remaining injury free throughout the season. With Jordan Pickford being in the form of his life
this season, Begovic hardly got an opportunity to feature in the team. The extended deal will
take him to the summer of 2023 and continue in his role as a backup to Pickford.

Manager Frank Lampard values the experience Begovic brings with him, which was a key part
in wanting to keep the goalkeeper at the club.

Now Lampard has two competent keepers at the
club and finances can be utilized to strengthen other positions ahead of a busy summer for
Lampard.

This means Everton goalkeeper Joao Virginia will have to further spend time away or look at
other pastures if he wants to find regular playing time for himself. Begovic has enjoyed playing
under Lampard, citing the manager’s leadership abilities as the crucial bit in the fight against
relegation.
