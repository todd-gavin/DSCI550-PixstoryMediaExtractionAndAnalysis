Cellphones are capable of potential health problems many of which we often ignore because of the lack of specific evidence. The main reasons revolve around Cell phones emitting radiation and cell phone use is widespread. 

Since the phone is directly near the head, brain and central nervous system cancers are a concern. Ionizing radiation—a higher energy form of radiation than what cell phones emit—has been found to cause some brain cancers. Many different kinds of studies have been carried out to try to examine whether cell phone use is dangerous to human health. Still, the proof to date suggests that cell phone use does not cause brain or other kinds of cancer in humans.

Also, the frequency of radiation phones emits falls in the nonionizing range of the spectrum, which is low frequency and low energy. The energy is too low to harm DNA. Now the most consistent health risk associated with cell phone use is careless driving and vehicle accidents. Several other potential health effects have been reported with cell phone use. Neurologic effects are of particular concern in young persons. However, studies of memory, learning, and cognitive function have generally produced conflicting results.

A New study links cell phone radiation to Alzheimer’s disease. The study indicates that too much exposure leads to higher levels of intracellular calcium in the brain, a major feature of Alzheimer’s disease.

Researchers have found Alzheimer’s-specific alterations in the brains of rats exposed to EMF pulses. The negative changes happened in the hippocampus, an area of the brain known to be affected by Alzheimer’s.

Let's be careful around phones to avoid too much mental and physical toxicity.
