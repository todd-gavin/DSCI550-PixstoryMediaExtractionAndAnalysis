Indonesia&#39;s decision to ban the export of palm oil must be an opportunity to accelerate its replacement with healthier products with a lower environmental impact such as butter, olive oil or hazelnut oil historically used in the first spreadable creams. Coldiretti in commenting on the partial ban on exports decided starting in April by the Asian country which is the world&#39;s leading producer of palm oil Last year Italy imported billions of kilos of palm oil of which about half for a quantity of millions of kilos from Indonesia according to the analysis by Coldiretti on Istat data A product that many companies in Italy have already decided to replace since concerns about the impact on health due to the high content of saturated fatty acids are added to those from an environmental point of view because Coldiretti underlines the enormous development of the palm oil market is leading globally to the wild deforestation of vast forests without forgetting the pollution caused by transport thousands of kilometers away from the place of production For the growing opposition of consumers the writing without palm oil has become one of the most widespread on the shelves of shops and supermarkets even if some companies continue to use it explains Coldiretti in sweet and savory foods such as biscuits broths and soups sweets spreads cakes breadsticks brioches and some ready meals A possibility that today denounces the Coldiretti can even be hidden from consumers due to the circular from the Ministry of Economic Development issued at the beginning of April which allows the food industry to use it in place of sunflower oil without explicitly indicating it on the label Italy, which is the world&#39;s second largest producer of olive oil concludes Coldiretti can count on a high quality substitute product at the base of the Mediterranean diet which, moreover, has had contained price increases compared to other vegetable oils
