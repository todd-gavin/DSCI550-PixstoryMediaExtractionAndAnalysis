The US State department approved a massive arms sale to the tune of $2.5 billion to Egypt despite continued concerns over the country’s poor human rights record. When the deal gets finalized, the sale will include 12 Super Hercules C-130 transport aircraft and related equipment worth $2.2 billion. In addition, air-defense radar systems worth an estimated $355 million will be sold to the nation.

The announcement was made on Tuesday soon after Democrats in the US Congress urged the administration to refrain from releasing a much smaller amount of military assistance – around $130mn – that was frozen last year after a series of questions were raised over Egypt’s human rights records. The administration had released $170 mn, but withheld the rest of the package of $300 mn on conditions that Egypt drops charges against human rights organizations and activists. Cairo was apparently given a January 30 deadline to correct its rights record.

Human rights groups estimate the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi currently keeps 60,000 dissidents imprisoned as political prisoners. This includes Alaa Abdel Fattah, one of the leading activists of the 2011 revolution that helped topple President Hosni Mubarak after three decades in power. The then- army chief el-Sisi captured power in 2013 and initiated a crackdown on all dissidents.

Before 2020 US elections Biden had promised to make human rights at the heart of his foreign policy unlike the then President Donald Trump’s alleged policy of offering “blank cheques” to his “favourite dictators” like el-Sisi.

Surprisingly, after Biden came to power he pushed for a strong US-Egypt relationship as it considers the country a major non-NATO ally and a key strategic partner of the US in the Middle East.  

According to rights activists the Egyptian government engages in widespread torture of political opponents or dissidents, including “persecution of American citizens and the families of critics living in the United States”.
