A jury in the United States determined actress Amber Heard filed false allegations of abuse against her ex-husband Johnny Depp and granted him $15 million in damages on Wednesday.

A Virginia jury concluded that an article written by Heard in 2018 about the "sexual assault" she had experienced was defamatory to Depp and written with malicious intent, rendering her guilty of libel.

The jury also decided that Depp's lawyer, Adam Waldman, defamed Heard by telling the Daily Mail that her assault claims were a "hoax," and gave her $2 million in damages.

The jury in the high-profile slander case reached a decision earlier today.
