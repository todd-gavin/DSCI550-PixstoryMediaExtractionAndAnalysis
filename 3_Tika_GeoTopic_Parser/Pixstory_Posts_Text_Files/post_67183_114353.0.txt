Tanabata is a very popular festival of Japan. It is celebrated on July 7 every year.
   Tanabata means 'evening of the 7th.' It is also known as the Star Festival. Tanabata arrived in Japan in Heian period(794-1185) from China. But people started celebrating it in the Edo period(1603-1868).
         On this day,  people write their wishes on Tanzaku(brightly colored pieces of paper) and hang them on the branches of bamboo tree.
        Tanabata is a love story of Orihime,  daughter of the God of Heavens and Hikoboshi, a cow herder. Orihime was a weaver and made beautiful pieces of cloth by the Milky Way. She was sad because she couldn't find love.               
           Her father introduced her to a young man, Hikoboshi, who lived across the Milky Way. The two fell in love and, started neglecting their work.
             On knowing this, the God became very angry and forbade them to be together. But, for the sake of his daughter's happiness, he allowed Orihime to meet Hikoboshi on the 7th day of the 7th month every year, if she took her weaving seriously. 
               Finally, the day of meeting arrived. But, it was difficult for the two lovers to cross  the Milky Way. However,  a flock of magpies saw Orihime's sadness and compassionately made a bridge to cross and reunited Orihime with Hikoboshi.
