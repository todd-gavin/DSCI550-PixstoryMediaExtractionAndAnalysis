Do you know ? one-third of women in India have experienced physical or sexual violence . And only 14% of women who have experienced violence by anyone have brought the issue up ! The matter of violence committed against women in India is massive and widespread ! 
Violence Against Women ! What actually it is ?? violence against women is defined as “ any act of gender-based violence that results in physical , sexual or mental harm or suffering to women " ! The number of crimes against women is rising alarmingly . Rape , dowry killings , female infanticide , forced child marriage , kidnapping , and acid attacks on women are a few typical types of violence against women ! 
In spite of the fact that women are not safe in public areas , they are still not guaranteed privacy . There have been numerous reports of domestic violence . Both in the public and private spheres , women are not safe ! Every day , acts of violence against women , ranging from eve-teasing to murder , occur . However, only a small percentage of instances are prosecuted , and there are extremely few incidents that are recorded ! 
Society believes that this is the correct way and it must go on . Women are expected to have feminine traits such as sensitivity , dependency , being submissive , home-oriented , passive , gentle , and emotional . While men are expected to have masculine traits such as aggressiveness , independence , dominance , toughness and being active  !
Current cybercrimes that target women must be reported right once , and offenders must not get away with it . 
As a result of violence , women suffer social isolation , unemployment , income loss , poor self-care and fail to provide childcare , which is a grave concern ! 
All this is not acceptable and should be stopped !
Government and society must make some rules and laws while keeping in mind the current condition of women . To make India safer for women , more effective rules and legislation must be developed .
