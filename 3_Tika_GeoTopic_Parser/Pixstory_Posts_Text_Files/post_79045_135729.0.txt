Wow. What a game. We probably should have killed it off in the first half; we really could have been three or four ahead by the break. Second half was not so good, but we reacted well to the Villa goal and got the three points. Here’s my player ratings from the game…

Ramsdale - 7 - Didn’t do much wrong.

Tierney - 7 - Technically inferior to Zinchenko but defended well.

Gabriel - 9 - What a performance.

Saliba - 7 - A bit shaky in the second half

White - 8 - Another solid display

Lokonga - 9 - Proved a lot of people wrong

Xhaka - 9 - My MOTM. So, so good

Ødegaard - 7 - Not at his best but good nonetheless

Martinelli - 8.5 - Always dangerous, lovely goal.

Jesus - 9 - So strong, so powerful. What a player we have!

Saka - 8 -  Much better performance but should have scored. Great assist for the winning goal.

Subs:

Tomiyasu - Very good when he came on. 

Nothing much to say about Holding or Smith Rowe, but Nketiah was superb again off the bench.

15/15. Great start to the season.
