 Purandar fort is just like any other fort but still it is a special one Fort looks like so many huge mountains have been kept on each other with so many rock patches On the edge of rock patches the fortified wall has been built Inside the fort wall there is a Machi and inside a Machi there is a Balekilla with a total of twenty four Buruj where Shendrya Buruj is the highest among all as it feels like Shendrya Buruj is touching the sky And inside a Balekilla so many warriors will show their bravery with their sword just like so many kite birds are soaring in sky Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Took a short and sweet weekend trip to the Purandar Fort The nature and scenery was a treat to the eyes and soul Unfortunately you have to leave your phones at the base camp before you climb to the top for safety reasons The peak of the fort has a shankara temple with fierce cold breeze and dense fog It may be a little risky in the monsoon season but the overall atmosphere in fhe rains makes it worth it
