This topic came up when a couple of my friends and I were chatting yesterday How Selena Gomez Who Says and Rachel Platten s Fight Song are so empowering to listen to One of them said it s because the lyrics are so relatable and the other said it s because the beats and the music lift your mood up enough to want to groove to it I was wondering what people think is more important in a song lyrics or the beats For me lyrics can make or break a song and the feel of a song can radically shift my mood It depends on the situation but I prefer music lyrics since they tell a story and give the song significance I place a higher value on music that isn t just catchy or a banger but also moves me and connects me with my thoughts feelings through finely penned lyrics Lyrics carry so much of the song in them Stories ideas and raw emotions are all part of the package But what s fascinating is how much a song can make one person feel while the person next to them may be utterly unaware if they aren t paying attention to the lyrics Bad lyrics are a deal breaker for me A song can have great beats and sometimes that s enough to enjoy it but carelessly handled lyrics put me off I need to really connect to a song to be able to enjoy it truly It s always fascinating to me how people put random words together and turn them into such heart touching masterpieces
