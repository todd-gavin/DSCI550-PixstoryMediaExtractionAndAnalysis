At the American Freedom Tour, Donald Trump addressed the crowd promising to return to the White House in 2024. The rally was conducted in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Speaking to the masses, Trump said that they had a president who always put America first, and he vowed to be back in a better and more powerful way. Trump also falsely asserted that he had won the 2020 US presidential election.

Following his statements, Congresswoman Liz Cheney warned Trump of criminal penalties related to the 6th January riots. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is busy fetching Trump's White House records to help the House committee with the January riots investigation.

Donald Trump Jr, right-wing commentator Candace Owens, and radio host Dan Bongino were a few of the other speakers scheduled for the event in Florida.

Ever since Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, he has continued fabricating stories about his false victory. Although Trump has not announced any formal plans, he has continued to drop hints regarding the 2024 presidential run and aims to return to the White House.

Donald Trump lost the presidential election by approximately 7 million votes and got 46.8% of the votes cast. Whereas Joe Biden, current US president, won 51.3% of the votes cast.

Last year in an interview, Trump mentioned that he brought America to a level never seen before during his presidency.

Trump said last year that if he participated in the coming 2024 presidential election, he would easily win the GOP nomination. He also mentioned that he already has 94-95% and has a 98% approval rating in the CPAC (Conservative Political Action Conference).

Trump has been chasing a potential bid, although he has not announced a formal run for the 2024 election yet. Joe Biden has confirmed that he plans to participate in reelection in 2024.
