Marvel’s second on the list of brilliant Tv shows had “The Falcon and the Winter Solider” as it’s entry. First things first, even though this might just be the most mediocre experience of a Marvel Content, the performances of Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie are worth the watch. They excelled their roles to perfection showing an electrifying chemistry. 

The show follows Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson after the events of Avengers Endgame as he was given the mantle of Captain America. Bucky Barnes is trying to make sense of the world around him now that everything has changed. He goes on a journey to settle his guilt he had working for Hydra. 

The series has a plot which follows the eventual succession of the Captain America, whether it will be Sam Wilson who Steve chose or some one else. 
Even though the series loses it’s way in its narrative several times it makes up to it and gives a satisfying watching experience. 

If you are confused about what to watch this weekend, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a good action flick which will be worth your time.
