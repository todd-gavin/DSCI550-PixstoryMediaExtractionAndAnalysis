He was the most eagerly awaited Italian tennis player in this edition of the prestigious English Wimbledon tournament Matteo Berrettini After the victory in Stuttgart and at Queen&#39;s the runner-up was in great shape at the appointment with the London grass All nuanced due to the Covid positive test result the strong Roman athlete had to forfeit on the day he was supposed to play against the Chilean Garin The announcement came from the tennis player directly on his Instagram page With a broken heart I have to announce that I have to withdraw from Wimbledon to be positive for the Covid test I had some flu symptoms and in recent days I had decided to isolate myself Although it is nothing serious I have decided that the most important thing was to take a new test this morning to protect the health and safety of the players and everyone involved in the tournament I have not words to describe my deep sorrow The dream for this year has vanished but I promise I will come back stronger than before Thanks for the support Instagram photo matberrettini
