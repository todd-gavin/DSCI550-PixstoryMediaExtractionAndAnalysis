By Shekhar IyerNew Delhi: A ban on the Popular Front of India (PFI) was long overdue â€“ with many state governments pressing the Union Home Ministry to do so because it attempted to radicalise the Muslim youth and create violence in their areas.But Prime Minister Narendra Modi wanted the ministry to bide time to let the security agencies establish its wide network, identify its leadership and trace its operatives and also get a better grip on the funding routes before the ban.This was to avoid a repeat of what had happened when the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) was banned in 2001.In other words, Modi wanted greater homework by the security agencies before an official ban came into existence to prevent the PFI from morphing into new groups like the SIMI did. At that time, a lot of its leaders went underground to re-emerge even as functionaries of the PFI. Some SIMI units also rechristened themselves as the Indian Mujahideen too.Though it came into existence in 2006, the PFI has followed the path of the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), which was set up in Aligarh in 1977. By 2001, the SIMI had earned enough notoriety for a ban. The Supreme Court confirmed the ban in 2008. In 2019, the Centre extended the ban by another five years.Therefore, this time, Modi wanted a crackdown that should ensure that none of its affiliates had the wherewithal to reincarnate into new groups or pose any big security challenge as the country heads for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. There must also be no fallout on the law and order front when a series of assembly elections are held, starting from Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh by end of 2022, which will be followed by polls in Karnataka and Tripura in early 2023 and a few other states including Rajasthan, Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Telangana by end of 2023.Read more: https://www.newsdrum.in/columns/long-overdue-the-ban-on-pfi-shows-a-sense-of-timing-of-pm-modi-and-a-lot-of-preparations-95379.html
