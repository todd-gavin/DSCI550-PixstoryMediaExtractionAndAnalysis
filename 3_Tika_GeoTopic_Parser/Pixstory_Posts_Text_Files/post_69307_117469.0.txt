Vivek Bharadwaj, additional chief secretary for finance, industries, and commerce, opened a seven-day Hausla exhibition and sale at Zabarwan Park on 19 July.

A comprehensive initiative called HAUSLA- inspiring her growth was introduced last year by Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha to encourage female entrepreneurship in Jammu and Kashmir. 

The Department of Industries & Commerce and the J&K Trade Promotion Organization (JKTPO) are working together to host the week-long exhibition and sale, which will include a number of female entrepreneurs selling their goods. 

The ACS looked over every booth set up by the female entrepreneurs and spoke with them to learn more about their experiences starting and running businesses. 

Bhardwaj praised JKTPO and the female entrepreneurs who are participating in the show while addressing at the event.
