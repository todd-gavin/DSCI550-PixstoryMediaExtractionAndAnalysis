In addition to becoming platinum without any features, J. Cole will now be able to claim that he became a diamond without any music video and featuring.

 Diamond awards, which recognise artists whose singles or albums have sold 10,000,000 copies, are now available for Cole's 2014 Forest Hills Drive song "No Role Modelz," according to Chart Data.

J. Cole hopes to add song No. 79 to the distinguished list of only 78 songs to ever get diamond certification. Cardi B's "I Like It," Nicki Minaj's "Super Bass," and other recent hip-hop tracks have all joined the club. The Weeknd's "Blinding Lights," Juice WRLD's "Lucid Dreams," and Roddy Ricch's "The Box."

The top charting single on 2014 Forest Hills Drive, "No Role Modelz," peaked at No. 36 on the Billboard Hot 100. It received its most recent RIAA certification in August 2002, when it was certified as 6x-platinum.
