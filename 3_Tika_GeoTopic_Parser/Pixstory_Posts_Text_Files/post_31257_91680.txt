Coldiretti Lombardia we need to organize ourselves with structural interventions to collect water in the rainy periods and make it available in times of difficulty At the regional level, as repeatedly requested by Coldiretti, we are working on the recovery of abandoned quarries or in any case no longer used as a reserve accumulation basin At the moment, the abandoned quarries identified by ANBI Lombardia in collaboration with the Region are strategic water sources and meet the requirements for the collection and storage of water. At the national level, Coldiretti has developed and proposed in time a concrete project that can network of accumulation basins with low landscape impact and spread throughout the territory favoring the completion and recovery of existing structures in order to quickly route the project and optimize the final results. Coldiretti specifies the idea of building ponds without the use of cement in balance with territories that conserve water to distribute it rationally to citizens, industry and agriculture with an important impact on the environment and employment
