Chandigarh: An episode of eve teasing when she was 12 led Suchika Tariyal Hooda, then Suchika Tariyal, to pick a combat sport that would enable her to confront any similar situation that may arise in the future. 

She not only chose judo for herself, but also became a path breaker for her three sisters to follow suit. 

Thanks to Suchika’s initiative, all four Tariyal sisters have represented India at international arena.

Now, at 32, Suchika, who comes from a humble background, has become the torch bearer for the young girls hoping to also make a mark in sports.

She is a part of the six-member Indian judo contingent competing in the 2022 Birmingham Commonwealth Games. 

“Judo has given me everything, from strength to tackle eve teasing to providing a platform to be independent. It is more than a sport for me and for my sisters,” says Suchika, who is competing in the 57kg weight category in 2022 CWG. “I still remember that I was just 12 years old and had gone for a haircut. While doing the haircut, the barber tried to misbehave with me and somehow I told her to mend his ways. But that episode had an everlasting impression on my life and I decided to opt for a combat sport, so that in future if I would come across such a situation again, I would be able to teach that person a lesson. Eventually, I opted for judo and later on there were many occasions, while travelling in a local bus or a train, when a co-passengers tried to misbehave with me or with other girls, I taught them a lesson. And they would have never imagined in their life that a girl with a lean frame would overpower them easily. Judo has given me the strength to overcome all sorts of adversities and pride for my family.”
