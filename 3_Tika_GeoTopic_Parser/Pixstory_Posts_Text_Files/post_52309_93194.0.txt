A business magnate, Olympic medalist, marketing academic, pharmacy founder, and reconciliation advocate are among the final five people chosen to organise the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Brisbane in 2032.

On Sunday, the final positions on the Board of the Brisbane Organising Committee for the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games were filled by business and industry leaders.

Shelley Reys previously served as Reconciliation Australia's co-chair. She was a driving force behind events like the People's Walk for Reconciliation, Parliament's Apology to the Stolen Generations, Australia Day, and the Australian of the Year Awards.

The five new independent directors join 16 other directors from a variety of backgrounds, including several Olympic and Paralympic representatives. See the complete list below.
