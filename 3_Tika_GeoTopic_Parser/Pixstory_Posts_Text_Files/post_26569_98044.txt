Each collection for Maria Grazia Chiuri represents a visual poem a sort of dialogue between the history of the maison and its evolution in the contemporary world This time Justine Picardie&#39;s book Miss Dior A Story of Courage and Couture becomes the starting point to celebrate the house of fashion and create a new collection that speaks of the true creative force that women in the Dior universe have had, from Catherine sister of Christian Dior to Mizza Bicard, historic muse and character of proverbial elegance, up to Marguerite Carr, one of the pillars of the atelier. A creative process that becomes the symbol of a new sisterhood embellished by the imprinted emblem found on the jute sacks of the Dior family company and transformed into a heraldic motif that embellishes numerous pieces in the collection thanks also to the motto L union fait la force
