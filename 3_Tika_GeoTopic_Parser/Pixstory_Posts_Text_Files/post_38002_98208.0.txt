A move for Robert Lewandowski?

This is surely the most far-fetched option on the list. But Robert Lewandowski would be the perfect replacement. The 2021 FIFA The Best Men's player of the year awardee has been exceptional in the past 3-to 4 seasons. 

But sources claim that the striker is looking to leave Bayern Munich in the summer. Owing to this, it is possible that the Red Devils can sign him in the summer. But this would not be easy as Lewandoswksi would certainly want to continue playing in the UEFA Champions League. 

Robert Lewandowski has scored 343 goals in 373 appearances since joining Bayern Munich in 2014. Hence, Manchester United would surely benefit if they manage to pull out the signing of the Polish superstar amidst Barcelona's interest.




A possible move for Lautaro Martinez? 

Lautaro Martinez has been linked with the Red Devils for the past week. United manager Erik Ten Hag reportedly wants the player in the summer. Hence Manchester United have already made a bid. 

But Inter Milan are not willing to sell Lautaro Martinez "cheaply" and hence they have even squashed a bid from United. Manchester United are reportedly looking to add Anthony Martial as a swap plus money deal for the Inter Milan player. 

Lautaro Martinez has scored 17 goals and provided 3 assists in Inter's Serie A campaign so far. Hence the Argentine would certainly be a crucial player if the Red Devils can complete the signing. 





Will Darwin Nunez move to the Premier League? 

Benfica's Darwin Nunez are another striker that United are linked with. The Uruguayan has scored 26 goals in 27 Liga Portugal games this season. Hence he has drawn the attention of multiple Premier League clubs. 

The Red Devils have reportedly made an early bid of £67 million on Darwin Nunez. Hence it has to be see if the first bid is sufficient or if United would have to add to this in order to sign the striker.
