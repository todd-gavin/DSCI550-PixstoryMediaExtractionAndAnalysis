Turkey will send over 3,000 riot police to Qatar ahead of the FIFA World Cup 2022, to secure stadiums and hotels in the country, Reuters reported.
The security operation will be paid for by the competition hosts but will function under the Turkish command, a Turkish Interior Ministry source said.
“With a population of less than 3 million – of which just 380,000 are Qatari nationals – Qatar faces a shortage of personnel as it gears up for the month-long FIFA soccer tournament,” Reuters said.
Qatar has “turned to” Turkey, its closest regional ally, to ensure the competition – which aims attract an over 1.2 million visitors – is secure at all times.
Under the protocol signed between the two nations, Ankara will deploy 3,000 riot police and 100 special operations police to Qatar.
The squad will also include 50 bomb specialists and 80 sniffer dogs and riot dogs, Reuters said.
“During the tournament, Turkish police will only take orders from their Turkish superiors who are serving temporarily in Qatar,” the Turkish source said, adding “the Qatari side will not be able to give direct orders to the Turkish police,” however all expenses of the personnel deployed will be covered by Qatar.
The source did not specify who would have ultimate oversight of Turkey’s security operation, which will cover the eight stadiums where matches are taking place and hotels where the 32 national soccer squads will stay, Reuters said.
The protocol agreement says Turkey will also send senior staff to head the police teams and “a number of personnel for coordination” as well as one “general coordinator.”
In August, the Pakistan cabinet also approved a draft which allows the government to provide troops for security at the FIFA soccer World Cup in Qatar later this year.
The number of personnel which would be sent was not specified neither was the finalising of the agreement, Reuters said.
