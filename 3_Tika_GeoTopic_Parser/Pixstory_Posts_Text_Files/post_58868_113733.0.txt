In response to the "unfortunate and unprecedented" remarks made by the Supreme Court bench of Justices Surya Kant and J.B. Pardiwala while hearing a petition from former BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma, who is being investigated for allegedly making anti-Muslim remarks on television, fifteen retired judges, 77 former bureaucrats, and 25 former armed forces officers have issued an open statement.

The Vacation Bench had made derogatory oral statements about Ms. Sharma during its denial of her request to combine the numerous first information reports (FIR) that had been filed against her in various States, including that she was "single-handedly responsible."
