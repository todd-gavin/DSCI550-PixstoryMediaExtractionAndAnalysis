"St Patrick" has been trending in the states today with 411.4 tweets as of now following Ireland's St Patrick's Day parade which was held after two years and America's own parade yesterday.

After two years of muted celebrations owing to Covid-19, tens of thousands of people turned out to celebrate St Patrick's Day around the island of Ireland.

Because of the pandemic, parades were cancelled in 2020 and 2021.

The streets of Belfast and Dublin were lined with green revellers on Thursday.

Many people celebrated the restoration of street festivities with parades in Downpatrick, Londonderry, and others.

In United States, perhaps you imagine the parade in New York or the Chicago River being coloured green as St. Patrick's Day approaches.

There is, however, a city and a village in America that both claim to be the most Irish, and chances are you haven't heard of either.

One is a town in the heart of America's "Irish Riviera," while the other is a former mining city in the northwest. They celebrated St Patrick's Day with much excitement.
