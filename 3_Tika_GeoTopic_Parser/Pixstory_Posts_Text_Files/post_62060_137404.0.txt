Star India batter Virat Kohli continued his good run with the bat and slammed his 2nd consecutive fifty in Asia Cup 2022 in the Super 4 clash vs Pakistan on Sunday (September 4). 
Kohli, who came in to bat at his ideal number 3 in the batting lineup, smashed unbeaten 60 of 44 balls to become the top-scorer for his side. 
This is his 2nd back to back fifty as Kohli has smashed a half-century in the last match vs Hong Kong as well a few days back. Kohli continued the good show and slammed 4 fours and 1 six respectively. 
Kohli looks to be back in the golden touch as he is the highest scorer in the Asia Cup as it stands.
