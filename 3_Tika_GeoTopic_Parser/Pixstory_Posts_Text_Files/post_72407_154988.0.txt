Actor Urvashi Rautela wished her fans happy Karwa Chauth in her latest Instagram post a day after she shared a photo of herself wearing sindoor and mangalsutra (worn by married Hindu women). Urvashi is in Australia, and has been sharing one cryptic post after the other in recent days. Many on social media are reacting to her latest posts, with some asking her to leave Rishabh Pant alone during the upcoming T20 World Cup in Australia, and insinuating that Urvashi is stalking the cricketer.Earlier on October 4, Urvashi had indirectly wished Rishabh on his birthday via a cryptic Instagram post. In a recent post, she also spoke about sindoor (vermillion) being the most important thing for ‘a woman in love’. On Wednesday, in her latest Instagram post, Urvashi shared new photos of herself from Australia and wrote in the caption, “May the moon light flood your life with happiness and joy, peace and harmony. Happy Karwa Chauth in advance…” The actor wore a white top with red skirt and a matching red hairband in the pictures as she posed inside a room.
