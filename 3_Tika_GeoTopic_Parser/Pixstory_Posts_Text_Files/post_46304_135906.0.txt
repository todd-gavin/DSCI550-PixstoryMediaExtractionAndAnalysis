Most of us and even i too find it impossible to have a meal without first getting a drink of water . Our skin , bowel movements , digestion , and general health benefit greatly from drinking water . A minimum of 2 litres of water per day is recommended , and 3 to 4 litres per day in hot cities is essential . It is best to drink a glass or two of water either 30 minutes before or 30 minutes after eating !  👍💦
I have heard both sides of this , some people tell me - don't drink water along with meal as it interfere with digestion . While some says - to wait for sometime after having meal to drink water . ☹️
A few sips in between are perfectly OK , but due to several misconceptions , it is thought that drinking water while eating is not a good idea . 
So what is the entire truth ?? 🤔
Here are some of the common reasons , why you should not drink water with meals ; 
1 Reduces saliva , sends weaker signals to your stomach which ends up impacting the release to gastric juices and enzymes . 
2 Slow down absorption of nutrients .
3 it can Cause acidity .
4 It may cause weight gain . 
I usually don't have water in between meals . I only have water when i feel like food is spicy . But if it suits you , and you cannot eat your food without having water , you must continue doing so ! ✅
So it's completely your choice . Drink water and stay hydrated ! ✅❤️
