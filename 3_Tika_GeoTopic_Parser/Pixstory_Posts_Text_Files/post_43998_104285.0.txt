Ivory Coast and Zambia are set to meet at the Stade de Yamoussoukro in Group H on Friday as they begin their 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaigns.

Ivory Coast are coming into this fixture after losing two on the bounce, albeit those fixtures were against European giants France and England. Ivory Coast exited the last African Cup of Nations campaign in the Round of 16 - losing to Egypt on penalties.

Zambia will be playing their first competitive fixture of the year. Zambia had beat Ivory Coast to claim the African Cup of Nations title in 2012.

Sadly, Zambia have not featured in the competition since 2015 and will be looking to make their return in the tournament.

Ivory Coast vs Zambia: Probable Playing XI

Ivory Coast: Badra Sangare; Serge Aurier, Willy Boly, Eric Bailly, Hassane Kamara; Ibrahim Sangare, Jean-Michel Seri, Franck Kessie, Nicolas Pepe, Sebastien Haller, Wilfried Zaha

Zambia: Toaster Nsabata (GK); Dominic Chanda, Benedict Chepeshi, Frankie Musonda, Tandi Mwape; Kelvin Kampamba, Kings Kangwa, Enock Mwepu; Patson Daka, Fashion Sakala, Evans Kangwa

Ivory Coast vs Zambia: Predictions

Despite being plagued with injuries, Ivory Coast should boast enough quality to see off Zambia comfortably. Zambia sit 34 places behind Ivory Coast in FIFA’s rankings and that gulf will be evident on display.

Prediction: Ivory Coast 3 - 0 Zambia
