Brahmastra Part One Shiva is officially back on track After four successive days where the film s domestic box office collections showed big drops the film has picked up again in its second weekend On its second Saturday September the film showed a huge percent growth in collections across India raising promises of a healthy lifetime run It also overtook The Kashmir Files in terms of global earnings to become this year s highest earning Hindi film The nett domestic collection of the film is now the second highest for all Hindi films this year crossing Kartik Aaryan s Bhool Bhulaiyaa which collected crore in India In that list Brahmastra is still behind Vivek Agnihotri s The Kashmir Files which had nett collections of crore It is to be noted that The Kashmir Files budget of crore was a mere fraction of Brahmastra s overall budget Trade analysts have said that the jump on Sunday may not be as high now but even a mild rise will give the film a chance to register a crore second weekend which is a very healthy number The absence of major releases in this weekend has helped the film something that will continue next weekend as well In fact Brahmastra virtually has no competition at the Indian box office till Vikram Vedha and Ponniyin Selvan I arrive on September That means the film should break into the crore club domestically if all goes well
