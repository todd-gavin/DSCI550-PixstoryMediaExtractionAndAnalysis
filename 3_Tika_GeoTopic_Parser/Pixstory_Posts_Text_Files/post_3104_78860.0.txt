Was the Holocaust all about race? Yes, it was, historically speaking. No necessarily, said Whoopi Goldberg, comedian and actor, on the ABC talk show ‘The View’ that she co-hosts. After a barrage of criticism, she expressed regret and apologized. The show has suspended her for two weeks. Alongside her misunderstanding, though, she was also making an important point underlining something about humanity in general. 

The topic of discussion was this month’s ban of the classic Holocaust graphic novel, ‘Maus’: https://www.pixstory.com/story/should-classic-holocaust-novel-maus-be-banned-in-schools1643636069/78240

Goldberg said the Holocaust was “not about race ... it’s about man’s inhumanity to other man.” To the repeated interventions from other discussants, she maintained: “If you’re going to do this, then let’s be truthful about it... No, it’s not about race”: https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/01/media/whoopi-goldberg-the-view-suspended/index.html 

The first half is factually incorrect (Hitler saw Jews as an inferior race) but in the second she shows she means something more, not less. In ‘denying’ race, she was not an apologist for racists, but looking at racism in broader, humanitarian terms. 

Her sympathies were clear in further discussion. Among the reasons a school board in Tennessee has given to remove ‘Maus’ from the eighth grade curriculum was that it depicts a character nude and the language is offensive. Goldberg was vehemently critical. “I mean, it’s about the Holocaust, the killing of six million people, but that didn’t bother you?” 

Where she went wrong for certain was in introducing the white-supremacy angle. “… these are two white groups of people. This is white people doing it to white people, so y’all going to fight amongst yourselves”: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/01/us/whoopi-goldberg-holocaust.html

That certainly revealed “a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the Holocaust & antisemitism”:

Soon after the show on Monday, she however tweeted her regret: https://twitter.com/WhoopiGoldberg/status/1488320164517101574 She is completely right in admitting that “I should have said it is about both.” She said she was “deeply, deeply grateful” for getting an education on the topic. Next day, before commencing the show, she admitted, “I misspoke.” 

Yet, Goldberg is clearly not among the Holocaust deniers. In taking the matter beyond one category – race – and underling its universal aspect, she was not wrong either.
