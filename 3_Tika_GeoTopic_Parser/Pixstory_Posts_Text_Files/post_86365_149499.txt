This is connected to my first hand volunteer experience in an offline mode I discussed a variety of concepts and subjects pertaining to periods and menstrual hygiene awareness Without a doubt the experience was positive I enjoyed hearing the young girls opinions and learning about their feelings and emotions I reinforced the idea that periods should be normalized and that there is nothing to fear when talking openly about them while defining some of the major words The important thing to remember is that when we consider it it is definitely alarming Periods have always been and still are kept in the shadows not spoken in public and some myths still exist now I think these ideas will persist unless something is done about them As rightly said charity and basic upbringing begins at home Period talk should be open and honest between parents and kids Children must be informed in advance that these occurrences are common and they need not be alarmed Boys must be included in these debates because they are common and should not be disregarded
