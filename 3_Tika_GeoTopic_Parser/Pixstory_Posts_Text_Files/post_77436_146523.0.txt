Harsingar 🌼 flower is my favourite ✨
Harsingar  flowers have four to eight petals arranged above a vibrant orange tube in a pinwheel pattern. These highly fragrant flowers open at night spreading their fragrance in the surrounding area with an intensely sweet floral aroma. These flowers blossom between August to December.
