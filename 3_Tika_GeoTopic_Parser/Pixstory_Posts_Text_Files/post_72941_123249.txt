Sitting on the golden sand watching the beautiful red orange sun set into the crystal clear blue sky Just to the left of me I can see a few fluffy clouds that look just like freshly made fairy floss As the coconut trees giveing south vibes flowing thought the winds and the birds chirping and flying here and there The sun was gradually melting into the sky like a person waving goodbye and walking far far away and darkness was setting in The silence of the evening was shattered by the loud thunderous boom of the ship s whistle signalling all members on deck to return to the musty cabins below The smile of triumph was etched across my face My victory in shuffleboard no small feat against the veteran veterinarians had left me a bundling ball of joy My victory dance along the deck was momentarily paused as I chanced upon the setting sun
