In the end it wasn t the most glamorous of victories against Fulham but we certainly did enough throughout the game to be deserving of the win backed up by our xG In a deceptively hard fixture both players and manager will be delighted with the result Here s how I rated the players performances Ramsdale Made a few vital saves at important times in the match stayed focused throughout and showed just why he was preferred over Leno Tierney Struggled for composure on the ball compared compared to Zinchenko and failed to make a real impression on the game Gabriel Made a very naive error trying to overplay the ball under significant pressure but made amends with the late winner Saliba Characteristically solid throughout and started taking responsibility in build up as the game went on completing long passes Also undeterred by Mitrovic s physicality White We re starting to get used to these games from White Barely put a foot wrong and did the fundamentals to a high level Xhaka Once again not quite as eye catching as we ve seen from him recently put he s keeping up the high standards we ve been seeing from him Elneny A more limited deputy than the man he replaced but he knows his role and does his job efficiently allowing others to focus on progression degaard Took the game by the scruff of the neck and drove us forward as a team deserved the goal MOTM for sure Martinelli Busy game as usual and made things happen but was unable to directly make any real impression on the goal Jesus Pressed well from the front and brought others into the game but also didn t see many clear sights of goal Saka Good link up with degaard and all round tidy play but will be frustrated he wasn t able to get his name on the scoresheet Subs Nketiah changed the game Fulham s defence couldn t handle his strength and movement Could ve been more decisive in front of goal N A Tomiyasu Tierney Arsenal PixstoryArsenal
