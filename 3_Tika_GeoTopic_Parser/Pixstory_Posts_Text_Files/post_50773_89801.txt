Donald Trump now emboldened enough sued Hillary Clinton the Democratic National Committee and other people and entities that he claims had falsely accused him of colluding with Russia ahead of the US Presidential elections and in the process showed how the Republicans are still beholden to him The page lawsuit was filed in the District Court in Southern Florida It asks for more than million in costs and damages The lawsuit has come just a day after the release of a letter from a New York prosecutor who claimed that Trump had committed numerous felonies in his various businesses The lawsuit has named a number of people including former FBI Director James Comey and other FBI officials the retired British spy Christopher Steele and his associates and a handful of Clinton campaign advisers The complaint features a number of disproved and conspiratorial claims regarding the origins of the Russia probe It s an attempt by Trump to play into the emerging theories that the Russia investigation was not the result of FBI wrongdoing as Trump has long alleged but rather of wicked Democrats duping the FBI into pursuing it The lawsuit is a longshot that Trump has decided to take because there is ample evidence of Russian involvement in the presidential elections as was shown by the Robert Muller investigation This evidence includes the Trump tower meeting between the senior campaign staff of Trump and Russian officials A court victory in this lawsuit may be unlikely for Trump but the lawsuit in itself is enough for the Trump to show his supports that he is fighting back against the allegations that have been levied on him These suits have widely been seen as tactics which are meant to help Trump wait out the January committee which is responsible for investigating the Capitol Riots until the Republicans take back the house and kill the investigation Eli Hoenig a former federal prosecutor now an analyst for CNN said It s difficult to put into words just how deeply flawed and utterly hopeless this lawsuit is
