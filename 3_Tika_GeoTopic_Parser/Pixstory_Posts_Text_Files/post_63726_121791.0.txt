 Gotham Knights has been one of the most hotly anticipated games of the year, and its first 16 minute gameplay footage suggests that it is going to be more than a boring loot grind. This is not going to be an origin game by any means.“They're already awesome at the start of the game,” explains creative director Patrick Redding.

“It's not a function of them being ineffective as crime fighters, quite the opposite. They are all effectively graduates of the Batman School of Crime Fighting. So when they start, they are at their most similar, in the sense that they have a lot of these basic tools of combat and stealth, and moving around in the world and using their grapple. And then it's really over the course of the game that they fully diverge into their own flavor of what a Dark Knight of Gotham City should be.” Rather than being meek characters who slowly progress through levels to become heroes, players will be experiencing the essence of the four characters from the very start.

Set in a universe where Batman has died,  his underlings have taken over the crime fighting job and we will see Batgirl, Robin, Nightwing and Redhood become the new Knights of Gotham, with the game chronicling the journey of how each of them came to become Gotham’s guardian’s after the death of the Dark Knight.

The recent clip focused on Batgirl who is investigating a mystery that Batman was on earlier. Batgirl's character proficiency has been described as, Expert Hacker, Tough as Nails and Single Target Bruiser. Doing some Witcher style investigation, Batgirl uses advanced Wayne Enterprises technology to illuminate a bunch of footsteps like Geralt’s Witcher senses which show you where to go. The gameplay also features parkour, a grappling hook to cover long distances and some new style combat. The game looks really cool and seems to have a lot more to offer. Gotham Knights is slated for release on October 25 for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC.
