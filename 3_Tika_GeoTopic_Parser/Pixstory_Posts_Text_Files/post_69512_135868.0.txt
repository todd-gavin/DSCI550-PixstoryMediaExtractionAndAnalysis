The Indira Gandhi Memorial Tulip Garden, which is located at the base of Zabarwan Mountain and is known as the largest tulip garden in Asia, is one of the must-see attractions in Srinagar. The 48 different species of tulip blooms in a seven-terraced garden attract not only the family's adults, but also the children. 
A variety of other flowers, including daffodils, hyacinths, roses, narcissus, and other attractive plants, are also present in the garden. The water channel that runs through the terraces gives the area extra charm and makes it the ideal location for amorous couples to take romantic photos.
This popular tourist destination in Srinagar, which spans 30 hectares of land, comes to life in the spring when the Tulip Festival is held. This event is open to the public and is a must-see for tourists of all types in Kashmir as it tries to highlight the natural beauty of the garden, the vibrant Kashmiri culture, and its crafts and cuisine.
