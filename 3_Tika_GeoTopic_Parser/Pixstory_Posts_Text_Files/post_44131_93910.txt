Liverpool have confirmed the death of a supporter who became ill ahead of their Champions League match against Benfica at Anfield on Wednesday First and foremost the condolences and thoughts of everyone at the club are with the supporter s family loved ones and friends the club said in a statement released Thursday morning We would like to thank the emergency services for their heroic efforts in providing urgent care and our appreciation to our medical professionals stewards and all supporters in the vicinity of the incident for their assistance Merseyside Police confirmed the fan was a guy in his sixties in a statement He was sent to the hospital for emergency care but he died soon after He was said to have been in the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand when he got ill about minutes before the game started On the night Liverpool drew with Benfica to reach the European Cup Champions League semi finals for the th time in the competition s year existence tying the English record The Reds will now meet Villarreal in two legs in late April and early May aiming to reach the final for the tenth time and win the cup for the sixth time In the tie they were up But Benfica broke their offside trap twice in eight minutes with Roman Yaremchuk and Darwin Nunez scoring to transform the tone of the game and if Alisson had not stopped low at his post from Nunez Liverpool would have been left with more than psychological damage at the finish Liverpool had the opportunity to score more goals They were the superior group However it s possible that this merely serves to heighten rather than diminish the sensation of impending doom Klopp then blamed his team s issues on an unfamiliar back four But that would only be true if thiswas a one time occurrence That was not the case
