Canada's immigration minister said that 324 Afghan refugees were transferred from Pakistan to Canada on a special flight on Friday.
The Canadian government has transferred 17,600 Afghan citizens to Canada since August last year.
Canadian officials say the process is ongoing and more flights from Pakistan will be added in the coming weeks.
With the fall of Kabul, Canada announced that it would accept 40,000 Afghan citizens.
