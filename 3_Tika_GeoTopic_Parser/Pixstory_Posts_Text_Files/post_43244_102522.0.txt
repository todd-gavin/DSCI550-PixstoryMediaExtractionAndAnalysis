With the trailer out, fans wanted an introduction to the much-awaited first appearance of Bale's menacing villain and they certainly were not disappointed. The trailer gave way to Gorr as he took centre stage in the trailer followed by fans thirsting over Tessa Thompson's King Valkyrie and Portman's She Thor. Though there seems to be a disagreement between the fans as they fight over the brilliance of Gorr's look which some wanted the CGI version of. On the other hand, there are fans who appreciate the raw intimidation of Christian Bale's bare face which has been modified with just makeup and costume to help him embody the terrifying aura of the new MCU villain.
