Met Gala would be the night of sparkle and lights where celebrities would be seen scintillating the red carpet with this year's theme. As there are two left for the most prominent fashion night, here are some "need to know" things for Met Gala 2022.

Met Gala is also known as the Costume Inside Benefit or the Met Ball.
It is a charity event held at the Metropolitan Museum Of Art in the Newyork city. It is undoubtedly the most significant celebrity fashion event of the year.

The event decides some names who would be clad in the beautiful attire as per the theme of the Met Gala. The theme consistently portrays an idea, representing the most significant change of the times.
The Gala raises millions for the Costume Institute, which holds an annual accompanying exhibition by selling tickets brought by the biggest brands and designers.

This year's theme is the Gilded Glamour and white tie, referring to the Gilded Age.
Regina King, Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds and Lin- Manuel Miranda are announced as the event's co-chairs, while Tom Ford, Adam Mosseri and Anna Wintour will act as honorary co-chairs.
The rest would be unbosomed on the day of the fashion's biggest night on 2nd May 2023
