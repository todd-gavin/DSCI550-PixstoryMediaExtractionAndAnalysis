When i started playing basketball i was in 9th standard.
I didn't know anything about basketball that time.
My school coach wanted me to play and not just play but also represent school and district.
My parents always stayed with me and pushed me towards hardwork .
And then i started practicing .
Never thought i would come to this level.
Thanks to all who supported me .
Whenever i was disappointed they movtivated me to grow and practice harder ..
To become who i am today .
From representing school to district...
District to region ...
Region to stateâœ¨
Today i represent uttar pradesh in senior basketball.
