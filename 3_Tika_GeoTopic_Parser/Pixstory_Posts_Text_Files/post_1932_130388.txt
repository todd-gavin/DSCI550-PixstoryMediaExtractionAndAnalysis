Cancel culture has ruined the reputations of numerous living and deceased celebrities and public leaders Cancel culture is the notion that a person who makes a mistake or does something wrong should have their reputation tarnished and be banished from both the public and private spheres This idea was spawned through our rapid interconnection as a result of social media Those that foster cancel culture hold the belief that individuals are irredeemable for if that wasn t true then they wouldn t seek the destruction of a person s reputation instead they would advise them to alter their behavior or mindset and lead a better life In addition apologies and new actions taken by those who are called out for their behavior invariably add more gasoline to the fire than they do to their cause meaning that people look to destroy not heal Culture is not the disease but rather a symptom of our division As a country we have become limited to sound bites and isolated incidents because we are so polarized It is hardly inconceivable that a person who has contributed billions of dollars and sacrificed their life to rescue others would be condemned for a single transgression nowadays Our country is at its most polarized point in history will there ever be a moment when being an imperfect human overcomes the necessity that we be infallible
