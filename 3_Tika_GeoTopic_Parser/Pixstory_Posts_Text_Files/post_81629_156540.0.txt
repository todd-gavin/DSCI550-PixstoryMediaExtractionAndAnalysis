Colombia beat Mexico 2-1 to qualify for the quarterfinals atop Group C on Matchday 3. The game was at Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Goa. Both sides needed a win to assure qualification on the night and it was Colombia that came out on top. Although the score line suggested a competitive match, Colombia dominated for large swathes of the game and only conceded via an unfortunate own goal. Juana Ortegon sent the Colombians into half-time with a one goal lead after her strike in the 41st minute. Linda Caicedo scored for both sides in the second half as she doubled the Colombians’ advantage in the 74th minute and conceded an own goal 7 minutes later. 
After a losing start to Spain on Matchday 1, the Colombians rallied to win the group by winning their next two games. Two goals each against China and Mexico mean that they are the top scorers in the group. They will face second place in Group D in the quarterfinals. 
Mexico’s tournament started with a surprise defeat to China on Matchday 1. They followed it up with an equally surprising upset of Spain by the same 2-1 score line on Matchday 2 to keep hopes of qualification alive. Mexico can return proud of their displays in the world cup and consider themselves fairly unlucky to miss out on the last game. 
While Colombia could have qualified with a draw, a win was essential for Mexico on account of their inferior goal difference. Colombia are likely to be the favourites against likely opponents France or Tanzania in the quarterfinals. Although not one of the teams pitted as title contenders, their performance in the group stage inspire confidence that they could push any team on their day.
