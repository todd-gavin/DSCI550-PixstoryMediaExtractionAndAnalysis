IT WAS TOO RESTRICTIVE

Don't eat carbs. Only eat insert certain food] 2 time per week. No alcohol. Only eat 1200 calories per day. Sound familiar?
Having rules and restrictions around food never works in the long term. You can't keep up with the rules, and when you break them, you feel like a failure. Not only do you not see physical results from the diet, but your mindset and ego take a hit, too.

IT WAS UNSUSTAINABLE

If you can't picture yourself following a way of eating on the weekends, vacation, or actually,
for the rest of your life, then it's probably not a good fit. Eating is something we do EVERY single day. We have to enjoy how we eat and it has to feel like we can do it easily day in and day out, which is not the case with most diets.

IT WAS UNREALISTIC

Super low calorie. A very short list of “allowed" foods, and a very long list of “not allowed" foods.
This isn't real life. We're often in situations where we don't have control over what we're eating or just don't have access to certain
foods. If the guidelines of your diet feel restrictive when you first start, you'll only feel more restricted the longer you attempt to make it work.
