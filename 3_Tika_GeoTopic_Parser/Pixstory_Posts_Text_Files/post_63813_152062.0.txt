 With the coming of October, legendary director Guillermo Del Toro is taking audiences on a joy ride inside his mind where he will show them a cavalcade of unbridled horror with his eight part horror anthology titled ‘Cabinet of Curiosities’.
Produced by Del Toro, each episode in the series focuses on a new cast of characters who are unlucky enough to cross paths with a ghost, monster, or just outright creepy murderer. The newly released trailer for the show is enough to send shivers down your neck.
A look in the mind  of one greatest masters of horror, Cabinet of Curiosities will feature a plethora of material that that Academy Award winning director wanted to bring to audiences but via a smaller format than that of a feature-length presentation.
We can expect to see and hear a lot of the stories and musings the film-maker wrote about in his 2013 memoir titled Guillermo Del Toro Cabinet of Curiosities: My Notebooks, Collections, and Other Obsessions.
The anthology series is created and executive produced by Del Toro; executive produced by Academy Award winner J. Miles Dale (The Shape of Water; Sex/Life), who also serves as co-showrunner; and executive produced by Gary Ungar with Regina Corrado serving as co-executive producer.
The collection of shows include the following: The Autopsy, Dreams In the Witch House, Graveyard Rats, Lot 36, The Murmuring, The Outside, Pickman’s Model and The Viewing. 
Cabinet of Curiosities will release on October 25 on Netflix and will debut with two episodes per day with each episode with Del Toro also acting as the host.
