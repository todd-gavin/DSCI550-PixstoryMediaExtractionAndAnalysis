A video of a man distributing saffron scarves to young women has been shared on social media. It is viral with the claim that a Muslim teacher of a Christian school in Maharashtra who had coerced his female students into offering namaz was “taught a lesson” when Shiv Sena activists forced him to put saffron scarves on the same students.

Several Twitter users shared this video with the same claim.

Fact-check
Through a more detailed examination of the video, it becomes quite clear that this video was shot at a movie theatre. A film poster and a concession stand can be seen in the background.

Through a simple keyword search, we found that the video was filmed at a movie theatre in Nashik, Maharashtra, during a screening of ‘The Kashmir Files’ on March 23. A group of women had arrived at the said theatre wearing saffron stoles which they were allegedly asked to remove. This led to a scuffle between the authorities and the movie-goers. It ended after the police intervened.

The man in the black shirt who put on the saffron stoles on the women in the video was pictured by ANI. One of the onlookers can also be seen in the picture.

The scuffle was reported by several media organisations.

It is thus clear that a video has gone viral with the false claim that a Muslim teacher at a Christian school had forced his female students to read the namaz and was consequently “taught a lesson” by Shiv Sena workers who made him put on saffron scarves on the same students. In reality, the video was taken after a scuffle broke out at a theatre in Nashik during the screening of ‘The Kashmir Files’.
