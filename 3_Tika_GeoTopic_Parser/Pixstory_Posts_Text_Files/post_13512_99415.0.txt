Last year a day before today, tens of school girls fell as the bombs wich terrorists had planted around the gate of their school went off, hundredothers were injured, of whom many  became disabled and others mentally wounded and traumatized. 
We commemorate them and promise to support the way of knowledge and human liberty, no matter what the terrorists do and no matter how hypocritical the world powers play. We continue this nonviolent fight, through schools, against religious extremism and bigotry with an army of millions of individuals, women and children, no matter even if we are not politically signifigant or strategically important to others. 
We need this fight so that our next generations should not live as miserablly as we do. 
My heart is with families and survivors of that barbaric attack, you are remembered you are on the right path of human history! You are alive, the terrorists are dead.
