Given all of Kim Kardashian's dramatic movement - constricting and body exposing fashions over the years, it should come as no surprise that there are no lengths the reality star will not go to in order to pull off a particularly difficult high fashion look.

On April 13, the skims founder returned to The Ellen DeGeneres Show, telling DeGeneres that she never says never when it comes to fashion and will "literally wear" anything. "I don't care how uncomfortable it is, or how long I have to go without using the restroom if I have to wear a diaper. I don't give a damn what I have to do "She said. Kim's choice of attire for her talk show appearance, a black mock turtleneck latex midi dress with Yeezy stiletto ankle boots, emphasised this point.

Kim also revealed that if one of her future Balenciaga duct tape catsuits requires a diaper, she already has a box of them at home due to a previous misunderstanding about the bar exam logistics. "I actually bought adult diapers when I took the bar exam because I didn't understand how it worked and thought I had to sit there for eight hours straight," the reality star revealed.
