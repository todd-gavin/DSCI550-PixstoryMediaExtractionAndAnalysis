The end of the Taliban's rule in late 2001 and the formation of a new system in this country has not yet provided the ground for the return of refugees to their homeland. As new resolutions are passed every day in support of the rights of refugees and migrants around the world, the sad and horrifying images of the lives of Afghan refugees shake the human heart. "People of almost all countries shout in unison at the request of immigrants and refugees: 'No ... do not let a stranger into your home.' While the crying faces of Afghan children and the sad faces of displaced women and men are etched in everyone's memory.
Afghan refugees and asylum seekers in the current situation do not have the proper respect for a refugee and an immigrant. Violent and inhumane treatment is reflected in some countries in relation to displaced persons or immigrants and even children born in the same country, and immigrants are treated with contempt, their rights are violated, and they are treated badly as a lowly group. They are described as despicable who do not deserve any respect or equal treatment with other citizens of that country or religion.
This pathetic and offensive situation has made it necessary to discuss the rights of refugees in refugee countries. If refugee countries show an interest in human rights, it is only for their own citizens. As for others, especially in the case of Afghan refugees, the opposite is true in theory and practice. And this is what has created great problems for IDPs living in refugee countries. It is also necessary to activate the issue of human rights with a comprehensive and global perspective and not be content with the slogan for refugees. We live in a world filled with hypocrisy, lies and pretense.
