The Congress has suffered two back to back exits in the last two days it was Patidar leader Hardik Patel yesterday and today it is the turn of Sunil Jakhar In his resignation letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi Patel was unsparing on Rahul Gandhi Ironically it was Rahul Gandhi who got Patel and Alpesh Thakor into the party Without naming Rahul Gandhi Patel said Whenever I met with the senior leadership always felt that leaders were not really interested in hearing about problems concerning the people of Gujarat but were more engrossed on what messages they had received on their mobile and other such trivial things Whenever our country faced challenges and when the Congress needed leadership Congress leaders were enjoying abroad Senior leaders behave in a way like they hate Gujarat and Gujaratis Patel was equally harsh on Gujarat Congress leaders Big leaders of Congress in Gujarat are far away from issues of Gujarat but are more focussed on ensuring that Chicken Sandwich for leaders who have come from Delhi is delivered on time Patel s letter is an indication of where he is headed to though he hasn t officially declared his future plans yet Patel s entry into the Congress had hardly made any difference to the party in Gujarat and so has his exit Coming to Jakhar he was appointed Punjab Congress chief at the behest of former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh Prior to that and even after his appointment Jakhar would spent most of his time abroad He was promoted in the Congress by Amarinder only to keep Partap Singh Bajwa in check The two leaders who caused immense damage to the Congress in Punjab are Jakhar and Navjot Singh Sidhu who did everything to negate the party s masterstroke of having appointed Charanjit Singh Channi as the first Dalit chief minister of the state It is too early to assess the impact of the exit of Patel and Jakhar on the Congress The only difference is that while there is much time left for the elections in Punjab Gujarat is going to polls in some months and Patel belongs to the influential Patidar community
