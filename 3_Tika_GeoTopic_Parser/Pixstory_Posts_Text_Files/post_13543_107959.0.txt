TOLOnews was honored with the One World Media's Special Award for 2022 at a ceremony Thursday night.
Three media organizations--from Afghanistan, Peru, and Uganda--were nominated for the award and it was presented by renowned British journalist Jon Snow.

Speaking online at the awards ceremony, Jon Snow said the Special Award is for those organizations standing up for truth and justice. "As we have heard, each of these nominees from Peru, Afghanistan and Uganda are incredible organizations powered by determined and creative journalists and filmmakers, but there can only be one winner, I can reveal that the winner of this Special Award is TOLOnews in Afghanistan," he said.

The BBC's Yalda Hakim received the award on behalf of TOLOnews.

Yalda Hakim said it was an honor to receive the award on behalf of the TOLOnews team and added that she would dedicate the award to women journalists in Afghanistan, especially to women journalists in TOLOnews.
