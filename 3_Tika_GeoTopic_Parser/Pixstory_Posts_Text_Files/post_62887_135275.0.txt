1. Pack light – you don't want to be lugging around unnecessary items all the time, especially when travelling to a hot place like a tropical island.
2. Bring plenty of sunscreen and bug spray – it's going to be hot out there, and you don't want to get sick or bitten by mosquitoes.
3. Drink plenty of water – not only will this help you stay hydrated, but it will also help cool you down if you're feeling too hot.
4. Dress lightly – while it's great to feel comfortable and airy while you're outdoors, try not to wear too many clothes in case it's cooler inside than outside. 
5. Bring an insect repellent containing DEET – there is a high rate of mosquito bites in tropical areas, so make sure you have protection if needed. 
6. Bring your passport and other travel documents – just in case something goes wrong and you need to leave quickly for any reason. 
7. Make sure your phone is fully charged – even if you're not using it much, having a phone charger handy can never hurt! 
8. Communicate with your family and friends back home – let them know where you are, what time zone it is, and that all is well so far (even if there are no pictures yet). 
9. Be patient - If you experience any trouble while travelling, don't hesitate to seek help from local police or emergency services – they will be more than happy to help you out! 
10. Stay informed- Keep an eye out for warning signs posted by local authorities – these may include updates on ebola outbreaks or other health concerns specific to the area you're visiting. 
11. Wear long sleeves - Wear long pants and sleeves when walking around – it's easier to avoid getting bitten that way.
