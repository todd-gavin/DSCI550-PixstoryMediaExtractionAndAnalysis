Reading books based on what everyone else is reading is a sure way to become just like them. Instead, try reading books that are based on your personal interests and passions. This will help you to develop your own opinion and worldview, which will ultimately lead to better decisions.

Moreover, reading for pleasure is one of the best ways to learn new things. By immersing yourself in a new story or setting, you'll be able to access information that you wouldn't normally be able to understand. This is how we become better educated and more knowledgeable about the world around us. So read what you love, and remember: be original!
