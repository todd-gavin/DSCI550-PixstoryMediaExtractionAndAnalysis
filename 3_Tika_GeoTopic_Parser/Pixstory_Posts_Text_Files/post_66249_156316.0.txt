This is definitely without a doubt another one of the most tremendous, incredible, amazing and terrific films I've ever seen. The completely enthralling world of Harry Potter continues to get more exciting and more mysterious and this film delivers in such enormous ways that I never saw coming, in this wonderful masterpiece I'm introduced to another favorite character of mine that I'm proud to add to my small group of favorite characters in Harry Potter so along with Harry Potter himself and Hagrid I now also include cautious, magical, adorable, sweet and innocent little Dobby. I only ever saw him in Part 1 of the Deathly Hallows and even in that one I was completely heartbroken from what happened to him in the end of that one since it almost broke me, but I truly love him in this one since he's exactly the kind of dear and darling little friend you'd always want by your side even if he can be a little overbearing and a little overprotective at times. But that's just more of the things that I really love about him since they're more of the things that make Dobby himself, besides for someone with a face like his how could you not love that face? What is it about that face? If you haven't seen this film yet than you had better get your head in the game because the world of Harry Potter is about to get even better and if you thought you loved the Sorcerer's Stone before than you are not going to believe what the Chamber of Secrets has in store, you'll laugh, you may cry and you might even groan but in the end I garuntee you'll be as 100% satisfied as I was after I saw this masterpiece of a film for the first time ever. After this you can bet that a new Hufflepuff like me will be begging for more, even a new Slytheran like my sister. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets All The Way!!!!
