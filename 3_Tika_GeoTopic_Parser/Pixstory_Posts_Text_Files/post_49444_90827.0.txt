The sequel to the 2017 Nintendo Switch and Wii U adventure, Zelda Breath of the Wild 2, is one of the most eagerly awaited games on the horizon, with a release date set for this year. However, the House of Mario has released an update to its plans today, and it's bad news for those hoping to play BOTW 2 this year. The release date for The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild 2 has been moved back to spring 2023, according to Nintendo.

In a video released today The Legend of Zelda series producer Eiji Aonuma said: "I have an update to share on the launch timing of the sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

"We previously announced that we were aiming for a 2022 release for this game.

"However, we have decided to extend our development time a bit and change the release to spring 2023.

"For those of you who have been looking forward to a release this year we apologise."

Aonuma-san went on to add: "As previously annouced, the adventure in this sequel will take place not just on the ground as in the previous game, but also in the skies above.

"However, the expanded world goes beyond that and there will be an even wider variety of features you can enjoy including new encounters and new gameplay elements.
"In order to make this game's experience something special, the entire development team is continuing to work diligently on this game so please wait a while longer."
