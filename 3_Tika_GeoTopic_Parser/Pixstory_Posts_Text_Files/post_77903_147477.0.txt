Gobi Manchurian😋
Gobi Manchurian is always a veg option for me. Recently me and my friends found a super budget friendly fast food near our hostel. The main attractions are veg. Noodles, fried rice, Manchurian etc at ₹40/-. So if you are some where near Arakere, go to Sri Krishna Udupi Veg hotel and try these dishes. It's delicious😋.
