Best player, best young player, team of the year: our Red and Blue were honoured at the UNFP Awards.

After winning the Best Young Player Award in 2017-18 and 2018-19, Marie-Antoinette Katoto won the most important award this time and followed in the footsteps of her colleague Katidiatou Diani.

The Parisian No.9 had her work cut out for her with competition from Catarina Macario (Olympique Lyonnais), Clara Matéo (Paris FC) and her team-mates Kadidiatou Diani and Grace Geyoro.

With two games remaining in the league, Marie-Antoinette continues to lead the Arkema D1 scoring charts with 18 goals. The Colombes born player, who joined the club at the age of 12, continues to shine for the Parisians.

This is another reward for the Paris Saint-Germain player, who also became the club's all-time top scorer this season. 

Alongside her, the young Laurina Fazer was awarded as the best young player of the women's league. The youngster made her debut this season with the professional team, and celebrated her 18th birthday at a D1 Arkema match. 

Finally, Kadidiatou Diani, Grace Geyoro, Paulina Dudek, Sakina Karchaoui, Sara Däbritz and Ashley Lawrence were all named in the best XI of this season. 

In total, no less than 8 Parisian women were honoured by their counterparts on Sunday evening.
