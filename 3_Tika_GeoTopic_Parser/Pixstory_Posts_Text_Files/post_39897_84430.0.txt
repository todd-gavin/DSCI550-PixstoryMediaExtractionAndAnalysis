Origin of Patrani Macchi
There is no debate that Parsis, the Zoroastrians of India take their food seriously, rather very seriously.
Zoroastrianism is the ethnic religion of the Parsi people. According to the Qissa-i Sanjan, Parsis migrated from the Sasanian Empire to Gujarat, where they were given refuge, between the 8th and 10th century CE to avoid persecution following the Muslim conquest of Persia.
During this migration, they brought with themselves rich and loving culture along with a box full of recipes of both vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian delicacies.
One amongst them is Patrani Macchi or Parsi Fish Steamed in Banana Leaf !
