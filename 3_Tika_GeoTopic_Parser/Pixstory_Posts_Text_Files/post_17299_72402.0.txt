According to Spanish outlet El Nacional (h/t Mirror), Chelsea are said to have outbid Spanish giants Barcelona in their attempt to bring Paris Saint Germain defender Layvin Kurzawa to Stamford Bridge.

Kurzawa is said to be looking for a move away from the French capital to gain more game time, and it appears that Chelsea and Barcelona are the frontrunners to sign the player. The former AS Monaco man has hardly featured for PSG this season and is behind summer signing Nuno Mendes in the PSG pecking order.

Chelsea are in the market for a new left-sided defender this January following Ben Chilwell‘s season-ending injury against Juventus back in November. Kurzawa has been identified as a potential option for the Blues as to look to address their full-back concerns.

Kurzawa has not featured for PSG in the league this season and has made just one appearance for the French giants across all competitions. The Frenchman will be desperate to leave the Parc des Princes in order to play regular football at the highest level. Given that Chelsea and Barcelona are keen, he is not short of options either.

The Catalan giants are also looking for a new left-back, as their new manager, Xavi Hernandez wants to sign a top player who could provide competition for Jordi Alba. However, they seem to have suffered a blow in their attempts to sign Kurzawa, as Chelsea are reported to have outbid them.
