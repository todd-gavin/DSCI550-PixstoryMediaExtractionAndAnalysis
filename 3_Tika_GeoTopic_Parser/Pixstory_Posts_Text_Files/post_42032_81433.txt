Groundwater contamination When we talk about groundwater pollution we re talking about dissolved solutes in the water that can make it unfit for human consumption or inappropriate for the ecosystem into which it flows Most natural waterways contain dissolved compounds that we consider to be pollutants in some form Lead and arsenic for example are present in every glass of water we consume However in the vast majority of situations these compounds are present in extremely low concentrations posing no risk to our health A contaminant must be present at a concentration that causes a considerable risk to human health or the environment to be considered a true problem
