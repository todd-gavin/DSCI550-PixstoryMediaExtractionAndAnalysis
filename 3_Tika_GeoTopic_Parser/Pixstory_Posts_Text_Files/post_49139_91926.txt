ACAB is a sad commentary on the media which uses any police fault to make big headlines in order to sell newspapers and television commercials For every awful act that occurs police officers perform hundreds of thousands of nice deeds every day which are never covered on social media and never by the mainstream media Believers of ACAB are nothing but ungrateful citizens While you re home with your families there are hundreds of thousands of men and women in blue who leave their families at home and go to work each day so that when you re in trouble they put their lives on the line and eventually take the bullet for you Personally I don t think it s fair to assume that everyone in a group is evil It s simply not true and I find it shocking that so many civilians are so quick to accuse law enforcement of wrongdoing especially when you examine their rationale While cops sometimes make mistakes my experience has taught me that those that believe ACAB is breaking the law and don t want to be found out are likely to do so Of course it is a generalisation and I m sure there are times when that dread is justified However it happens far less frequently than one might assume However this pessimistic mindset frequently prevents the vision from being dispelled Everyone is wrong if one is incorrect It s illogical and it hurts law enforcement all over the world Bad attitudes have pervaded our society since its inception and keeping it on a level keel has been a constant effort What other career aside from law enforcement expects more of a person while providing no remuneration for erroneous thinking on behalf of the wider public It s a mob mentality with no requirement for people to physically show up in the town square Without concern for the end outcome the internet allows us to propagate misinformation make judgments intimidate people and influence thinking
