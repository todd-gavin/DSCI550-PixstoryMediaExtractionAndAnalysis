I'm an amateur illustrator and I'm keenly interested in graphic design.

If there's anything like a stress buster that takes my mind off of my academic work, it's indulging in various forms of art.

I'm not formally trained in any of them and mostly self-taught through YouTube. There's obviously scope for improvement and for the longest time I have been hesitant about posting my work online. But I really wish to express myself through my work and I believe it's ideal to share and get feedback from the online community.

I also believe it's a great opportunity to connect with people who are interested in the same and are learning the art.

These illustrations are portraits of humming birds. If you have been following my posts for sometime here, then you'll know that I'm attached to nature. Humming birds are among some of my favourites because despite their delicate anatomy, they are just so resilient.

I wanted to try different colour combinations and experiment with the water colour effects (i'm still trying to find my niche style but I still love exploring different art styles).

I'm going to be featuring my other illustrations I made for various projects and campaigns in the past and maybe you'll find something you'll love in my collection.
