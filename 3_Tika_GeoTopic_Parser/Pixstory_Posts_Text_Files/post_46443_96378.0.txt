A sweet love-story 
Villian : Diabetes

Well , That's my story ! But jokes apart let's me talk About Diabetes . A very serious problem faced by people of all ages In today's time ! 

Guys i can feel your pain ! Diabetes diet can be tricky as there are a lot of do's and dont's. To keep things simple, your main goal should be managing your blood sugar levels.

It's not that difficult ✨! I will tell you 3 things Which you can take Without taking any tensions ! 

1 Dark Chocolate Instead of Normal Chocolate🍫 -  
Well i know how bad it feels when you want to have chocolate but you can't because of Diabetes ! The solution is Dark Chocolate ! The secret of how dark chocolate works against diabetes lies within the sweet snack's makeup. Polyphenols in dark chocolate may improve insulin sensitivity. This, in turn, may help control blood sugar . Such improved insulin sensitivity may delay, or even prevent, the onset of diabetes.

2 Dates Instead of Refined Sugar🍭 -
Dates have a low GI, which means they're less likely to spike your blood sugar levels, making them a safe choice for people with diabetes. Moreover, dates have a medium GL, which means that 1 or 2 fruits at a time are a good choice.

3 Coconut Water Instead of Energy Drink 🌴-
Avoiding your fav Drinks can be difficult ! But Coconut Water is the solution . Coconut water comes loaded with protein and fibre, both of which are essential nutrients for diabetics. Both the nutrients take time to digest . Coconut water makes a better option than an aerated drink or a sweetened beverage. Coconut water is natural and does not contain any preservatives .

Well No , i don't Have Diabetes ! But unfortunately , In my family some people are suffering from diabetes ! So I learned all this from my family . 🤍

 All you have to do is " Think before you eat " .🤍✨
