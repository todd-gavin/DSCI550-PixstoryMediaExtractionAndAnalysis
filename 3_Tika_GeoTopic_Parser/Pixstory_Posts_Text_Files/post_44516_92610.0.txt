Jurgen Klopp has agreed that Liverpool's rivalry with Manchester City is the finest in Premier
League history, according to Jamie Carragher.

The Reds manager is prepared to play Pep Guardiola's side in a potentially title-deciding
encounter on Sunday, and believes the two clubs' recent squabbles have propelled them ahead
of the likes of Manchester United, Arsenal, and Chelsea. Klopp was informed of Carragher's
decision at his pre-match news conference and enthusiastically approved.

He stated, yes, indeed! It's amazing how consistent both teams have been throughout the
course of the season. We understand how difficult it is. What has happened in the last four
years is that everyone else believes it is difficult.

Klopp said, "I'm anticipating a nice game. Iâ€™m aware that this isn't always the case. But it should
be entertaining to watch since both sides are going all out." "I cannot decide what others
believe, but we can simply go through the various results," Liverpool's boss continued when
asked whether it was a championship decider.

With only one point separating the two teams and with eight games remaining, the outcome of
Sunday's match will likely determine who wins the League Title in May.

The Reds are in high spirits after beating Benfica 3-1 away from home in the first leg of their
Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday. After failing to beat City at the Etihad Stadium in
the Premier League since November 2015, just two months into Klopp's leadership, even eight
consecutive away victories aren't enough to persuade him that they will win.

While the rivalry has a competitive edge, the two managers - who will also face off in the FA Cup
semi-final at Wembley next Saturday - have mutual admiration for one another, with the German
saying of Guardiola: "We can all agree that Pep is the finest coach in the world. I'm not sure how
anyone could have doubts about him."
