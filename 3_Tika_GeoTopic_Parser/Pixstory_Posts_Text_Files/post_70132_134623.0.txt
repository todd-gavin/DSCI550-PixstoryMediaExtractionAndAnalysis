The head coach of FC Goa, Deggie Cardozo on Monday highlighted that coming to this tournament (Durad Cup) as the defending champions, taking the trophies back home has indeed been the top objective all along. 
"We may have lost our way a bit, but it’s not because we played poorly. Across all the three games that we played, there were several phases where we dominated our opponents. Our midfield play has been fine, and this experience will serve the youngsters well in the days to come. Being a young squad, my players lacked experience at the topmost levels of Indian football and also in terms of physicality when compared to the senior players of our opponents - yet they never made that an excuse to give up," said Cardozo.
“I’m proud of my boys for the way in which they fought so far. And the fight is not over, because we are facing Bengaluru FC tomorrow. We want to play a good game, and that’s what we are focusing on,” the FC Goa head coach added.
“Bengaluru FC may be a strong team, but we faced similar sides prior to this. We’re confident of doing well.”
The clash between FC Goa and Bengaluru FC will be held at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan on Tuesday, with the kick-off slated to happen at 03:00 pm IST.
