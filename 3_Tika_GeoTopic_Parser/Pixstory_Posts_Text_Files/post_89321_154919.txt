I am not from a religious family For me the festive season means taking a break from my normal eating habits and splurging money on tasty food usually junk food and enjoying these days to the fullest Most times I order food but sometimes I make delicious food on my own as well The pictures above are of the dishes I made and ordered last year near Diwali Happy Diwali in advance to all of you reading this post and do share your favourite Diwali experiences
