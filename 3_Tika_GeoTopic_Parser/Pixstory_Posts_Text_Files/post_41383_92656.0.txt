The antithesis of war is peace and togetherness and sports is the epitome of that. In the midst of the Russian Ukrainian struggle which has been specifically hard for Ukraine in financial and psychological terms, sports has emerged as a beacon of hope. This is an example of how if humans are killing each other right now, there are also people coming together to help those in need and establish peace among nations. 

Shakhtar Donetsk, a Ukrainian soccer club, will take part in a government-sponsored "Global Tour for Peace" to collect funds for the country's troops in the fight against Russia. 

US News reported that the reduced squad has gathered in Turkey to prepare for Saturday's season opener against Olympiakos, the Greek league leader. The games will also collect funds for Ukrainian refugees who have been displaced as a result of the conflict.

“Football diplomacy will help us involve millions of fans around the world in assisting Ukraine, which is really important,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Friday. “By this charity tour, we will continue attracting the world’s attention to Russian aggression against Ukraine and raise more funds for the Ukrainian army.”

Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, soccer clubs all over Europe have offered to play games against Ukrainian clubs and host youth players. 

The game is billed as "Football For Peace - Stop the War in Ukraine," according to Olympiakos. Tickets for the Pireaus match are 10 euros ($10.90).
