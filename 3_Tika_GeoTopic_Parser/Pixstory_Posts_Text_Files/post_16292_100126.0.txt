During a conversation at the Goafest 2022, Prakash Jha spoke about the process of filmmaking and how he would attend acting workshops to be able to communicate with the actors in their language. "I would quietly go and enrol myself as a student. And that’s how I understood an actor’s language. I have performed Shakespeare and other plays in classes, which gave me a lot of confidence," he said during ‘From Films To OTT’ segment

He then went on to criticise actors in India. "I was disgusted with actors working here in India. They don’t know what acting is about. Till date, no actor has asked me questions about shoot days, shoot timings, locations, action sequences and more. And that’s the difference between Hollywood actors and Bollywood ones. The actors there attend workshops and keep on practising and improving their art,” he said.
