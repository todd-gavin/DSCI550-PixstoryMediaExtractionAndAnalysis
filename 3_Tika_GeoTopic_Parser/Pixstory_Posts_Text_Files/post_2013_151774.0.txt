Mayor Eric Adams of New York City is in discussions with Norwegian cruise lines to harass the new influx of migrants that was sent over to New York City by Governor Abbott. The cruise line has stated that they’re currently in negotiations, but have not finalized a deal yet.This is truly sad, not just for the migrants, but also for the taxpayers of New York, who will have to see their tax money being used for a ridiculous reasons such as this. Obviously, we have to take care of people who are here – we’re not monsters. But these illegal migrants should not be here in the first place. They should not have left their homes in search of a life in America simply because they felt entitled to it. There is a process That they must go through.Having so many migrants in close quarters on a ship like that is going to be chaos. There’s no telling what types of activity will occur on that cruise ship. But what we do know, however, is that this will cost millions of taxpayer dollars and will continue to encourage more and more migrants to come to our country and seek refuge in our “sanctuary” cities.
