The World Health Organization released a statement on February 22, 2022, in connection to SARS -CoV-2 subvariants BA.1 and BA.2. 

As per the report the BA.2 subvariant should be taken into consideration and should continue to be classified as a "variant of concern." 

S.Wesley Long, MD, PHD, a researcher at Houston Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas, claimed that the subvariant is more virulent than BA.1 variant of Omicron. 

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) previously had stated that the Omicron variation caused for Covid-19 hospitalizations on weekly basis. And most of the patients were children under the age of 5 and there was a hike in the cases reported on January 8th 2022. 

The hospitalizations rates rapidly increased to five times more during the dominance of Delta variant. 

The children who were under the age of five wasn't approved on any vaccinations so they were more exposed to the virus.Â
