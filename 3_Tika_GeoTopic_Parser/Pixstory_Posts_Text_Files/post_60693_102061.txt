I am like butterfly who has different stages in life Like that I also have different ways of how I have evovled Like a butterfly first stage is caterpillar then cocoon then with wings I also have evovled as a personality I have become more enthusiastic I have become a seeker Who seeks knowledge and I also have great observer As butterfly flies it looks like a beautiful dance I am also a dancer Who has it ingraved in her heart My week can t be completed without dance How can I forget I was involved in singing Like I said I am like a butterfly who is full of enthusiasm
