A üíØ must-read, in my opinion. The book will help you better understand your own purpose in life by providing examples from both personal experience as well as from other successful people who have found their purpose. It will undoubtedly influence the way you look at life.
The book, Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life by Hector Garcia, Nicolas Feltres, and Francesc Miralles, is a great read. It includes information about the Japanese concept of ikigai, which is translated as ‚Äúa reason for living‚Äù. I was fascinated by this concept because it is so different from what I normally consider to be a life purpose.
Ikigai is not about money or power; it‚Äôs about finding something that gives you meaning and purpose in your life. The authors explain that ikigai ‚Äúisn‚Äôt about having a job with lots of money or being married with children; it‚Äôs about having an occupation that makes you happy when you look back on your life‚Äù.
I found this book very inspirational because it showed me that there are many things in life besides financial security or social status that can make us happy. It also made me think about my own career path and where I am going in life right now. The book also provides practical techniques such as meditation techniques and exercises you can do at home or work to help your mind focus on what matters most to you in life so that you can find your personal ikigai faster than before!
