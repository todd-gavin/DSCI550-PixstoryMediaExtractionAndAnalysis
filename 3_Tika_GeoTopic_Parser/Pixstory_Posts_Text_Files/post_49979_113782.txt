The Mothering Blackness BY MAYA ANGELOU She came home running back to the mothering blackness deep in the smothering blackness white tears icicle gold plains of her face She came home running She came down creeping here to the black arms waiting now to the warm heart waiting rime of alien dreams defrosts her rich brown face She came down creeping She came home blameless black yet as Hagar s daughter tall as was Sheba s daughter threats of northern winds die on the desert s face She came home blameless In The Mothering Blackness a young girl is confronted with the problem of returning home She is running home in the dark crying because she knew she did something that her mother wouldn t agree with In her journey back home she worries that her mother will not accept her She is creeping back home because she feels ashamed of what she did But the lines intended show otherwise for despite knowing what the daughter has done her mother wanting her to come back The intended lines portray their mother and daughter relationship s complicatedness and allow both their points of view to be seen The central idea of the poem focuses on the mother and daughter relationship Within the relationship the poem explores the idea of anxiety fear forgiveness comfort darkness etc The poem emphasizes on mother s love and forgiving nature Mothers though tend to forgive especially their children with open arms and tend to forget anything that has happened as long as their child is safe Source Poetry Foundation
