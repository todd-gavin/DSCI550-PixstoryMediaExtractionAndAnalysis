The Brazilian Duo Rodrygo and Marcelo paid tribute to the all-time greatest goal scorer Blancos at their Ciudad training centre. 

Cristiano Ronaldo’s “Siu” celebration is seemingly still as popular as ever at Real Madrid. 
Carlo Ancelotti’s Madrid squad are currently in the run of preparing for their home fixture against Getafe as they continue their league run for the La Liga title, fresh from their stunning 3-1 away win against the English side, Chelsea. 


Marcelo and Rodrygo were in high spirits at the club’s Ciudad training centre-ground on Friday, with the former running over to his Brazilian teammate to celebrate a goal using a move made famous by the Blancos’ all-time record goalscorer Cristiano Ronaldo, who left the club back in 2018. 


What does Ronaldo’s “Siu” celebration mean?

 The Portuguese International has always deployed an array of after goal celebrations over the years, but none has come to the point to define his goal-scoring exploits. 

Ronaldo’s trademark goal celebration sees him performing a mid-air pirouette before exclaiming “siu” which is Spanish for “Yes.” 

After Ronaldo jumps and lands the stadium normally joins the forward in roaring the word producing a booming sound, which reverberates throughout the stadium. 

Ronaldo first used this word at the 2014 Balon D’Or when he defeated his arched rival Lionel Messi and claimed the trophy under his name. Thus, producing a mix of emotions, with many left bewildered by the outburst. 

FIFA’s translator was evidently taken back by it and some of the attendees could be seen laughing at his reaction. 


“The scream? The players know I always do that shout when I score a goal or we win.” Ronaldo once said to Spanish TV.
