During an interview with Deadline, Denis
Villeneuve shared his thoughts on the academy cutting 8 categories from the live telecast:

"Honestly, I think that the Academy's throwing the baby out with the bathwater. I think it's a mistake. And I
understand that they're under tremendous pressure, but I think it isn't the right decision. The thing is that filmmaking is about a teamwork. It's like a football team. It's like you have like all different kinds of jobs that everybody needs to get the top of its game; otherwise the movie collapses, you know? It's a team effort. In the media we are a lot about the directors. We are, of course, a lot about the actors. All the people that are working in the shadows there, unfortunately, they need to be seen and to be recognized, and these award shows are made for them.
