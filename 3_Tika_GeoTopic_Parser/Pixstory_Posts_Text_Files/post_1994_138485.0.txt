A deranged man from Mississippi is making headlines due to his hijacking of a small plane and threats to crash it into a local Walmart. Fortunately, this event concluded with a safe landing and no injuries. The man's acts have not yet been attributed to a specific motive. 

It is incredibly tragic when people feel forced to do something that could cost them and others their lives. Regardless of whether this man was insane or depressed, something in his mind convinced him that the repercussions of his actions were worth taking the risk of. 

The outcome of the event was either his death, the death of others, or his imprisonment. After he began flying the airplane, there was no conclusion that would have been advantageous to him. 

We'll have to wait and learn why this man did what he did, but it's evident that law enforcement did an excellent job of calming him down and preventing him from causing any harm, especially to himself.
