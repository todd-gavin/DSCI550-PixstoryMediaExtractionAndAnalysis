Steven Stamkos, who is 32 years old and in his 14th season, is no longer one of the NHL's most prolific scorers, nor is he even his own team's second- or third-best player. 

As per US News, the six-time All-Star and two-time "Rocket" Richard Trophy winner as the league's highest goal scorer is, however, the uncontested leader of the Tampa Bay Lightning and one of the reasons the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions are four wins away from completing the first three-peat in 40 years. 

The Lightning face the Colorado Avalanche in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final on Wednesday night, after defeating the Toronto Maple Leafs, Florida Panthers, and New York Rangers to reach hockey's grandest stage for the fourth time since 2015.

“It’s not individuals. It’s great to score a couple goals in a huge game. ... But if I didn’t score and we won I would have been just as happy,” the No. 1 overall pick from the 2008 NHL draft said.

“That’s the way the guys are on our team. Each guy plays a part. And (the media) can discuss if it’s a big part or if it’s a little part,” the Lightning captain added. “We know in the room that everyone plays a huge part in our group success. That’s why we have been so successful because the guys in that room are truly like that.”
