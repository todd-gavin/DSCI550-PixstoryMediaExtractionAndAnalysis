"Angry feminist" – a term I have been linked to way too many times.

"Why are feminists so angry?" – a question we're met with over and over again.

So here's the answer –

We have been oppressed for as long as all generations can remember. You will not find one generation of women telling you that they were treated equally as their male counterparts. However, each of those generations will tell you horrific stories about how they were violated. 

We find ourselves having the same talks over and over again attempting to explain to each individual man why his bewilderment on this very basic concept is something he needs to work on. Every generation of men appears to grow up in our world bewildered by the idea that women are human beings.

Everytime you talk about women rights because, hey, women are human beings, aren't they? There's always a man coming up with excuses as to why women should stay oppressed. Sometimes they objectify us – "if we keep food out in the open, animals will come at it", sometimes they reduce us to our genitals and other times they treat us like a baby machine servant.

But everytime we express our sorrow, our anger on that? We are met with the same old "that's why women belong in the kitchen" , "that's why women should be beaten up" , "that's why women shouldn't be allowed to-".

Women's righteous anger is met with these statements, just imagine what women's mistakes are met with.

And then you ask why feminists are angry? One story of assault of a man comes and men act like women should be dead and here we are dealing with those stories everyday. Why shouldn't we be angry?
