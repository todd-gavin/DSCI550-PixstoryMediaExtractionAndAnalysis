Fun , enjoyment, development, achievement, disqualification, victories, happiness, sometimes a mixture of craziness /mischievousness/angerness /boldness and intelligence, the whole universe of knowledge and many infinite information , values, ethics, dedication and hardwork etc. There is plenty of that's type of thing which we attained or learn in offline classes now a days student are losing their chances from attaining this qualities even though online class are helping students in their academics or may be many more but still it's lacking and blocking our way to our achievement to our sucess those who have complete there education via offline classes having a greater amount of values ethics and addition of many more things in comparison to those who are still learning by now they have realised the real value of the same. May be the comparison the bias btw the two will never end but as all know the convenience the principles the values  the entertainment the path of enlightenment we learn and even can say the God have gifted us in offline mode. So no matter how far we go how digital we become how much development we have made the value the goodwill of offline classes will never fall.
