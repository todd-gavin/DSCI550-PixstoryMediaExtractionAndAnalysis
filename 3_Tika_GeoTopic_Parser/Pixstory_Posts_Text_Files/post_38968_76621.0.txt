Procrastination, the ultimate enemy of productiveness. We all have been there, being victims of procrastination and then regretting and rethinking our entire life decisions. Not being able to work in time, alway leaving chores to last moments is something we all have been guilty of. Some might say due to laziness but some might have the intense drive of perfection that they prefer to not do the task at all in fear of messing it up. It's that endless cycle of putting off work, then doing it like one's life depend in the last moment and then again regretting poor life choices. At the end of the day you feel really terrible due to not unleashing your full potential by doing half done works at the final moment. The only one who can break this vicious cycle is us. If only we decide to sort it all up and get ourselves together, we surely can overcome it. All you need is self control and thay good old drive of motivation. So stop procrastinating and find that muse.
