The Probe has accessed an exclusive copy of an internal document of the Irrigation and Flood Control Department of the Jammu and Kashmir government that exposes glaring details regarding excessive riverbed mining in Doodh Ganga, in the Budgam district of J&K. Doodh Ganga – is a tributary of the Jhelum river that flows through the Batmalu Swamp near Srinagar. 
The inspection report related to the mining activity in Doodh Ganga reveals that the Geology and Mining Department had given a mining lease to a private bidder; however, massive violations have taken place, and the region has witnessed excessive illegal mining. The riverbed materials that were supposed to have been mined in a period of 5 years were extracted within 13 months. Excessive mining and extraction of minerals without following the necessary environmental safeguards result in the degradation of the river ecosystem. But the authorities have not been able to curb the practice of excessive riverbed mining in the region.
The department’s internal document reveals that the mining undertaken in Doodh Ganga is not consistent with the approved mining plan. In March this year, the Department of Flood Control conducted an inspection of the site at Doodh Ganga after the local villagers had protested against illegal and excessive riverbed mining. 
More than five months have passed since the inspection at the site, but The Probe has learnt that the government has not acted against the private contractor so far. Though the report notes that at least 15 trucks carrying riverbed materials are dispatched every day, local sources say that close to a hundred trucks carry the mined materials from the region to different places.
