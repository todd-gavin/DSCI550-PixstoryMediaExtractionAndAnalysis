He hugged me like I’m all that he wants, I’m all that he needs and I’m all that he wished for 

His eyes sparkle with every blink, he stares at me like I’m a FIFA cup 
He knows what I want and when I want because he pays attention.

He notices my every cramp and says god bless if I sneeze or cough,
sometimes i even do fake coughs just to see him say god bless you my baby even though he knows that was a fake one 

His kisses feels like feather on my body 
His hands fits mine like puzzle pieces 
His eyes are the most comfortable to stare into and his breath is the most powerful shelter to sleep in. 

He made my kinda romcom without telling me
