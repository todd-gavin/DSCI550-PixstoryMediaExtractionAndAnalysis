Fraser Forster is all set to join Tottenham Hotspur as a free agent this summer,
according to reports.

Foster- who started his career at Newcastle has spent the past eight years at
Southampton. The 34-year-old’s contract at Saint Mary’s Stadium expires at the end of
the season. And Tottenham looking for a back-up of Hugo Lloris are ‘closing in’ on a
deal for the England international according to Daily Mail.

Well known and respected journalist Fabrizio Romano has reported on Twitter that
Foster has already reached a full agreement with Tottenham.

The former Celtic goalkeeper will move to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as a
replacement for Pierluigi Gollini, who will return to his parent club Atalanta after a loan
spell at Tottenham. The Telegraph journalist McGrath has reported that the 34-year-old
goalkeeper will undergo a medical at Tottenham this week.

The Telegraph have mentioned in their report that Forster is set ‘to undergo a medical
before completing a free transfer from Southampton.

In my opinion, it is very exciting that Tottenham are making a signing and the fans are
very excited about it. Now, of course, Fraser Forster is not exactly a player who would
make the first team better but he would push Hugo Lloris and would be a good backup
option.

Forster has had a fine career in the Premier League, while he has also previously shone
in a spell at Celtic. He also has six caps for the senior England national team under his
belt.

Tottenham will play in the Champions League next season and will also try to compete
with Liverpool and Manchester City and United, so it is good to see that they are already
starting summer business early.
