In our hypocritic society we all are labelled or judged for many irrelevant reasons One such judgement is based on beauty and body image People love to pass comments on the basis of weight gain hairfall freckles stretchmarks and list goes on As soon as you get pregnant alot of thoughts bombard your minds One of them is how to deal with stretchmarks They are caused by stretching of the abdominal skin during pregnancy They can appear bluish purplish pinkish and turn whitish You might try exotic moisturizer stretchmark oil cocoa cream lotions etc but to be frank nothing can completely eliminate them Yes definitely they will reduce by time I would definitely like to acknowledge stretchmarks as badge of honor or warrior stripes Still many women are ashamed of their stretchmarks Kindly don t compare yourself with other women Some don t get stretchmarks at all and some do It s mainly your skin type and genetics Giving birth to another individual is no less than a miracle and we should thank our bodies for being such excellent hosts for nurturing and nourishing a child within Embrace them and try to accept these beautiful stripes gracefully as they are symbol of how strong you are Don t let someone s opinion or judgement affect you ever Remember Your body is not Ruined you are a tigress who has earned her stripes More power to all the lovely mothers
