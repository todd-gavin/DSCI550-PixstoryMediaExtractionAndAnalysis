On Sunday night at ESTADIO DO ALGARVE, Fulham will continue their preparations for the 2022â€“23 season with a preseason friendly against Portuguese powerhouses Benfica.

With 74 points from 34 games and a third-place finish in Portugal's premier division, Benfica fell
17 points short of winner Porto.

David Neres, Enzo Fernandez, Joao Vitor, Alexander Bah, Petar Musa, and Mihalio Ristic are
just a few of the players who have joined Benfica this summer. However, they have also lost star
striker Darwin Nunez, who signed a lucrative contract with Liverpool.

Meanwhile, Fulham will play their first summertime friendly against Nice on Saturday night
before returning to action against Benfica the following day.

So far this summer, the Cottagers have brought in Joao Palhinha from Sporting Lisbon and Andreas Pereira from Manchester United, while their two main departures have been Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa to Napoli and Fabio Carvalho to Liverpool.

Benfica: Odysseas Vlachodimos; Alexander Bah, Joao Victor, Nicholas Otamendi, Alex Grimaldo;
