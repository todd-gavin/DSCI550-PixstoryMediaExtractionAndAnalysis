On 17 July, a 10-member police team from Saraikela Kharsawan district on the eastern border of Jharkhand arrested independent journalist Rupesh Kumar Singh, 37, from his residence in neighbouring Ramgarh district, claiming he had links with the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) or CPI (Maoist). 


The arrest warrant was issued by the sub-divisional judicial magistrate, Saraikela. It said Singh was arrested in connection with a first information report (FIR) registered at the Kandra police station of Saraikela Kharsawan. 


The FIR had been registered on 13 November 2021, after alleged Maoist leaders Prashant Bose, Sheela Marandi and four others were arrested by Jharkhand police from a toll plaza. 


An upper-caste Rajput from neighbouring Bihar who was moved by and involved in issues concerning Indiaâ€™s most disadvantaged community, its 110 million Adivasis or tribals, Singh was not among those originally accused in the case. 


Like Bose, Marandi and the other named accused, he was, three months later, charged under six sections of three laws.


The charges: sections 10 (penalty for being a member of an unlawful association) and 13 (unlawful activities) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967; sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860; and section 17 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1908.


A tall, sturdily built man who smoked Gold Flake cigarettes, smiled often and was deeply moved by injustices on Adivasis, lower castes, workers, women and other marginalised groups, Singh was the latest journalist to be arrested in a democracy where media freedom is widely regarded as being under siege. 


In recent years, independent voices in Indian media have been gradually choked, with criminal cases (here, here and here), pressure to self-censor and instances of top editors resigning or fired (here, here and here) over disagreements on such censorship by owners.
