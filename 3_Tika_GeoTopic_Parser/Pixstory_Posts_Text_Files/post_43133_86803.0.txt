Ajay Devgn's 'Rudra' set a week 1 viewership record, in terms of the figures for original content. Fans called it 'deserving' and expressed excitement for S2. Ajay Devgn recently starred in an extended cameo in the movie Gangubai Kathiawadi, and the film hit the Rs 100-crore club. The figure was not something new for the actor as he achieved this milestone in over 10 films, and some even went on to enter the Rs 200-crore club. However, there were other figures that were new for him around the same time and that too turned out to be encouraging. The Singham star made his over-The-Top debut with Rudra: The Edge of Darkness last week, and that also seemed to be on its way to success. The thriller series has gone on to become the highest-viewed series for Disney+ Hotstar. Rudra: The Edge of Darkness' feat was shared by Ajay himself on his Instagram stories. The makers had used the term 'tod fod' during the promotion of the series to highlight its 'shattering' impact on audiences and one of the episodes too had been titled the same. That was once again the term when records were broken as the 52-year-old posted a new poster of the series with the words 'viewership record ki todfod' written on it. Many netizens expressed their delight in the series' feat. One felt that it was something the team 'deserved'. Some were excited to see what happens in the life of Ajay's cop character in the second season, while others showered praises on the series and the performance of the actor
