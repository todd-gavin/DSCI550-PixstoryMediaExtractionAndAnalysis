Children are the country s future yet there is disagreement over how they should be raised Some people think they need be physically punished while others think they need to constantly be praised Before coming to a conclusion I believe that these points require careful examination First of all praise and verbal appreciation can have a magical effect on children s behaviour because when they are appreciated for good behaviour they learn the value of it and try to maintain it This is just one of the many benefits of giving children rewards They are more assured the more they overflow with compliments Conversely youngsters who experience Children who receive unnatural physical punishment on the other hand are perceived as lacking self confidence A study on children s behaviour found that youngsters who experience punishment from their parents are more aggressive and irate than other kids his age Therefore hitting a youngster will never be effective Contrarily it is undeniable that training the infamous and ferocious mind is a difficult nut to crack because it is true that rod is the only rationale for fools Additionally some kids persist in doing the same mistakes despite being warned and disciplined as a result their guardians and parents must beat them Of course excessive pampering can have negative effects on kids In the current situation parents have one or two kids and the pampering diverts them from their intended course In conclusion raising children is a huge duty because they are the sensitive buds A fair assessment of behaviour is therefore necessary for successful upbringing
