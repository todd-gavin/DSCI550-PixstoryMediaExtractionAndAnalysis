Why the timing of your morning coffee matters. ☕️ 

There's nothing like the smell of fresh
coffee brewing in the morning. But did you know that When and how you enjoy your daily cup matters?

For Hormones
Coffee stimulates cortisol production. Drinking coffee in the 60 min. after
waking - when the body is already naturally producing cortisol - can induce jitters and the “fight or flight" response.

For Digestion 

Coffee signals the production of hydrochloric acid.
If there's nothing in your stomach to
digest when the coffee shows up, that excess hydrochloric acid damages stomach lining over time.
