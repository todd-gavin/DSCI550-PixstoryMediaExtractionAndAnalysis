It is also widespread on Facebook.

Old video
Alt News broke the video into multiple keyframes and reverse-searched them on Yandex. One of the results took us to a website where a screenshot of the video was visible, although the video could not be played. It was uploaded in 2019.

The video was uploaded with a Russian caption that roughly translates to, “This is what Russian paratroopers look like.” We searched the caption on Twitter and came across a user who reshared the same video in 2016 uploaded by another user. We went to the latter’s account and found that he had tweeted the video on September 2, 2016. He claimed that it was shot in Rostov, Russia.

Facebook page ‘Made in Russia’ had also shared the same video a few days later. The page also said that the video was shot in Rostov but claimed it is from 2014.

Thus, an old video of paratroopers descending from fighter jets is circulating on social media with the false claim that it depicts Russia’s ongoing military operations in Ukraine.
