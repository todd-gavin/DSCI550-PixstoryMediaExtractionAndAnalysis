Music has been known to have a healing effect on the body and mind for centuries. It can help in yoga by providing an emotional and physical outlet, as well as promoting calm and focus.
Some people even say that music is the key to unlocking the full potential of yoga. By combining its calming effects with the stretching and strengthening exercises that are involved in yoga, music can help practitioners achieve a deeper level of relaxation and revitalization. It also helps them stay connected to their bodies, which can lead to better coordination and flow during their practices. 
Music has a calming effect on the mind and body. It can help you to focus and relax, which is essential in yoga. Additionally, music provides an emotional release, which can help reduce stress levels and tension in the body. It also helps to stimulate the nervous system and encourage deep breathing.
Lastly, music forms a connection between you and your environment. When you're listening to music while practicing yoga, it creates a sense of unity with the universe. This connection can lead to deeper levels of concentration and mindfulness during your practice.
So if you're looking for an extra edge when it comes to your Yoga practice, why not try incorporating some soothing music into your routine? It may just be what you need to take your practice further than you ever thought possible!
