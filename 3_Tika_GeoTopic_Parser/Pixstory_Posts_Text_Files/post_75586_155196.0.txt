"This year is different" - Ben White's response when asked about Arsenal's 3-2 victory over Liverpool.
And how right he is. For years now, Arsenal fans have gone into games against Liverpool, expecting to struggle and likely lose. The Liverpool team had the quality, the hunger and the threat that Arsenal just could not compete with. 
In the league, the Gunners had won just one game against the reds since 2015. That game had followed Liverpool already being confirmed Premier League winners in 2020, and truth be told, didn't mean anything to the Liverpool team.
However as Ben White said, this year is different. Arsenal and Liverpool met with the London club sitting in second place and looking to capitalise on a game in hand to retake the lead of the Premier League. Liverpool however, sat in 9th and desperately looked for a win to kick-start their season.
Many have accused Arsenal of capitalising on an 'easy fixture list' to take the early lead of the Premier League. Many were expecting the bigger clubs to knock them down a peg, or two. However, this year is different.
Arsenal raced out of the blocks, shell-shocking Liverpool and taking the lead within one minute through Gabriel Martinelli. Liverpool took some control of the game in the first half and equalised, but another counter-attack saw Bukayo Saka retake the lead for the home team.
The second half saw Liverpool equalise again, but this Arsenal team don't respond to set-backs in the same way they used to. The Gunners took complete control and rewarded with a penalty that Saka dispatched to win the game for Arsenal.
No element of fear towards high-class opposition could be sensed in Arsenal's performance. They won every dual, competed for every ball and bullied Liverpool into submission. 
In the last two weeks, Arsenal have beaten Tottenham and Liverpool, two sides who were expected to compete for the Premier League this season. This year is certainly different.
