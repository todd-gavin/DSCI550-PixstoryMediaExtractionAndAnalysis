 Shah Rukh Khan rejects Don 3. 😦

 A source close to the development revealed to the portal, “Shah Rukh Khan was offered Don 3. However, he turned it down.” Further adding, “It’s not like Shah Rukh Khan didn’t like the script. It’s just that Shah Rukh was not fully convinced. He knows Don is an iconic role and would like to step back into the character once he’s completely confident of the script. ✅👍🏻

The box office scenario is not very healthy and he wants to be doubly sure before signing on the dotted line.”👍🏻👍🏻

“As of now, Farhan Akhtar has gone back to the drawing board and we can hope that the next time he meets SRK, the superstar will happily sign Don 3. 

The fans would be on cloud nine. When the speculations around the film generated so much craze, imagine what would happen on the day the makers announce Don 3!” ❤️‍🔥🤯

Well, this indeed is heartbreaking news for all the Shah Rukh Khan and Don 3 fans.💔💔
