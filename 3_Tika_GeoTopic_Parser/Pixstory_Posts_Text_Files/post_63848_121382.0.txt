 A new Lovecraftian horror experience, Eresys alpha footage showcased nightmarish and a mysterious tentacle creature setting the mood for the disturbing experiences players may soon get to experience after the official release. 
 Developed by Ares Dragonis studio, Eresys is a cooperative project with elements of horror. Here, a group of 4 players must work as a team to survive among various creatures and misfortunes.
 In Eresys, gamers take on the role of cultists who need to close the Nether Portal that has summoned mysterious beings to our world. Players will explore forests, caves and abandoned houses, find various altars, scrolls, and other magical resources that will help in the fight against creatures. To win, you need to look for the pages lost from the book of the order, which are necessary to complete the ritual and seal the Portal of the Void.
 The ambience of the trailer immediately sets the tone as players are greeted in a dark mist-covered forest, the main setting for the game, and with Lovecraftian horrors at your back, this will be far from the most pleasant experience. The game will be released for PC on Steam, though currently has no official release date, though it will come out some time in 2023.
