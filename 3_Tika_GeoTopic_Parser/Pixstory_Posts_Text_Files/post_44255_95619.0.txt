Cristiano Ronaldo, one of the game's all-time greats, joined Real Madrid from Manchester
United in 2009 for £80 million, a then-record transfer cost. The Portuguese legend went on to
play nine seasons at the Santiago Bernabeu, breaking numerous records along the way.

During his career at Real Madrid, he won two LaLiga crowns and four Champions League
trophies, and he became the club's all-time leading scorer with 451 goals in 438 matches.

Ronaldo debuted for the club against Deportivo La Coruna in the La Liga opening on August 29,
2009. It was a fantastic start for the former Manchester United player, who scored a penalty kick
as the club began their season with a 3-2 victory over Deportivo. Raul Gonzalez and Lassana
Diarra scored the other goals.

Let's take a look at the players that were on the field with Ronaldo on his Real Madrid debut and
see where they are now:

Raul Gonzalez – FW

The great Spanish striker has the most Real Madrid caps (741) of any player in history. He
departed the club in 2010 after 16 seasons with the club, dating back to 1995. After that, he
joined Schalke and finished his career with the New York Cosmos in Major League Soccer.

Raul returned to Real Madrid in 2018 as the head coach of the club's U15 team after retiring.
He
became the coach of Real Madrid Castilla a year later.

Karim Benzema – FW

He was a product of Olympique Lyon's youth system and spent five seasons with the French
club before joining Real Madrid in 2009.

Benzema has won four Champions League and three
La Liga crowns in the last 11 years.
The French international has 279 goals in 559 appearances with Real Madrid.

Kaka – AM

Real Madrid signed the Brazilian midfielder in 2009 and he stayed for four seasons. Due to
several injuries, the former Ballon D'Or winner did not have a very successful stint with the
Spanish team. In 2013, he returned to his former club AC Milan, then in 2014, he joined Orlando
City in the United States. In 2017, Kaka announced his retirement from professional football.
