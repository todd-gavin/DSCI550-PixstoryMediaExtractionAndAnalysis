Jenna O'Hea, a former Opals captain, has spoken out against Liz Cambage's controversial Olympic withdrawal last year, claiming the WNBA star racially abused her Nigerian opponents during a heated warm-up match. 

Fox Sports reported that the highly publicised incident prompted Cambage to leave the national team, with whom she has had no contact since. The Opals performed poorly at the Tokyo Olympics, winning only one of three pool matches before being eliminated in the quarter-finals by the United States. 

After the practise game altercation delayed the Opals' Olympic campaign, Basketball Australia conducted an independent investigation and issued a formal reprimand, though no suspension or penalties.

Speaking on ABC’s Offsiders, O’Hea was visibly uncomfortable speaking about the moment but confirmed host Kelli Underwood’s assertion. “This all started in that training game, or in the pre-Olympics game, when you played Nigeria,” Underwood opened. 

“And it’s never really emerged what happened, but I’ve had it confirmed from a few sources, is it correct that you were playing Nigeria and Liz Cambidge had her feathers ruffled and she turned to them and said ‘Go back to your third world country’.

Any racist remarks, especially in the field of sports should be vehemently opposed.
