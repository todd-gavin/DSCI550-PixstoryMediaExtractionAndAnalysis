Priyanka Chopra may be one of the biggest stars in Hollywood as well but she's still a 'desi' girl at heart and her new Instagram story is proof of that. The actress who was at her LA home for the Memorial Day Weekend shared a story on her Instagram that consisted of the gorgeous view from her home and a Bollywood song playing in the background.

In Priyanka's story, the Bollywood track "Choli ke peeche kya hai" could be heard playing at a distance presumably at some weekend bash. Sharing the music and the views from her home, the actress questioned, "Why wasn't I invited?" Even as Priyanka may have move to the US, the actress is known to still boast of a brilliant Bollywood playlist that she always enjoys listening to.
