Fiorentina coach Vincenzo Italiano spoke to Sky Sport after the victory against Atalanta The bar has risen because finishing a match in great balance against a great team like Atalanta is always a great satisfaction I think this balance has been broken by a nice goal We could have scored another one Koopmeiners had a great ball and this is a game that whoever scores the goal wins We are happy and we are growing Playing on an equal footing against Atalanta a satisfaction Piatek I must say I am amazed but a boy who compared to the others two who arrived in January knows the language and Serie A He is now making himself available in an exemplary way despite not being used to some situations The goals pay him back for the overtime he is doing I am happy with what we are showing in terms of points They are arriving because the performances are of a level and our work is repaid When we lost Vlahovic I was afraid that the wingers would not score and that he was the only offensive end but then clinging to our identity we are demonstrating that with other guys and with real professional players all of this can continue Working on an equal footing with teams that make the difference in Italy means that the work is coming out
