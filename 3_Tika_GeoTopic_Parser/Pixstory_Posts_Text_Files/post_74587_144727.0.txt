She told  "I think shaadi... shaadi ho jaegi iss saal. Kar lenge kisi tarah se (We will get married this year, will marry somehow). We're very excited to get married but just worried about Covid and want to be responsible. Don't want to be in the news for the wrong reasons. Plus, we've both gotten really, really busy when stuff opened up, and work resumed at full pace. So I'm saying we have to like do a live production job of taking combination dates and making this happen this year." 🙏🙏🙏🙏On the work front, Richa is currently busy with Heeramandi, and Ali is shooting for Mirzapur 3. However, reportedly, the couple will wrap up their shoot schedules by end of this month, so they can later concentrate on the preparations for their big day. 😱😍The guest list is not yet out, but both Richa and Ali have worked with many big names in the film industry, so of course, everyone is expecting that many Bollywood celebs might be attending the wedding.
