YouTube Shorts, the short-form rival to TikTok on the video platform, is introducing an ad revenue sharing model that will pay artists a 45 percent cut based on their proportion of overall Shorts views. Hollywood Reporter said that Shorts commercials, in contrast to regular YouTube video ads, are shown in between videos and are not always related to the content of a particular artist. According to Neal Mohan, YouTube's chief product officer, the Shorts revenue sharing programme, which will launch in early 2023, will pool together all of YouTube's Shorts ad revenue. The payout will go toward creators and covering the costs of music licencing.
