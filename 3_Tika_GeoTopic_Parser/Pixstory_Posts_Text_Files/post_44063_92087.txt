Ex Manchester United and Everton Legend Wayne Rooney has been in the studios quite a but this past week His comments about Paul Pogba s wasted potential sparked a few stories not long ago Now his thoughts on former teammate Cristiano Ronaldo have got people talking again I think he s scored goals he s scored important goals in the Champions League early on in the season he scored the hat trick against Tottenham but I think if you re looking to the future of the club you have to go with younger hungry players to do the best and lift Manchester United over these next two or three years Rooney highlights the year old s early season heroics under Ole Gunnar Solksj r but says It s important for the United hierarchy to look at the bigger picture Obviously Cristiano is getting on a bit he certainly isn t the player he was when he was in his s and that happens that s football He s a goal threat but the rest of the game they need more they need young hungry players Rooney suggests investing time and resources into the depths of United s academy players and the other younger talents they ve got is the way to go Interim manager Ralf Ragnick s decision to leave forward Marcus Rashford on the bench against Leicester City last Saturday despite other strikers unavailable didn t impress many but it didn t come off as much of a surprise either It is a two way story with United s struggling youngsters Consistency is key and when they struggle to find breakthrough into the first team it asks questions about the manager s policies and where the club is headed to Rooney s comments on the ageing Portuguese also seem to come off as spicy and get the media talking but at the base of it it is the unspoken truth at Manchester United That seems to become more and more obvious as the season goes on For all of Ronaldo s clutch heroics he isn t Old Trafford s future
