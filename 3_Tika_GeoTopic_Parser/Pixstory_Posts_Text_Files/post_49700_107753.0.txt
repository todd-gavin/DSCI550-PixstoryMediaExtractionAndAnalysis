We have a  Senate history of more than 230years and its the first time two rooms were formally named last week in honour of women: Barbara Mikulski, who retired at the end of 2016 as the longest-serving female senator, and the late Margaret Chase Smith (R-Maine), the first woman to win election to the House and the Senate, and who stood up to McCarthyism in the 1950s.

The patriarchy exists well throughout the Capitol, where there are roughly 540 rooms, 25 of them named to honour or of a historic figure.

 Before these two Senate rooms were named, just two on the House side were named after women: Gabrielle Giffords, the Democratic lawmaker who was shot in a 2011 mass shooting in the Tucson area, and Lindy Boggs.

Barbara Mikulski demanded they build a much bigger women’s room, which they did. Now, 24 women serve in the Senate, among 58 throughout U.S. history the former senator is the first woman to serve in that role — 46 previous vice presidents have their busts exhibited in and around the Senate chamber as a nod to their role as president of the Senate.

 Two former vice presidents, recently departed Mike Pence and President Biden, will join them, and Harris eventually will be the first female bust to be dedicated and displayed on the second floor of the Senate.

Mikulski used more colourful language when speaking to other women about working together for bigger change — for instance, during an equal-pay debate in 2012.

“Put on your lipstick, square your shoulders, suit up, and let’s fight for a new American revolution,” she said.
