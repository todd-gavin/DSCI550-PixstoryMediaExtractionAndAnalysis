For the first time, the Islamic Republic of Iran Radio broadcast a women's football match live with the voice of a female reporter
The Iranian newspaper Shahrvand has reported that for the first time a women's football match was broadcast live in full with the voice of a female reporter on the Islamic Republic of Iran Radio.
Paniz Farhanak reported the matches of football teams Khatun Bam and Sogdiana of Uzbekistan in the Asian Club Cup.
Referring to the first experience of reporting a football game, Paniz Farhanak said that contrary to his expectations, the expert was not present in the studio and did not have the list of players of the two teams. He told Shahrvand newspaper: "I realized that I have to talk and report the game for 90 minutes without interruption."
This reporter added: I was very stressed for the first 5 minutes and there was a certain tremor in my voice, but I tried not to reach the audience. However, my stress gradually decreased and I came to my senses and saw that I had reported a football match live on air.
The first leg match between Khatun Bam and Sogdiana of Uzbekistan in the Asian Women's Football Club Cup ended with a 1-1 draw on Saturday.
