 Abstract Background Emerging evidence showed metformin may have pleiotropic effects on ameliorating depression However whether metformin was associated with decreased risk of depression remains unclear Methods A historical cohort study was conducted based on a medical claim database from to in Beijing China Patients newly diagnosed with T D were classified into the metformin and non metformin groups according to their initial antidiabetic prescription The incidences of depression between the groups were compared using Cox proportional regression model Results There were and T D patients in the metformin and non metformin groups The mean age was SD years and were females With a median follow up of years patients developed depression The adjusted incidence of depression in the metformin group CI per person years was significantly lower than in the non metformin group CI per person years P lt The metformin group significantly associated with a lower risk of depression compared with the overall non metformin group HR CI as well as compared with glucosidase inhibitors HR CI sulfonylureas HR CI and glinides HR CI except for thiazolidinediones HR CI The association between metformin and lower depression risk was significant in all the age and sex subgroups Conclusions Metformin was associated with a lower risk of depression compared with other oral hypoglycemic agents indicating a potential pleiotropic effect on depression Sources
