When the Pharaohs face the Lions of Teranga later this month, they will look to the Reds star for inspiration.

Egypt coach Carlos Queiroz has named his final 23-man squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup play-off against Senegal, which includes regulars such as Mohamed Salah, Mohamed El-Shennawy, and Mohamed Elneny.

Mostafa Mohamed, who is based in Turkey, was named to the squad alongside VFB Stuttgart's Omar Marmoush and Pyramids defender Omar Gaber.

Ahmed Hegazi, Akram Tawfik, Ramadan Sobhi, and Mohamed Hany, on the other hand, did not make the cut due to injury concerns.

Another exclusion is Yeni Malatyaspor star Karim Hafez, who has returned to the national team setup following a March 2019 international match against Niger in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers.
The World Cup qualifying game provides an opportunity for the Pharaohs to return to winning ways after being defeated on penalties by Senegal in the Afcon 2021 final.

Queiroz's team will host the reigning African kings at Cairo International Stadium on March 25 before travelling to the Diamniadio Olympic Stadium four days later.

Coach Aliou Cisse recently downplayed his team's chances ahead of the big game against Egypt.

"This double confrontation with Egypt, the team that we have just beaten in the Afcon final on penalties promises to be tough and very difficult," Cisse said in a press conference via Foot Mercato.

"We are champions of Africa, but we are not favourites, because the statistics say that all the teams that have been African champions have not qualified for the World Cup.

"It's another competition, we will do everything to qualify. Professional football, high-level football does not only feed on the past. Today, we are facing two very important dates for Senegalese football."
