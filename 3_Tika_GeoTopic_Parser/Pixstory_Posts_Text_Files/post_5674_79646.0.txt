Lata Mangeshkar, for whom the description playback singer is something of an understatement, died on Sunday. She was 92. A funeral with state honours will be held this evening. Ms Mangeshkar was taken to the intensive care unit on January 8 after testing positive for COVID-19. Lata Mangeshkar was also being treated for pneumonia. Over the next few weeks, Ms Mangeshkar showed signs of improvement. However, on Saturday, hospital authorities said that Lata Mangeshkar had been put back on the ventilator after her health deteriorated.
