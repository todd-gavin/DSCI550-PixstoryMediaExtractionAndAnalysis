On Tuesday, following the star Ezra Miller's felony burglary charge, fans of the impending superhero film "The Flash" urged Warner Bros. Discovery drop the film.

The alleged incident occurred on May 1 and involved the theft of several bottles of alcohol from a local home in Stamford, Vermont. According to sources, police were directed to Miller, 29, after reviewing security videos.

Miller, who plays Barry Allen aka The Flash, has demonstrated a pattern of unsettling conduct this year, including claims of grooming young girls in a cult-like setting, according to The Washington Post.
Miller faces a felony charge. Monday prompted a Twitter frenzy, just days after Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav cited "The Flash" as crucial to the company's strategy for large superhero movies.

One fan questioned why Warner Bros. hasn't yet dropped #TheFlash after all the grooming and sexual assault claims against him and this recent news.
