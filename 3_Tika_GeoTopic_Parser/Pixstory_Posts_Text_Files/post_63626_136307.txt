Watching the gameplay trailer of Flintlock The Siege of Dawn we get a more than proper look at the action adventure RPG created by A Games Another Souls inspired game the game features a strong story driven narrative with a combat system that can best be described as a merge of Elden Ring and God Of War The combat is lifted right off the Dark Souls play book a well timed dodge roll is followed by a few aggressive strikes and then a patient wait for an attack that can be parried First displayed at Gamescom the five minute gameplay video shows off the meaty hatchet combat and how the flintlock pistol fits into the flow When nearing death enemies appear to glow like in the modern Doom games and catching them in that window delivers a God of War like finisher The flintlock pistol can also be used to deal standard damage but it does look cooler as a combo ender and to finish off staggered enemies Indeed we even saw it utilized as an opener rather than a finisher which comes in handy when closing the distance to enemies at range Interestingly enough enemies appear to change their tactics during the fight depending on their loadout For instance one enemy becomes more aggressive when they lose the shield which is definitely cool to see not to mention adds a little bit of variety
