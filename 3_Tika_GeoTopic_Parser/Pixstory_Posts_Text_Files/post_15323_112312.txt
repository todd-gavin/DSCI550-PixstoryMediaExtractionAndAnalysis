Today and tomorrow we celebrate the National Enpa Day against abandonment with the volunteers of the association engaged in over Italian squares to raise awareness of the issue of abandonment today more delicate than ever The slogan of this year&#39;s Enpa campaign With you Always a concept that should taken for granted when you welcome an animal into the family but which unfortunately turns out to be just a dream for the many too many abandoned four-legged friends mainly summer but which in this period, near the arrival of the holidays and after the arrival of spring, becomes increasingly critical Only in the last two weeks have been abandoned and recovered by the Enpa more than puppies of which in Calabria, Sicily and Sardinia Negative record for Reggio Calabria where in one day Enpa recovered puppies Even at the Center we have an increase in puppies only this week Enpa recovered puppies in Ciociaria Gruesome stories of small puppies left to die on the street or in the countryside under the sun of hunger and of thirst Stories that unite different regions of Italy but which are even more present in the South of our country where effective prevention and sterilization policies are absent
