The Ulsoor lake which is also known as the Halasuru lake named after the locality it s based in is a lake with history in its depth I had to include the ulsoor lake in my photography assignment because an album about Bangalore is incomplete without it I have been visiting this lake from a young age and it has always been a great spot for walks It was built as a water supplying tank in the th century by Kempegowda I and subsequently developed by his successors Lord Bowring the then chief commissioner of Mysore developed the tank and expanded the area in the th century as well The tank covers several acres of land and is a popular spot among the residents for morning and evening walks It s also a great place if you just want to sit and reflect somewhere I often go there just to sit and enjoy the view Sadly the entire lake has become polluted over the years The lake is also popular for idol immersions and the materials which do not biodegrade have made the lake toxic in the past decade Climate change has also impacted the biodiversity around the lake Measures have been taken to ensure that the lake is preserved and not polluted anymore than it already is As of now idol immersions have been restricted to a small area near the lake and actions against polluters have been put in place However legal measures are not enough to protect it Residents also need to put in maximum efforts to not pollute the lake in any way or form This place will always be a source of comfort to me and I really hope it doesn t change more than it already has Do you have a place like this in your city Do you like to go for walks there
