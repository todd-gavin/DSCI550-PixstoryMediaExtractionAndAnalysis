The population of big cats like lions tigers and leopards is declining because they are losing their habitat due to deforestation and poaching Lions are currently listed as vulnerable on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature IUCN Red List of Threatened Species In some parts of Africa lions are classified as critically endangered because lion populations are still plummeting at an unprecedented rate Deforestation contributes to the reduction of lion populations by making it difficult for them to find favorable conditions to live in Poachers also kill lions for their bodies or their valuable fur which is then sold on the black market Tigers are globally listed as Endangered on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature IUCN Red List of Threatened Species The Malayan and Sumatran sub species are listed as Critically Endangered Wild tigers are hunted to meet the demands of the billion a year illegal wildlife market The primary reason for this decline is habitat loss and poaching Tigers are especially threatened by deforestation because it makes it harder for them to find food and water They also suffer from hunting because their fur is prized on the black market Leopards are doing relatively well currently thanks largely to conservation efforts by various governments and organizations However they too face threats from deforestation and poaching which has led to a decrease in their population
