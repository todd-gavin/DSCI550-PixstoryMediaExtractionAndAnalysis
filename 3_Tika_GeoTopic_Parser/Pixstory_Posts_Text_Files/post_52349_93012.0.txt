Following the Covid-19 crisis, the City of Sydney has released an update to its long-term strategic plan: Sustainable Sydney 2030-2050. Continuing the Vision

The plan will guide the City's path beyond the pandemic, assisting the city to recover and thrive anew with more space for people, improved transportation, better access to the harbour and cultural identity, increased greenery, and climate action.

Lord Mayor Clover Moore stated that the vision builds on Sustainable Sydney 2030, which has guided the City's efforts to make Sydney a greener, more connected, affordable, and equitable city for more than a decade.
"All successful cities have long-term plans to ensure their economies and communities prosper, business invests with confidence, and all governments work together to provide essential infrastructure and services," the Lord Mayor said.

Making Room for Culture
To ensure the long-term future of creative workers and Sydney's cultural vibrancy, we must take a proactive and innovative approach to making space for culture and creativity. Making space for culture is a two-pronged strategy for creating and preserving cultural and creative space in Sydney â€“ precinct revitalization around existing cultural assets, and the establishment of a creative land trust to create more cultural production space.
