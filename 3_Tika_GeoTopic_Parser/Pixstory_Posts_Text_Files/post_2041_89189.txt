Two thoughts come to mind her poise and demeanor in how she answered the intense questions reflect well on her and her character I saw authenticity there and a sincere desire to pursue the law Sure she isn t conservative But she sees and understands the weight of the position she s been called to hold Republicans on the right couldn t help themselves Clearly they re using this stage to fundraise I was disappointed by Senators such as Sen Blackburn They know better and it appeared this was a political scoring exercise Maybe I m naive to think both parties can and should rise above that particularly when a candidate holds such high regard Today may be and feel even more desperate from Republicans as they know their time to accuse her is waning Either way the public isn t watching this closely and maybe that helps everyone involved
