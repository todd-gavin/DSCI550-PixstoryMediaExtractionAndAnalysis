According to numerous sources, James Harden formally agreed to a two-year contract with the Philadelphia 76ers and will earn $14.5 million less next season than he would have under his prior agreement. On July 27, the group made the previously rumoured deal official. He will receive just under $68 million in total, including $33 million this season and a $35 million player option for the 2023â€“24 campaign. Last month, Harden exercised his $47.4 million option for the upcoming season but refused it because he wanted to give the 76ers flexibility to make roster improvements and contend for a championship. "I want to be here," she said. I want to succeed here, and I believe we have what it takes.
