Dorothea Wierer&#39;s Winter Olympics in Beijing closed with a disappointing th place in the women&#39;s biathlon mass start The South Tyrolean made a lot of mistakes at the shooting range well mistakes and finished more than behind the winner Braidaz Bouchet Wierer concludes this Olympic expedition with a bronze and track her personal balance it was a very tiring very demanding Olympics from the slow snow to the temperatures and the wind We saw so many girls who struggled it wasn&#39;t easy to manage and we were also lucky to find races with less wind than we expected I&#39;m happy with the medal, let&#39;s say it was very, very hard here in Beijing Speaking of future goals, the blue class questioned its presence at the next Winter Olympics scheduled in Italy Every athlete&#39;s dream is to do the Olympics at home but you have to be realistic I don&#39;t know if we will get there We still have three weeks of the world cup in which I can compete for the specialty cup in the mass start and I would still like to confirm myself in the top positions of the general classification then at the end of the season with bowls still I will think about it
