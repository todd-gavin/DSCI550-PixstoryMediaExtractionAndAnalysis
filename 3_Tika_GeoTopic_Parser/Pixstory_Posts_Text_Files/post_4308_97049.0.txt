Hello everyone!

Last night we were in Varanasi, India. 

We experienced a ceremony prayer for everyone who has passed away and everyone around the world. It’s part of the world that wants peace and love throughout the world. We joined in prayers for everyone who we don’t know, people who we do know...we  prayed for peace.
