Marcelo Montoya has been suspended for four games after using a homophobic slur during a game After being charged with contrary conduct the year old pleaded guilty to the NRL judiciary on Tuesday night The incident occurred on Friday night when he made a slur directed at Cowboys player Kyle Feldt Montoya will not play again until round when his team plays the Rabbitohs Obviously things are said on the football field in the heat of the moment and I completely understand and accept that the word I used is unacceptable Montoya explained It s completely out of character for me It was unquestionably a poor choice of words I had no intention of offending anyone especially Kyle Feldt It was just a word that came out in the heat of the moment I used the word to irritate him or to get under his skin It was never used to refer to his sexuality I am not a homophobe and gay people are valued in our community That is my stance I accept full responsibility for that and I am prepared for whatever comes next
