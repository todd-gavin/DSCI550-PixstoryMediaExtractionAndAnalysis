Now the smell At one point in the movie Da Song runs over to Ki Tek and shoves his nose in his leg He runs over to Chung Sook and shoves his nose in her belly starling her greatly When the Park family s young son notices that all the Kims smell the same he s unknowingly threatening to reveal their true identities But beyond serving a function in the plot smell is used as a symbol It represents the poverty that the Kims and particularly Kai Tek can t escape But rather than simply introducing a symbol and utilizing it once symbols can be repeated and even manipulated over time In one scene A short barely standing drunk man is relieving himself in the corner Ki woo jumps up He grabs the stone and walks toward the door Seeing the symbol of the stone again reminds us of its original meaning his aspiration for wealth and status But when we first saw it Ki Woo had no prospects now his family are on their way to achieving their goal The next time we see the rock however Ki Woo s aspirations are in jeopardy After the Park family nearly discovers their true identities the Kims return to their basement and find it completely flooded Something touches his foot in the water He bends over and reaches into the murky depths eventually finding the stone that Min Hyuk gave the family as a gift Ki Woo pants heavily as he hugs the rock It s like he just found a precious treasure Again we remember what it once meant And now as Ki Woo clutches it to his chest we see how he is desperately clinging to this goal that is slipping away This recurrence has created a motif one that externalizes Ki Woo s inner feelings about wealth and status The symbol of smell becomes a motif as well After it s introduced as a representation of the poverty Ki Tek cannot escape from that idea is reinforced over and over again Ki Tek Ki Woo and Ki Jung can do nothing but silently take hit after hit The Kim family s relationship with poverty and the invisible line that separates them is explored throughout the film using the motif of smell
