Medical bodies and hundreds of UK doctors have joined forces to protest against climate damage by calling for an immediate halt to new oil and gas exploration.

In a joint letter to the prime minister they also urge the government to end the country’s dependence on fossil fuels to tackle the climate crisis and fuel poverty, citing the health impacts of both, and to deliver a clean future with affordable energy for everyone.

The letter is signed by institutions with a combined membership of more than 250 000 including the BMA and the Royal Colleges of Physicians, Paediatricians, Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and Psychiatrists, as well as more than 600 individual health professionals.

In May last year International Energy Agency said no new oil, gas or coal development if world is to reach net zero by 2050. 
Governments must close gap between net zero rhetoric and reality, the agency said . 

Exploitation and development of new oil and gas fields must stop this year and no new coal-fired power stations can be built if the world is to stay within safe limits of global heating and meet the goal of net zero emissions by 2050. 
In its strongest warning yet on the need to drastically scale back fossil fuels, the International Energy Agency (IEA) also called for no new fossil-fuel cars to be sold beyond 2035, and for global investment in energy to more than double from $2tn (£1.42tn) a year to $5tn (£3.54tn) The result would not be an economic burden, as some have claimed, but a net benefit to the economy.
