Paris Saint-Germain are in contact with Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford as they look ahead to a possible summer move, according to reports.

The forward has struggled for form this season and has often found himself out-of-favour at Old Trafford this season amid competition from the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Jadon Sancho, Anthony Elanga and Edinson Cavani.

He did, however, score a late winner against West Ham last time out, just his second Premier League goal of the season.

As reported by the Daily Mail, French giants PSG are hoping to bring the England international to the club as they look set to lose Kylian Mbappe on a free transfer in the summer.

The report adds that Rashford is ‘seduced’ by the idea of linking up with the likes of Neymar and Lionel Messi at PSG.

It also adds that PSG have held long-term interest in Rashford and had considered the winger in the summer if Mbappe had joined Real Madrid.

Elsewhere, former Manchester United and Everton forward Wayne Rooney has revealed he turned down an the opportunity of an interview at Everton as they look for a new manager.

He said at a Rams press conference on Friday afternoon: “Everton approached my agent and asked me to interview for the vacant job, which I turned down.”

“I believe I will be a Premier League manager. I believe I’m ready for that, 100 per cent. And if that is with Everton one day in the future that would be absolutely great.

“But I’ve got a job here that I’m doing at Derby County which is an important job to me.”

He admitted he had to think long and hard about the offer.

“They got in touch with my agent, my agent let the administrators know as well, and yes of course it was a difficult decision for me (to turn it down),” Rooney said.

Frank Lampard, Duncan Ferguson and Vitor Pereira are now the front runners for the role with a decision expected to be made in the coming days on who will be Rafa Benitez replacement.
