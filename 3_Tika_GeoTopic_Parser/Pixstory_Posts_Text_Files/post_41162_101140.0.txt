While accounting may seem like a boring profession, it’s vital to every business out there. Without accountants, people won’t get paid promptly nor be able to understand their debits and credits. Even with an accountant, these can still be hard to understand. Accounting is work that isn’t something many people enjoy.

International Accounting Day is all about promoting the accounting profession. It seeks to give people the opportunity to network among their colleagues and aims to provide the opportunity to continue education for those interested in the industry.
It is also a great day to celebrate the role of an accountant. 

After all, no matter whether you run your own business or you are a sole trader, it is likely that you have required the services of an accountant at some point or that you will need their services in the future. From filing tax returns to ensuring business accounts are up-to-date; accounts play a critical role in the financial security of companies all over the world.

Of course, International Accounting Day is not only about those who are already in the profession, but it is also a day that is important for anyone who is looking to get involved in the accounting industry. There are a lot of great opportunities in this industry, and there is always going to be the need for accountants, so this is certainly a good sector to get involved in.
