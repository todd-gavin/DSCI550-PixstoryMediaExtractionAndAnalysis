8 Bundesliga titles, 1 UCL, 1 UEFA Super Cup,1 club World cup,3 DFB- Pokal, and many countless accolades, that's Robert Lewandowski for you. He is the best number 9 in the world behind Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. He is moving to Barcelona after so many intense rumors, with the player openly stating his desire to play for the Catalans. Barcelona sealed the deal for 50 million. The 33-year-old has scored 500 goals for the club and his country.


In 2015, he is known for scoring 5 goals in a single match under the leadership of Pep Guardiola. That’s his attacking prowess. 


Looking at his season heatmap, we can see that he has operated in the opposition box. 

Barcelona looked feeble with an attacking front with the departure of their legend to Paris Saint Germain. They tried to replace him with Memphis Depay, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, and the young crops but they weren’t able to. They turned their sight from Bundesliga to Bayern Munich where a certain Number 9 was plundering goals for fun. He scored 35 goals this season.


He was the top scorer in Bundesliga and the top 5 leagues. He scores goals for fun. Since he made his switch from their rivals Dortmund to Bayern he has been a revelation for them.

From the visualization, we have compared players who have scored more than 15 goals. We can see that Lewa is head and shoulders above them with Cristiano Ronaldo coming last with 18 goals and Kylian Mbappe coming second with 28 goals to his name. What needs to be taken into consideration is he scored at the age of 33. Players usually wane past 30 barring Ronaldo and Messi but he’s going strong. Is it too early to compare him to the 3rd goat after CR7 and Messi? 


He’s a poacher as he has taken a total of 127 shots and was able to convert 77 of them. He has made shots 4.34 per 90 and was on target 2.17 times per 90. It takes it to 99 percentile apiece. He ranks in the top quadrant. Head and shoulders ahead of the rest of the players.
