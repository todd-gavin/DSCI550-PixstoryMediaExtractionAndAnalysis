[picked this question up from a movie. I will never have a response for it, but here’s what I typed into my notes app]

queerness is overflowing. it will move along before I can cup it in my hands to show you what it means to me. it’s the consistent tug and pull in a time continuum and dissolves before it can create itself. the past has lost all meaning but lives through every moment of the present. the future is in the present too, through the hopelessness of momentarily joy and growing grief. it’s the comfort in redefining being complete as being incomplete in persistent longing to find missing pieces of my puzzle. it’s the hope in knowing that I’m not where I want to be with the simultaneous hopelessness in knowing that I’m not where I want to be. it’s the confidence in multitudes that can’t be contained and the fear in being stuck. it doesn’t belong to me and isn’t for me to define. but it’s the only way I recognize myself. it’s to be living in death and to grapple with the death of living.
