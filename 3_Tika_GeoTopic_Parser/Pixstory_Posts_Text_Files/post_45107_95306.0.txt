Manchester City have been through a rough couple of weeks. Since the season entered It's
business end, the Cityzens have been in fine form. When quizzed about his team's physical
status ahead of a home game against Brighton, Pep Guardiola had a few things to say.

"I like to work with a big squad, in my experience, I’ve lived it many years in my life as I’ve
been in top clubs, we arrive here fighting many times. If you want to fight you have to be fit,"
he said.

City boast one of the deepest squads in the world, consisting of a wide range of talent in all
departments but one (centre forward).

"10 days [we played], Atletico, Liverpool, Atleti, Liverpool for many players after an international break. 25 or 27 players, I don’t like it. I prefer 16, 17, 18 all fit, otherwise it’s
difficult to handle it. I live that, in previous seasons, we fought and we won and we were
there, at the end of the season the desire is there, we were close.

City's intensity has rarely ever dropped, and they continue to amaze.

"If it’s not a specific game, it’s the next one and the next one, you might not have five or four
days, you have three, with travel. Our physios made 71 treatments between Atleti and the
semi-final. 71, it's true. When they come and say Kyle [Walker] is ready but didn’t play much
minutes, you can handle it that’s why it was more difficult, but you tell me how you compete."

Having played both Atlético Madrid and Liverpool twice in the space of two weeks, Guardiola
believes his physios and backroom staff have a lot to take credit for. They remain still, in the
midst of a two-way title race and with a Champions League tie against Real Madrid to boot.

71 injury treatments and counting.
