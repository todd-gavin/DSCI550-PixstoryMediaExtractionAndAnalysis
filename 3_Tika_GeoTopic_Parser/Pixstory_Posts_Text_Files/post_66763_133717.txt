 Sometimes you stay up late with a book because it s just that great and you can t bear to put it down other times you find yourself up late because you just want this PoS book out of your life as soon as possible Like a lot of people right now I picked up Split Second because it s recently been made into a TV show and I was interested in checking out the source material Usually the visual media conversion of a book comes off the poorer in any comparison but after having read the book I have to say that every change the production company has made has come off as genius in comparison to the poorly written illogical mess that is Split Second It s one of those books that s not just bad it s boring I want to call the prose workmanlike but honestly I ve read a lot of myster thrillers it s a genre that generally lends itself to fairly functional storytelling and the prose in Split Second was clunkier and less inspired than its peers The characters were flat uninteresting and felt a bit too much like Baldacci s wish fulfillment Related to this I hated how he wrote Maxwell and the other major female character Joan Dillinger both separately and together The plot such as it was was just painful to get through Some of this is a style issue On the one hand Baldacci gives out information and really obvious information at that and then spends the next dozen pages having the characters verbally rehash what just happened On the other hand he plays annoyingly coy with any all the information that would actually let the reader put the pieces together in a way that I more commonly associate with YA where the author tells you that the character s has found or concluded something but doesn t bother to tell you what it is I personally don t like those types of mysteries it always feels as though the author isn t playing fair with the reader and that the story and or storyteller isn t good enough to play fair
