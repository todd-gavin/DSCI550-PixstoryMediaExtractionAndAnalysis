Scooby doo's Velma comes out of the closet, google celebrates
The forthcoming scooby doo film, trick or treat scooby doo confirms that detective Velma Dinkley is a lesbian as she is seen crushing over Coco Diablo, a new character in a video that has went viral on twitter. The lgbtqia+ folks as well as pop culture enthusiasts have taken the revelation very positively and made numerous tweets about this that gained millions of likes. Google has paid its tribute in support of Velma coming out by adding confetti alongside pride and lesbian flags over the search page. One may ask, why is everyone so excited about a "cartoon character" (fictional) coming out of the closet? Well the answer to this is normalisation of queer characters in pop culture has been long due. The creators of the show were in a constant struggle to freely express this identity of Velma but the production studio was simply not ready for it. Now that our very own Velma has finally been able to come out and become the icon of queer representation in pop culture and mainstream media, we can hope to see more queer stories make a smoother entry on your screens.Â
