Prior to the Artemis I mission, which is scheduled to launch no early than August 29, NASA plans to move its Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and the Orion spacecraft to the launchpad on August 18. To announce the science and technological payloads that will launch on the space agency's Artemis I test voyage to the moon, three teleconferences will be held by the space agency the following week. NASA will live webcast the teleconferences and the rolling of the spacecraft.

The first in a line of more difficult flights to the moon, Artemis I will be an unmanned flight test. The SLS rocket will launch ten "CubeSats," or shoebox-sized payloads, along with a number of additional science exploration payloads during Artemis I. Each payload will conduct scientific and technological investigations in deep space, advancing knowledge of lunar science, technological advancements, and deep-space radiation.

NASA will be live streaming audio briefings so that you may learn more about the project. 

The Space Launch System (SLS) and Orion spacecraft will be moved to Launch Pad 39B at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on August 18 as planned. This YouTube link will provide live streaming of the occasion: https://youtu.be/21X5lGlDOfg
