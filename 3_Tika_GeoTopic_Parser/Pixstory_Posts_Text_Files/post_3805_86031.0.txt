Women have been coming forward on various platforms talking about ways how men can do their part and make the streets a safe place for women at all times. 

Some popular conducts suggested by women for men were- 
•	Cross the street to avoid walking behind a woman. Give all women space. Never run close to them when jogging, especially in the dark.
•	If a woman is walking towards you, let her stay in her path and get out of her way rather than making her move.
•	Don’t strike up random conversation with a woman in an empty space. If women ignore men, they worry that they will get aggressive. If they engage, they worry that men will think ‘you’re in’. If SHE strikes up conversation, fine, otherwise leave her alone.
•	 If you witness even low-key harassment, call it out. Everyone pretends not to notice the creeps making women uncomfortable. It only emboldens them & normalises the behaviour.
