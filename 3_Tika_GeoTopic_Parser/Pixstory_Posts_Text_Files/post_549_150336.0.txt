While many countries in the West are still debating whether woman can have the right to abortion of a feotus. The Supreme Court in India has given a landmark judgement giving a woman right to abort an unwanted pregnancy irrespective of her marital status. The Apex Court said sexual assault by husbands can take the form of rape and the meaning of rape must include the meaning of marital rape under the MTP Act and Rules for the purposes of abortion.â€œmarital status of a woman can't be ground to deprive her right to abort unwanted pregnancy. Single & unmarried women have right to abort under Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act & rules till 24 weeks of pregnancy."Distinction between married and unmarried women under abortion laws is artificial, constitutionally unsustainable, SC said.SC grants abortion right to unmarried women, acknowledges marital rape. "Married women may also form the part of the class of survivors of sexual assault or rape. The ordinary meaning of the word rape is sexual intercourse with a person without consent or against their will. Regardless of whether such forced intercourse occurs in the context of matrimony, a woman may become pregnant as a result of non-consensual sexual intercourse performed upon her by her husband," SC said in its order.Source -news agencies Photo credit -Her zindagi
