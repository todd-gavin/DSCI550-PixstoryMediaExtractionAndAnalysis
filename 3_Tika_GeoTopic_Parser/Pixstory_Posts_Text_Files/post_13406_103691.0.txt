There are more people on the planet who need care than those who can give it. 
Humans are more productive but lonelier. 
People avoid each other, instead they like to be on social media, they even prefer their pets to ones used to be their loved ones. 
In more developed countries, they produce more wealth but in less developed countries they produce more babies, and this creates all kinds of problems. 
People don't like wherever they are and whoever they are, they like to be in some other places and in another bodies or skins. 
In poorer countries there are more hunger than food, in richer ones there are more food than hunger, but even more greed. 
There are more children, but not enough parents, because some died, some othe left and still others resigned as parents. 
In richer countries there are more laws but not enough hearts, in poorer ones, there are more hearts, but not enough laws. 
Many people now prefer to turn their hearts into cigarette rather than sharing it with one another.
