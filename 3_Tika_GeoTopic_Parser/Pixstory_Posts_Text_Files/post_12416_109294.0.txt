Because the truth hurts. People are so damaged and so on that if they hear anything related to their defects they will combust with anger.

Alot of people use this offended rubbish as a way to become some sort of special privileged person who can now exploit the offend and this in the end does nothing for them if then person who offended doesn't care and ignored lack of reason by walking away so the offended cries even more and reports you for having opinions, being realistic or whatever really.

The reason that people can get offended is that they don't realize that what they are offended by feels correct for that person or people in the moment. Being offended to me means that someone's way is grossly different from my ways. For me not to be offended, I simply can accept that they think the way they think based on their life's experiences.

Well, taking it from another perception , it can be assumed that people who get offended usually have a reason. It's because it is connected with something personal to them. Sometimes it's connected with a deeper belief, sometimes it's connected with a past experience/memory, etc. Even if it seems like something very minuscule from an external perspective, it might actually be something more if one decides to try to understand what it triggers within that person.
