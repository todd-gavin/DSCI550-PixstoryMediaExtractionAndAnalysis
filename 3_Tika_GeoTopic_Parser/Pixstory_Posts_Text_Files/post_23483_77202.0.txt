Orchha can be ‘done’ in a day..a long day that is! But then you’d be like the Betwa that skims the rocks in Orchha but doesn’t get to dive into the feel of the place. A long weekend would suffice and if you have more time or are jobless..well then, lucky you! Paucity of time and the heat made us skip some monuments so I guess a rerun will be on the anvil someday…maybe a post- monsoon trip this time.

Or you could try-Mandu & Maheshwar in the Monsoon Mist
