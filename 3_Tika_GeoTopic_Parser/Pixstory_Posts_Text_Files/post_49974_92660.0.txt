‌Is Breed Specific Legislation a plausible way to prevent dog bites? It is born out of the instinct of humans to discriminate against everything. Please remember at least some humans are animal-friendly. 
‌
‌Yes Dog bite, is a serious issue it can cause deadly diseases such as rabies. Rabies doesn't restrict to any specific breed. Every dog bites. Many factors contribute to dog bites and it is not attributed to breeds. Here is the main issue that is not addressed: the irresponsibility of owners! Dogs the most friendly beings, become dangerous when they are not well-trained or unsupervised. The law only helps in spreading the wrong message. Cities and states expend money trying to execute ineffective bans and restrictions rather than implementing proven solutions, such as licensing and leash laws, and responding proactively to owners of any dog that poses a risk to the community. The very law becomes nullified as animals cross-breed and breed-specific rules are almost impossible. Physical attributes cannot determine whether a dog is dangerous or not! Moreover, it is an outrageous act against responsible and loving dog owners. We don't have to bear the burden of the irresponsibility of others who tortures dogs for their own selfish needs. 
‌
‌The dogs are considered to be of "masculine or proactive breeds" and may already be serving the community in positions such as police work, military operations, rescue purposes, and as service animals. They are an asset to society! Yes, a dog bite is an issue but they can be controlled by responsible pet owners ships or the government could prohibit dog-fighting to ensure safety.
