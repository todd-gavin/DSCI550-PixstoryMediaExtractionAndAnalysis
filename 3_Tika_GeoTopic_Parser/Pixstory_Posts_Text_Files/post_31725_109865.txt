The efficacy of PDEs in the andrological field continues Andrea Isidori has attracted the attention of the medical community to such an extent that their possible use in women was ignored We therefore insisted on investigating other targets of these drugs After demonstrating the efficacy of PDEs on cardiac remodeling in diabetic men we have put together all the scientific evidence through a meta-analysis, finding gender-related differences in the study populations Subsequently we have discovered that the kidneys can also be targets of PDEs i Today with this new work we have finally demonstrated how the effects of PDEs i are sex and tissue specific revealing the remarkable potential of these drugs especially in the field of precision medicine. pathological diseases of Sapienza and the IRCCS Neuromed of Pozzilli the Biomedical University Campus of Rome the Fatebenefratelli Hospital and the University of Cagliari was published in the journal Science Translational Medicine Through a multidimensional approach that exploited cardiac magnetic resonance imaging renal vascular immune profile and various patterns molecules analyzed via digital PCR the authors studied each component among the many possible targets of PDE We are sure, adds Andrea Isidori, that it is the lack of estrogen that is the reason why women have not been able to achieve the heart improvement observed in men Pharmaceutical companies should consider that pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women may respond differently to medications and therefore should be adequately represented in clinical trials important to emphasize that these results were achieved in the face of negligible side effects with a very cheap, off-patent drug In any case, a prescription from medical personnel is always necessary who can monitor the potential adverse effects of this class of drugs and above all the interaction with other drugs taken
