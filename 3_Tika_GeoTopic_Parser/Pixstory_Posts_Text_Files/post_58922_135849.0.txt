According to an official, a SpiceJet flight from Nashik to Delhi returned to Indira Gandhi International Airport on Thursday morning due to a 'autopilot' snag the plane encountered midway. SpiceJet flight SG-8363 took off from Delhi at 6.54 a.m. and returned an hour later. The Boeing 737 plane landed safely, and the passengers were transferred to a smaller Q400 plane.
