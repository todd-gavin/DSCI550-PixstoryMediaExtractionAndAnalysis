Among the more unforgettable moments of my travels have been my three visits to Pakistan The love affection and warmth for us from India from its people was simply unbelievable I visited Pakistan three times in and then in And each time I had a distinct experience In when the Pakistan Independence Cup the three match one day series was played only a few journalists travelled with the team So we were initially apprehensive But our fears vanished the moment we landed in Karachi The taxi driver spoke in fluent Punjabi put a Hindi film song on his tape and greeted us with great warmth However the Indian team that was led by Sachin Tendulkar kept to themselves as a tight security cordon kept them away from interacting with their Pakistani fans They were cold towards the local press as well something which didn t go well with the people But the entire situation was different in As it was sort of a peace mission by the Indian government and the then prime minister Vajpayee said Sirf match hi mat jeeto dil bhi jeeto win matches as well as their hearts This time Pakistan didn t even make separate seating arrangements for the Indian spectators It was a masterstroke as the hundreds who travelled to Lahore mingled with the Pakistani people and were given real VIP treatment by them Whosoever went to Pakistan in whether the players the journalists or the people all of them came back with memories filled with love and goodwill I have mentioned many such incidents in my book and how cricket can be a bridge and help in mending relationships between the two countries As told to Sanya Tyagi To be continued To get book NOT JUST CRICKET A Reporter s Journey through Modern India
