Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God Matthew King James Version There s no doubt religion has been used as a tool of hate for a long time but that does not mean it teaches that It s just the misinterpretation of it that does Prejudice is the absence of truth It s the misunderstanding of the fact that we are all His children And that s what belief teaches us against Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind This is the first and great commandment And the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself Matthew Belief requires you to discard deception after deception whereas contemporary common sense necessitates constant airy pretending fooling that is so completely incentivised by our culture that it might as well be systemic Religion teaches against that Religion teaches peace and mercy But many times seeking forgiveness for ignorance is seen as prejudice Conscious and hardened resistance to the truth leads man away from humility and repentance and without repentance there can be no forgiveness Repenting and taking solace in God is not prejudice
