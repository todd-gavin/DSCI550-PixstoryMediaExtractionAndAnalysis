Deepika Padukone never fails to stun all
her fans with her strong fashion game. She makes
sure to turn heads with every single outfit she dons.
Yet again, the actress, who is currently in Spain to
attend the French luxury brand Cartier's event,
impressed fans with her dynamic style statement. A
video shared by her fan page shows Deepika
dressed in an off-white dress with a plunging
neckline. She was seen posing with Yasmine Sabri
and the actor Rami Malek, among others.
Currently, Deepika is in Madrid for the Cartier event,
and videos and photos of the same have been doing
rounds on social media. Looking all divine, she opted
for a ruffled white gown with a plunging neckline.
She completed her looks with Cartier's diamond
neckpiece and earrings. It was her smokey eye
make-up and high-bun that added more drama to
her entire look.
