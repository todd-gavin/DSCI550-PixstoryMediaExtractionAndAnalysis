Richard Williams is a single minded father Stubborn and undemocratic I must say Hardly give space to others opinions Kinda always I have plans with a percent success rate Just follow me He even planned to make two more babies with a pre set goal Looking from a broader perspective he is relentless to grab a bright future He works hard and hard Both of his young daughters Serena and Venus also work hard and hard Wondering if that dream was theirs or their father s What s impressive is his wife interferes and questions everything undemocratic upfront and consoles him as well A relatable Indian sports drama was Dangal where Aamir Khan Indian actor another Richard Willams with the same mindset from a similar background If the girls are silent here the elder one questions her father s single track in Dangal when she started indulging little pleasures for herself Serena Demi Singleton and Venus Saniyya Sidney are good girls here nothing against their father s towering dreams Whenever Serena gets dull Williams becomes a motivational father and settles her easily This could have continued longer in their real lives Serena started playing pro matches much later considering Venus This created a lesser importance and screen time for Serena in King Richards Racism is loud in the movie though director Reinaldo Marcus Green couldn t shake us with those scenes Black girl politics never ends Lifting heads through education and other world victories seem an unavoidable preach here too I felt Willimas is a bit obsessive about the idea of the whole movie time If you ask me whether Will Smith s performance was exemplary to win an Oscar it wasn t Make up and body language fit But the character build is poor with a drowsy effect in totality The two girls their coaches and mom could ooze some life into their roles Entire tennis shots were well edited and the plays seemed real I am yet to figure out whether King Richard had the stuff for a film or just fit a documentary
