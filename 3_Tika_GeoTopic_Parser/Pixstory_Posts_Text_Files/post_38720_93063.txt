Due to his inexperience in this position he has failed to be beneficial to the team in terms of supplying the box with balls and creating goal scoring opportunities He has amazing passing and ball retention awareness It won t be surprising if Ten Hag uses Timber as a defensive midfielder due to his excellent range of passing The manager said that in the foreseeable future he might use him as a central midfielder From the above dashboard we can see that he has made most of his touches in the middle third and attacking third with him contributing per in the middle third and per in the attacking third There is a slight jauntiness to his game which is reflected in his tackling which is quite poor Timber ranks only tackles while conceding fouls leading to way below percentile in tackles won He has made interceptions However he ranks percentile in stopping the passes by standing on its path The Dutch international excels in blocking the shots from his feet or another part of his body as he ranks blocks Timber standing at only ft inches could lack the height to play as a center back in the long term He has only won Aerials duel That s why Ajax Manager Erik Ten Hag switched him to right wing back this season One thing he excels is in dribbling past players on and off the ball One thing in which Timber excels is physical contact and can hold his one on one defensive duels on the ground Despite his shortcomings with respect to his height he is not afraid to contest for the ball aerially From the figure we can see where Timber has made most of the defensive actions It is mostly in the defensive half and the middle third What makes him successful defensively is his positional sense Timber s ability to read the game helps him in anticipating the opposition movement and move into spaces so he can pressurize his opponents and block their attacking efforts
