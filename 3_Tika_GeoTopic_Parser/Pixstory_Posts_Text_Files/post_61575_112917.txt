Before the match Adam Pearce notified the competitors already in the ring that Theory would be the eighth participant in the high stakes collision Omos used his height advantage in the opening stages clobbering Superstars left right and center His run ended with a sickening Claymore from Drew McIntyre but The Nigerian Giant still did not go down The other seven individuals used the weight of the ladders to bury the huge Superstar hoping to dispel the gargantuan threat McIntyre was the first to grasp the briefcase but his arch nemesis Sheamus stopped him in his tracks landing a White Noise on The Scottish Warrior Riddle used some innovative offense of his own hitting a draping DDT from the rungs of the ladder on Sheamus and a Floating Bro from the top of the ladder onto the hungry participants below The human demolition derby finally ended when Theory turned his night around knocking Riddle off the ladder nabbing the briefcase and becoming the youngest Money in the Bank winner in WWE history
