India tied England at 1 in the second quarter of their opening Pool B match of the FIH Hockey Women's World Cup 2022 on Sunday at the Wagener Hockey Stadium in Amstelveen, Netherlands. In the eighth minute, Petter Isabelle made a field goal to give England the lead.

Before Vandana Katariya scored the equaliser in the second quarter by converting a rebound into a penalty corner, India had a number of missed opportunities. Savita Punia will serve as India's captain as they look to build on their fourth-place performance from the Tokyo Olympics, where they lost to Great Britain in the bronze medal match, and increase their winning percentage. 

Rani Rampal, India's regular captain, is out with a hamstring injury and is not available. Goalkeeper Savita will fill the position while she is away.
