Dr Anthony Fauci made an appearance on The Rachel Maddow Show on Monday and discussed his approaching retirement from the government after more than years of service Fauci stated earlier in the day that he intends to step down from his positions as chief medical advisor to President Biden and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in December The year old Fauci has other interests that will keep him occupied even if he intends to retire Fauci acknowledged that he had intended to retire earlier but agreed to join the administration when President Biden asked him to do so because he mistakenly thought the COVID outbreak would have ended by now However Fauci finds comfort in his decision to retire at a time when COVID is on the decline nationwide What he said Rachel it s never really a good time to leave but you have to leave sometime I have been wanting to pursue another chapter in my career as you mentioned a bit ago because I ve been wanting to do things outside of the government Fauci said Particularly to do things be they lecture or write or get involved in situations where I can serve as hope and inspiration to encourage young people to go into public service particularly in the arena of science medicine and public health Part in support post
