Further on the building of skyscrapers on the aztec foundation is making it a lot worse due to their very heavy weight. Due to a phenomenon called subsidence, Mexico City is sinking at a rate on a foot and a half each year. 
All this also effect the underground systems like sewage, gas and water lines. The city invested a lot of money in a new sewage system which was completed in the late 1800s, it was meant to help with the flooding and sewage problems which didn’t quite work as well it was meant to due to subsidence. The city has spent about 2 Billion dollars on a new sewage system which would help with the flooding, but the flooding in late 2021 still costed the lives of 14 people just north of Mexico City. To make matters even worse rain and spring water flow done the mountains into Mexico City which would make the city sink deeper and eventually contaminate the drinking water. 

The city is already facing a problem of water availability due to the increasing population, the failure to harvest the water water and rain water means that the city loses about 200 million gallons of water via crippled sewers like the grand canal. The city planners have installed water pumps to draw water from whatever is left of the rivers, but this still is not enough. The city’s demand is of more than 10 million gallons a day, the city has to import more than 40% of the water from other sources but almost 40% of this water is lost across 8000 miles of pipes because of leaks and other losses. 1.1 million homes in the city lack access to water. 20% of the city residents can’t rely on the water supply. To battle this the government sends out water trucks so people can take water for their needs but this still doesn’t reach everyone. A lot of these trucks draw this water from the Aquifer which lie 300 metres below ground. And this is not helping the problem of the sinking city.
