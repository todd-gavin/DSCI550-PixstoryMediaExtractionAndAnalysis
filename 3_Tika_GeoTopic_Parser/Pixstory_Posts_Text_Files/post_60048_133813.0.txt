Before the Sunday at 2:30 pm destruction of the Supertech Twin Towers in Noida, almost 5,000 inhabitants of the Emerald Court and ATS Village communities were forced to leave. Dogs were also rescued from the location by NGOs. The Parsvnath Prestige Residential Complex in Sector 93 has offered the families temporary housing.
Between 2.15 and 2.45 p.m., the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway would be closed for the demolition drive. Drones are not permitted to fly in the area above the city. According to Noida Authority, during the demolition period, planes will also temporarily be prohibited from the air space within a one nautical mile radius of the explosion.
Process, effects, and concerns of the Supertech twin towers' removal in Noida
The towers will be destroyed using a "controlled implosion," in which explosives are set carefully and then detonated to cause as little damage as possible to the surrounding area. The two towers have been loaded with about 3,700 kg of explosives.
Due to the Twin Towers of Supertech in Noida being demolished, about 500 police and traffic officers have been stationed around the buildings. Road barriers were set up early in the morning after all residents of the two nearby housing societies in Sector 93A, Emerlad Court and ATS Village, had been evacuated, according to police officials.
To maintain smooth traffic flow and the general public's safety in light of the destruction of the Supertech twin buildings in Noida Sector 93A, Noida Traffic Police issued a traffic advisory/diversion plan.
Ganesh Prasad Saha, DCP Traffic, stated on Sunday, "Before the demolition, the expressway would be shut down for 15 minutes. After the demolition, and the dust has settled, we'll do everything we can to reopen the expressway in a half-hour. The major issue for Noida police would be handling the expressway shutdown."
