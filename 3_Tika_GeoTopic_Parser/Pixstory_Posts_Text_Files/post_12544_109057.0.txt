• Feeling sad after making a decision doesn't mean it was the wrong decision.

• Life is not tiring. Wanting life to be a certain way but not having the confidence to make it that way, is tiring.

• Self-awareness is realising that there is no opponent you're fighting against yourself.

• Sometimes saying 'goodbye' doesn't mean you don't love something, it just means you love yourself too.

• That lesson will repeat itself until you learn it.

• If you keep one hand on your past and one hand on your future you'll never have either. To embrace tomorrow, you must let go of yesterday.

• The world starts and ends entirely inside your mind. 

No matter where you end up, no matter how rich, or successful you become, you won't enjoy any of it if you get there at the expense of your mental health.
