My father is my role model He is the person who I wish to become like My father has all the qualities that I find are the ideal qualities in a person He is honest and he is also courageous to be that way He always seeks the truth and abides by it He will do all he can for this He is helpful to people who may need his help But he is never proud of all his good qualities My father is a charming person with so much comprehension There is no single car drive without him explaining something to me That is how I wish to be And so I see him as my role model at all times
