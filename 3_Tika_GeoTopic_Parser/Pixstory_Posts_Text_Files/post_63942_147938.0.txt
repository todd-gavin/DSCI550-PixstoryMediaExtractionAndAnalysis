PlayStation has been making some big moves lately by providing a port of their exclusive titles for the PC platform. They have already released God of War, Spider-Man Remastered and Horizon Zero Dawn for PC and do not seem to stop anytime soon. 
As far as the friendly neighbourhood Spider Man is concerned, it seems that the time for Peter Parker to step aside has come as Spider Man: Miles Morales has gotten its PC port, with the teaser for it being released this Friday.
Currently available on PS4 and PS5, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a spinoff title from the original Spider-Man and follows the adventures of a teenager.
 Miles Morales was bit by a spider in the last game and seemed to develop the same powers as Peter. Peter has become his mentor and is teaching him the ropes of being a Spider-Man.
Miles Morales is not like every other Spider-Man, he has his own flair and a couple of different tricks up his sleeve, making him a different character compared to Peter Parker . The teaser trailer shows Miles Morales in his sleek and shiny spider-suit, swinging across the city and stomping bad guys to protect New York City.
While at the moment there is no official release date for the title, the teaser does state that we should receive the game by Fall of 2022, so fortunately the players waiting for the game will not have to wait till 2023. Those players who are interested can now add the game to their wishlist across Epic Games Store and Steam.
