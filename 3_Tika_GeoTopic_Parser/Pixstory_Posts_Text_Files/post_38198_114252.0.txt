As per Juvefc.com, Italian giants Juventus are reportedly looking to sign defender Kalidou Koulibaly from rivals Napoli in the summer. This news would certainly not be well received by the Napoli faithful as the two clubs share a heated rivalry in Italy. 

As per the report, "Juventus is keen to add Kalidou Koulibaly to their squad after losing Giorgio Chiellini at the end of last season. The Senegalese defender has been at Napoli since 2014, but this might be his last summer with the Partenopei. His current deal expires in 2023, and he has not agreed to terms of a new one with them." 

Owing to this, Napoli are looking to ship out Koulibaly this summer instead of losing out on him for free in 12 months. 

The report states that Juventus officials met with Koulibaly's agent yesterday, and they offered to make him one of their players on a salary of 6m euros net per season. Juve are also willing to pay 30m euros in transfer fees to Napoli for his signature.

Chelsea and Barcelona had also earlier emerged as the other two clubs fighting for Koulibaly's signature this summer. Hence it has to be seen where the Senegalese defender would end up playing next season.
