Loved every bit of Sarah and James’ wedding in what used to be a stable for horses in Ashbourne. 

Tom drove us through buttercup carpeted hills, grazing sheep, and endless twists and turn of grassy fields. 

I mixed and matched from my mom’s wardrobe, while she mixed and matched saris from her mother into a dress.

Once I get home, I’m going to go through all her saris to find the unstitched outfits waiting to be made.
