#3.  David Bentley

Although the inclusion of David Bentley on the list may sound harsh to some, the reality that his unquestionable ability resulted in only 62 appearances over a five-year stint at the club cannot be overlooked. Bentley was a whopping £17 million at the time, and it came with undoubted pressures, which he may have struggled to deal with overall. Bentley's decision to retire from football at the age of 29 in 2013, citing his dislike of modern football as the reason, shows that he was never going to fit in at a club aiming for the top.


#2.  Grzegorz Rasiak

There's a pattern emerging here, and it's that Spurs have had a bad track record when it comes to signing strikers in the past. Thankfully, Harry Kane is making up for it these days, but before the England striker, players like Grzegorz Rasiak were being signed to try to turn the teams' fortunes around. In August 2005, the Polish striker was recruited with a few minutes remaining on transfer deadline day, however he failed to score a single goal during his stay at the club before being moved to Southampton.


#1.  Bongani Khumalo

Between 2011 and 2015, Bongani Khumalo was a member of Tottenham Hotspur, but he did not make a single appearance for the club. His chances of staking a claim were hampered by loan moves, but the fact that no manager liked him during his stay at the club reveals that Khumalo was truly out of his depth.
