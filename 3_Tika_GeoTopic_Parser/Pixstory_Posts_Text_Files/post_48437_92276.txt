 Censorship is important because many are been targeted within art forms Art forms are known for creativity but also for raving out one s hate Opinions do defer among individuals but it doesn t give the right to any individual to hurt or insult another individual by the means of any art form For example Me and Earl and the Dying Girl by Jesse Andrews was banned on the grounds because it was considered sexually explicit and degrading to women ALA Access to excessive sexual content or violence could affect the mental health of students Hence it could be under parental access Censorship is necessary as it prefers which age group could read the books To stand fair I am completely against banning books because of insensible reasons such as it promotes religion for example Kite Runner or is about a particular community Pulitzer award winning colour purple was attempted to ban for LGBTQ content Censorship is necessary that people think before the use of hate speech or extreme violence in books or to regulate the access of books to certain age groups The world we should create should have opinions without targeting any individuals or community
