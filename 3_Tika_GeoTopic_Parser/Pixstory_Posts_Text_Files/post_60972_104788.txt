F r i e n d s has always been a comforting show for me and each of the characters has such amazing and interesting traits that I find it challenging to choose one character that I love But I always related to Chandler s sarcastic humor and Phoebe s weirdness This is what these two characters are usually known for However there is a deeper reason why these characters inspire me Chandler might be sarcastic but being with Monica proposing to her when he initially was scared of commitment and marriage and basically sacrificing a whole lot to make her happy Showing the soft side of him was definitely a wholesome surprise Phoebe is also a character known for her weirdness but the dedication she had to be a surrogate for her brother dropping Ross to meet Racheal at the airport and so many instances where she put her time and effort into helping her friends wanting nothing in return
