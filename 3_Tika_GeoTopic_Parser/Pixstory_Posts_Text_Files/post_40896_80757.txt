The Colour White When she was born it was the color of her blanket When she dressed as a fairy it was the color of her wings When you asked her for dance it was the color of her corsage When you said something stupid it was the color of the canvas on which her eyeballs rolled When your fingers traced her body it was the color of her skin When she ate an ice cream it was the color of her lips When she cuddled up to you it was the color of her breath When she walked down that aisle it was the color of her dress When she whispered sweetly in your ear it was the color of atmosphere And when you saw her last it is the color of the shroud
