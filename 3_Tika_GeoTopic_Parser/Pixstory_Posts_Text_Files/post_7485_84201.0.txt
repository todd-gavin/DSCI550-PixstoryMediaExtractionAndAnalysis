A 74-year-old woman died in a fast-moving fire that consumed her Brooklyn apartment, police said Sunday.

The blaze broke out inside the four-story building on Tompkins Ave. near Putnam Ave. in Bedford-Stuyvesant about 11:15 p.m. Saturday and quickly grew to three alarms, cops said.

Firefighters brought the blaze under control about 2 a.m.

The victim was found dead in a third-floor apartment after the blaze was extinguished. Her name was not immediately released.

The cause of the fire remains under investigation.
