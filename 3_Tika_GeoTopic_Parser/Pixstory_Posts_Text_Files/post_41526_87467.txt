AP Golf Writer Doug Ferguson has some interesting views on him He has written that at Kapalua the scoring was so low that it was easy to miss the name in the record book Cameron Smith was tough to ignore at the TPC Sawgrass because his play was so daring bordering on fearless Those two victories which were so dissimilar in so many ways are a significant reason Smith is ranked sixth in the world In the rankings he has a large lead over Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas and is closing in on Scottie Scheffler and Patrick Cantlay who are ahead of him He further believes that Smith s tee shots are short and crooked which has never been a successful combination in golf history True his short game particularly his putting compensates for it That propelled him to a tournament record tying birdies in the final round and a under giving him a one shot win in the most important golf tournament outside of a major However he also emphasises that it s all about the fight for Smith and his willingness to take any shot He was born into a working class Brisbane household He was asked to explain the significance of toughness in Australia particularly among Queenslanders Smith stated It s probably simply never give up I grew up watching rugby league and cheering for the Queenslanders when they came back from behind
