People's preferences for science fiction, in my opinion, are more psychological than objective. 

One of the reasons individuals explore the world of science-based fiction is excitement and curiosity about the big questions of life. 

A mystery story's intrigue and charm are amplified when it is supported by science because that distinguishes it from fantasy. But more importantly, it is the innate human desire for mystery and the satisfaction of solving it or witnessing it solved that draws people to this genre. 

Instead of imagining what may occur if Edward Cullen attended college on a sunny day because his vampire skin glows like a diamond, I personally would like to unravel the riddle in Interstellar.
