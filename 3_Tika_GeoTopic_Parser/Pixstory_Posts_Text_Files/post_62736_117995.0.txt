Being gone through a global pandemic that affected every aspect of our lives, and in a fast paced world, everything, including the way we look at parenting and education is changing. 

Homeschooling is when students' education is home-based i.e. parents - guided, rather than enrolling them in a private or public educational institution. 

According to the US Census Bureau, in 1999, 1.7% of students aged 5-17 were homeschooled, whereas in 2012, the number had doubled. 

The disruption to traditional schooling because of COVID-19 lockdowns, online teaching, mask mandates and other reasons led to many people switching to home schooling in recent time. 

There is no set method for homeschooling; rather, each day, the parent and kid select which educational philosophies to utilise, how to execute the educational frameworks, and what curriculum to follow.

Homeschooling is an option for students up until they graduate and enrol in college. Families might decide to homeschool their kids for the entirety of their schooling, or they can do it for a short period of time before sending them back to a traditional school.
