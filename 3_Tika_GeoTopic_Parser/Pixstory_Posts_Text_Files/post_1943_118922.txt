The mainstream media is corrupt After a decade of propping up politicians and serving as vessels for political propaganda a large amount of Americans that our mainstream media institutions are at least somewhat corrupt Yet there has been reported something much more sinister Something is so rotten that it makes its biased left wing segments masquerading as impartial journalism seem like child s play What I m referring to is the mainstream media s and the Democratic Party s complicity in supporting and promoting far right candidates in primary elections so that moderate Democrats can easily defeat them in the general elections How can Democrats claim to be the party striving to rescue democracy when they are colluding with the media to lie and cheat their way to power It would not surprise me at this point if it were revealed that Hillary Clinton s campaign persuaded the mainstream media to go on the offensive against Donald Trump in order to make the primary easier for her to win as he was always seen as the most radical This is a troubling finding that will undermine the Democratic Party over the next several years when enough people realize they have been lied to and manipulated into hating their neighbors
