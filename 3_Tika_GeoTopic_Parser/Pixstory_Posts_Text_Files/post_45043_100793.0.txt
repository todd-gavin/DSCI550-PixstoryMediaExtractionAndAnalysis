As he prepares to leave Parc des Princes after seven years, the Argentine winger is looking
forward to a fresh challenge in Italy.

Angel Di Maria of Paris Saint-Germain will join Juventus on a free transfer this summer, according to GOAL. He has agreed to a one-year deal at the Allianz Stadium.

PSG has opted not to extend Di Maria's contract beyond the summer, despite the fact that he has spent the previous seven years of his career with the club, winning several domestic
championships.

On May 21, the 34-year-old will play his farewell game for the Ligue 1 champions against Metz,
and he will become a free agent the following month, with Juve reportedly interested in signing
him.

Di Maria will be paid €7 million net per year for a one-year deal with the possibility of a second
year.

Due to the short contract, Juve will be unable to take advantage of the Growth Decree, a three-year tax break.

PSG signed the 34-year-old from Manchester United in 2015, and he has won five league
championships since then.

He played four seasons with Real Madrid before moving to England, where he won a LaLiga title, the Champions League, and the Copa del Rey.

Di Maria was also a member of Argentina's World Cup-winning team in 2014.

What kind of impact did Di Maria have at PSG?
PSG spent €52 million (£44 million/$65 million) to entice Di Maria away from Manchester United
in 2015, and the purchase turned out to be a steal.

The experienced attacker has helped the club win five Ligue 1 titles, five Coupe de France titles,
and three Trophee des Champions, as well as helping them reach the 2019-20 Champions
League final.

Di Maria has 92 goals and 118 assists in 294 games for PSG, and will undoubtedly be
recognised as one of the club's finest players in recent years.
