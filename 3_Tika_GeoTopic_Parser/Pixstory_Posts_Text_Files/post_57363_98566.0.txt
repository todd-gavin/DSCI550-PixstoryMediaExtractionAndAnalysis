The survey unveiled how people's eating habits in the U.S. have changed a lot since the Pandemic, and surprisingly, the change is not so malignant in all cases.
America's Test Kitchen conducted a survey which included 1,500 people, most of whom were women under the age of 62.
And this is what they found out in the survey.

Since the Pandemic closed all the doors of public places, the choice remained to eat home-cooked food. So to maintain safety, people started dining at home.
The finding states, "45% say they are eating more fruits and vegetables, 29% are eating less meat, 29% are eating less junk food, 27% have reported eating less takeout, 52% of people are eating more home-cooked meals, and 39% are eating smaller portions."

Another finding revealed that cost and time were roadblocks to healthy eating. Most people who didn't eat healthier blamed it on time and cost.
The 35% of people reported that money issues (either food being more expensive or budgets getting tighter) have made eating healthy harder in the past year. Pandemic had a substantial economic effect, so if one would say money was the reason, then that can be true as many people lost their jobs and income and couldn't make enough to get a healthy diet.

Other 34% have reported that more stress makes it harder to eat healthily. Of course, stress can be because of anything; time constraints sometimes hinder eating habits as people are so engrossed in their work that they forget to take care of something more precious, our health.
