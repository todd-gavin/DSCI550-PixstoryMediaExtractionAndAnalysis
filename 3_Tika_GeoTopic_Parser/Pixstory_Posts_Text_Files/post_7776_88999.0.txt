Lost among the woods,
Remembered a princess,
She's one from the fairy-tales,
Always leaves me in awe.

Transpiring events leave me stranded,
Do I still trespass here,
Wait for her appearance,
Or is a meeting forbidden?

The nightingale sings her songs,
Eyeing me with pity,
I have no foresight,
Just an impossible dream I believe.

Everything is so obvious now,
My desperation leaves its scent,
I try to hold it off, 
If only my heart listened.

She wouldn't want to, 
Lose herself in someone like me,
What could I offer her,
Hymns full of her praise.

My sense of self is frailed,
The solution is so clear,
She's the one I long for,
Is it a sin to desire.

The letter will never come,
The invitation of hope,
Will be recieved in ashes,
It'll always be an unresolved riddle.

I keep on writing to her,
Whatever my heart lets go,
My confession is still caged,
Abandonment is too great a risk.

Don't call me a drifter anymore,
I won't sway away,
Not even lingering on,
Staying still in limbo.

Some moments aren't enough,
I'd settle for an eternity,
Staying mesmerized by her,
If she'd let me.

Like a blazing phoenix she flies,
Away from the ashes of chaos,
I'm left to dwell in agony,
I'd settle to be even Icarus.

I'd fly up to her,
To fall to my end again,
A glimpse for a moment,
Would be my eternity.
