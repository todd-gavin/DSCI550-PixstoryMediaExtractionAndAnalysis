Recently US President Joe Biden pledged a new million military aid package for Ukraine including helicopters howitzers and armoured personnel carriers Russia reacted that US and NATO are adding fuel to the current situation and there will be unforeseeable consequences to this action What s America s stand on this As Russia prepares to intensify its attack in the Donbas region the United States will continue to provide Ukraine with the capabilities to defend itself Biden said Let s analyse Who started the war Who destroyed a country for their own selfish needs It is the responsibility of America as a strong country and NATO as an organisation to bring this war to peace Yes I agree the responsibility rests within us and all the nations to demand peace but what is the situation here Ukraine is under constant threat and Russia is not offering a solution for peace Russia cannot be justified for what they did so I don t think they should threaten the USA as they themselves are responsible for the massive destruction First take responsibility for the destruction you caused the people whom you made homeless However I think there is more a strong country like America NATO and the UN can do to bring in peace between two countries War is a crime and it should not be encouraged in any way There are people many people in Russia who might not support the war they too suffer So rather than helping Ukraine with ammunition please bring a halt to this cruelty It s not a tough job for the UN and NATO and we definitely don t want a WW but we do want peace without weapons and proper punishment for the root cause of war
