Was the Holocaust all about race Yes it was historically speaking No necessarily said Whoopi Goldberg comedian and actor on the ABC talk show The View that she co hosts After a barrage of criticism she expressed regret and apologized The show has suspended her for two weeks Alongside her misunderstanding though she was also making an important point underlining something about humanity in general The topic of discussion was this month s ban of the classic Holocaust graphic novel Maus Watch Goldberg said the Holocaust was not about race it s about man s inhumanity to other man To the repeated interventions from other discussants she maintained If you re going to do this then let s be truthful about it No it s not about race The first half is factually incorrect Hitler saw Jews as an inferior race but in the second she shows she means something more not less In denying race she was not an apologist for racists but looking at racism in broader humanitarian terms Her sympathies were clear in further discussion Among the reasons a school board in Tennessee has given to remove Maus from the eighth grade curriculum was that it depicts a character nude and the language is offensive Goldberg was vehemently critical I mean it s about the Holocaust the killing of six million people but that didn t bother you Where she went wrong for certain was in introducing the white supremacy angle these are two white groups of people This is white people doing it to white people so y all going to fight amongst yourselves That certainly revealed a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the Holocaust antisemitism Soon after the show on Monday she however tweeted her regret She is completely right in admitting that I should have said it is about both She said she was deeply deeply grateful for getting an education on the topic Next day before commencing the show she admitted I misspoke Yet Goldberg is clearly not among the Holocaust deniers In taking the matter beyond one category race and underling its universal aspect she was not wrong either
