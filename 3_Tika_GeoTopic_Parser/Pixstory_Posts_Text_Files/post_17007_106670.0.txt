Zoya Akhtarâ€™s Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara starring Hrithik Roshan, Farhan Akhtar, Abhay Deol, Katrina Kaif, and Kalki Koechlin is undoubtedly one of the best movies made in Bollywood. The movie was released in 2011, but still, people love to watch it on OTT and TV. It revolved around three friends who go for an all-boys trip and do different kinds of adventures. One of the adventures was skydiving and recently Farhan took to Instagram to share a picture from Spain where he is doing skydiving.
