Joan Gamper Trophy is an annual exhibition match organised by La Liga club FC Barcelona. The Catalan giants select one club to compete against every year and the game is usually played at the start of the season at the Spotify Camp Nou. Last year, for example, Barca faced Juventus in the Joan Gamper Trophy. This year, the Catalans have selected the Mexican club Pumas UNAM as their opponents.

Match Prediction: FC Barcelona vs Pumas UNAM

There is no doubt in the fact that FC Barcelona will totally toy with Pumas UNAM in the Joan Gamper Trophy. It is not only because Pumas UNAM are not a top club and it is atrocious even to expect them to be at a comparable level to FC Barcelona, but also because Xavi’s men have been in impeccable form in their pre-season matches. 

Barca’s pre-season campaign in the United States of America has been nothing but an absolute success and they have shown the world that with the star-studded squad that they have built in this transfer window, they can achieve anything. The Joan Gamper Trophy will be yet another excellent opportunity for them to prove the same.
