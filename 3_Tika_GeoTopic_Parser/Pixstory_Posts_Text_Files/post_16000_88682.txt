Deep Dutta Meha Sharma Abstract Background aims Pooled systematic analysis of safety and efficacy data of trelagliptin in type diabetes T DM is lacking We undertook this meta analysis to address this issue Methods Electronic databases were searched for RCTs involving people with T DM receiving trelagliptin in study arm and placebo active comparator in control arm Primary outcome was to evaluate changes in HbA c Secondary outcomes were to evaluate alterations in pre and post meal glucose levels glycaemic targets lipid parameters and adverse events Results From initially screened articles data from RCTs involving patients was analysed in active control group ACG defined as having alogliptin sitagliptin linagliptin teneligliptin anagliptin or vildagliptin as active comparator in passive control group PCG defined as having placebo as controls study had both ACG and PCG HbA c reduction by trelagliptin was comparable to ACG MD CI P I but superior to PCG MD CI P I Fasting blood glucose lowering with trelagliptin was inferior to ACG MD mg dl CI P I but superior to PCG MD mg dl CI P I Glycated albumin lowering was similar to ACG MD CI P I but superior to PCG MD CI P I Treatment emergent adverse events Risk ratio RR CI P I and severe adverse events RR CI P I were comparable among groups Conclusion Once weekly trelagliptin has good glycaemic efficacy and well tolerated in people with T DM Sources
