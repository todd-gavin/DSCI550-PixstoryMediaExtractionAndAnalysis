"Education Is The Most Powerful Weapon"
Approx 75% People are literate in India while 25% are illiterate. In rural areas education level is very low as compare to urban areas. 
We as an educated person should  spread the importance of education and also government should focus more in such areas  specially in rural areas where 78% people are inhabited.
