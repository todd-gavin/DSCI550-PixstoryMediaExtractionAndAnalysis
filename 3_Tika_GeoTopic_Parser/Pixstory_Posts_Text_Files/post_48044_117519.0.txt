New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday granted bail to Alt News co-founder Mohammed Zubair paving the way for his release from jail. Zubair was arrested on June 27 by the Delhi Police for allegedly hurting religious sentiments.

On Monday, A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and A S Bopanna said it would hear on July 20 the plea filed by Zubair, the co-founder of Alt News who is seeking quashing of the five FIRs registered against him for allegedly outraging religious sentiments.

Pronouncing the order on Wednesday, Justice DY Chandrachud said, “We direct Zubair be released on bail on each of the FIRs in UP. Existence of powers of arrest must be distinguished from the excercise of powers of arrest which must be used sparingly.”

There is no justification to keep the petitioner in continued detention especially since the gravamen of allegations in UP FIRs is similar to that in Delhi police FIR, Justice Chandrachud added.
