According to reporter Fabrizio Romano, Tottenham Hotspur are ready to sell Argetenian winger Giovani Lo Celso this summer for £17 million, with Villareal interested in making the deal permanent. 

Having joined Villareal on loan this winter, Lo Celso has enjoyed a stellar second half to the season, creating 25 chances for The Yellow Submarine this season, scoring 1 goal and 1 assist. Unai Emery is keen to bring on the winger to the club permanently this summer. 

As of now nothing has been agreed between the two clubs. However, both clubs are optimistic of making a deal. Spurs initially demanded €24m (£20.4m) for Lo Celso but Villarreal have managed to negotiate down the price.

Tottenham are set for a big summer of ins and outs, with Antonio Conte keen to make his impression on the squad well known. Ndombele is also another one who is set to depart the club, with Tottenham open to offers for the central midfielder. Winger Ivan Perisic has been signed from Inter Milan, once again reunited with manager Antonio Conte after their title winning campaign two years ago.
