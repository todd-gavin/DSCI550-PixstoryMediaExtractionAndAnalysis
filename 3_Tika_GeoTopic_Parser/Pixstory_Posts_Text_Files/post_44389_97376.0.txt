Gilles Grimandi - Centre Back

In 1997, the Frenchman joined Arsenal from AS Monaco, where he spent five seasons. He joined MLS side Colorado Rapids in 2003 and played a pre-season friendly game for the team, but he left the club just before the season began, citing family concerns, and then retired.

Following his retirement, he worked as the football director at ASOA Valence, a small French club. He joined Arsenal as a France-based scout in 2006, a position he left in 2019 to join OGC Nice as technical director. In October of this year, he resigned from his position.

Nigel Winterburn - Left-Back

The English full-back joined Arsenal in 1987 and stayed for 13 years before moving on to West 
Ham United for three seasons before retiring from sport in 2003.

In 2008, he returned to Blackburn Rovers as their defence coach, working under Paul Ince.

However, after Ince was fired in the same year, Winterburn was also removed of his duties. He 
has been a regular pundit since 2013.

Freddie Ljungberg - Right Wing

Between 1998 and 2007, the Swedish midfielder played for Arsenal for nine seasons. Ljungberg 
went on to play for the Chicago Fire of Major League Soccer and Celtic of Scotland. The 
midfielder, like his old teammate Robert Pires, retired after playing for Mumbai City FC in the 
ISL's inaugural season.

Ljungberg was the head coach of the Arsenal U15 and U23 teams during his coaching career. 
He was also an assistant coach at Wolfsburg. After Unai Emery's departure from Arsenal in 
December 2019, he became the club's interim head coach.

Until Mikel Arteta's hiring as head coach in 2020, he was the club's head coach. Ljungberg resumed his role as the club's first-team coach after Arteta took control.
