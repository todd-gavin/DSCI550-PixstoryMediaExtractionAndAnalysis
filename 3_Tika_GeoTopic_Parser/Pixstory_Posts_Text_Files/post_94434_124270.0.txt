Juventus midfielder Adrien Rabiot is currently demanding a big wage from Manchester United in the contract that he could sign with the club.
Rabiot is one of the players that the Bianconeri are looking to sell this summer and reports in England and Italy have stated that an agreement between the two clubs has already been reached regarding a permanent transfer.
But it has also been suggested that personal terms are not done between United and Rabiot. La Gazzetta dello Sport have claimed that Rabiot wants around 10 million per season in his contract at Old Trafford and wants assurances over Champions League football.
These demands are causing hold-ups and bringing about hesitations between United and Rabiot’s mother-agent Veronique.
