It is something I see everyday on the internet and in real life. It is, as if, a learned pattern they all follow when met with a woman in an argument. It does not matter if she is right, or if she's raising valid questions, a man talking to her would always talk to her in a condescending manner. Especially, if he is unable to come up with a valid counter.

I was just reading a conversation between these two people which compelled me to write down the frustration I felt after doing so. This has much to do with the entitlement that society teaches men which almost always leads them to mansplain. Despite how well-read a woman is in a certain field, she is always expected to not only tolerate but respect uninformed men feeling entitled enough to teach them about their own area of specialization.

And it's quite easy to figure out whether the man is curious or condescending: their response to being schooled. Men often start deflecting from the point as soon as they are countered with valid points. A man who's there for a conversation or a debate would will to listen and learn, but unfortunately it just turns into a session of manipulative trolling. The woman is trying to reason, have a conversation but the man is busy looking down upon her. That's when the derailing starts, and now suddenly it's not about the topic in hand. It's about tone policing and condescending nicknames. Oh, just how much that frustrates me! And it's a pattern I've noticed almost everytime I've seen a man and a woman debating. Nicknames as insults have been used for all women I know, including myself. The subtle undertone to pet names is a sexist message that women lack competence to be informed when it's the other person that is uninformed.

Having a different opinions opens the door for a debate, not condescension. And if you can't do that, you should probably not start an argument in the first place. Subtle sexism is still sexism.
