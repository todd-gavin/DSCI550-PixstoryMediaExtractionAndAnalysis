The other day when I was as a mall with my family,while shopping for my clothes  of course.......the only clothes I liked were either really short or had opening at the sides or back. Like not all of us want to show our skin. The only few things that are cute and not that showing are to big for some of us. Like the world wants us all to believe that the only thing a girl can do is look pretty but i think that answer is already given. There are so many girls who have out smarted in both sports , studies, arts, gaming and many other things. And also why do you want young kids to dress up like older girls.So if there is something you think I miss please us this hashtag #girlpower
