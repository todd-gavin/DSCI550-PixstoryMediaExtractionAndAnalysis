Tomorrow on 2nd August, Nag Panchami will be celebrated all over India. It is the Hindu festival celebrated to commemorate Lord Krishna's triumph over Kaliya, a venomous snake. Nag Panchmi is observed on the fifth day after Ashwini, which marks the end of the serpent's reign of terror.

It is said that when Lord Krishna was still a child, he was playing by the Yamuna River and his ball got stucked in the branches of a tree near the river's banks. Krishna was attacked by Kaliya, a snake, when he fell into the river while trying to fetch the ball.

The snake begged Krishna not to kill it after he put up a good fight and showed that he was no ordinary youngster.Â 

Nag Panchami takes place on the fifth day of the lunar fortnight of the month of Sravana.
