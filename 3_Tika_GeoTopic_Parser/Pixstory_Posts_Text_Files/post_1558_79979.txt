The Brooklyn Nets were rumored to be open to trading James Harden to the ers if they were to land Ben Simmons Obviously Ben Simmons is a good player but perhaps adding a third team into the deal and moving Ben Simmons will give them an even better chance of winning a championship That team could be the Sacramento Kings who have been linked with Simmons as well Here s the potential trade scenario Philadelphia ers Receive James Harden Brooklyn Nets Receive De Aaron Fox Buddy Hield Marvin Bagley Sacramento Kings Receive Ben Simmons Tobias Harris Andre Drummond James Harden and Joel Embiid on the same team would immediately be the best duo in the Eastern Conference Joel Embiid has been playing at an MVP level and a dominant multi faceted big man like him seems perfect to pair with James Harden This trade would make the aging Nets much younger De Aaron Fox is an electric year old guard who can play alongside and for Kyrie while he is out for home games They would also get Buddy Hield in this trade who would help provide spacing Marvin Bagley is an athletic big man who still has upside and perhaps playing for a competing franchise with stellar coaching could help unlock him Ben Simmons would be a difference maker for the Kings defensively He is a versatile defender that can successfully guard most positions He is also a fantastic playmaker and finisher at the rim Perhaps he can be the future face of the franchise for Sacramento and a higher usage rate on the offensive end could help him develop his offensive game further Tobias Harris is still a good basketball player that can contribute as a scorer and rebounder on a playoff team Though he is overpaid the goal for the Kings is to make the playoffs by acquiring talent Tobias Harris is overpaid but he is an upgrade in talent and can help the team win Drummond is a throw in
