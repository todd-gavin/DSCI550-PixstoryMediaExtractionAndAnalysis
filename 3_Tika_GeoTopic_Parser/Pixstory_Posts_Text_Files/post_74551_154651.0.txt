Prime Minister Indira Gandhi visited Amitabh bachchan ji after the incident and kissed him on the forehead❤️ and his childhood friend, son of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi canceled a trip to the United States to be with him. Rajiv gandhi came to meet him for his health ❤️The day befor the incident happened Smita patil called amitabh ji at night at around 2 am . Amitabh ji told “I was shocked as I had never spoken or talked to her at such a time. Thinking that it would be an important one, I answered” 💯. "Smita asked me if I was alright and in good health. I answered yes and she said that she just had a bad dream about me and that's the reason behind calling up so late in the night. The next day I had my accident," he said. IT IS THE MOST STRANGE THING THAT HAPPENED . SEEMS LIKE SMITA PATIL FORSEE THE MISHAP 😱✅Amitabh ji thanked his Donors“One of my blood donors was carrying Hepatitis B virus which went into my system. I continued to function normally till year 2000 and almost 18 years after the accident, during a very normal medical checkup, I was told that my liver was infected and I had lost 75 per cent of my liver. So, if I am standing here today, you are looking at a person who is surviving with 25 per cent of liver. That is the bad part. The good part is you can survive even with 12%. But no one wants to get to that stage,” he expressed.❤️Jaya Bachchan too was worried She told “I had the prayer book in my hand, Hanuman Chalisa. Dr Dastoor passed by and said, ‘It’s only your prayers that’ll help.’ But I couldn’t read it."❤️Thousands of common people turned up to offer any part of their body that could save his life and people camped outside Breach Candy Hospital waiting impatiently to hear the latest health bulletins. People cutting the boundaries of religion, language, race were one in praying for the miracle to happen.❤️
