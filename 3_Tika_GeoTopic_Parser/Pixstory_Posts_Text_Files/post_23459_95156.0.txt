If you manage to get past the quaintly eclectic village of Hauz Khas and its enticing eateries and tiny shops you’ll see the picturesque tank of the Hauz Khas park.

The 'Deer Park’, as it is often called, is a bit of a misnomer. It is actually a complex of adjoining parks which surround the village. There is a deer park (Yes, they are safely parked at one enclosed end!) and a rose garden at the entrance of the village.

At the end of the village lies the Hauz Khas fort park. A small complex with ruins dating back to the 12th century and includes the tomb of Firoz Shah Tughlaq and a seminary and ‘chattris’.

This overlooks the massive tank made by Alauddin Khilji (The same one, made more infamous by the movie Padmavat) at the end of the 12th century and is now part of the district park.

A wide promenade encircles this where one can sit, sip coffee and watch the world go by or go to one of the eateries overlooking the lake at night and behold the moon shimmering in the water.

The newest entrant on the green bloc sits quietly, thankfully, yet to be discovered. Its much older and famous neighbour hogs the crowds, as it should, having been lovingly restored to such breath-taking glory.

But once you are done with Humayun’s tomb, the Sunder Nursery adjoining it is a must visit. The Sunder Burj housed within and being an active old nursery lent it its name.

Dating back to the 16th century it has recently been reclaimed and restored and it has to be seen to appreciate all the hard work. The Sunderwala Mahal shines bright, all scrubbed and cleaned.

Done on the lines of a Mughal Garden with water channels, ponds, tiny waterfalls and pavilions, it’s a fantastic take of the old on clean contemporary lines. It also houses a massive collection of bonsai. Although still to be completed on the far fringes, come spring it will be a melange of colour true to its name. A celebration of being alive again. Agha Khan Trust! Take a bow!
