Saturday's early kickoff against Espanyol is a great opportunity for Real Madrid to potentially put this season's Laliga title race to bed. Football Club Barcelona's recent poor form has given the Merengues an ever greater advantage than the one they already had. In any case, Madridistas wouldn't have expected a crowning in between the two legs of their Champions League semi final.

Speaking to the Media ahead of Matchday 34, Ancelotti said "The XI for tomorrow? I can't use Alaba, Nacho and Militao tomorrow so Vallejo will play tomorrow. I could use Casemiro as CB because he has recovered."

Injury woes continue for Real Madrid, who struggled defensively in Manchester earlier this 
week. Casemiro's injury didn't allow him to start and David Alaba was replaced after a disastrous first 45 minutes. Defender-in-chief Éder Militão also struggled on the night.

"We don't need a replacement for Casemiro because we have many players who can play in 
that role. Kroos, Camavinga…"

Rotations are almost a given for Ancelotti's side against Espanyol. A thorough transformation 
of the team from back to front wouldn't be completely out of the question given next 
Wednesday's return leg against Manchester City.

The likes of Rodrygo, Eduardo Camavinga and Dani Ceballos have impressed as of late.

Defensive absences however, weigh heavy as the Italian coach is left with little option but to start Militão with Nacho. He presented a tactical dilemma with his lineup not long ago, with the 4-4-2 vs 4-3-3 prior to the City game.

“The doubt I have is whether to opt for three forwards or just two. We need to think about this, as players like Rodrygo and Camavinga are doing really well. That’s the question mark we have.” he continued.

“We are much closer to winning the league and want to win it on Saturday in our stadium.” he remarked.
