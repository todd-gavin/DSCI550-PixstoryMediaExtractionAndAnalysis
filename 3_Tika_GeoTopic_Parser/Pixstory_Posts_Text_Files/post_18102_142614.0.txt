The Nielsen statistics for the 2022 Emmys on NBC is in, and it does not bode well for television's greatest night.
Total viewers were down 25% from the previous year, and ratings set a new low.
The 74th Emmy Awards, presented by Kenan Thompson, received a 1.0 rating among adults 18-49 on Monday, the lowest-ever key demo figure for the Emmys. The previous low was reached by the 2020 show, which broadcast on ABC and only received a 1.3 rating. The Emmys improved to 1.9 the following year.
The show got 5.9 million total viewers last night, compared to 7.9 million on CBS last year. That's a new low, and it stands in stark contrast to the 2021 show, which was a high point.
The 2022 Emmys aired live from 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET until 8:03 p.m. PT/11:03 p.m. ET and were also available for live-streaming on Peacock.
This year’s top Emmy winners included HBO’s “Succession” for drama, Apple TV+’s “Ted Lasso” for comedy and HBO’s “The White Lotus” for anthology series. The No. 1 network for the 2022 Emmys was HBO/HBO Max with 38 wins.
Produced by Done+Dusted in association with Hudlin Entertainment and directed by Hamish Hamilton, the Emmys were broadcast from the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles.
