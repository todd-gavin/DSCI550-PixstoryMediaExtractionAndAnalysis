Continued from Going back to school and visiting the ones who I owe my life to gave me a realisation that the experience of school or as a matter of fact any experience in life will always be a part of you The scars will remain but there does come a time when you have to outgrow them And when you decide that those experiences can become a learning curve and you would view your past a little less daunting Coming back to the realisation I got I realised that closure in my case does not mean dumping my experiences in a capsule and never looking back but rather the acknowledgement that these experiences made me who I am today I realised that no matter how hard I try to go further away from my school my school would never go away from me This is because I grew up here This was my second home after all More importantly my value systems of integrity and self respect over anything else came from my school I may not have been a success story but I sure as hell am sure that I am doing pretty well from myself It is my teachers who taught me how to rise It is my principal who taught me how to treat people and instilled the value of treating people the way you want to be While I did not have a great experience in school it wasn t all too bad I came back home with a smile yesterday and at ease with myself I am finally excited about all the good in my life right now I am in a much happier place right now My school life scarred me and those scars will remain in my life they are a part of me whether I like it or not I hope you enjoyed this story of mine and hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I felt happy writing it The End
