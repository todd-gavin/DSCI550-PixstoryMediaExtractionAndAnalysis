Ralph Lauren returned to show in presence after almost three years of absence and to celebrate he organized a great event outside the fashion month He had the exact copy of his living room made as the venue for the show and between Anna Wintour the mayor of New York and Jessica Chastain white, black and red dresses walked the runway An evening with friends that was not so intimate but profoundly glamorous Direct inspiration rather than Old Hollywood the concept of old money the elegance and style of the great and ancient American wealthy families Tuxedos and long gal dresses pinstripe suits with a jazz flavor mix with printed sweaters and casual chic
