Marca has reported that Real Madrid's umpteenth comeback when all seemed lost in the second leg of the UEFA Champions League semifinals against the all powerful Manchester City, has generated a doubt in which everyone will have an opinion beyond the numbers, is there any team in the NFL, NBA or MLB that can be compared to the winning DNA of the Merengues?

In the NBA, there could be two apparent candidates, the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers, both have 34 championships (17 each), the rest of the teams have 43 Larry O'Brien Trophies, however, there are two big arguments that make both teams get off this boat, the first is that between them the glories are divided and, the second, are the long periods in which the teams have had title fasts.

Boston has won a championship since 1987 (34 years), in other words, they only had two great eras, the iconic Bill Russell (mostly in the 60s) and Larry Bird in the 80s, Los Angeles won a championship between 1955 and 1979 (24 years), plus they did not lift a single trophy in the decade of the 90s and not from 2011 to 2019.
