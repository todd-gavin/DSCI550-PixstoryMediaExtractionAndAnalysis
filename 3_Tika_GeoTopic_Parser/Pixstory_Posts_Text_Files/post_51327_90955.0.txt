Once Anna reached Poland, she was able to stay in an Airbnb, and plan the next steps to get to Anubhav in India: “She was coping fine – her main focus was on her mom and dog. Dog was fine in the village, and mom also left, so everything was calm then,” Anubhav says. 

After sorting through the paperwork, Anna made her way to India after a two-week long stay in Poland. Anubhav describes her arrival as nothing dramatic, though he did greet her with a proposal: “I'm usually a very practical guy, not a very filmy guy. But then somebody suggested why don't we just go to the airport and propose as a joke – I thought it wasn't a bad idea,” Anubhav says. 

Anubhav had planned for a ‘simple’ proposal, but it soon turned into a cinematic moment with friends taking over in celebration with Dhol, and the media quickly catching onto their story.

“When we met at the airport I personally was almost dead after a super long journey and then seeing Anubhav and his friends almost made me tear up,” Anna says.

Now that Anubhav and Anna are back together, they are caught up with wedding plans, while arranging essentials like clothes for Anna, who was able to travel back only with some winter clothes packed in a small bag.

The two will probably continue to live in Delhi, as they settle into this new chapter together: “Generally I consider myself lucky and I’m going with the flow and trusting the process. Just gonna focus on my life passion and sport for the next two years. Will slowly learn the language, build a family, take some lessons probably,” Anna says.

Once Anna is able to get back to work, she hopes to fulfill her dream of opening a makeup and educational studio.

Although Anubhav and Anna are private people, Anubhav is grateful for the love they’re getting, and for the big smile on Anna’s face.

“I’ve received so much help, love and support from people around the world for the past month it’s overwhelming,” Anna says.
