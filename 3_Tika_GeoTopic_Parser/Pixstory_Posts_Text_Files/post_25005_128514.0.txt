#2. Anfield: The Fortress
The Amazon Prime documentary All or Nothing featuring Arsenal has an episode where Mikel
Arteta schedules a training session with fans chanting “You’ll never walk alone” in big speakers
ahead of their game against Liverpool at Anfield. This is the level of intimidation Anfield strikes at
its opponents.
Liverpool were undefeated at Anfield last season winning 15 out of the 19 matches. It is a
daunting experience for any team to come to Anfield and make a result out of it. It will surely play
a big factor in Liverpool’s title chances if they manage to strike points in all their home fixtures
Fun fact: Virgil van Dijk has never lost a game in Anfield going into his 6th Liverpool season.

#3. Jurgen Klopp
Yes, the final reason is this man. A manager with a CV most of his counterparts dream to have. If
there is any team or a manager who has kept Manchester City on their toes in the past few years,
it is Jurgen Klopp and his Liverpool.

The German has managed to win the Premier League and the Champions League in addition to
the FA and Carabao Cups in 7 years. The Reds registered 2 90+ points seasons under Klopp. If
not for Pep and his magic, Liverpool would’ve had 3 Premier League titles in his tenure.
Liverpool’s sidelines have become hard to imagine without the charismatic character and his
animated reactions. With the squad that he has and his gengenpressing style of play, he can
guide this team of superstars to glory.
