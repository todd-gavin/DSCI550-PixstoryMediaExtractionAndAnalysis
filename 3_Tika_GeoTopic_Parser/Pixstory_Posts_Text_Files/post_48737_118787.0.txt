In the same way that food, healthcare, utilities, and a certain level of sanitation are needed, housing will always be one as well.

Inflationary property markets in big cities consume approximately half of people's wages, leaving them unable to pay even their rent. Housing costs are the same.

A significant source of anxiety is eliminated when one has a place to live and is not concerned about being homeless. That liberates you. True freedom cannot be experienced as long as homelessness is a possibility.

We are not free until all of our people are not free. We are not a great country until all of our countrymen are safe and happy. Housing is a human right, living with dignity is a right. Everybody should be able to exercise it.

The responsibility lies on the government, on the communities, on you and me, and especially on the rich. They need to step up and help!
