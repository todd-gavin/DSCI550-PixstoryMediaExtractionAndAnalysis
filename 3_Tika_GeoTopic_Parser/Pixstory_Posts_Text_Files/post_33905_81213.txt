Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri commented on DAZN&#39;s microphones on the equal of the black and whites against Atalanta We made a lot of mistakes in the final pass in the scoring phase A few minutes of terror for some turnovers in which they restarted but De Ligt sacrificed himself twice Second good time like the first paradoxically on our ball we lost a pass they restarted and Malinovskyi was good It must be said that the team believed in it until the end and Danilo was good at scoring it was a good overall performance McKennie and Rabiot opened up the space for plays by Morata and Dybala They made good triangulations Then there was a moment in which we piled up too much but it was a good match from everyone and technically pleasant We drew an important point we know that Atalanta is a Champions competitor Then whoever asks him if the Scudetto race is officially over he replies It was official even before there are too many points to recover on three teams You always have to win it&#39;s impossible We have to think about fourth place and improve performance For example when the ball is good to score goals you have to have attention and precision to score so that the action turns into a goal I believe that the best attack and the second best defense are in the lead With the exception of Sarri&#39;s Juve who had conceded I think the best defense always wins a goal I have said since September for me Inter wins Con all respect for Milan and Naples but yesterday was an important step for Inter
