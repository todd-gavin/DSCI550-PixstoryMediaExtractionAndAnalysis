It is certainly not a good time to be a Manchester United supporter as the Red Devils are in unknown territory Everything could eventually boil down to Cristiano Ronaldo as the icon could still depart taking away even more positivity from the once great club Yes Cristiano Ronaldo is still a Manchester United player but the rumour mill is still churning It is quite evident that the Portuguese talisman wants to play in the UEFA Champions Lague Hence with days remaining in the transfer window a lot can change within the club Manchester United have made the signings of Lisandro Martinez Christian Eriksen and Tyrell Malacia But the Red Devils have still not dealt with the problem that they have in defensive midfield Yes Fred and McTominay are expected to take the mantle once again But United suffered badly last season especially in their midfield Anthony Martial and Donny Van De Beek are back in the squad after their loan spells Hence Erik Ten Hag would certainly be in the spotlight when it comes to team selections With Frenkie De Jong being rumoured to join the Red Devils could add much needed steel to their squad But Ten Hag is still unproven outside the Eredivisie Hence it would have to be seen if he can guide the Red Devils to a top four finish this time around
