Being a mother has long been considered a sign of completeness and it is so deeply engrained in our culture that marriage has become the licence for having children When we tell women they re incomplete if they re not mothers we re furthering the notion that women exist for the sole purpose of making babies which reduces mothers to some kind of machines Women who choose to be or are mothers are humans And they were always complete A child brings along happiness but is not the only way to happiness Also forcing women to be mothers because of peer pressure is putting not only hers but the child s life at risk A child who will grow up craving the selfless love a parent is supposed to give a child who will constantly see themself as a liability It is selfish to force children to live in such conditions Women are here to do big things They re meant for greater things than to just serve as a man s baby machine Let s put the whole women are incomplete bullcrap in the past and move on
