As a parent there is no worse feeling than when your child is being bullied These are the first words of a mum&#39;s tweet who posted on social media a photo of her son smiling outside the Emirates Stadium the home of Arsenal so sad I really don&#39;t know how to cheer him up morale Relentless darts about his height pushed by boys who are twice his size Here he is happy I want this smile back The cry, the outburst and the appeal of this mother did not go unnoticed by the Gunners striker Alexandre Lacazette The Frenchman is sorry for the story of the little fan replied to the tweet inviting him and his mum to an Arsenal match And added Bullies will never win An exemplary gesture of great value a strong message against bullying
