Minnesota Timberwolves NBA player Anthony Edwards seeks apology over homophobic comments posted on his Instagram
Edwards, 21, shared the video earlier this month using derogatory term for LGBTQ+ community which recieved huge backlash from public.
During the Timberwolves' media day, Edwards apologized in person after previously saying sorry online.
"Man, I respect everybody," Edwards said. "I know what I posted was immature. And I'm sorry for that, if I hurt anyone.
"I'm working with the team and I'm sorry to all the Minnesota fans, and I'm working to be better." 
NBA has also fined Edwards $40000 for 'using offensive and derogatory language on social media'. But the clip has now been taken down by NBA player Edwards.
