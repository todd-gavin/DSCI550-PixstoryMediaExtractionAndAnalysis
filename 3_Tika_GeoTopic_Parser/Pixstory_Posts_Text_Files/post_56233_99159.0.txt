Happy Mother's day to all those who celebrate it today. In UK mothers day is celebrated on on 27 March in the UK, with the date set by the celebration’s Christian foundations as Mothering Sunday.

It always takes place on the fourth Sunday in the festival of Lent, exactly three weeks before Easter Sunday.

Almost 100 countries – including much of Europe, Africa and South America – following the American system and celebrates it on 8th May

Talking about orgins of mothers day in UK, during the middle ages when children who had left their families to work in domestic service returned to their mother or the home. The connection between mothering Sunday and mothers day came when the children returning home started bringing flowers and gifts for their mothers.

Another aspect that made the mothering day to mothers day is because of West Virginia activist, Anna Jarvis, who campaigned for a holiday in honour of her mother, who was a community activist. Anna Jarvis's mother; Ann Jarvis was a peace activist who treated wounded soldiers in the American Civil War.

Her daughter campaigned for a day to honour the part played by mothers following Ann’s death, and the idea gained such traction that by 1911 all US states observed the holiday.

In 1914, it had become so universal that President Woodrow Wilson declared Mother’s Day a national holiday “as a public expression of love and reverence for the mothers of our country”.

Later Jarvis deeply resented the commodificatoon of the holiday that she had created. The commodification of emotional symbols like the white carnation led her to withering criticism and she was even arrested for protesting against organisations selling Mother’s Day merchandise.

Even though it has relations to Christianity it is largely a secular celebration in UK. Here are some other countries that celebrates Mother's day on different days.
