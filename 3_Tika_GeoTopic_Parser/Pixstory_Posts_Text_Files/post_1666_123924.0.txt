A statue that was stolen in 1971 from a temple in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu has been traced to New York, police say.

The 12th Century idol of Hindu goddess Parvati was found at the Bonhams Auction House, a privately owned international auction house in London. 

Police said this idol is valued at $212,575 (Â£175,914). It shows the goddess in a standing position, wearing a crown of rings kept atop each other.

"The sculpture is a testament to the technical genius of the artist, epitomizing the confident and time-honoured aesthetic canon of the Chola empire," the Idol Wing said in a statement. The Chola empire ruled last parts of southern India from the 10th Century to the 13th Century.

The Parvati idol from Tamil Nadu that the police recently found was first reported missing from the Nadanapureshwarar Sivan temple in 1971. Investigation began in 2019 after a temple trustee filed a police complaint. The investigation was led by the Idol Wing of the Tamil Nadu police, which traces missing artefacts.

A senior police official said the Tamil Nadu police's Idol Wing has "readied papers" to bring the idol back. 

Over the past few years, India has amplified efforts to bring back idols and other artefacts which were stolen or smuggled from temples.
