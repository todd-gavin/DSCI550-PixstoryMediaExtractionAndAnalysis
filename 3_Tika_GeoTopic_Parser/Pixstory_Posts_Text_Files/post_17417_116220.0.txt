Lionel Messi has told Paris Saint-Germain he will not discuss the potential for another contract there until after the 2022 World Cup.

PSG have recently indicated a desire to extend his current deal, which expires in 2023, at least for a further year until 2024.

The French club's initial proposal to Messi in 2021, while he was still a Barcelona player, was either a three-year deal or two plus a one-year option. It ended up being two years.

PSG want to build their new era under Christophe Galtier around getting the best from Messi, who has committed to staying at least until the end of his current contract.

Barcelona have also openly talked about Messi one day returning when the club is in a better economic condition.

Messi wants to concentrate on beginning the season well with PSG and then trying to win the World Cup with Argentina, with the November-December tournament in Qatar likely to be his last opportunity.

His club future is therefore expected to be on the agenda next January, when six months will be left on this deal and he will be able to talk to clubs outside France.
