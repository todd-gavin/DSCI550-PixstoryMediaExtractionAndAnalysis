Lil Nas X has taken the world by storm You have to be living under a rock if you haven t heard of him The openly gay rapper has delivered hits after hits throughout his career which is still in its infancy And if you don t know him for his music you might just know him from his funny tweets Lil Nas hit out at BET claiming that they were homophobic in his new video released on Twitter In the video Lil Nas went on an expletive tirade to showcase his new song while dissing BET He hit out them by saying that the homophobic behavior within the Black community is tiring and suffocating He expressed his disappointment about how his own people wouldn t nominate him for awards which he more than just deserves And how the artists he collabed with were individually nominated so that he can be properly excluded When a fan tried to reason with him and defend by saying that many queer artists like Tyler the Creator have been appreciated by BET To which Lil Nas X hit back by saying that Queer artists are only respected when they do less feminine things The whole situation is unfortunate and hopefully a proper resolution can be achieved to close it
