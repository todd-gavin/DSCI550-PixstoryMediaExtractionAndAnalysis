Barcelona midfielder Frenkie De Jong was being scouted by Manchester United for the past few months. However, a recent report suggests that the Dutch midfielder is going to extend his stay in Spain this season. 

As per the Metro, Erik Ten Hag had identified the midfield maestro as his No 1 summer transfer target. However, De Jong is now seemingly "unattainable" and Manchester United would have to do without the services of the former Ajax star. 

Erik Ten Hag is no stranger to Frenkie De Jong, having trained him at Ajax. Together the duo, along with the other players and support staff managed to reach the Semi-finals of the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League season. 

Owing to this, Barcelona paid around Â£75m to secure the midfielder. Fast forward to 2022, De Jong has become a pivotal player at his club. This is also one of the reasons why Barcelona dont want to sell De Jong in the summer despite the interest from Manchester United. 

With De Jong out of the way, it has to be sen if and whom Erik Ten Hag would now go for in the summer window.
