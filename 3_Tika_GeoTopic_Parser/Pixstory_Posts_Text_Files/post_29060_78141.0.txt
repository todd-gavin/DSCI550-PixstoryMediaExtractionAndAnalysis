The climate crisis is something where the consequences are not local, but global. Every human activity, every conscious decision, every innovative idea contributes to this crisis in some way or the other. Being mindful of it all and deriving socially, ecologically nd economically sustainable methods of production and consumption is the need of the hour. A need, that everyone in power must recognise and work for all while empowering their underprivileged counterparts.
