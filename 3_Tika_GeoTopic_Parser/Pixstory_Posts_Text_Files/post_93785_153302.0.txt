The Indian super league 2022-23 edition started off from October 7th with its first clash between Kerala Blasters FC and East Bengal FC at Kochi. 
The 2022/23 season started off well with the runners up of the previous season against East Bengal who finished at the  bottom of the points table. After a 2 year gap due to world epidemic the league is back again from bio bubble to its home and away format. 
The opener of the ISL 2022 ended with Kerala Blasters in the winning side winning the game by 2 goals. Kerala Blasters 3-1 East Bengal. All the goals came in the second half though Kerala dominated in the first half too.
Kerala Blasters dominated the game. The first goal came from Kerala by Adrian Luna in the 72nd minute. Adrian Luna gave Kerala Blasters the lead with an outstanding goal as hedived to meet the long ball from Harmanjot Khabra.
Kerala registered their second goal in the 82nd minute as Ivan Kaliuzhnyi doubled their lead against East Bengal. Kaliuzhnyi ran inside the box and passed the East Bengal defenders with ease and pushed the ball into the right bottom corner.
East Bengal though tried to come back into the game after registering their first goal of the season in the 88th minute by Alex Lima but it didn't help as Kerala scored their third goal in the meantime and again it was Ivan Kaliuzhnyi with a stunner. Kaliuzhnyi strikes it beautifully first time on the volley with his left boot and the ball just flies inside the post. 
Both the teams looked to be at their best though Kerala's defence restricted EB to enter into their zone to score. Entirely a good beginning of the season and fans expect the upcoming games to be more intense and competitive as the opener.
