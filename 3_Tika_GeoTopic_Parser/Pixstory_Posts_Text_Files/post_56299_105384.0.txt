A busy week awaits Darvin Ham, who will be officially introduced as the new Los Angeles Lakers head coach on Monday afternoon.

Ham has started assembling his staff after the franchise confirmed the 48-year-old’s hiring last week. He is expected to enjoy “a large autonomy” in L.A., allowing the first-year head coach to choose his own assistants.

Ham is believed to look for someone with previous head-coaching experience to join his staff. However, his former Detroit Pistons teammate and 2004 NBA champion, Rasheed Wallace, has been named as the first candidate for the assistant job, according to The Athletic’s Shams Charania.

Wallace has worked as an assistant coach with the Pistons in 2013-14 and at the University of Memphis last year. The 47-year-old also served as the head coach of the boys varsity team at Jordan High School in Durham, N.C.

As a player, Wallace was known for his intensity and toughness — which should match Ham’s no-nonsense coaching style. Wallace holds the NBA record for the most technical fouls in a season, receiving 41 techs during the 2000-01 campaign.
