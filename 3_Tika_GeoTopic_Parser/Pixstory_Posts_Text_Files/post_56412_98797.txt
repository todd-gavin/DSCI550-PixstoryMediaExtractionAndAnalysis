In this world of survival we play many games Some pretences some fake smiles some silences and whatnot this easy Is it easy to sleep in guilt for the untold words faked laughter or discomfort The best way to move forward in life is by being yourself Every person is unique and there is no need to fit into an imaginary shell where you pretend to be someone you are not You shouldn t fit into places but be able to build an empire just for yourself You have to compete with yourself Each day try to be a better version of yourself Silences are scary silences are often regrets and silences are never answers Even though you are late speak up for yourself and for things that you don t feel right The world might not have listened to you but make it a habit Grab attention and speak for the things you think should be spoken for Always say no when a boundary is crossed Sadly many have no regard for your silence even though that is a no So try to be brave enough to say a stern no and don t let anyone control you or overpower you Speak honestly about what you feel even though it might hurt the other person It is always good to say the blunt truths than sugar coated words They will know your intention and if not don t forget to leave from where you are not respected or when you feel unwanted Mistakes might happen to you Your judgements might be wrong but it s okay What is not okay is to give up to not make amendments Always think what s done is done what s next Every problem has a solution Take your time to heal and find it and fix it Never prevent yourself from expressing gratitude appreciating and apologizing are the mantras that keep you grounded and easy in this world Have a great day
