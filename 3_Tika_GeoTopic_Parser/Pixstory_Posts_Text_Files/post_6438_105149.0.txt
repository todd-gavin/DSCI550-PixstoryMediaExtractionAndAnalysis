This Moon is quite interesting! It is known to be in Sagittarius and hold magical meaning✨

For the month of June while this moon makes its way through, it’s said that the “ strawberry moon allows room for luck, love, and prosperity, making it the perfect time to manifest your greatest desires.” 

June 14th this is suppose to happen so prepare yourself for greatness to arise. 🧿🪬💕✨

Even if it isn’t love you’re wanting, manifest what it is you want to happen or change during that time. I know I will 🌹
