Numerous states are moving to legalize marijuana for recreational and medical usage There are numerous proponents and opponents of this position The reasons for support differ but they all come down to racism safeguarding drug users and relieving the drug war s strain on our law enforcement resources I shall address each individually Regarding race the historical rationale for marijuana prohibition seems to have racial origins That minorities often smoked marijuana the government could simply imprison them by declaring it illegal To support this idea m any also point out that the substance has several beneficial effects and few negative consequences at least in comparison to other similarly treated narcotics Regarding user safety since marijuana was previously illegal in many places unlicensed and unregulated street dealers would blend their marijuana with other substances in order to boost profits One such item may be the exceedingly lethal fentanyl By legalizing the market and opening the doors to registered and controlled facilities itappears considerably more likely that marijuana consumers will abandon the well known practice of cutting and pay less or perhaps more for the enhanced purity protection and accountability Considering the harmful impacts of marijuana the last point is that the burden placed on law enforcement resources by the war on drugs specifically with regard to marijuana is needless The billions of dollars spent on enforcing marijuana laws prosecuting offenders and placing them in jail for marijuana related charges according to proponents of legalization may be better allocated elsewhere Marijuana is not without flaws and it does have many negative effects such as the fact that it can lead people to use other hard drugs and that it can cause depression addiction stunt the development of young people and lead people to engage in risky behavior while under the influence much like alcohol which is already a major problem Nowadays making a public statement that you do not think children should be able to have a sex change procedure may cause you to lose money have your name destroyed be shunned from numerous social groups and even get you fired
