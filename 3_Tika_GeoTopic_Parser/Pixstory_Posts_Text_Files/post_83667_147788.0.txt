Can you fall in love with your best friend? It's an age-old question, right? Can friends be lovers and can lovers be friends? Well, according to the author F Scott Fitzgerald, who you may know from The Great Gatsby, the answer is yes. He says, "love is simply friendship which has caught fire." And what he means is that friendship can be the spark that ignites love, the start of a great passion and a long-lasting relationship. And yet what he also means is that unless you find friendship within love, you may not have love at all. That to be in love is simply to be with your best friend, to be with the person who means the most to you. And so yes, according to Fitzgerald, friends can become lovers. And yet, in order to be happy lovers, you also have to become friends. So Fitzgerald says, love is friendship, which has caught fire.
