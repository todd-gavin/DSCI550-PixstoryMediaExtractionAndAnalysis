The trailer of Ranbir Kapoor’s new movie, Shamshera is out and after watching the trailer, one thing I want to say is that the teaser of Shamshera created the hype too much because of trailer started looking average, to me at least.

As a Ranbir Kapoor, I want this movie to work but I have mixed emotions right now, but if I talk about the looks of all the actors, that is amazing.

As per the trailer, the movie is set in 1871 but some scenes didn’t match the era of the 1870s.

Shamshera is all set to release on 22nd July exclusively in theatres.
