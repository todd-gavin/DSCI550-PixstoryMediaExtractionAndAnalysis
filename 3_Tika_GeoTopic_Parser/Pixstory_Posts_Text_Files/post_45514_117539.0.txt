To acquire Oleksandr Zinchenko, Arsenal and Manchester City have reached a £32 million
agreement. Personal conditions are not anticipated to be an issue, as the Gunners want to pay
£30 million up front with a further £2 million in add-ons.

The Ukrainian international will now depart from Man City's preseason training camp and join
Arsenal, who are also in the United States, where he will complete the necessary paperwork
and medical procedures.

After Brazilian striker Gabriel Jesus, Zinchenko will join Arsenal from City as the Gunners' second acquisition of the offseason, and their fifth overall, following winger Marquinhos, goalkeeper Matt Turner, and attacking midfielder Fabio Vieira.

Zinchenko, a Shakhtar Donetsk youth product, started his senior career with Ufa in the Russian
Premier League before joining City as a 19-year-old in 2016 after representing Ukraine at the
2016 European Championship.

Zinchenko, who often plays as a midfielder for his country, has frequently been used as a left
back by Pep Guardiola at City. But because Joao Cancelo is the go-to choice on the left side of
defence, he has had trouble getting playing time.

For Ukraine, Zinchenko has appeared in 52 games and scored eight goals. He has played 127
times for City in all competitions, including the Champions League final in 2021, where City lost
to Chelsea. With City, he has four Premier League championships, four League Cups, and one
FA Cup to his name.

Meanwhile, as Sky Sports News reported back in June, Man City are still interested in Brighton's
Marc Cucurella and want to sign a left-back. Brighton does not want to let Cucurella leave since
he still has four years left on his Amex contract, and selling would require a big offer.
