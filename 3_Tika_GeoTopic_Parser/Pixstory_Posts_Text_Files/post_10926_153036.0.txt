Fact-checkers and co-founders of Alt News, Pratik Sinha and Mohammed Zubair, are among the favourites to win this year's Nobel Peace Prize, said an article in Time, published on 4 October, setting off a tsunami of reactions; ecstatic messages from their supporters and many very unkind ones from the right wing ecosystem, three days before the winner is announced (later today).
Nominated individuals are not officially listed. The Nobel Foundation's bylaws prohibit disclosing nomination information to the general public or individuals until 50 years. However, in recent years, a list of the favourites to win is based on nominations made public via Norwegian lawmakers, bookmakers’ odds, and a shortlist of the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO).
Of the 343 candidates – 251 individuals and 92 organisations – for the Nobel Peace Prize—this year’s list of favourites to win includes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Belarusian opposition politician Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Russia’s jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the World Health Organisation (WHO), David Attenborough, Greta Thunberg, Harsh Mander and Karwan-e-Mohabbat, and Sinha and Zubair, among others. 
Zubair and Sinha, PRIO said, were the co-founders of Alt News, “a fact-checking site making significant contributions to debunking misinformation aimed at vilifying Muslims in India.
The winner is chosen by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, composed of five members appointed by the Norwegian parliament. 
Since 2017, Sinha and Zubair have been running a fact-checking website, analysing and dispelling false and propagandist information, a growing menace in India since the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party came to power in 2014. 
A total of 1,527 cases of fake news were recorded in the pandemic year — a 214% increase — against 486 cases in 2019 and 280 cases in 2018, when the category was first included by the National Crime Records Bureau.
