The beloved corgis of Queen Elizabeth have a new home. People reported that according to a source close to the Duke, Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, sometimes known as Fergie, are now the owners of the late monarch's two canines. "The corgis will return to live at Royal Lodge with the Duke and Duchess. It was the Duchess who found the puppies, which were gifted to Her Majesty by the Duke," the insider says.Fergie and Andrew divorced in 1996, although they are still friends and cohabit at their Windsor family home, Royal Lodge.The source adds that Fergie previously "bonded with Her Majesty over dog-walking and riding horses and even after her divorce, she would continue her great friendship with Her Majesty, by walking the dogs in Frogmore and chatting." After receiving her first corgi from her father in 1933, Queen Elizabeth raised more than 30 corgis and "dorgis," or dachshund-corgi hybrids. In the middle of the 2010s, the monarch decided to stop adopting corgis because she did not want to leave any dogs behind after she passed away. She did, however, warmly welcome additional corgis to the royal corgi family in 2021. Prince Andrew gave his mother a new puppy on what would have been Prince Philip's 100th birthday, making a full circle from Elizabeth's first gifted corgi when she was only 7 years old. Elizabeth had received two puppies in March 2021 not long before Prince Philip's death, and she had lost one dog just weeks later.
