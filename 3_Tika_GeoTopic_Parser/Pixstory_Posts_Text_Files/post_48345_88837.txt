 One of the three African American Senators Sen Cory Booker said he was delighted over Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson s historic nomination He said I cannot tell you how happy I am Today we should rejoice because President Biden nominated someone that we ve heard to be the th associate judge of the Supreme Court who is extraordinarily talented and also happens to be a Black woman He said acknowledged that Judge Jackson would also be the first public defender on the nation s court He also mentioned that Jacksons daughters wrote to Barack Obama who was the president back then urging him to nominate her to the Supreme Court He said We re gonna see a new generation of children talking about their mamas and daring to write to the president of the United States that my mom should be on the Supreme Court Meanwhile Sen Tom Cotton a possible Republican Contender for said The progressive left is not just threatening the rights of Americans but our very system of constitutional government Mr Cotton also tied rising crime rates in cities to the judicial system and the judges who populate it He also made a harsh remark that liberal judges who have more sympathy for the victimizers than for the victims are a big part of the problem Sen Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said that her constituents were deeply worried about what kids were being taught in school She even alleged Judge Jackson of upholding the progressive indoctrination of our children Sen John Kennedy stole the show by putting forward a very sensible statement Sometimes justices have to uphold the rule of law when it s not popular with the majority of Americans Boy that s tough It s also important Sometimes the majority can mean just that all the fools are on the same side He also said I believe that the appropriate role of the federal judiciary is the following Federal judges don t make law They don t tell us what the law ought to be They tell us what the law is seems fair to me
