The final episode of Obi Wan Kenobi is due on 22 April, and with that expectations are all over the place being as the show is a total mixed bag . 

The fifth episode was full of many plot holes and while far from perfect, it was a really good episode which got a lot more things right than wrong, one scene of utter perfection, and one scene of utter balls to the wall badass. So what can we expect from the upcoming final episode? Catastrophe or flawed brilliance?
 
The things we should really be getting , but either won’t or will get in some convoluted form:
 
From story points we know that Obi Wan gained the ability to become a Force Ghost from Qui Gonn during his exile on Tatooine at some point.
 
 So hopefully we will see a surprise snippet of Liam Neeson as Qui Gon Jinn talking to Obi Wan in the same way he did with Yoda in the Clone Wars.

Maybe he would finally help his apprentice regain his strength and encourage him to let go of his fear and restore his connection with the Force.
 
Also, another duel between Obi Wan and Vader needs to happen with Obi Wan fighting as an actual Jedi Master and not as some afraid old man barely able to swing his weapon. If not, then the impact of their previous ‘duel’ would be made totally meaningless, and that would be Disney’s biggest middle finger to the Star Wars community and Obi Wan.
 
And, while Reva dying from her wounds would be much better, that is unlikely to happen, so at least she should not be the main character here unlike the previous episodes.
 
This episode needs to focus entirely on Obi Wan Kenobi, you know the title character and Darth Vader, the main antagonist with whom the protagonist shares a deep emotional connection with on every individual level?
 
Finally  this episode needs to be lot longer, though that is unlikely to happen as well.

But if you want no disappointment? Avoid expectations or keep 'em low
