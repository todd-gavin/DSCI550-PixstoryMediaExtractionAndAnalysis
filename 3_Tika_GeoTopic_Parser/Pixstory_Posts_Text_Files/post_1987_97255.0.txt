Two female inmates at a New Jersey prison became pregnant as a result of consensual intercourse with a transgender male inmate. This was made possible by an ACLU's lawsuit, which ultimately resulted in a settlement requiring inmates to be housed according to their gender identity.

We have seen this movement to blur the boundaries between the sexes in an attempt to treat everyone equally. Unfortunately, far too many people have bought into the fallacy that difference is bad and equal is desirable. Everyone is aware that men and women are physiologically distinct. Indeed, what we have here is a failure to comprehend the reality that convicts imprisoned in same-sex prisons for extended periods of time, often years or decades, are denied intercourse with the opposite gender. For many, seeing a biologically male inmate would be akin to a starving animal finally finding food.

What did they think would happen? That merely because a man with male genitalia considered himself to be a woman, he would avoid having sex with female convicts or that female inmates would ignore the presence of a man with male genitalia? It doesn't make any sense.
