The sinking, known as land subsidence, happens when excessive pumping dries out the water reserves underground and collapses the space where water used to be. 

Land subsidence threatens infrastructure, including roads and canals.

Damage from it led to a $3.3 million repair project at a canal in San Joaquin Valley, which delivers water to 1.2 million acres of farmland and 2 million people in the region #sfchronicle
