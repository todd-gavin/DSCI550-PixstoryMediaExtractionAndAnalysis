In a piece of delightful news for all Henry Cavill fans, the actor is most likely to return as Superman in the DC Extended Universe. Cavill, whose 2013 outing as Clark Kent/ Superman in the Man of Steel created a legacy, will '100%' return to the DCEU, according to Hollywood insider AJ. In a series of Tweets, AJ mentioned that Cavill's return has been confirmed by 'trusted sources' and further teased that the 'tides are changing.'
In a recent Tweet, the insider mentioned, "I’ll just say it. Multiple scoopers 100% believe Henry is back, the dm I received said “Cavill's back” This friend who told me this I trust very well and has ALWAYS been sceptical over Cavill and Affleck returning. They are now believing in the idea of Cavill's return."
In a follow-up post, they added, "Before this, it was seen as impossible. But the tides are changing. Something has to be going on."
This post comes shortly after a Twitter Spaces conversation between journalists Erik Davis of Fandango and Umberto Gonzalez from The Wrap. Erik revealed that he "heard a story that they've asked [Henry to return as Superman], and he doesn't want to do it, he doesn't want to come back".
