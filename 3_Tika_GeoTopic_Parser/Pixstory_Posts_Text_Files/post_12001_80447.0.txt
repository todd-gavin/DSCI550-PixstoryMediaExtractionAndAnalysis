The COVID-19 pandemic may play a significant role in the rise of female genital mutilation threatening years of progress made so far and putting at risk 2 million girls in the next decade. A policy briefing from the Orchid Project highlights that school closure and lockdown measures were taken as an opportunity to (re)install female genital mutilation.

As we marked the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation, it is important to recollect the health implications of the practice and understand what key actions should be prioritized to protect women‚Äôs and girls‚Äô health.
