As Indian director Sanjay Leela Bhansali's movie "Gangubai Kathiawadi" premieres in Berlin, DW met lead actor Alia Bhatt, who portrays a sex worker turned underworld leader.

Born in 1993 into a family of prominent Indian filmmakers, Alia Bhatt started acting as a child and is now a superstar in Hindi-language films.

Her films "Highway" (2014) and "Gully Boy" (2019) both premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival. Now Bhatt is back in the German capital to launch her latest work, "Gangubai Kathiawadi," which is directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali and based on the book "Mafia Queens of Mumbai" by S. Hussain Zaidi and Jane Borges.

In the film, she plays a young woman who is betrayed by her lover and sold off to a brothel. Knowing that she cannot return to her family, Gangubai nevertheless manages to become a political leader in Bombay's infamous red-light district of Kamathipura, fighting for the rights of her fellow sex workers.

DW met the actor in Berlin ahead of the world premiere on February 16.
