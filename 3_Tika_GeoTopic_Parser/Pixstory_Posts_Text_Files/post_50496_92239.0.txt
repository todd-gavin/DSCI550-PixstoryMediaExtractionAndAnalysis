I am currently pursuing Biomedical Science which is a medical research course which is quite unpopular in India, so unpopular that approximately only 3 colleges provide this course. But then how did, I land into this? 

I always wanted to become a researcher, when I was in class 9 , I realised , I have  keen interest in studying biology . In the end of class 11 , I concluded that I should specifically lean my career path towards medical research. But I don't want to do MBBS as I want to way out of clinical traditional method. But I even not chose courses like Microbiology, Zoology , Biotechnology as I used to think that for becoming researcher, I should have deep core concept about my subject. So at my bachelor's level I wanted to take  quite versatile course that will end up opening a lot of opportunities for my career. No of the course was so diverse that can provide me flexibility in terms of career after my graduation. After doing intense research on internet , I came across Biomedical Science provide by some colleges of DU. This course was such designed that I can choose any field of medical research.

 I am specifically more interested in Modern Medicine. Upcoming fields in medical research like Stem Biology , Translation Molecular Medicine , CRISPR technology and many more such used to fascinates me. 
I believe these fields will bring  new shape to the world of medicine as even today there is still no cure for many diseases. Modern concepts and fields believe to cure a disease from cell not from a pill. This is what something I understood at the time of  my class 12 Boards itself.

I used to be one of the student who have guts to chose rare, someone who don't go necessarily with the trend or with the crowd, but used to rely on instincts. I remember at the time of my Boards , my all batchmates were preparing for NEET without even  realising whether they are actually interested in doing or not. It's important to go with what our inner soul says!
