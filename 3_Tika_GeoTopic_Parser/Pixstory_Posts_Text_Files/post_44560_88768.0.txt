5. Meaning ‘New Dominion’ or ‘New Frontier’, having been thus renamed when it was conquered by China for the second time in 1750-51. The first time had been in the 2nd Century BCE, when the famous Chinese general Pan Chao (Ban Chao), China’s most-successful expeditionary general ever, conquered, occupied, and held the area, including the repelling of two invasions by the Indo-Aryan Yueh-chi people also known as the Kushan. The second Kushan expedition was led by the Kushan emperor Kanishka himself, whose capital was at Purushapura or Pushpapura, modern Peshawar in Pakistan. The Chinese held this Buddhist area till CE220, when the Han dynasty collapsed. The second Chinese foray into the region was in the 7th Century under the Tang Dynasty, but they were defeated and repelled by the Muslim Arabs who had invaded Central Asia after over-running Iran. The Arabs defeated the Chinese at the battle of Talas, in present-day Kirghizstan, in 751 CE. However, the website of the Chinese Government and Chinese history books say that it has been a part of China since 
60 BCE. This is similar to the official Chinese claim that ‘Tibet has always been a 
part of China’ or that ‘Tibet has been a part of China for hundreds of years’.
