Browsing through the internet is tricky stuff – just ask your parents or grandparents. There’s a lot to it even the snazzy “Gen-Z” don’t understand – for example, SEO. What is it? How does it work? Most people have no clue about this crucial aspect of the internet.

But there are certain things you can do to make the experience of browsing much simpler. If, like millions of others, you use Chrome, you can use “extensions” to surf through the net with relative ease.

Extensions are Chrome add-ons you can download inside the application that perform specific tasks. You can download them from the Chrome web-store, and access them by clicking the small puzzle piece shaped symbol towards the top-right corner of the application.

Here are two extension to make the internet a better space for you:

1) HTTPS Everywhere
Heard of http? What about https? The difference between the two is simple: the former is not that safe, while the latter is encrypted and more secure. This Chrome plug-in will switch any website from the default http to https, making browsing a safer experience.

2) I don’t care about cookies
What the hell are cookies? And why is every website asking me whether I’m okay with them? Clicking “Yes, I agree” so many time can be a real hassle – this Chrome plug-in does the job for you, so that you can focus on reading the content instead of clicking meaningless buttons.
