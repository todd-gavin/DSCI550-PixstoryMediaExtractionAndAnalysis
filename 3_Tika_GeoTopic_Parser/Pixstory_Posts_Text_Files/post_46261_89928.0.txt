Lemme ask You all - How many of you love crying ?? 
Well JK ! No one loves to cry ! 
Crying is a natural response humans have to a range of emotions, including sadness, grief, joy, and frustration. 
Some people cry during commercials, while others only tear up for very sad or happy moments ( Khushi k aasu )❤️. Sometimes, we even cry randomly. Emotional tears make you feel more vulnerable, which could improve your relationships. 
People don't cry because they are "weak" .   
Sharing my own experience - Years back I had a huge need to cry. I had gone through a horrible experience. I felt empty inside and wanted a cry, a good cry, a healing cry, but it was hard to let the tears come. I allowed my tears and sadness to come out !
