According to a NASA official, NASA will find it "challenging" to try again to launch its Moon rocket in October; but, a launch in November is more likely. As Mint reported, NASA's most powerful rocket to date, the SLS, had to be transported back to its storage hangar for the night in order to shield it from Hurricane Ian's approach. The 320-foot-tall rocket must be raised, transported to the launch pad, and then prepared for departure. As a result of the most recent setback, the launch of the much anticipated Artemis 1 mission will be significantly delayed. The following possible launch windows are from October 17 to 31 and from November 12 to 27. The dates are determined by the Earth and Moon's positions."We know that the earliest it could go is late October, but more than likely we'll go in the window in the middle of November," NASA administrator Bill Nelson told CNN.Jim Free, an associate administrator for NASA, said it would be “difficult". However, as per Free, NASA is not taking “anything off the table".
