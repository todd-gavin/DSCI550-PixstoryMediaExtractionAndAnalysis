Excellent movie. Kudos to Vijay Sethupathy, Nithya Menen and rest of the cast. Must watch. I loved the songs. Some people questioned why no details was given re what issues VS character was fighting about. But i think itâ€™s freedom of speech which is the real issue here. I love this kind of movie - slow paced where we can enjoy the simple setting of the movie, the soothing music and meaningful lyrics. Sadly audiences now prefer fast paced, action filled and meaningless songs. and because of that, no one wants to make simple, meaningful movies. Thanks to the director and producer for giving this beautiful movie with my 2 favourite actors - Nithya Menen and Vijay Sethupathy, both of whom can express feelings with their eyes. They dont even need dialogues too.
