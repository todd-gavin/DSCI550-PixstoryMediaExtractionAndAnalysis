Deepika Padukone made her Hollywood debut with the release XXX Return of Xander Cage The actress performance in the film was appreciated and Vin Diesel had also flown down to India for the premiere of the movie It was expected that Deepika will be seen in more Hollywood movies however that didn t happen The actress who will be on the jury at Cannes recently spoke about diversity in Hollywood She stated that currently diversity in Hollywood is surface level and we have a long way to go While talking to Vogue Deepika said Right now the conversation around diversity in Hollywood is surface level The minute you have a Black or Asian actor it s considered diverse casting But we have a long way to go before we start seeing substantial change I feel like percent of the people in charge are still looking at inclusive casting as a box to be ticked No doubt there are some who are genuinely interested in turning the tide but they are getting it quite wrong It s a learning process and I hope it s an earnest one
