We can experience different emotions, whether it's happiness, sadness, or just being pissed off because of something.
All emotions are innate.
Anger is one such natural response to threats, and some kind of anger is necessary for survival.
It can't be considered a negative emotion always.
It does become a problem when you have trouble controlling it, you often do things which you might regret later, but during that point of time, it is uncontrollable.
This is when anger becomes an issue.
"A 2010 study found that uncontrolled anger is bad for your physical and mental health. It can also quickly escalate to verbal or physical violence, harming you and those around you."
Uncontrollable anger is harmful in every way, not because it can only affect the person around you but because what it does to you and your mind is more rigorous and wrong.
