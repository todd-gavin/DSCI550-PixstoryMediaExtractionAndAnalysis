After a recent visit to Tehran by Director-General of International Atomic Energy Agency Rafael Grossi, there has been speculation that the negotiations in Vienna between Iran and the Western powers for reviving the 2015 nuclear agreement have reached the final phase and a deal could be struck anytime.

But the Western powers are accusing Russia of playing spoilsport. After talks between Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, Russia is insisting that it should have equal access to trade with Iran as any other country if the deal is struck. This results from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions against it. Russia is saying that sanctions should not apply for its trade and other relations with Iran. But the Persian nation has indicated that it is not comfortable with this line of argument by Russia. ( https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/world/europe/iran-nuclear-deal-russia-ukraine.html )

"While standing firm in maintaining our red lines, we won't allow any foreign factors to impact our national interests" at the talks in Vienna, Amirabdollahian told lawmakers on Monday indicating that Iran had an ambiguous take on the turn of events. 
 
 Reports in the U.S. and Europe say that a deal at Vienna could ease the pressure on international oil prices as sanctions on Iran would reduce and it can export oil. Crude oil prices have hit multi-year highs after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

US secretary of state Antony Blinken has dismissed Russia's demands as "irrelevant", saying that sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine "have nothing to do with the Iran nuclear deal".  

In the meantime, Iranian top negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani and Deputy EU foreign policy chief Enrique Mora have held talks in Vienna after returning from Iran, and Iran is insisting that it has made its position clear on the way ahead and that other countries should make the "political" decision.

How Iran will view the situation and what will be in its "national interest" would determine the future of a deal.
