In the border state of Punjab, which is third on the list of states with active gun licences in the country, owning a gun is more than a status symbol. In Punjab, there are approximately four lakh active gun licence holders, with each licence allowing for the ownership of three firearms.

Surprisingly, individuals in the state have more weapons than police officers. The estimated number of firearms possessed by Punjab population is roughly 11 lakh, while the state police force has 80,000 officers.

The districts of Muktsar, Sangrur, Hoshiyarpur, Firozpur, Tarn Taran, and Amritsar have the most weapons licences.

The need for guns has led to a demand for illegal weapons that are not only readily available but also affordable:

Country-made handguns, often known as "desi katta," range in price from Rs 2,500 to Rs 15,000 (depending on the model).
Automatic country-made pistols cost between Rs 25,000 and Rs 60,000 for a 0.30 barrel and Rs 50,000 to 1.50 lakh for a 9 mm pistol.
Illegal guns are mostly transported into Punjab from Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.

Last year, Punjab Police busted three illicit weapon manufacture and supply modules in Madhya Pradesh. Baljit Singh alias Sweety Singh, a major supplier, was also apprehended. Baljit Singh is from the Barwani area of Madhya Pradesh.

In 2020, the UP Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) nabbed one guns supplier from Haridwar, Ashish Singh. Ashish Singh, a Meerut native, was supplying the Khalistan Liberation Force with illicit weaponry.

The data comes from a poll conducted by the Punjab Police. This is a severe problem for the country; weapons licences should be limited to one person per household. The most astonishing revelation is that the police themselves have fewer weapons than the Punjabi people.
