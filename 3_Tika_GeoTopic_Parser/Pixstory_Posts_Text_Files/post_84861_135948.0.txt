Girona have reached an agreement to transfer Fulham goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga on loan until the end of the season. The goalkeeper underwent a successful detailed test, following which his transfer was completed.
It is Montilivi's second signing of the day for the goal position as they have also acquired the services of young Toni Fuidias. The Argentine goalkeeper will have to compete with Juan Carlos Martín and Toni Fuidias for the starting position.
Gazzaniga will reunite with coach Michael Sanchez, under whom he worked in the 2016-17 campaign at Rayo Vallecano. That season, he participated in a total of 32 games in the second division.
Announcing the transfer, Girona released a statement which read: “Paulo Gazzaniga has today become Girona's new goalkeeper after the Club and Fulham reached an agreement for the player's transfer.”
Gazzaniga started his professional career at Club Atlético Las Palmas before landing in the youth team of Valencia. It was because of his great performance for Gillingham which helped him get signed for Southampton.
The English team transferred him to Rayo Vallecano in the summer of 2016, where he had a great season. Later on, he went on to play for Tottenham under Mauricio Pochettino, whom he worked with at Rayo Vallecano.
Notably, it will be Gazzaniga’s second life in LaLiga Santander as he played for Elche in the 2020-21 academic year of the First Division.
The 30-year-old goalkeeper has already played 43 games in the Premier League, 5 in the Champions League and 32 in La Liga. He has also been a regular member of the Argentine national team for whom he debuted on November 20, 2018 against Mexico.
Last season, he played a total of 15 games for the English team, where he ended up with four clean sheets to his name.
