A photographer played matchmaker for model and entrepreneur Kate Bock and Cleveland Cavaliers NBA basketball player Kevin Love. The two met in 2015 after individually shooting with the same photographer in New York. “He thought we would be a nice match and set us up on our first date at the St. Regis,” Kate remembers. “From there, the rest was history.”

They started dating shortly thereafter and got engaged in January 2021. “We were celebrating my birthday at one of our favorite restaurants, Lilia, when Kevin got down on one knee and totally surprised me with a beautiful ring that he personally designed,” Kate says. “It was super intimate. I couldn’t imagine it any other way. It was a picture-perfect New York moment.”

They set a date of June 25th at the New York Public Library and enlisted event planner extraordinaire Marcy Blum to oversee all of the planning. She, in turn, collaborated with Mixed Greens Design and Amaryllis Events for decor.

“It was a lot of work, but we had so much fun doing it,” Kate says. “We love being creative, and it was amazing to see the process of how our dream celebration came to life. I create moodboards all the time for my brand Love Kate, so making them for my wedding was natural for me. I would create moodboard after moodboard and ask for Kevin to provide his input. We both envisioned an old-school New York City, Great Gatbsy-inspired, black and white ball for the big day. That was the easy part! The hard part was just making the small detailed decisions—whether it was a specific linen, the seating chart, or where to get ready. Our amazing wedding planner Marcy and her team guided us along and helped us through everything.”
