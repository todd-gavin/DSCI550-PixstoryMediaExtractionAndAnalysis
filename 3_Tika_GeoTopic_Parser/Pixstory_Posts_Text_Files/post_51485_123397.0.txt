In support of Neville’s chat about United’s shortcomings, another legend of the club voiced his thoughts on the club unable to bring new faces in midfield despite showing interest in the transfer market a few days back:

"It's the same characters, same personalities, especially in midfield.

"There is elements of talent in the squad but when they have setback they don't deal with it. I go back to the DNA of the club and culture at the training ground, it's not there. I don't see personalities, I don't see characters.

"Harry Maguire saying it's a nightmare start, it's up to the players to do something about it. He keeps coming out as the captain saying how disappointed they are as a group. 'We go again'.

"Leopards and spots, they must make some changes.

"It's not all about throwing money at it but if these players aren't up to it and good enough for Manchester United."
