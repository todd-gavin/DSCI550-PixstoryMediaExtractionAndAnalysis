Competing with others encourages bitterness not betterment Vex King No two single journeys are the same You re on your own path We all move through life at our own pace and reach different stages at different times Someone else might already be at the most interesting part of their show while you re still making preparations These are the lines taken from the book Good Vibes Good life Let s just admit we all compare ourselves with others everyday atleast people like me do Everytime I see someone doing a thing which I consider productive I ask myself a question Why I am not doing the same This habit actually is the cause of my problem maybe the inner critic in me is too hard is made to be too hard on myself Cause of this can be what I have seen learnt in childhood We have always listened we can still do better yes we got appreciation but never really asked to celebrate what we got we are always asked for betterment I know improvement is important but now I am learning that it s important to celebrate the achievement And about bitterness yes that always increase in me after comparison not for others but for myself And I am learning to decrease this bitterness Thank you for reading Hope you also don t compare yourself with others
