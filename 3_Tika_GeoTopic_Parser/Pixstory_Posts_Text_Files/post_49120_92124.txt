Yes and now let s talk about what happens when drugs are legalized If heroin is legalized its price will drop dramatically hypodermic needles will be freely available at the local drug store and narcotics will be available for purchase anywhere There would be no financial or medical reason to abstain from using drugs Legalizing heroin in the United Kingdom did not work mostly because of increased addiction The current crack epidemic is significantly more serious than the heroin epidemic Crack addicts and their effects obliterate almost all other considerations including work sleep food family and children Crack abuse is not a victimless crime users frequently neglect their children as well as their employers and coworkers as a result of their sluggishness and carelessness The percentage of occasional cocaine users who become binge users does not necessarily imply the number of people who would become addicted if the substance is legalized but it is likely to rise Illegal drugs increase crime partially because some users turn to crime to fund their addictions and partly because some users are driven to act more violently by certain drugs Legalization on the other hand will have no effect on addiction or its implications on the likelihood of violence Rather than legalising drugs greater treatment education and research are required to reduce drug dependency and the negative health and societal consequences of drug use Criminalization may not end the current addiction but it can surely prevent sny future ones
