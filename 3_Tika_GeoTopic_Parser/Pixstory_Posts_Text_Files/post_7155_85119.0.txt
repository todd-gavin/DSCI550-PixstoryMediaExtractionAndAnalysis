22 yards of deceit continues………

Public and media reactions ranged from shock, utter disbelief to revulsion. Strong denials followed from Hansie Cronje with the South African Cricket Board and Hansie’s teammates rallying behind him. Incurable critics and detractors of the Delhi Police continued to be skeptical of the expose despite the transcripts of Hansie’s telephonic intercepts being made public.

 It was the voice of a man who had waged a fierce and lonely battle with himself, before deciding to surrender to his own conscience, a man who would turn the cricketing world topsy-turvy with an intrepid confession that was, at the time, like a bolt of verbal lightning from the blue. Hansie Cronje did not mince words and it did not take long for Ali Bacher to realize their enormous import.

 All sleep deserted Bacher as the South African captain told him that ‘he had been dishonest’ in his activities on the last tour of India and confessed to have received huge sums of money from ‘undesirable people’.
