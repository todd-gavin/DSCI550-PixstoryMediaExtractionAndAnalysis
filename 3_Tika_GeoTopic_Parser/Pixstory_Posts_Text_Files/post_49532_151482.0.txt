Russian President Vladimir Putin will not frighten the United States or NATO, according to President Joe Biden, who also said that the Western alliance will defend "every inch" of its territory in the event of an attack.
In remarks delivered at the White House, Biden declared, "America and its allies are not going to be intimidated," he added, "Putin is "not going to scare us."
After that, Biden addressed the head of the Kremlin directly, pointing his finger at the camera and issuing a warning against any attack that would spread beyond Ukraine and into NATO territory.
“America’s fully prepared, with our NATO allies, to defend every single inch of NATO territory,” he said. “Mr Putin, don’t misunderstand what I’m saying: every inch.”
