The mai pooja signals the beginning of Bundelkhandi wedding rituals. This is a rare ceremony of women, by women, for women, where women invite their friends, basically the whole village, for an entire day of song and fun. This is also rare because the bride gets to have fun too. She gets to leave the four walls of her house and just chill outside. The searing heat and the long walks to and from the river are forgotten in the company of friends. 

Before you think which goddess is this Mai, let me tell you that mai is the puri they all make together and eat later. 
Worshipping puris, we can get onboard with that. 

The song itself is a remix of many songs sewn together and the new song is lilting and delightful too. 

Sarayu Nadi ke teere nazariya,
Mudariya dono gabha ke beech me. 

Mai pujan ki June re ram vanvas nikal gaye 
Bhavra khelan na jaaye galiyan me. 

Sone ki thali me khana parosa 
Bhavra khelan na jaaye galiyan me
Paana pacheesi ke beera lagav rahe na shyam galiyan me. 

(Our eye is on the Sarayu river, 
But our mind is on the ring wedged between our toes dug in the river bed lest it slips away. 

June is the month of mai, when we come out on the streets as if we are walking in exile
So you friends of flowers, bees, don't come out to play now. 

Shyam, or Krishna, is also coming to taste twenty five different paans we have prepared on a golden plate,
So you friends of flowers, bees, don't come out to play now. )
