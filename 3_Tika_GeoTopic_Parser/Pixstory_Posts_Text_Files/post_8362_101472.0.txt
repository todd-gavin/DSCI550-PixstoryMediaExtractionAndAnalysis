The 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR ‘Uhlenhaut’ Coupe was sold at a private auction for a whopping €135,000,000. 

For the vintage beauty been owned by Mercedes-Benz since 1955, the winning bid came from a private collector who has just bagged themselves not only one of the most beautiful cars ever built, but one of “the great jewels of motoring history".

The invitation-only auction took place on May 5 at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, Germany, the auction house said, adding that the vehicle’s high price places it in the “top 10 most valuable items ever sold at auction in any collecting category".


Note: Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut was sold for almost triple ($142 million) the previous record price for a car, set in 2018 by a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO that went for over $48 million.
