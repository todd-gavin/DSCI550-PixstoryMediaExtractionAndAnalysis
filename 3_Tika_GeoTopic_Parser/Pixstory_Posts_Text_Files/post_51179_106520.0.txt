INGREDIENTS OF CHEESY TORTILLA WRAP
4 Servings
4 tortillas
1/2 cup grated low fat mozzarella cheese 🧀 
1 cup sliced & slit baby onions🧅 
1/2 cup sliced & slit tomato 🍅 
1 cup chopped into cubes paneer 
1/4 cup green chutney 
1/4 tablespoon tamrind chutney
2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil 
      - You can take toppings of your choice☺️

Step 1 :
Make Four Sections On Your Tortilla
Take the tortilla and divide it into four sections. The four different sections will have different ingredients. Make a half vertical cut on the tortilla so that it gets wrapped easily.

Step 2 :
Add In The Delightful Chutneys
Start by adding tamarind and green chutneys to one part of the tortilla. Spread it evenly so that you get a chatpata flavour in the tortilla.🌮🫔

Step 3 :
Put Paneer Cubes In The Second Portion
It's time for some protein, so add the paneer cubes to the second portion (vertically). You can also add tofu instead of paneer cubes. Make sure the paneer cubes are chopped into small cubes. In the third portion, add tomatoes and onions.

Step 4 :The Main Element Cheese Goes In The Last Part The fourth portion has the star element of the recipe, i.e., cheese. Add grated cheese and then wrap the tortilla starting from the side which was slit vertically.

Step 5 :
Grill The Tortilla
Once, you have wrapped your tortilla well, heat some ghee on a grilling pan and then put the tortilla on it. Cook it from both sides carefully till the cheese melts properly. And it's done. Your cheesy tortilla wrap is ready. The perfect meal for your dinner.🌮
