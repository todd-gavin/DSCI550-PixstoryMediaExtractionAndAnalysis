NWSL club Racing Louisville have traded Ebony Salmon to Houston Dash for $150,000 in 2022 allocation money & $25,000 in 2023 allocation money. The trade also includes an additional $15,000 in the form of performance-based incentives for the 2022 season. 

The 21-year old English forward has signed a contract extension with Houston until the end of the 2023 NWSL regular season. Dash already have players like Rachel Daly, Maria Sanchez, Nichelle Prince but Ebony’s arrival will further strengthen their attack. 

A product of the Aston Villa Academy, Salmon was a part of the Manchester United side which was reformed in 2018 but unfortunately she didn’t make a single appearance for the Red Devils. After a loan spell at Sheffield United, where she managed to score 7 goals in 9 appearances, Ebony joined Bristol City in the WSL where she spent two years. Salmon scored 18 goals in all competitions over the two seasons. 

In 2021, she joined Racing Louisville and coincidentally made her NWSL debut against Houston Dash; Salmon came off the bench and scored the only goal of the game, that too within a minute of stepping on the pitch. In the 2021 NWSL regular season, Salmon was the top scorer for Racing Louisville. 

She didn’t play much for Louisville this season, partly due to managerial changes as interim head coach Mario Sanchez was permanently replaced by Kim Björkegren as the head coach of the Kentucky based club. 

With Rachel Daly being involved with the England national team for the Euros, Salmon’s addition will boost Houston’s chances during this period as they face Kansas City, Orlando, Chicago and Gotham in July.
