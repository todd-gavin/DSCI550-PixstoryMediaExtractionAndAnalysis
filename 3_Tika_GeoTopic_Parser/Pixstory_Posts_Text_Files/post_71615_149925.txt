Prologue continues Gandhi was a phenomenon unfathomable and inscrutable to ordinary men He was intensely spiritual and at the same time very political He was an idealist and his concerns were about the moral and spiritual well being of humanity But he was also a hardcore pragmatist who fashioned political strategies to deal with the most hard headed British rulers There is an interesting chapter in Nehru s autobiography titled Paradoxes in which Pandit Nehru analyzes the paradoxical traits in Gandhi He writes He is an extraordinary paradox I suppose all outstanding men are so to some extent For years I have puzzled over this problem why with all his love and solicitude for the underdog he yet supports a system which inevitably produces it and crushes it why with all his passion for non violence he is in favour of a political and social structure which is wholly based on violence and coercion Perhaps it is not correct to say that he is in favour of such a system he is more or less a philosophical anarchist The greatest paradox is that this philosophical anarchist led history s biggest mass movement against colonialism by strictly adhering to ahimsa or non violence He disapproved of individual acts of violence by young revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh Rajguru Chandrasekhar Azad Ram Prasad Bismil and others There was no place for any kind of violence in his plan of action Nevertheless the impatient youth resorted to violence resulting in the killings of some Britishers The people hailed them as heroes Bhagat Singh threw a bomb in the Central Legislative Assembly which is the present Lok Sabha to wake up the deaf rulers After throwing the bomb he did not try to run away but let the police arrest him Bhagat Singh was the symbol of unparalleled courage who was considered a grave threat to the empire He was charged with sedition and hanged along with his associates on March To be continued
