Cosmic rays are atom fragments that rain down on the Earth from outside of the solar system They blaze at the speed of light and have been blamed for electronics problems in satellites and other machinery Discovered in many things about cosmic rays remain a mystery more than a century later One prime example is exactly where they are coming from Most scientists suspect their origins are related to supernovas star explosions but the challenge is that for many years cosmic ray origins appeared uniform to observatories examining the entire sky A large leap forward in cosmic ray science came in when the Pierre Auger Observatory which is spread over square kilometers or square miles in western Argentina studied the arrival trajectories of cosmic particles It concluded that there is a difference in how frequently these cosmic rays arrive depending on where you look While their origins are still nebulous knowing where to look is the first step in learning where they came from the researchers said The results were published in Science Cosmic rays can even be used for applications outside of astronomy In November a research team discovered a possible void in the Great Pyramid of Giza which was built around B C using cosmic rays The researchers found this cavity using muon tomography which examines cosmic rays and their penetrations through solid objects
