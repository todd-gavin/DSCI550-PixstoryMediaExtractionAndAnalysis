Ever felt you have a million things to express but when your about to confess your feelings suddenly your speechless in front of your ❤🥺. 

Well love is it self a magical world ✨🎩🔮 once your in love i assure you'll realize of another version of yourself. Love is a very beautiful feeling you would ever felt in your life💕

There is no right or wrong when in love nor there is a proper way to love. Love happens in any movement it's inevitable but what matters is who choose to stay in love or just leave. 

I'm in love with someone from past few months. The person I'm in love with is just like my dream boy, I fell for him at the first sight. Even though that person doesn't what to get into any relationship right now he constantly shows his love towards me. We have gone throw times which were crucial, number of fights between us. We both decided to wait for the time to decide our destiny. I'm still deeply in love with that person❤ i wish destiny will bring us together👫🤞🥺 

I have lot of things to express with him but... I just can't explain my feelings when he is listening it's like I no longer can speak. My heart feels so heavy with all the love I have for him. 

How can I express my feelings? How can I make him understand my love for him? Is there a language of love? Can we be together? Ahh... I have lots of questions in my mind.
