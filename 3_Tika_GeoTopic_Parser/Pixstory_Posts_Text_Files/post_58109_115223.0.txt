Pasteurization (or pasteurisation) is the process by which heat is applied to food and beverages to kill pathogens and extend shelf life. Typically, the heat is below the boiling point of water (100 °C or 212 °F). While pasteurization kills or inactivates many microorganisms, it is not a form of sterilization, because bacterial spores are not destroyed. Pasteurization extends shelf life via heat inactivation of enzymes that spoil food.
