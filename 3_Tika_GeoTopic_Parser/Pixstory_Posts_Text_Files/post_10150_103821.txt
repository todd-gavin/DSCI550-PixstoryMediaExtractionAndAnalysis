This morning I was walking upstairs from the kitchen carrying your beautiful flowers the flowers you brought me last night calla lilies and something else I am not sure what to call them white flowers of course you had no way of knowing it has been years since I bought white flowers but now you have and here they are again I was carrying your flowers and a coffee cup and a soft yellow handbag and a book of poems by a Chinese poet in which I had just read the words come or go but don t just stand there in the doorway as usual I was carrying too many things you would have laughed if you saw me It seemed especially important not to spill the coffee as I usually do as I turned up the stairs inside the whorl of the house as if I were walking up inside the lilies I do not know how to hold all the beauty and sorrow of my life
