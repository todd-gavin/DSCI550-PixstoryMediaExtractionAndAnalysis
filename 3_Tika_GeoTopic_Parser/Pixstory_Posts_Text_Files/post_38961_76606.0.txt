Four things changed this Republic Day of Bharat and this is historic. If anyone feel bad then either they are very much obsessed with Britishers or they are illiterate/ignorant about real history. 

1. Musical Tune of Beating Retreat ceremony changed from ‚ÄúAbide with me‚Äù  written by Audrey Assad to ‚ÄúAye Mere Watan Ke Logo‚Äù written by Bhartiya Poet Pradeep. 

2. Statue of Netaji Shubhash Chandra Bose will be placed at Canopy near by India Gate where King George V used to be placed till 1965 (18 years since Independence) - This actually shows How Congress and Nehru never got us Independence. If you have a little shame then you will read how Nehru used to even report every Intelligence to Britishers till 1962. A Shame I feel on my forefather How we all have accepted this without a fight and How we celebrated Republic Day for 18 years in front of King George V statue. 

3. Republic Day Celebration will now be of 4 days starting 23rd January instead of 24th January till 27th January in order to include Netaji Birthday in the celebration. On this coming Birthday (125th Birthday) PM Modi will be place hologram at canopy till Granite Statue built. 

4. Eternal Flame of Amar Jawan Jyoti is combined and shifted to rightful location of National War Memorial along with War Memorial Flame. This Flame actually started in 1972 after 25 years of Independence and for 7 decades we can‚Äôt even build our own memorial. Now PM Modi built National War Memorial, Hence it is rightfully moved. 

These four changes are not just symbolic but a beacon for coming Future of Bharat. It is an answer that we are now no more oppressed but a rising power.
