It's become more and more of a modern footballing tradition to have mosaic's of the club
emblem matted onto the floor at stadiums. Most modern day stadiums are equipped with
huge crests on the floors inside tunnels.

What has also become an increasingly noticeable trademark is footballers walking around
these crests instead of over them, so as to highlight respect to either their own team or the
opposition. A very similar incident happened at the Etihad Stadium on Monday before Diego
Simeone's Atlético Madrid squad got a feel of their opponent's stadium.

In a video that has since resurfaced on social media, the likes of Angel Correa, Luis Suarez
and Rodrigo de Paul can be seen walking out of the wide tunnels at City. As they approach
the City crest, Suarez makes a comment in Spanish and respectfully steps aside, walking
around the mosaic. The tunnels at the Etihad are also plastered with memorabilia from City's
most famous victories in recent years.

In another video that later went viral on twitter, Antoine Griezmann can be seen walking
through the very same tunnel in his usual playful element. The Frenchman moves about
doing a comical dance, stepping right over the City badge in the process. One should
suppose that It's more about choice than anything with this kind of gesture.

Some footballers choose to do it, others like Griezmann aren't so mindful. It mustn't
necessarily come across as disrespectful. Vinícius Júnior was recently seen skipping over
the Madrid crest inscribed onto a mat at the Bernabeu.

Dani Alves and Erling Håland have in the past caught attention for walking past club crests
too. The Norwegian memorably did it at the Etihad two years ago, which got a lot of City fans
on the Internet talking. Regardless of how footballers choose to approach them, matted
crests do seem to be a growing theme in some of Europe's elite stadiums.
