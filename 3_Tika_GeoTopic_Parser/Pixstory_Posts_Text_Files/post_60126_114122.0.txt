New court records reveal that Elon Musk had two children in 2021 with Shivon Zilis, a senior executive at his artificial intelligence startup Neuralink.

With Justine Musk, his first wife, and two children from his second marriage to artist Claire Boucher, better known by her stage name Grimes, the world's richest man is now known to have nine children in all.

Insider was able to get court records proving that Elon Musk and Zilis petitioned to have the names of their twin children changed to "have their father's last name and incorporate their mother's last name as part of their middle name."

The judge granted the petition, which was submitted in Austin, Texas, the city where the infants were born. A few weeks before Musk and Boucher delivered their second kid through surrogate, Zilis reportedly gave birth in November 2021.

Zilis, 36, a Canadian-born economics and philosophy graduate of Yale, began his career at IBM before moving on to Bloomberg Beta, a venture capital firm. She has been included on LinkedIn's 35 Under 35 and Forbes' 30 Under 30 lists, where she is recognised as a rising star in the field of artificial intelligence.

Musk has previously advocated for boosting the birth rate, warning that "civilization is going to implode" if people don't have more kids. He recently commented on the dropping US birth rate on Twitter, "I mean, I'm doing my part hehe."
