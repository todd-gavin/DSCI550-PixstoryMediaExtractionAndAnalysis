A couple in the United Kingdom recently won a court case against the the UK Department of Education after the elementary school of their child sent them a letter educating that if their child did not refer to a transgender student by their preferred pronouns then both they elementary school age child would be deemed transphobic As a result of this win the education department must now reevaluate its transgender guidance for students How can a child be called trans phobic The issue that these far left educators somehow fail to comprehend is that the idea of transgenderism is only easy to learn in a vacuum but when you bring in the reality is of every day life it gets more complicated and extremely difficult to teach The end result is that students will feel compelled to follow along or face penalty rather than actually understand it voluntarily abide by it Transgender s make up a fraction of a fraction of a percent of every population Therefore young children often will not be exposed to transgender normally Instead children will associate male and female with their respective average characteristics Never mind the complexities of even understanding how or why somebody would change genders and how difficult that would be for a child to understand but now these schools expect children to forget how to apply common sense and to make fair assumptions and instead abide by their rules to make a few people happy
