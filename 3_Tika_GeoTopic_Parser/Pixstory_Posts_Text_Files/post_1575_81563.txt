Reality point number two The Kings needed to choose between one of their two star point guards and needed to get the biggest bang for their buck It was not an option to not trade one of them The longer they played together the more both players stock fell When Halliburton played without Fox his numbers skyrocketed which really helped the Kings when it came to trading him The same has been true for Fox as he has averaged over points a game since Haliburton was traded Once you accept this reality one fact become clear The Kings needed to trade the point guard who would bring back the most talent in a trade Fox on his own would not have brought back a time All Star like Sabonis Fox is paid million a year more than Sabonis so the Kings would have needed to send Fox who has never been an all star as well as more assets to make the salaries match This was much less attractive than acquiring Haliburton and filling in more expiring salary and or desirable players This is exactly what was done Hield had become just a marginal asset because of his notoriously bad defense Bad decision making in declining shooting They clearly weren t able to fetch a better talent by simply treating him straight up This was the perfect situation to add in his salary and sweeten the deal Maybe Haliburton will turn out to be an all star I hope he does He s a great player I truly think this was a good example of a trade that helps both teams The kings can t afford to keep waiting to rebuild They did not mortgage their future with this move at all Sabonis is only years old and they didn t trade any of their picks Time will tell how the players match together but the early results look very good The key point is the kings needed to make a trade and they needed to bring back young talent Sabonis was the best and youngest talent out there besides Simmons and they got him without trading away any picks Grade B
