5. 'Let's talk about Cesc baby, let's talk about Flam-in-i, let's talk about Theo Walcott, Freddie Ljungberg and Henry, let's talk about Cesc.'

This, obviously, was sung by Arsenal fans as praise for their players. It was sung to the tune of the song ‘Let’s talk about sex baby’. 

4. “3-0, and you can’t get home, 3-0, and you can’t get home”

This was again sung by Arsenal fans when they were 3-0 up against Stoke City in a certain match and there were announcements of trains being cancelled. 

3. “He’s coming for you!

He’s coming for you!

Harry Potter is coming for you!”

West Ham fans sang thus during a match against Liverpool because rival player Jonjo Shelvey looked a lot like Lord Voldemort, the famous antagonist of the Harry Potter series. 

2. ‘Steve Gerrard Gerrard,

He slips on his f*cking arse,

He gave it to Demba Ba,

Steve Gerrard Gerrard…’

This needs no introduction. Steven Gerrard’s infamous slip against Chelsea at Anfield in the league deciding match of the 2014 Premier League cost Liverpool the title and there were a lot of chants made about it. This was one of the funniest. 

1. ‘Oh Romelu, Lukaku,

He’s our Belgian scoring genius,

With a 24-inch penis,

Scoring all the goals,

Bell-end by his toes…

Manchester United fans made this chant famous when they signed Romelu Lukaku from Everton in 2017.
