One of my favourite things about Australia is its sass! 

For tourists, if you're looking for a taste of Australian sass, look no further. As culture trip says, begin with this joke from Bob Hawke, the former Prime Minister of Australia. Australia is a place where saying 'G'day, friend' to your boss is appropriate; where swear words are thrown around the dinner table as generously as salt and pepper; and where we slag off our politicians while also taking the piss out of ourselves. 

No, Australians aren't really good at the whole'solemn reverence' thing. 

Moreover, I just love how Australians are egalitarian. The idea of a "fair go" — the view that everyone should be given an equal chance — is a concept that Australians hold in high regard, manifesting itself in widespread support for publicly supported education and healthcare. Australians pride themselves on that deep-seated egalitarianism, shaking off the pompous class system of the historic motherland, Britain.

But, the nasty affliction known as 'tall poppy syndrome,' where people are disparaged for their perceived money, success, or status, is a result of that irreverent, egalitarian mindset. The adoration of an underdog in Australia culminates in derision for a tall poppy, who is inevitably chopped down to size once their boots become too big.
