Brahmastra has been the talk of the town . Everybody is excited for Bollywood 's attempt at creating a film with a concept like  MCU universe  . The storyline and VFX definitely look promising and with top actors like Ranbir , Alia and Amitabh Ji everyone has great expectations for the it. 

But apart from all this , someone else caught my attention in the trailer, Mouni Roy . Yes Mouni Roy even though she had limited screen time her  villain look mesmerized me. Her long hair , the dress , plus the delivery of the dialogue" hamara ek maksad Brahmastra" were very intriguing. I have always loved Iconic villanous characters but sadly they are so  hard to come by in Bollywood movies. I sincerely hope they gave Mouni ,the role of a great and nuanced villain. I will definitely watch the film for the story , VFX and Mouni .
