China women’s 17 start their World Cup campaign with a  2-1 over Mexico women U17.
Mexico women were in great command and were led by in the first half after being awarded the penalty as Chinese defender Huang Jiaxin committed a handball inside the box, but Maribel Flores' hit the crossbar and failed to put Mexico ahead. 
Mexico were punished for lack of cutting edge upfront instantly after failing to go front im score line as China opened the scoring in the second half when Huang was tumbled down in the box, giving China's captain Qiao Ruiqi the chance to step up and convert the subsequent penalty.
China once again found the net when Yu Xingyue tipped the ball home in a counter-attack in the 90th minute. As the match was reaching it’s closing stage Mexico reduced the deficit as Katherin Guijarro scored one.
 Mexico almost salvaged a point in the last second but China were lucky as their goalkeeper Liu Chen made an impressive save from Valerie Vargas  volley.
Both the team were dominating but China came above as they had end product and build up on this in their next game, while Mexico will look to bounce back in subsequent match and hopefully make it into the round of 16.
