 With unfailing kindness your life always presents what you need to learn Whether you stay home or work in an office or whatever the next teacher is going to pop right up Life always gives us exactly the teacher we need at every moment This includes every mosquito every misfortune every red light every traffic jam every obnoxious supervisor or employee every illness every loss every moment of joy or depression every addiction every piece of garbage every breath Every moment is the guru Most of our difficulties our hopes and our worries are empty fantasies Nothing has ever existed except this moment That s all there is That s all we are Yet most human beings spend to percent or more of their time in their imagination living in fantasy We think about what has happened to us what might have happened how we feel about it how we should be different how others should be different how it s all a shame and on and on it s all fantasy all imagination Memory is imagination Every memory that we stick to devastates our life It s of no use to look back and say I should have been different At any given moment we are the way we are and we see what we re able to see For that reason guilt is always inappropriate Joko Beck
