Because I could not stop for Death –
He kindly stopped for me –
The Carriage held but just Ourselves –
And Immortality.
We slowly drove – He knew no haste
And I had put away
My labor and my leisure too,
For His Civility –
We passed the School, where Children strove
At Recess – in the Ring –
We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain –
We passed the Setting Sun –
Or rather – He passed Us –
The Dews drew quivering and Chill –
For only Gossamer, my Gown –
My Tippet – only Tulle –
We paused before a House that seemed
A Swelling of the Ground –
The Roof was scarcely visible –
The Cornice – in the Ground –
Since then – 'tis Centuries – and yet
Feels shorter than the Day
I first surmised the Horses' Heads
Were toward Eternity –

This poem is a typical example of the formalist theory of criticism. Formalism argues that the form of the poem is the most important element in a poem. This poem senses movement through the metaphor of the wheel in the structure of poetry. The wheel from life to death to immortality. She personifies the death of a gentleman who came in a carriage. In this poem, the punctuation attributes meaning to the lines. In the third line, the full-stop represents, death and from the next line, she moves towards the afterlife. The poem shows how everything in life passes in front of you like a film at the time of death and finally; the journey according to the poet has no end but eternity. The hyphen helps in the effect of movement in the poem. The final hyphen instead of a full stop denotes; the unending journey towards eternity. The poem is rich in alliteration and metaphors which brings life to the poem. Emily Dickenson's poems were published after her death hence the title and the first line of the poem remains the same.
