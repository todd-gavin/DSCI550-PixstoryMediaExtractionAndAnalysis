Dear Earth,

I have pledged to make sure that at the individual level I will not try to do anything which will harm you and will adopt measures that are going to ReFrame you.

I will definitely make an impact by influencing people to adopt sustainable measures of livimg which will protect you from this Global Warming.

I have taken a single step by adopting the practice of using solar devices.

I urge every one else to do the same.

Let's ReFrame our habits to sustainable ones.
