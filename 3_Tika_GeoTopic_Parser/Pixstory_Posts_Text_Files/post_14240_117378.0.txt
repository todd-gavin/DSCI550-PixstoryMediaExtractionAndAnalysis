Matthijs de Ligt will not be a Juventus player next season.

After three years in Juventus, the Dutch defender leaves Turin for Germany on a permanent move to Bayern Munich.


Arriving in Turin in 2019, Matthijs was an important addition to the Juventus defence, fully employing both his physical and technical skills, as confirmed by the results obtained together - a Serie A title, an Italian Cup and an Italian Super Cup.

ln his 109 appearances in all competitions as a starter, more than any other outfield player over the last three seasons, the Netherlands international put together some impressive stats: he completed 6160 passes, five of his eight goals were headers, he made a total of 339 clearances and blocked 86 shots.  

Numbers that say total commitment, consistency, and a desire to always give one’s all. Numbers for which we can only thank him.
