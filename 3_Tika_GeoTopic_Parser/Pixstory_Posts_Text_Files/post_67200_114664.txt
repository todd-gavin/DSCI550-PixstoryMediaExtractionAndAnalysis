NOTHING TO LOSE NOTHING TO HIDE A stream flows by Babbles and sparkles Trickles to meet the river Gurgles and laughs Breaking all silence I hold onto my solitude Nothing to lose Nothing to hide A stream flows by A haunting melancholia Dominates my mind Sorrows and pain I drown within The story of a Meandering blue Is nothing but true It s time to rise Time to forget the lies The grey sky above Sets the stage Drama unfolds Love uncaged A blank canvas Screams loud Ready to be coloured With new things Why emptiness howls Like a child A stream flows by Breaking the silence Of my heart A stream flows by Trickles to meet the river I hold onto my solitude I have nothing to lose Nothing to hide NANDINI MITRA JULY
