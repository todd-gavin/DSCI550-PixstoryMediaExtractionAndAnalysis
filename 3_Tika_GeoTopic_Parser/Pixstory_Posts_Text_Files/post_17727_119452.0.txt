Brendan Fraser is back . The first trailer for Darren Aronofsky's forthcoming movie "The Whale," in which Fraser plays an obese guy who strives to reestablish contact with his daughter, 17, has been published by A24. The movie is Aronofsky's first to be directed since "mother!" received mixed reviews from reviewers and audiences. After it was confirmed that "The Whale" will make its global debut at the 2022 Venice Film Festival, the first image of the film became available.

The "Stranger Things" fan favourite Sadie Sink, Hong Chau, Samantha Morton, and Ty Simpkins are among the cast members of "The Whale," which also stars Fraser. Matthew Libatique, who previously captured Olivia Wilde's Venice premiere of "Don't Worry Darling," is once more working with Aronofsky. Every Aronofsky film to date has been filmed by Libatique, with the exception of "The Wrestler," which was filmed by Maryse Alberti.

Regarding his performance in "The Whale," Fraser promised Unilad last year: "It's going to be like something you haven't seen before. Really, that's all I have to say. The clothing and wardrobe were enormous, seamless, and heavy. To be honest, this is really different from anything I've ever done. I am confident that it will leave a lasting impact.
Fraser played a supporting role in Steven Soderbergh's "No Sudden Movie" the previous year, but his starring role in "The Whale" represents a significant return for the actor after the direct-to-DVD action film "Breakout" in 2013.In addition, Fraser will play antagonist Garfield Lynns/Firefly in the next DC tentpole "Batgirl," which will air on HBO Max later this year, and in Martin Scorsese's Apple western "Killers of the Flower Moon."
