Despite some difficulties on Wednesday a critical fuelling test for the Artemis I massive moon rocket has succeeded according to a NASA official CNN reported that when the mission embarks on its orbital trek around the moon and back will be decided by the test results According to Charlie Blackwell Thompson launch director for NASA s Exploration Ground Systems Program at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida all of the goals we set out to perform we were able to fulfil today The Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System rocket are still on the Kennedy Space Center launchpad in a secure condition It was further reported that NASA engineers detected a liquid hydrogen leak during Wednesday s test that had the same signature as a leak that prevented the September launch attempt However their troubleshooting efforts appeared to allow the team to manage the leak Afterward they did not see the same leak signature which was wonderful Blackwell Thompson said According to a Monday update from NASA officials the test was designed to bring the liquid hydrogen tank up to the pressure level it will experience just before launch while engineers calibrate the settings for conditioning the engines at a higher flow rate as will be done during the terminal count By enabling teams to dial in the appropriate settings and validate timeframes before launch day lowering schedule risk during the launch countdown it would lower the possibility of a launch delay
