The very delicate challenge at the Due Strade di Firenze All in the field for the last day of Group C of Tuscan Excellence The teams fighting not to relegate are called to the derby between Antella Grassina and the dispute of Baldaccio Bruni Foiano Firenze Ovest Chiantigiana and Porta Romana Terranuova Alle Porta Roma and Terranuova just can&#39;t keep going Not the weather nor a too bad match a bee swarm that got angry with the players on the wing under the Tribuna Laterale Game suspended the teams stay still for more than minutes while the company called specifically for the disinfestation does its duty Then DaiColliFiorentini tells us it resumes play with a small detail the first half at the Due Strade ends at or at the same time as the finals of the other matches When returning from the break in the changing rooms, therefore Porta Romana finds out that Grassina won the derby with Antella and that Baldaccio didn&#39;t go beyond the draw in the match with Foiano This means that the orange players no longer have the obligation to win to avoid the playouts but can also settle for a draw Terranuova instead returns on the pitch knowing that Fortis, who were undermining the place in an excellent place for the playoffs, even lost at home against Pontassieve So the Valdarnesi would arrive in any case but with a draw they would close the championship with consecutive useful results The second half was a joy for both teams The end Porta Romana is safe and the Terranuova arrives With the bees which are now cared for by the beekeepers of the area
