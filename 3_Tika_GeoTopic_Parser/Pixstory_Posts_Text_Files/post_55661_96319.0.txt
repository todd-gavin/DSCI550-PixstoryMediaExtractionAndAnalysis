Barons, an eight-part drama set against the backdrop of Australia's '70s surf culture is gaining popularity around the world. 

But, as huntervalleynews reported, because to COVID, the production, which was meant to take place in Bali, was moved to Australia, according to Keeenan. 

Sean Keenan claimed that the majority of the series was recorded on Sydney's northern beaches, with additional video shot in Byron Bay, Long Jetty, and Turimetta Beach, which is just 350 metres long and backed by Narrabeen Head, which has 20-30 metre high shale bluffs. 

The 1970s in Australia were a time of experimentation, surfing, drugs, and ambition. So, how did Keenan get ready for this part? 
“I have all my dad's stories. He actually [used to] look like Ben O'Toole's character. I saw qualities in my dad and his friends that translated to the show. Plus I watched a lot films and documentaries. Sea of Darkness in particular.

"I've been a surfer my entire life, and it is a culture, where there are so many different kinds of personalities you come across.”

Keenan has done a few '70s pieces, and says the first episode of Barons show how the surfing community isn't about what is considered part of the machine, because they don't want to be part of a society they don't subscribe to.
