Former Arsenal player Jack Wilshere has finally announced his retirement from Professional football via an emotional Social Media post and he will be now be taking up a career in coaching.

His decision comes exactly a day after he was released from Danish Superliga side Aarhus GF roughly just 136 days after he signed for them.

The English central midfielder started his career at Arsenal as a promising youngster and at his 
very best, he had a market value of about €34 Million. He peaked between the years 2010 and 
2016 before being hit by a series of consecutive injuries which ultimately ended his career.

After a number of loan spells to West Ham United and Bournemouth, he was clubless for a very long time in 2021 before being signed by Aarhus AFC.

He failed to impress at the Danish club as well and in his farewell post, he hinted about considering retirement. It was thus not much of a surprise that he officially announced his retirement within the next 24 hours.

In his emotional retirement post, Wilshere wrote, “Today I am announcing my retirement from playing professional football. It has been an unbelievable journey filled with so many incredible moments and I feel privileged to have experienced all that I did during my career.

From being the little boy kicking a ball around in the garden to captaining my beloved Arsenal and playing for my country at a World Cup. I have lived my dream.”

“I have enjoyed every moment of my career and it has been the journey of a lifetime. Now is the right time to close this chapter but I still have so much to give to the game and I am excited about what the future holds. COYG,” he concluded.

What next for him though?

According to David Ornstein (who has been spot on throughout this transfer window), Arsenal are set to name Jack Wilshere as the head coach of their U18 team.

Wilshere is expected to be supported by Adam Birchall and Julian Gray. Mehmet Ali in line for 
U23s, Max Porter assistant.
