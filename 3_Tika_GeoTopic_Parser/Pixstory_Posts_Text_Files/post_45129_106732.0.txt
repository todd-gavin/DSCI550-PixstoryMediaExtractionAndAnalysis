Bosnia and Herzegovina will face Finland in the UEFA Nations League on Tuesday at the Bilino Polje.


Bosnia and Herzegovina is coming off a 1-1 tie against Miodrag Radulovic's Montenegro in their most recent match. A Bosnia and Herzegovina's goal by Dinamo Zagreb winger Luka Menalo was canceled out by Montenegro's goal by Lazio right-back Adam Marusic.Bosnia has only won two of its past 17 international road games, defeating Kazakhstan and Lithuania, both of which are ranked below the top 100 in the globe.


Finland, on the other side, recently suffered a 1-0 defeat against Edward Iordanescu's Romania. Nicusor Bancu of Universitatea Craiova scored the game-winning goal in the first half.Kanerva's home record, on the other hand, may be a reason for concern, as they have only won one of their previous ten home matches in all competitions, failing to score on six occasions.
