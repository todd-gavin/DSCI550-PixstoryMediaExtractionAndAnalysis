Marco Asensio is likely moving out of Real Madrid in the summer. A lack of opportunities following the emergence of Rodrygo is set to be the reason for Asensio's departure. Liverpool and Juventus are believed to be the two clubs that are in pole position to sign the winger. 

As per Marca, Real Madrid have now confirmed the transfer price of their Spanish winger. As per the report, Los Blancos have demanded â‚¬40m for the services of Asensio. The price tag seems a big hefty as the Spaniard is yet to justify such a huge pricetag. 

Yes, Marco Asensio enjoyed his best season in front of goal for Real Madrid this season. The Spaniard scored 10 goals in 31 LaLiga games. But the 26-year-old was far from convincing and even lost out his place to Rodrygo in the "bigger" games.

Apart from Juventus and Liverpool, AC Milan and Arsenal are also said to be closely monitoring the Spanish superstar. A decision is yet to be made regarding the transfer. 

With Salah not signing a new contract and reports of his possible exit next summer on a free transfer, Klopp may view Asensio as an ideal long-term replacement to add some more creativity to an already talented frontline.

As of this moment, Liverpool are not the favourties for the Asensio deal. However, things can change depending on Salah's stand regarding his future with the Merseyside club.
