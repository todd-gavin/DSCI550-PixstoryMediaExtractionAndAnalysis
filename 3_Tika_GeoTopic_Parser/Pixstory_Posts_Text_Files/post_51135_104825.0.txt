There’s nothing better than a rich, fudgy chocolate brownie. Brownies are a perennial classic and longtime fan favorite for a reason. Whether they’re filled with nuts, topped with icing, or stuffed with decadent filling, brownies are downright delicious. 🥮🍪

If you’re looking for some new types of brownies to try, you’re in luck. Here are five different types of brownies that are all absolutely delicious:

BAKESHOP BROWNIES
A twist on a classic favorite, this rich, fudgy brownie holds a hidden surprise. Its center is filled with gourmet semisweet chocolate chips. Plus, it’s topped with a white chocolate glaze.

FUDGE WALNUT BROWNIES 
Made just like a regular brownie and jam-packed with walnuts, a brownie with nuts is one of the most classic types of brownies.

NUTELLA BROWNIES 
This type of brownie ups the ante with hazelnut spread mixed right into the batter and swirled on top. These brownies have an incredibly concentrated and sweet chocolate hazelnut flavour that makes them completely unique.🥮

MINT CHOCOLATE BROWNIES 
Since way before Thin Mints or York Peppermint Patties, mint and chocolate have always gone together. Mint chocolate brownies typically layer your favorite flavors with a brownie base, a mint layer, and a chocolate icing layer on top.

CARAMEL BROWNIES 
Caramel brownies are made by stuffing fudgy brownies with caramel sauce in the middle and topping it off with a caramel drizzle. 🥧🥧
