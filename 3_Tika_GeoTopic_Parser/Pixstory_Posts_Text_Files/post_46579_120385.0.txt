Michael Jordan, a former NBA star, is one of the wealthiest athletes in sports history. 

According to Essentially Sports, during his NBA career, he received millions in wages, and his shoe deal has turned him become a billionaire. He also has some ludicrously pricey possessions. None of them may be more ridiculous than the one when he spent more than $550,000 on his addiction alone. 

Since his playing days, Jordan has enjoyed cigars. Jordan frequently had a cigar in his mouth when he was out celebrating or partying. Jordan became so dependent on it that he used to smoke a cigar prior to each game. Additionally, he has spent an absurd sum of money on cigars over the course of his life.

In 2017, Michael Jordan did an interview with a cigar aficionado. He talked about his love for cigars and how addictive they are to him. He also said that since retiring, he smokes six cigars a day. And the brand of cigars that Jordan smokes cost around $14-$24 per cigar. And keeping with that estimate, Jordan has smoked nearly $550,000-$940,00 worth of cigars.

Now that is a big amount!
