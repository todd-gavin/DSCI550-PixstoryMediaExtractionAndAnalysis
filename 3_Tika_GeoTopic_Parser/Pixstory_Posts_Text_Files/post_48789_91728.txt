But why is the subject of that unsolicited concern always fat people Obesity maybe a health concern but that still does not take away from the fact that fatphobia does exist That prejudice coated with the layer of concern against fat people kills And if we are so concerned about their health anyway let me tell you that fat shaming does their health more harm than the fat does Discrimination causes stress and negatively affects people It drives them to depression and eating disorders and several other illnesses A lot of fat people either end up starving themselves and not taking in enough calories or lose control of their calories and end up eating more than their bodies need The concern trolling needs to stop Fat people can be healthy as they are You do not need to be slim in order to have a healthy body that is a eurocentric measure of fitness The problem is that fat people aren t even diagnosed properly The physicians see they re fat and tell them to lose weight ignoring any symptoms they are having So many people have lost their lives because of this kind of misdiagnosis When patients have obesity they come into an environment that s often not supportive of their disease process Physician Fatima Cody Stanford says A lot of it is that many doctors and other health care providers really have yet to really embrace obesity for the disease that it is And with that comes a lot of blaming and shaming assuming that the patient is not telling the truth assuming that the patient is not compliant with different recommendations that have been provided One of the most widespread misconceptions regarding obese people which has a direct impact on how they are treated in health care is that they are in control of their weight and that weight is a perfectly accurate metric for health In actuality the elements that influence someone s weight and how it affects their health are significantly more complicated from heredity to diseases Many times illnesses cause fatness and not the other way round
