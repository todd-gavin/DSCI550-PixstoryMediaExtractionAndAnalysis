Matter exists in different states solid liquid gaseous and plasma To these must be added a fifth the condensate of Bose Einstein able to connect the behavior of particle systems at the microscopic level regulated by the laws of quantum mechanics and the macroscopic one in general regulated from classical physics In a recent study published in Nature led by the Nanotec Institute of Nanotechnology of the National Research Council of Lecce and by the Physics Department of the University of Pavia, for the first time a microchip capable of forming a condensate of Bose Einstein when excited by laser light Such a microchip obtained starting from a simple semiconductor planar waveguide allowing the formation of quantum fluids of light on a chip that can be integrated with traditional electronics These results are the result of a collaboration including not only scholars from Princeton University, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the Ecole Centrale de Lyon have already been mentioned. system of this type can behave like a quantum fluid able, unlike the classical fluids, to overcome obstacles without undergoing deviations. hybrid, i.e. made up of photons and excited states of matter called polaritons adds Dario Gerace co-author of the work and professor of Theoretical Physics of Matter at the Physics Department of Pavia Polaritons behave like bosons and in recent years all the typical properties have been observed of coherence of a condensate of Bose Einstein as superfluidity and spontaneous formation of vortices even at room temperature
