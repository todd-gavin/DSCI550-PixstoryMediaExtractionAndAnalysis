According to the Australian government, there won't be any more species extinctions and the country will no longer be known as "the mammal extinction capital of the world." As per BBC, under new conservation policies, more than 100 threatened species of animals and plants, including well-known ones like the koala, will receive priority protection. A third of the land mass of the continent will be protected, according to the plan. An investigation earlier this year revealed severe environmental degradation in Australia. Threats to many native species of animals and plants include habitat loss, invasive species of pests and weeds, climate change, and increasingly severe natural disasters. The need for action, according to environment minister Tanya Plibersek, has never been greater."Our current approach has not been working," Ms Plibersek said in a statement. "We are determined to give wildlife a better chance."The goal to list 30% of Australia's land as protected under national environment laws will help vulnerable species and habitats, she said.“The 10-year strategy also aims to improve resilience to climate change, build "insurance" populations of some key species in predator-free zones, and better monitor existing populations.”It calls for more efforts to reduce the impact of feral cats, foxes and a prolific weed known as gamba grass, and to better harness Aboriginal expertise on managing the environment.
