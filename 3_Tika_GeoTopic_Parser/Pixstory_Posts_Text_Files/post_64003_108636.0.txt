Hey guys! Since this is my first post on Pixstory, I thought it would only make sense if I begin by introducing myself. Oh, I swear I won't be delivering that boring, formal introduction as if I am applying for a job. Honestly, I never liked answering those "tell me about yourself" questions since I started appearing for personal interviews. The reason is pretty simple: I realized that these can only be answered in a self-bragging and egoistic tone- which I am not good at. 

Anyways, I am Janvi Bist, a simple human finding her purpose in this complicated world. You can leave me on a deserted island with a few books and I'll happily survive.

Even if I'm not a talkative person but believe me, start talking to me about books or cricket and I won't shut up. The love for cricket runs in my blood. My Dad has always been a fan of Sachin Tendulkar, while there's me- swooning over Virat Kohli. 

I am a dog person, even though I don't have one yet... Will take some time to convince mom to adopt one. At times, my brother jokingly says that I prefer dogs over humans (well, I can't confirm if that's true or not ;)

Of course, the entire personality of an individual can't be summed up in one post, but still, I can only hope you all have gotten a little bit of an idea of what kind of person I am. Even if you haven't, you'll still be hearing a lot from me in the coming days.

Signing off for the day!
Ciao!
