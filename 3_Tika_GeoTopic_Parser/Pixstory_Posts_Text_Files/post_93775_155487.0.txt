We visited the Katara Cultural Village in Qatar today, to see the culmination of artwork produced by the street-connected young people and arts teams across the last week!🎨The young people shared their identity by creating team collages - their key demands and messages were also presented on the gallery walls. The exhibition shows the standout moments of the week which have been captured through illustration, digital design, textiles, and photography. The mix of media allowed the team to put together these amazing emotive pieces which will be displayed in Katara for the next month!📸🧑‍🎨🖌️✏️ #SCWC2022Address:Katara Cultural Village, Building 47, Gallery 1.
