It is a well-known fact that to combat any disease or health issue; one needs sound mental health and willpower.
And this is impacted by the milieu of a place and the people surrounding the person with health issues. 
Hence creating a cheerful ambience and helping the sick person heal comes with some etiquette.

-Talking to someone about the disease is an excellent way to show that you care. For example, you are asking them how they are feeling. This would make the person feel accepted and supported.

-Offering to help them, this can be with specific things or asking them to tell you what help they need.
-It is essential to become understanding.
Someone with a health problem may not feel like socialising. Tell them you’re still there for when they do want to meet up. Understanding their situation is essential.

-It’s likely to take more than one conversation to improve things. So talk while doing something together.
–These things are beneficial if you’re finding it challenging to communicate. It could include walking, cooking or gardening. Talk to others too. Your loved one’s illness will affect you, and it can help to talk to someone else, such as a friend, about how you feel.
