India had several princely states before the British invaded. The royal families had several leisurely tastes and hobbies that included hunting, painting and playing games. One common game that entertained both the royals and the commoners was the card game of Krida-Patram. The earliest versions of Krida-Patram cards were made of clothes and depicted motifs from Indian epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata. 

By the time the Mughals came into power, they introduced a new variant of this card game and called these cards as ‘Ganjifa’, although the game was still known as Krida-patram. Unlike the modern cards, these cards were traditionally painted and were completely handmade, which demanded a considerable amount of patience and hard meticulous work. At times, the kings even commissioned painters to make cards as per their preferences. Later on, the Ganjifa cards took to new forms where cloth materials were replaced by tortoise shells or ivory and decorated with pearls, precious stones, and metals.
