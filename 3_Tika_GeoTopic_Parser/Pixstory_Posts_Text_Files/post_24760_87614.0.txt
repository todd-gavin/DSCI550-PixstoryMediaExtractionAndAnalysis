Frank Lampard again in the radar after he managed Everton at 17th with a tough schedule ahead. Former Chelsea legend as player and coach who joined 31 Jan this year, is not having enough wins since then. Team has won just 6 matches in total, 3 wins under him and 5 losses. 


British commentator Paul Mason says "I'm looking at their fixtures and the way they're playing and I think they're in big trouble. 


I think they're the ones to go now. You've got to look at their fixtures- they're atrocious". 


Next fixtures looks like this for Everton: 


March 17 Vs Newcastle (H)


April 3 Vs West Ham (A)


April 9 Vs Man Utd (H)


April 23 Vs Liverpool (A)


April 30 Vs Chelsea (H)


May 7 Vs Leicester (A)


In between, they are playing their FA cup quarter final against Crystal Palace on 20 March. FA cup failure would leave them with nothing in the season. 


In previous matches, they have lost to Wolves by a single goal margin, and likewise to Manchester City but thrashed by Tottenham by 5 goals. There was not even a shot on target in the Tottenham match. 


Goal scoring has been a problem for Everton this season. They have scored only 28 goals from 26 matches, conceding 47. Demarai Gray is leading scorer with 5, followed by Richarlison (4) and Dominic Calvert Lewin (3). Calvert Lewin was excellent in the previous season with 16 goals, but he was out injured most of the time this season. 


The only way to earn some points is to try to win against Newcastle, West Ham and Leicester, even if it will be difficult and hard work. Everton is the second longest top tier participating club in the Premier League, missing just 4 (1930-31, 1951-52, 52-53, 53-54) and third all-time most points scored team. They are one of the founding members of the English Football league in 1888 and have taken part in a record 118 years. Liverpool based club have won league 9 times, FA cup 5 times and European cup winners' cup once.
