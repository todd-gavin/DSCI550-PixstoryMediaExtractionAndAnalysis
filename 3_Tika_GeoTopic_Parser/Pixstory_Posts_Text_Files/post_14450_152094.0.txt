Hay fever is caused by an allergic response to a harmless outdoor or indoor substance the body identifies as harmful (allergen).
Hay fever, also called allergic rhinitis, causes cold-like symptoms. These may include a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure.
Hay fever triggers include-
ðŸ‘‰Tree pollen, which is common in early spring.
ðŸ‘‰Grass pollen, which is common in late spring and summer.
ðŸ‘‰Ragweed pollen, which is common in fall.
ðŸ‘‰Dust mites and cockroach droppings, which are present year-round.
ðŸ‘‰Dander from pets, which can be bothersome year-round but might cause worse symptoms in winter, when houses are closed up.
ðŸ‘‰Spores from indoor and outdoor fungi and molds, which can be both seasonal and year-round.
