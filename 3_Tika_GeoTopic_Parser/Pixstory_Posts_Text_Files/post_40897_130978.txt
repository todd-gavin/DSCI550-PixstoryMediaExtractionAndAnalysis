What groans of over fed or half starv d who fall sunstruck or in fits What exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and give birth to babes What living and buried speech is always vibrating here what howls restrain d by decorum Arrests of criminals slights adulterous offers made acceptances rejections with convex lips I mind them or the show or resonance of them I come and I depart The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready The dried grass of the harvest time loads the slow drawn wagon The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged The armfuls are pack d to the sagging mow I am there I help I came stretch d atop of the load I felt its soft jolts one leg reclined on the other I jump from the cross beams and seize the clover and timothy And roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps Walt Whitman
