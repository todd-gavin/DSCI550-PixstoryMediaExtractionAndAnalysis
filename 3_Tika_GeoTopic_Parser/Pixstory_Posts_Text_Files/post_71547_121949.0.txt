I feel I am able to produce more breastmilk from one side than the other. Should I be worried?
“Both breasts produce an equal amount of milk. We all have a dominant side and so you may be comfortable feeding from one side. Over time the body reads this as a sign of increased demand and therefore, increases supply of milk to that particular breast.”

"New mothers must strive to feed the baby from both breasts."
