Bec Judd has revealed she feels “unsafe” in her own home after a spate of “rapes, bashings and home invasions” in the Bayside area of Melbourne.

The businesswoman and mum of four took to social media to accuse the Victorian state government of not caring about residents.

“So sick of the rapes, bashings and home invasions at the hands of gangs in Bayside,’’ she wrote in an Instagram story on Thursday.

“The state government don’t seem to care. We feel unsafe.

“I personally know 2 women who have experienced home invasions in Brighton in the last few weeks while they were at home.”

In response to a 7News story about the escalating situation, Judd also commented on the Instagram page of Liberal state MP James Newbury.

“Have these teens been charged yet or just another slap on the wrist?” she wrote.

Judd and her AFL star husband Chris Judd bought their mansion in Brighton for $7.3m four years ago and documented its Spanish-style renovation on social media, the Herald Sun reports.

Mr Newbury said residents and particularly women were increasingly scared and some are even starting to take matters into their own hands.

“I can tell you absolutely (Judd’s) sentiment is the same sentiment that I am getting from women across the electorate today,’’ he said.

“I am getting inundated with people who are living in streets where these crimes have occurred.

“They’re coming across these gangs and being forced to barricade themselves in their bedrooms.

“I am now aware of a number of people who are hiring private security.

“I also know of people now leaving keys next to the front door so that if they are home invaded they’re not fought.”

Mr Newbury said closing the Brighton police station several years ago had also instilled fear.

“We’ve got basically a front desk in Sandringham and if there’s a crime they have to come from Moorabbin,’’ he said.

“I went to a street where a recently widowed woman who just lost her husband had been home invaded.
