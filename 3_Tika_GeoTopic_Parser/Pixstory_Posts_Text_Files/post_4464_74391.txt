No relationship no matter how solemn entitles a person to another person s body Marriage does not grant a license to sexual relations in perpetuity Rape is a crime in India Marital rape is not In fact the Indian Penal Code makes an explicit exception in section stating Sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife the wife not being under fifteen years of age is not rape Why is marital rape not a crime in India Why is a social institution that is meant to tie two individuals in a consensual bond of partnership the only roadblock in the way of criminalizing a particular form of rape an established criminal act The Delhi High Court is currently hearing a clutch of petitions that seek to do away with the exception provided to marital rape under the IPC The crux of the ongoing debate in court is captured by the remarks from the two Delhi HC judges presiding over the case Sexual violence in marriage is a reality we can t ignore It would be unfair to downplay the sufferings of anyone falsely accused of any kind of crime However given that sexual violence is a common experience in a large number of marriages how wise would it be to continue shielding the errant husbands from legal action No law is immune to misuse Not one Despite their misuse it cannot be argued that human beings would fare better in the absence of all laws Let s not throw the baby out with the bathwater Finally coming to the most important aspect of the marital rape debate consent No relationship no matter how solemn entitles a person to another person s body Marriage does not grant a license to sexual relations in perpetuity Non consensual sex between a husband and a wife is as heinous a crime as any other form of rape if not more The so called sanctity of marriage cannot be protected at the cost of the personal liberty and rights of married women Furthermore if a marriage violates the dignity of a woman and the law strips her of any legal recourse to seek justice what are we really protecting in the name of marriage
