Miro is also feeling, as he took to Twitter and asked the question, “Who’s this guy that is fighting for the title?” when Mance Warner was afforded a title match against Jon Moxley 

The notion that Miro is frustrated with his position in AEW doesn’t end there. After a Twitter user commented on the post and asked the question, “Are you still in AEW? Seems you had it better in WWE,” Miro would like the tweet.
It was reported earlier this year that Miro signed a four-year contract extension with AEW, which would keep him with All Elite Wrestling until at least early 2026. In an interview with “Whatculture” shortly after he re-signed, Miro explained why he preferred All Elite Wrestling over WWE at the time. However, now that Vince McMahon is gone and Triple H, Stephanie McMahon, and Nick Khan hold the majority of power in WWE, it seems that Miro may be reconsidering his position.
