The roles of Chronic Kidney Disease and Diabetes Abstract Background Advanced glycation end products are involved in age related multisystem decline They accumulate in body tissues with age diabetes and chronic kidney disease CKD and can be measured non invasively by the skin autofluorescence SAF We studied the relation between SAF and later mortality in old adults Methods The SAF was measured using an AGE Reader in individuals from the general population aged over years and all cause mortality was assessed during an average follow up of years The association between SAF and mortality was analyzed using a multivariate Cox survival model adjusted for age and gender Analyses were further adjusted for diabetes and stratified on the presence of CKD due to its interaction with SAF for the risk of mortality Results Participants were years old on average SD Their mean SAF was AU SD One hundred and forty four individuals died during the follow up Adjusted for age and gender SAF was associated with an increased risk of all cause mortality HR CI for a one AU increase of SAF The association was no longer significant after adjustment for diabetes However after stratification for the presence of CKD higher SAF was associated with an increased risk of all cause mortality in the participants with CKD at baseline HR CI whereas there was no association among participants without CKD HR CI Conclusion Skin autofluorescence is associated with increased all cause mortality in older adults already suffering from CKD Sources
