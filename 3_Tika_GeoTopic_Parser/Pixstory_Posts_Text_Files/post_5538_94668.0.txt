Rajni Yadav is angry. Angry at a world that has no place or time for a single woman. She is angry, tensed and exhausted from trying to find work and trying to seek medical treatment to asking for help from her neighbours unsuccessfully.
She is angry at a society that does not have time to help her, but has time to make misogynistic comments about women and their mental health. Why does the world think the answer to our very real problems is a gossip session with women?

Rajni Yadav is frustrated at the lack of compassion and kindness in societal structures to understand and not dismiss women.

In this ongoing series Meera Chitrakoot is talking to women in Chitrakoot about their state of mind and health, their tensions and worries, to somewhat lighten their burden by listening to them.
