Write the things you can't say from your own mouth. It's hard .Afraid what might happen. So you wrote it down in a diary. Who soon becomes a close friend. Keeping all your secrets in. You just spread your feelings along that pages. Some lines say your crying some say your smiling. Some you wrote with happy tears some you wrote with sad sobbing. And you keep it with you forever. Read it after a long time and feel the moments again. It felt you were in the past for a moment. You contain this memory with your hands. Stories of how you fall at times but you still stood up. Take that pen of yours and write the thoughts of your heart. The poems , the quotes , the stories . Some rhymed , some your still working on. And you recieve the peace you always want.
