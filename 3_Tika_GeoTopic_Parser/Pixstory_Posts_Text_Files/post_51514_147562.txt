Despite Mbapp rejecting the option to play for Real Madrid he still makes the centre of news with links of the Spanish Giants Mbapp himself explained in a recent interview that even if he does not play for Los Blancos currently he feels a special connection with them as his dream club However this time Madridistas around the world were not swayed by the Frenchman s sweet words which have already proved treacherous Years of desire to play for Real Madrid and the chance to become the poster boy for the Spanish juggernauts were thrown all together in the bin by Mbapp after he accepted an outrageously expensive offer from his current club Paris Saint Germain If we consider some of the news from French media we can see that Mbapp has a feeling that he has only postponed his dream and still possesses the desire to star for Real Madrid in the future But time tide and Real Madrid waits for none when the time UCL Champions comes calling for you you either accept it and become a marquee player in their history or reject it and get knocked out every season by them in the UCL it s as simple as that Anything can happen in Football and a lot can change in the next two years but the Real Madrid Mbapp is over for now Florentino Perez runs the Los Reyes de Europa he won t give a player second chances even if he wants to express his desire later on People who are still talking in the favour of Mbapp and supporting what he did after showing enormous hope to millions to Madridistas may think twice now as Mbapp not only betrayed the hope of the Madridista Nation but have tarnished his name as a cash cow in the football world
