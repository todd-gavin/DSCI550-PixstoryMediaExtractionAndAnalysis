The music industry laments the demise of the legendary Punjabi musician, Balwinder Safri. 
He was 63 years old when he passed on Tuesday, 26th July, 2022. 

Singer Guru Randhawa from Punjab confirmed Safri's passing on Instagram, writing, "We will cherish your music and contribution to Punjabi music forever sir. Rest in peace. Alvida sir Balwinder Safri."

The Punjab-born Birmingham artist, who was active in the UK bhangra scene beginning in 1980, founded the Safri Boyz Band in 1990.

After sustaining a brain injury during a heart surgery in April, Mr. Safri has been in a coma.

The 63-year-old was transferred to a specialised rehabilitation facility after spending 86 days in Wolverhampton's New Cross Hospital. During his stay, the hospital prepared to turn off his dialysis machine as his kidneys had failed. However, his step-daughter, Pirya Kumari, tried to stop them from doing so, stating "He is there, he can hear you. I'll remind him of funny stuff, so will my mum, and he'll be frowning, or doing these weird facial expressions."

Because of patient confidentiality, the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, which manages New Cross Hospital, stated that it was unable to comment on Mr. Safri's care.

May Mr Balwinder Safri rest in peace.
