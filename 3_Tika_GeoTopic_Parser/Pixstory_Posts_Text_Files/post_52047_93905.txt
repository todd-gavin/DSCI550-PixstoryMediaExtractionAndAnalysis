Where exactly in Africa our species evolved is one of the hottest points of contention in human evolution Now a new study suggests Homo sapiens emerged in a single region in the south of the continent around years ago To reach their verdict a team of researchers from South Korea and Europe simulated the Earth s climate history back million years and paired it with ancient human bone and tool discoveries The study was published in Nature today but not everyone agrees with its conclusions Study lead author Axel Timmermann from the Institute for Basic Science Center for Climate Physics at Pusan University said it s the first study to link archaeological evidence with long range climate modelling to piece together a story of early human movement and evolution Ian Moffat a geoarchaeologist from Flinders University who was not involved in the work said the study took a broad look at the engine room of early human evolution Africa Europe and parts of Asia These are the places that have historically defined the narrative of early human evolution It s good that questions about human evolution are being asked using these rigorous approaches to the climate record Ancestral digs The human family tree isn t a neat and tidy series of branches It s a tangle of forks offshoots and dead ends with some limbs rejoining and intermingling multiple times over the millennia as different species interbred and migrated What compelled our human ancestors to wander into new territory was probably climate change which could have made a home region less hospitable or neighbouring areas easier to explore That said nailing down what the climate was like at a site that was occupied by early humans is a tricky task Researchers can for instance date sediments and analyse bits and bobs like pollen lodged in the soil Knowing what plants grew gives researchers an idea of the climate of the time But the qualities that make archaeological sites like caves so good at accumulating fossilised bones and tools they re sheltered dry and can remain relatively undisturbed by the outside environment means they don t accumulate much in the way of climate evidence Dr Moffat said It would be wonderful to find archaeological materials in a site that had a really good climate record But it s so unusual Read more
