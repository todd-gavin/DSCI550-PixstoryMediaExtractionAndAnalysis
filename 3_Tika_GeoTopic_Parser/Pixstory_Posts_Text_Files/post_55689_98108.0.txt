On Monday morning, Kahoder Sabra smiles as he looks out at the media throng around Prime Minister Scott Morrison during Eid prayers in Parramatta Park. 

The Guardian reported that Morrison is at the Eid prayer, and Sabra believes that acknowledging the Muslim community's electoral power has been long overdue. 

“I think it’s magnificent,” he says. “The Muslim vote does count.”
“Whether we like it or not, he’s our prime minister. And he’s coming to have a chat with the people. So it means a lot to us; it means we are part of the community now.”

Premiers, state or local MPs have previously attended Eid prayers, but Morrison is the first sitting prime minister to do so. Morrison chose the Eid prayers in Parramatta, one of the country's most marginalised and diverse seats.

While many in the audience believe Morrison's participation is a ploy to acquire their votes, others appreciate his acknowledgement of the importance of their community. 

With 2.6 percent of Australians identifying as Muslim in the 2016 census, Islam was the second most popular religion in Australia, with the number predicted to expand exponentially in the current census. It makes the varied population a major source of votes, and they can make or break any campaign in Parramatta, which Labor holds by a 3.5 percent edge.
