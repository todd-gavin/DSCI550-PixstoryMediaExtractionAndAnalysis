The first thing that comes to mind is to write a Mother's Day greeting, full of emotions. Sentences that are selected, such as: angel, compassionate, self-burning candle, a devoted and holy creature; I have no problem writing emotional sentences, but I have a problem with a very selfish idea of ​​why she expects so much from her mother. A few examples of sentences that we think describe the mother, but are actually for our own blessed existence, such as: "Mother is the basis of our existence" or "King of the mother's sorrow" conveys such texts that the mother is dear because she gave birth to us instead We also appreciate his efforts with a post he never sees. Such appreciations are due to our lack of understanding of the social situation and the lack of verbal skills to express our feelings and desires. However, what is said is true and our mothers do things that no one else is able or willing to do. But next to it, it leaves an expectation from the mother; The mother is the one who is found to reach us and sacrifice and sacrifice herself. That is, if she does not sacrifice herself, she is not a good mother, and as soon as she gave birth to us and did not do a great job, she should work hard and build a life with difficult conditions, so that her children are comfortable and do not notice the hardships she endures.

In my opinion, a family should cooperate in all matters, in which case only one person will not be a victim and will not sacrifice himself. There is no good or bad mother. She is a mother in any case, these people are independent of their gender and status, which is measured by their choices, "they are called good or bad". Mothers and fathers are equally responsible to their children, but our social and cultural context makes people evaluate the duties of the two differently.
