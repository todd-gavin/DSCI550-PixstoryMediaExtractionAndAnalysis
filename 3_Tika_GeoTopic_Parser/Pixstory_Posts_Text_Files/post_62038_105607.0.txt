Aurelien Tchouameni has been one of the most sought after players in this transfer window. 

He has already been linked with Liverpool and Paris Saint Germain. Tchouameni was not interested in their offers as he gracefully turned them down. PSG were reluctant in their pursuit of Tchouameni to secure his services and bring him to Perc de Princes, but he held his ground and did not sell out his dream at any cost (Wink, Wink). 

It has been reported by Fabrizio Romano, that Real Madrid and Tchouameni have both agreed to verbal terms and an official announcement will be made shortly. 

It is being reported that Los Blancos reached an agreement with Monaco in a deal that is worth around 100 million Euros.  

Tchouameni is the second signing of the window for Madrid as they have already secured the services of Anthony Rudiger. 

Tchouameni is likely to be a part of the new crop of midfielders who'll be taking over from Kroos, Modric and Casemiro. The club's eagerness to find new talent is not just to replace the Old heads but also make sure that the next generation of midfielders is ready for Los Blancos before the Old Guard dies out.
