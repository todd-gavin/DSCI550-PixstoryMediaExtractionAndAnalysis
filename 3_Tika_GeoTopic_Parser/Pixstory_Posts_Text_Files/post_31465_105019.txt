One of the most important and cited decisions in the history of jurisprudence of the United States of America The question decided by a sentence of the Supreme Court of the United States of America in was the first case of judgment of the constitutionality of a law and established the system of judicial review exercised by american courts The president of the Supreme Court at the time was John Marshall former secretary of state to the president of the United States John Adams federalist The latter before being replaced by Thomas Jefferson republican renewed many institutional offices including that of Justice of the Peace of the District of Columbia Justice of the peace in the District of Columbia that was entrusted to Marbury these are the so-called Midnight appointments In the last minute confusion the appointment of the new Judge Marbury is not communicated to the interested party by the outgoing secretary of state Marshall The new secretary of state Madison refuses to doing so was a Republican vs. Federalist Marbury Marbury appeals to the Supreme Court to order Madison to forward the act of appointment Court still entirely composed of Federalists and there&#39;s a problem If the Court agreed with the appellant it would have risked political exposure Marshall the new the president of the Court was also the very one who had forgotten to transmit the nomination What the Court does Recognizes Marbury&#39;s appointment effective and valid but declares unconstitutional the law that gave the Supreme Court jurisdiction over the case the Court decided to disapply a federal law using which Marbury would undoubtedly have received a favorable sentence since it was constitutionally illegitimate The binding effect of the decision derives from the top position of the jurisdiction held by the Supreme Court which with the sole force of the precedent imposes itself on all the other Courts of the Union as a third-party federal judge degree
