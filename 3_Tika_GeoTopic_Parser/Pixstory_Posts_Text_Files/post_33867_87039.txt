Fiorentina wins the Apennine derby thanks to Torreira&#39;s goal Mihajlovic&#39;s Bologna are therefore defeated, forced to play outnumbered due to Bonifazi&#39;s expulsion At the end of the match, the rossoblu coach dwells on the analysis of the match We got hurt alone we didn&#39;t score on two sensational chances we hit goal posts in the league what a really high number The post a wrong goal Then if you stay in it gets difficult I think the lads played a decent match even if ten of us suffered little We made good repairs several times The attitude was right The only thing I didn&#39;t like was the technical management In some cases we were too hasty and imprecise in restarting This is part of growing up We need to be lighter and have more fun Svanberg got all the first steps wrong it means he wasn&#39;t calm in his head Friday Bonifazi had his first training session but we had no other solutions than to let him play We could have put in Binks but he found it difficult on the outsides and with Gonzalez and Ikon it wasn&#39;t easy Among the ideas I had in my head I chose Kevin is a player who needs to know how to manage himself and play more with his head but he often trusts his body too much but he gets into certain situations that end badly Surely he screwed up with the expulsion Orsolini always has the same problem often yes he loses and can&#39;t keep concentration for him he knows how to play and he knows how to score goals and then every now and then during the match he isolates himself too much He needs to find more continuity and concentration this is his main flaw He needs to improve in his mind Arnautovic has been days apart he has a structure physical is important and feels in the long run when you miss workouts
