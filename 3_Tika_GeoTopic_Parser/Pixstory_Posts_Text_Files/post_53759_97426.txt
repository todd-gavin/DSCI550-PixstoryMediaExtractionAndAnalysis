Global maize production is worth billions of dollars annually and is key to global food security because it s a staple food for billions of people Most maize production relies on natural rainfall making it vulnerable to changing rainfall patterns This limitation is likely to intensify in the future because climate change is predicted to lead to lower rainfall in many regions This could decrease yields by by the time global temperatures have increased by C Droughts are also predicted to become more frequent and severe Higher temperatures are also predicted for many parts of the world and will have direct effects on maize growth and productivity Warming will also lead to more evaporation which means that plants lose more water But it is difficult to predict the effects of a changing climate on crop yields That s because the effects of rainfall and temperature can interact in complex ways Rising carbon dioxide CO in the atmosphere which is a result of industrialisation only adds to the uncertainty However as our new research conducted in South Africa shows it may offset some of the impacts of drying and warming on maize crops in tropical growing regions like those found in much of Africa Why CO matters CO is an important resource for photosynthesis and its low availability in the atmosphere has been a major limiting factor to plant growth for millennia This has led some plant groups particularly grasses to evolve a photosynthetic pathway that concentrates CO and makes photosynthesis more efficient under low CO Maize also has this pathway known as C photosynthesis Under warm and humid conditions its growth is thus not limited by CO availability and so it gains no direct benefit from increasing atmospheric CO However elevated CO allows plants to take up enough CO while keeping their leaf pores stomata partially closed This decreases plant water loss and could potentially increase the drought tolerance of maize Research has been done in Europe and the US to ascertain how elevated CO might indirectly increase the productivity of C plants like maize These studies found that elevated CO generally had a positive effect on maize growth and compensated for water limitation and warming Read more
