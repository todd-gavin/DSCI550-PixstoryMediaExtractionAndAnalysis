An experiment in Dyarchy and it s failure continues May I submit that it was a condition of helplessness in which the administration of the State was placed owing to the partition of India which brought into existence a purely Muslim State that was responsible for all that happened The award of the Boundary Commission and the sudden unexpected departure of the British created an extraordinary situation and whatever happened was due to this curious sequence of events and was also due to the Pakistani mentality to annex the State to Pakistan by creating a revolution from inside and by act of agression from outside His highness as ruler however accepts full responsibility for the killings of Muslims by Hindus and Sikhs and vice versa whether these killings were done by the State subjects or by the refugees from West Punjab who themselves had suffered enormously at the hands of the Muslims there He does not agree with you that the responsibility would not have been his if he had been a constitutional ruler he feels that the responsibility for all the troubles would have been his whether these troubles took place when I was incharge as Prime Minister or whether Sheikh Abdulla was in charge as Head of Administration because both these appointments were made by him and whatever powers are vested in me or Sheikh Abdulla are vested by him The ultimate responsibility remains with the administration of which he is the Head whether constitutional or otherwise To be continued
