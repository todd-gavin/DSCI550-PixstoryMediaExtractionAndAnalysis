Kabul Bazar is the name given to this bazaar The majority of Afghan refugees live near this bazar And people come here to buy their daily necessities Like vegetables fruits rations and etc I always feel at ease in that bazaar especially when I see my fellow citizens And I do occasionally translate Hindi for them There s also one of my favourite shops nearby He brings Afghani dry fruits and the powder fruit juice known as Altunsa
