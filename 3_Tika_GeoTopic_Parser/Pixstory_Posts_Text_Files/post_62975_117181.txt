The book written by Taylor Jenkins Reid falls flat on expectations and the hype surrounding it While the book does a really good job of depicting and describing bisexuality and the complexity of Evelyn s character the absolutely painfully human nature were one of the best parts about it the book still lacked in many areas The writing style was disappointing and didn t exactly to be one for a book with adult themes immature and clumsy It was fairly predictable and at one point it becomes pretty uninteresting which is because of the blandness of a few of the husbands and respective marriages It was anti climatic and the supposed big reveal at the end of the book doesn t come off as a really big plot twist The book get s boring at parts where it switches to the journalist Monique s parts and puts out unnecessary details that have no relevance to Evelyn s story Overall the book was a good read but definitely not worth the hype
