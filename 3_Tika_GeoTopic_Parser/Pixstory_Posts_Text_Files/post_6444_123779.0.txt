The NDA-JDU alliance has ended in the state of Bihar as Nitish Kumar handed over his resignation as Chief Minister of Bihar to Governor Phagu Chauhan today.

Kumar has decided to split from the NDA and will embrace support from the RJD led Mahagathbandhan to continue in office.

In the 2020 elections, RJD ( Rashtriya Janata Dal ) won the highest number of seats amounting to 79, followed by BJP with 77 seats in the assembly and Nitish Kumar's JDU winning only 45. 

Kumar formed his government with BJP led National Democratic alliance ( NDA ) as the majority required was 121 seats in the state assembly.

This will be the second time in last seven years that the two arch-rivals RJD & JDU will form an alliance. The two parties along with INC formed a coalition to contest the 2015 assembly elections but in 2017, Nitish Kumar broke the coalition and joined hands with BJP.
