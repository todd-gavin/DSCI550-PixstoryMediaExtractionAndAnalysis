After Bayern Munich's prolific scorer declared his wish to depart, Poland's national team boss
quipped that he would want to see Robert Lewandowski sign for Liverpool this summer.

Since joining the German giants in 2014, Lewandowski has been a big success, scoring 344
goals in 375 appearances and won a total of 19 major awards during his eight-year spell.
However, his time at Bayern could be coming to an end as he continues to press for a transfer
away from the club.

According to reports, the 33-year-old wants to join Barcelona and start a new chapter in his
career, but his current employers are adamant that he completes the final year of his contract
before leaving. Lewandowski addressed reporters during a press conference yesterday
afternoon ahead of Poland's forthcoming Nations League match against Wales:

"One thing is certain today, my story with Bayern is over. After everything that has happened in
recent months, I cannot imagine further good co-operation. I realise a transfer will be the best
solution for both sides."

Czeslaw Michniewicz, Poland's manager, then expressed his preference for where the prolific
forward should play next season, saying, "I'd want to see Lewandowski in Liverpool since I'm a
Liverpool fan." If this ever comes to fruition, the Bayern striker will be reunited with his former
boss.

Jurgen Klopp managed Lewandowski at Borussia Dortmund, where the two won back-to-back
Bundesliga titles and reached the Champions League final in 2013. The fact that Klopp
identified Lewandowski as the best player he has worked with in an interview with Bild last
March demonstrates his admiration for the Polish goal machine.
