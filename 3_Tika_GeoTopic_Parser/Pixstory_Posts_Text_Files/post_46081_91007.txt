When Ms Harris came into power I was honestly looking forward to it so much But the experience has been quiet bitter to be honest While it is still early in her presidency as Merril Mathews talks about there is a chance she may make a return let s just say future evaluations of Vice President Kamala Harris s work performance will most certainly be harsh Certain people believe that it s odd because the vice president has essentially no tasks to fail at under the US Constitution and yet she does Mathews in her further criticism talks about how it s understandable that the greatest polls of former vice presidents are a little more subjective than those of former presidents The vice president s only constitutionally mandated role is that of Senate President Unless the president gives work to the vice president the vice president has little to do And Biden has done so The Hill reported that he put Harris in charge of dealing with the southern border situation which has gotten exponentially worse since she came over Biden also occasionally dispatches her to give speeches But it has turned out to be much worse than her handling of the border crisis because a vice president s sole responsibility is to keep the president and the administration from embarrassment That s something Biden can do without Harris help and he does it frequently Her word salad speeches have been compiled and made available for everyone to giggle at on social media Furthermore her poll numbers are even lower than Biden s and her staff is abandoning the sinking ship though it s sometimes more politely referred to as a staff reset
