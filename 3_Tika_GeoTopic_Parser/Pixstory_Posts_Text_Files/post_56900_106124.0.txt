Jelly sandals are back in trend. Influencers and celebs are taking notice of the shoe’s turn toward the high-end as it re-enters the zeitgeist. According to The Real Real’s women’s editorial lead Noelle Sciacca, a desire to reach back into our past — both our past as individuals and our collective pop-culture history — has inspired a new fondness for the shoe. Nostalgia has helped propel it to the most influential runways in the industry.
“For many of us, they [jelly shoes] evoke the carefree and idyllic summer days of childhood,” says Sciacca. “Fashion houses are wise to offer pieces that recall pleasant memories and a sense of optimism to a post-pandemic world.”

Slick Slides
Try one of these slide-on options. Whether you prefer a chunky heel or something flat, these jellies will pair back quickly with your favourite beach dress or casual outfit.

Comfortably Chunky
For days when you want something a bit more trend-forward, opt for these sandals with a thicker sole and sturdy straps. If you’re feeling incredibly bold, opt for a super-platform a la Loewe.

Keep It Minimal
If you’d like to test the trend but want to keep your footwear a bit more minimal, try pared-back options with a touch of fun via a bold colour or funky rock studs. Finish off the look with a straw bag for a breezy summer ensemble.

Classic Cage
So you’re nostalgic for the classics? Opt for the fisherman sandal in rubberized form—we like Prada and Gucci’s chunky-soled styles.
