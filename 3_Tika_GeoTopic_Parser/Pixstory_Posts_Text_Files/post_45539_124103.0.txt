For a Christmas boom, Paramount is getting ready. 

As per Hollywood Reporter, on Monday, the studio said that Sonic the Hedgehog 3 would debut in theatres on December 20, 2024. 

Sonic the Hedgehog 2's massive $72.1 million domestic box office debut earlier this year was a tremendous lift for the domestic box office recovery, especially for family pictures. The movie went on to earn more than $401 million at the box office globally, which is a respectable number given that the economic recovery was only just getting underway.

Ben Schwartz, Jim Carrey, and James Marsden all appear in the movie series. 

James Cameron's upcoming Avatar 3 will compete with Sonic 3 when it debuts in 2024 over the holiday season (the Avatar sequels have moved around numerous times).
