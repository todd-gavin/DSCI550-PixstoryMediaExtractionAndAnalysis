Steven Gerrard will forever be associated with Liverpool FC as a result of his accomplishments
over his 17 years as a member of the Reds' first squad, which began on November 29, 1998.

For those 17 years, Gerrard was Mr Liverpool, despite the fact that he first joined the club after
a terrible season in which the club placed seventh and the joint-management experiment of Roy
Evans and Gerard Houllier came to an end.

We take a look back at the side that saw the midfielder make his Liverpool debut against
Blackburn Rovers in a 2-0 win in November 1998.

David James

After leaving Anfield in 1999, James continued to play at the highest level for another decade,
with stops at Aston Villa, West Ham United, Manchester City, and Portsmouth.

After retiring from football, he managed the Kerala Blasters in the Indian Super League for a
short time before being fired in December 2018. Away from football, the 50-year-old was the
fourth celebrity to be booted off of Strictly Come Dancing in 2019.

Vegard Heggem

Heggem resigned from football at the age of 28 in 2003, after being plagued by injury problems
during his Liverpool career. In his home Norway, the 45-year-old now operates a salmon fishing
business and is also an official patron of non-league club AFC Liverpool.

Stig Inge Bjornebye

After finishing his playing career with Blackburn, Bjornebye attempted management as an
assistant coach in Norway and at IK Start, where he lasted two seasons before being fired.

He
worked as the sporting director at Rosenborg for four and a half years before stepping down in
November 2019.
