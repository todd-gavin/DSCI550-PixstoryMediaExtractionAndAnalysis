I am appalled at how we hide behind this facade of being progressive In we would expect people to be aware of the fact how derogatory slurs are But alas this is not the case The Department of the Interior is attempting to erase a pejorative Native American epithet from Utah s hills lakes and plains It s depressing and infuriating that we re still having to see these words in Davina Smith a Din Nation member and tribal coordinator for the National Parks Conservation Association said Fox has said that Orem and Provo are dwarfed by Squaw Peak It s a well known peak with a great view of Utah County The feds aim to alter its name to something more meaningful soon Smith claims that the epithet squaw is derogatory to indigenous women When I hear that name it is really the equivalent to calling any other person of color the names that they had to endure she said The city of Provo has long advocated for the term s abolition A local organisation attempted to rename the peak in and only last year a state bill was passed to make the renaming process easier According to the Department of the Interior there are approximately fifty landmarks in Utah that utilise that word with over across the country Secretary of State Deb Haaland launched a Derogatory Geographic Names Task Force last week and held tribal consultation meetings to brainstorm substitute names Some of the proposed names for Squaw Peak in Provo include First Left Fork Rock Canyon or just Rock Canyon In Weber County Squaw Flat could change to Pine Canyon Bear River Range or Woodruff Creek
