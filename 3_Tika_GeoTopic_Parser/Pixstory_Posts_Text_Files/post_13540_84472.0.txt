According to sources and eyewitnesses, Taliban gunmen are now resorting to more violence in search of people's homes.

Witnesses say the Taliban are searching people's homes for weapons, equipment and vehicles of former military and civilian officials.

This is how a citizen whose house was inspected by the Taliban described his vision for Afghanistan
While searching our house, the Taliban saw a picture of my father in military uniform and insisted that we should give him his military uniform 30 years ago.
He says his father died a year ago.

The eyewitness said that Taliban gunmen broke the locked gates, inspected Panjshiri houses more seriously and even took a kitchen knife with them.

Meanwhile, the Taliban Interior Ministry has stated that it is looking for ISIL members, resistance fighters and terrorists.

Some sources say the house-to-house search operation will begin in western Kabul on Tuesday.

However, these inspections are carried out without a court order.

The Taliban have confirmed that they have detained individuals during the search.
