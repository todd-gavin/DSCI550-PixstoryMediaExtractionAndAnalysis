Wolves enjoyed a solid campaign last season under new manager Bruno Lage as they secured a finish in the top They have been poor so far this season as they currently sit th in the league They have only managed one win so far in seven games and need to improve massively after the international break After the departure of Nuno Esipiritos Santos many were wondering how Wolves would do but they were impressive last season under their new manager We will look at in depth analysis on the squad Strengths The biggest strength of Wolves squad is their defensive solidity They play a formation with their wing back providing strong defensive support while also contributing in attacking areas Lage must be given credit for this as his system suits the players he has at his disposal and while there are not many high profile players in the defence every player knows their role and carry it out effectively While Conor Coady the club s former captain has moved to Everton on loan Wolves fans will hope the team can regain that defensive solidity after the international break Weaknesses One big weakness of Wolves squad is their attacking output While they were good last season and finished th their attacking output has not been brilliant and they have lacked goals Of course Raul Jimenez injury proved to be detrimental to this as he was the team s main goalscorer before his injury and was rather prolific He has struggled to achieve them heights he was at before his injury and Lage will have to find a way for Jimenez to get back to his best again They also have talented wingers in the likes of Pedro Neto and Daniel Podence therefore Lage will have to find a way for these players to be more productive in attacking positions
