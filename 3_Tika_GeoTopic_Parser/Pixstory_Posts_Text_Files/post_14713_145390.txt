 When you re tidying up put items away in small trips rather than taking it all together Set the timer on your television to turn off an hour earlier than usual to remind you to get up and move Walk around when you re on the phone Stand up and do some ironing during your favourite television shows Rather than sitting down to read listen to recorded books while you walk clean or work in the garden Stand on public transport or get off one stop early and walk to your destination Sources www betterhealth vic gov au
