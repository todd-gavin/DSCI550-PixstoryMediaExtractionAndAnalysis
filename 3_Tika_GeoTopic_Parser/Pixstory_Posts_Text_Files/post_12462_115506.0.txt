There are various misconceptions about mental illness. Now first and foremost we have to get the term right. According to WHO, "mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community". 

Whereas mental illness is characterized by clinically significant disturbance that interferes into an individual's cognition, emotional regulation, or behaviour. It is usually linked with distress or impairment in important areas of functioning. There are many different types of mental illness. Now one disorder can be called as an illness only when it can be described by the tools called International Classification of Diseases and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. 

Misconceptions associated with mental illness are as follows : 

• People with mental illness are dangerous 

Like how we get physically ill, similarly mental illness is something that can be treated and can be bought into control. Mental illness don't pose any danger. 

• Mental illness is a mindset problem
That's not true. When one is not being able to cope with the life stressor and which goes beyond what they can imagine it leads to mental health problem which further leads to mental illness. 

• Mental health only concerns sick people
Mental health is a domain of health and so everyone has mental health just like how everyone has physical health. 

• Getting help for mental illness is easy
Even though we know there are helps that we can seek, there is a lack of awareness between the family members and other close ones which restricts the individual to seek help. And so it is not easy for everyone to get help. The help also comes at a price and so not all are being able to access these helps. 

• Medications for mental illness are dangerous 
Medications for mental illness are to bring the symptoms of the illness into control. These help the individual to cope with their condition. 

Mental illness is real like a physical illness and it needs to get resorted, if not it can lead to worse situations.
