As a kid, I fell in love with the idea of getting a puppy for Christmas. Wrapped in a small box with a bow on top sitting under the tree just like the movies and tv shows I had seen. I can remember making a Christmas list of all the things I wanted that year, and every year the same thing that I wanted had said “puppy” with it underlined so that my mother knew which was my favorite on the list. Every year no surprise, I didn’t find a dog. I never understood why I never received one. When the kids at school talked about the few dogs they had at home made me so jealous, but I hoped that one day it would be me to have my own best friend at home. Being a teenager my mother explained having a pet was a great responsibility somehow I was frustrated she didn’t understand my passion and love for dogs! Nothing in the world would convince her to let us get one. She claimed I can have a turtle if I desperately wanted to have a pet. I couldn’t agree. It became the longest week I had ever lived. Excitement ran throughout my body making it impossible to rest at night. In the meantime, I was preparing all of my future puppies things. It was clear I decided on a boy. Later, I decided to name him Bentley. Not sure why but it was a name that pleased me. I met the man to pick my choice of dog. I was brought into a room and in this room was a basket overflowing with sleeping puppies. They were two months old black and white but also a few brindle. Some had escaped and wandered off walking. Each one was five hundred dollars, not a price that bothered me since I saved enough for this. This small half black and white face male puppy really caught my attention. “That one!” Nothing was changing my mind on that.
