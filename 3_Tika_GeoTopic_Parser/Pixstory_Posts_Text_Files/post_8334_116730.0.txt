India's ace shuttler and former World Champion PV Sindhu has defeated China's Wang Zhi Yi 21-9, 11-21, 21-15 in the final match of women's singles at the Singapore Open 2022. 

The two-time Olympic medallist won the first game in a dominating style before she lost the second one to the Chinese. The match went into the decider where Sindhu bounced back beautifully to clinch her maiden Super 500 title of the year 2022. Wang Zhi Yi fought well till the end but Sindhu's early advantage in the final game played a crucial role in the latter's victory. 

The Singapore Open also happens to be Sindhu's 3rd title in the 2022 season after winning theÂ Syed Modi International and Swiss Open BWF Super 300 titles. 

This record win is certainly gonna boost her morale to defend her title in the upcoming Commonwealth Games to be held in Birmingham later this month.
