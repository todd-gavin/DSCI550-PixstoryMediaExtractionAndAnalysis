Following a 60-51 loss at the NEC Arena, the Australian Diamonds ruined England's attempt to defend its Commonwealth Games championship.

Sky Sports reported that England won the gold medal match against Australia on their home court and in front of their home crowd four years ago, securing their triumph and the title. The Diamonds, however, took stylish revenge for that outcome. 

First half performance was strong, as Australia led 29-23 at the break. In the third set of 15 minutes, they increased their lead to 10 goals before holding off England's valiant fourth-quarter comeback.

England will now play New Zealand in a rematch of their last pool match on Sunday afternoon to determine the bronze medalist. Later on in the day, Australia and Jamaica will compete for the gold medal.

Letâ€™s see what happens next!
