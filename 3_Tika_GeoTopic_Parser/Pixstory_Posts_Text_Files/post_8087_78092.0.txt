The first load of Indian wheat assistance to Afghanistan is expected to be shipped to Kabul as part of the countryâ€™s humanitarian assistance after several months of talks with Pakistan during the current week.

New Delhi and Islamabad agreed on a method of transporting wheat through Pakistan after months of discussions, Indian media reported today (Saturday, January 29).

According to Indian media reports, the shipment of Indian wheat takes 30 days. However, Pakistan initially wanted the cargo to be transported by UN trucks, eventually, the two sides agreed that the wheat should be shipped by Afghan trucks and to submit a list of contracts to Pakistan.

Moreover, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Asim Iftikhar Ahmad had told reporters on Friday that all arrangements had been made and the country is waiting for the date of the first shipment.

Furthermore, the Indian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said at an online news conference that his country is committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people, including food grains, the Covid-19 vaccine, and essential medicines.

After the fall of the government to the Taliban, India announced that it would send 50,000 tons of wheat and medicine to Afghanistan via road transport through Pakistan.

Finally, Pakistan and India have agreed to ship the first cargo by the middle of this week, after months of talks.
