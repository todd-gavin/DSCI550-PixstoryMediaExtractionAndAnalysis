The Academy brought out the legendary director Francis Ford Coppola, and the legendary actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Francis Ford Coppola went on to thank Mario Puzo, the author of The Godfather and he also showed his gratitude to the late Robert Evans, who was the head of Paramount and agreed to produce the movie. What a moment to see the three legends together that easily shaped 50 years of cinema since the Godfather with their wonderful work in this world of movies.
