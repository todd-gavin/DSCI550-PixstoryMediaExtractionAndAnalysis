For me it’s traveling to explore, it’s seeing someone close after a long time, it’s being in the right place at the right moment, it’s coming home to my family everyday, it’s everything that makes my heart giggle 

Everyone has their own happy place and they try to find a new one everyday, that’s what keeps us going 

YKW sometimes my happy place is getting my hands on some new gossip or write ups
