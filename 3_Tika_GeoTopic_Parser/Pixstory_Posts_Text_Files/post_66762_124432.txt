Do you believe in ghosts This is not a typical romance and the names of the lovers resonate with it They went through hell to find some semblance of heaven and they had the help of angels wether real or just in their heads I felt involved and afraid I got really invested So many situations to make you wonder what would I do We all suffer loss and pain in life but some things are so tragic and unfair that I damn well hope they will some day never happen again Getting in the head of victims of abuse be it of drugs physical abuse or violence made me feel so ignorant and helpless A good writer the author imagined an interesting setting with a lot of potential for the next books in the series which I will definitely want to read
