Australia s wildlife is increasingly threatened with extinction One key driver of this is habitat clearing and fragmentation An associated factor is the expansion of our road network particularly the upgrade and duplication of our highways Governments expand our major highways in the interests of road safety and traffic flow But major roads become barriers to wildlife movement as well as places where cars can hit and kill many animals Our new research explores whether highway underpasses help animals safely cross roads We wanted to know if animals actually use underpasses and if they had hidden dangers by funnelling animals through a confined space making it easier for predators What did we find To find out whether underpasses work we used wildlife cameras to monitor underpasses for more than two years in north east New South Wales Five under the Oxley Highway at Port Macquarie and seven under the Pacific Highway south of Grafton What we found was quite astounding Vastly more animals than we expected were using the underpass We detected over medium large mammals and goannas while smaller species such as snakes and rodents also used the underpasses but were less reliably detected by our cameras Species such as eastern grey kangaroos swamp wallabies red necked wallabies red necked pademelons and lace monitors crossed some underpasses more than once a week Rufous bettongs and echidnas crossed individual underpasses every two to four weeks These crossing rates suggest animals use underpasses to forage on both sides of the freeways We were particularly interested in whether the endangered koala would use the underpasses They did occasionally We found they were not avoiding the underpasses because they were detected infrequently in the adjoining forest Do underpasses with fences reduce or eliminate wildlife roadkill Anecdotal evidence for our study road at Port Macquarie suggested roadkill rates were very low Only four roadkills two eastern grey kangaroos one red necked wallaby and one brushtail possum Read more
