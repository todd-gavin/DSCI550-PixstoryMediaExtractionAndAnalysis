Endless controversy over an episode that took place during the postponement of the th matchday of the championship between Turin and Inter In the first half on the result of for the grenade Belotti was kicked in the Inter penalty area by Ranocchia A clean penalty episode as amply demonstrated by the various shots but that both the referee Guide and the Var did not consider it a penalty Yet the foul was very evident and in the event of a penalty kick the hosts would be given a double advantage This is why at the end of the game in front of Dazn&#39;s cameras presented by the sporting director of Torino Davide Vagnati I would like to underline Vagnati began that it is the first time after a match that we introduce ourselves to speak as a club because we have and will always have respect for those responsible for making decisions But tonight&#39;s is an objective fact The mistakes there are two mistakes, the first is not giving a penalty so live because the VAR shouldn&#39;t be an excuse for the referee on the pitch And then obviously the second sensational mistake is that of the VAR For the statistics after league matches, Torino is the only team not having still had a penalty in favor I don&#39;t understand how something like this is possible Vagnati still says he spoke to the referee Guide at the end of the match I spoke to the referee he told me that if he wasn&#39;t called back by the VAR because he took the right decision For the VAR it can&#39;t be an excuse A game that we would have won is honestly unacceptable
