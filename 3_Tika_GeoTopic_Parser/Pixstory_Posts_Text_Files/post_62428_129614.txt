Everest s death zone is the area above meters feet where most deaths occur Everest s death zone is the name given to a section of the mountain where it is virtually impossible for anyone to survive This is because the altitude and temperature combine to create extreme conditions that can quickly kill anyone who enters them There are a few reasons why Everest s death zone is so dangerous First of all it s very cold and windy up there conditions that can quickly wear down even the fittest people Second there are no sources of food or water up in these mountains so people who are not well equipped risk dying from dehydration or starvation And finally there s a high risk of altitude sickness which can cause everything from seizures to stroke Given these dangers it s not surprising that Everest has claimed the lives of over climbers since Around bodies remaining on the mountain due to the difficulty in recovering them On May an unexpected storm engulfed the summit of Mt Everest killing eight climbers This was one of the deadliest tragedies in mountaineering history and remains as one of the most controversial episodes of it Around or p m there were more than people that had not made it down to camp Two of them were Rob Hall and Scott Fischer Fischer had collapsed and had likely perished at a spot called the Balcony which lies at about feet and Hall was still alive but in need of assistance In the early morning hours of May th Fischer unsuccessfully attempted to reach help by himself and then called down a distress call for help on his radio transmitter However due to fading batteries and low radio signal strength his call could not be received by anyone else on Everest at that time Eight climbers were quickly lost in a merciless storm that claimed their lives within just hours
