The next time you discard a plastic water bottle consider this That plastic bottle will take thousands of years to be converted back into the smaller chemical molecules from which it was made assuming it ever degrades Also consider that each year million tons of equally recalcitrant plastics are purchased worldwide and usually discarded And what is often forgotten is that to make all that plastic million tons of fossil fuels must be processed each year contributing additional waste diversion of the fuels from refineries and power plants and exacerbating geopolitical problems centered on oil and other fossil fuels Could microbes solve this problem Microbiologists are trying to answer that question Why could microbiologists suggest a solution to the plastics problem Plastics are organic polymers such as polyurethane polystyrene polyethylene and polyester Many bacteria and archaea store carbon as intracellular inclusions of poly hydroxybutyrate PHB and other polyhydroxyalkanoates PHAs PHAs are polyesters thus bacteria and archaea have evolved to synthesize a type of plastic
