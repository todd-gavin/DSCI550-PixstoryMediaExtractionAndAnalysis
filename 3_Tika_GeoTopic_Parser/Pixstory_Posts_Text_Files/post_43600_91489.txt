You ve probably heard of the notion that South Koreans will always be older than everybody else because they consider themselves a year old the moment they come out of the womb South Koreans celebrate their birthdays on the date they were born just like everyone else but their age won t change until the New Year which is every first of January If you want to know your Korean age you just need to subtract your year of birth from the current year then add one It s best to take note of this when someone asks for your age in South Korea because you ll need to distinguish between your international age and Korean age
