Presidential historian and author Michael Beschloss told us how the Rose Garden has altered throughout the Trump administration On President Joe Biden s Inauguration Day Beschloss went on MSNBC to discuss how the Trumps built a tennis pavilion near the space that looks quite like a cemetery He claimed that the Trumps wanted a photo of Melania strolling in the Rose Garden for the Republican National Convention but they couldn t get it because of the crabapple trees planted by Jackie Kennedy Onassis As journalists on the station joked they had the trees yanked out effectively for a camera shot Beschloss commented on Twitter that the pavilion looks like a scene from The Beverly Hillbillies He tweeted about the evisceration of the White House Rose Garden in prompting a comment from former First Lady Michelle Obama who oversaw the makeover He has demonstrated his ignorance by providing a photograph of the Rose Garden in its infancy she insisted His dishonest information is dishonourable and as a professional historian he should never be trusted However people disagree with her She turned a beautiful garden into something that looks like a walkway in between apartment buildings The Rose Garden should be named a national historical location Make it a penalty to mess with
