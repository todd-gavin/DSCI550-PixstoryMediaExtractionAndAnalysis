It s been a year not unbelievable because I missed you each passing day I felt the emptiness u had left inside me every moment I missed you even when u were alive and fighting those blank spaces in your brain which made you forget Since the onset of Alzheimer s how you withered to the extend that I could not see it any more and prayed that God takes you to a better place But the fighter you were you managed even that gracefully making sure you don t become a burden on anyone While you remembered nothing you always were struggling with yourself to remember to use the bathroom your self Till last moment that s the only thing you fought and you defeated Alzheimer s at this You also defeated Alzheimer s when it came to love You wouldn t recall my name but you told me you have been waiting for me just two days before you died Bae chasai pyaran Che were your last words to me You also defeated Alzheimer s when it came to caring for your loved ones Have you eaten you would ask every five minutes and I would have to remind you u just saw me eating How will u go home you asked me if the driver was waiting not remembering the driver had left the job long back since I had shifted cities How your eyes would light up at the mention of my brother my mother You would always ask how my dad was doing even as you almost forgot my mom your own daughter because you had seen one of your daughter go through the pain of loosing her husband you would constantly worry for the other How u held on to your love to your loved ones even your loses death of your son and son in law You won over Alzheimer s as you have always won over life as a young bride at or a widow at You were my hero my inspiration There hasn t been a stronger woman in my life I wish and pray to be even a fraction of what you have been
