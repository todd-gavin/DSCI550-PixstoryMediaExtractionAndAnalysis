Jug Jugg Jeeyo reminds me of one of those masquerade parties where everyone is grinning shrieking and flirting in the hopes that their half masked faces won t reveal themselves There s a sense of smug enjoyment here We have to laugh at this Punjabi family s antics since they are attempting to be amusing There s a lot of over the top acting here which we should avoid at all costs Please don t try these acts at home unaccompanied whatever this family is high on The continual attempts to be amusing and the grins on their cheeks are unhealthy Bheem and Kukoo played by Anil Kapoor and Varun Dhawan are seen behaving as if they are in a David Dhawan film I m a huge fan of Neetu Kapoor
