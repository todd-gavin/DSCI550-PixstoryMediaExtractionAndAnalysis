Mind Mapping is a useful technique that supports learning, improves information recording, shows how different facts and ideas are related, and enhances creative problem solving.

Mind Maps were popularized by author and consultant, Tony Buzan. They use a two-dimensional structure, instead of the list format conventionally used to take notes. This makes information easier to remember, as it's held in a format that our minds find easy to recall and quick to review.

They are easy to use. All you do is start with a central idea and expand it outwards. So for example if I'm using mind maps for my to do list. Central idea would be today, the branches would be different aspects of life, like spiritual, professional, personal, each branch would have different sub-branches which would contain specific tasks. 

It's easy to maintain and attractive for eyes. And you can do so much with it, you can use visual cues, use pictures and so many countless things. 

It is truly a useful tool in your quiver.
