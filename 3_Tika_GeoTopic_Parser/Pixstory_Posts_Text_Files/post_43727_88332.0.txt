Despite the ongoing crisis, the sport's regulatory body has pledged to help the Ukrainian Association of Football (UAF).
FIFA has dispatched a shipment of humanitarian aid to Ukraine and committed $1 million in funding to help the country recover from Russia's invasion.

As the Eastern European crisis approaches one month, football's governing body has acknowledged that it has been assisting.
This includes a sizable financial contribution to the Ukrainian Association of Football (UAF), which will be used to assist individuals in need.

What's been said so far?

FIFA President Gianni Infantino issued a statement pledging the organization's continued support for Ukraine amid the ongoing situation, saying that they would do everything they could to help their countrymen.

"In the face of this conflict, we want to do our part and support the people in Ukraine and the ones who have fled the war," he stated.
"The FIFA Foundation stands ready to provide some of the needed assistance by working in coordination with the football community in Ukraine and in the region."

What else has FIFA accomplished?

Apart from aid, FIFA and UEFA have imposed sanctions on Russia and given Ukraine promises in the midst of the current crisis.

The former has been barred from participating in its Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifiers, thereby ruining their prospects of qualifying four years after hosting the tournament, while the latter has been given permission to postpone their own playoff until the summer.
