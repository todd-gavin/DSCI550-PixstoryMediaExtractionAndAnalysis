Colorado police seized nearly 100 pounds of Fentanyl in a single day. This amount of Fentanyl is reportedly sufficient to kill 25 million people .The police found the Fentanyl in a car they pulled over on the highway, in which  100 pounds of pure fentanyl were found concealed behind a trap door inside a single vehicle. This is believed to be the largest seizure of pure fentanyl made on a United States highway.

This worrying new trend of fentanyl in the United States is one of the most deadly phenomena now taking place. A tiny amount of fentanyl is sufficient to kill a person. Due to this, even first-time drug users are vulnerable to death. Typically, this Fentanyl originates from outside the United States, namely Mexico, and is smuggled into the country by drug traffickers working for cartels.

Fentanyl is added to illicit substances by drug traffickers because it is extremely addictive and encourages consumers to seek more. Unfortunately, this highly addictive drug is also lethal. Over 100,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2021. The CDC estimates that 66% of these deaths were attributable to synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. The CDC also reported that in 2021, fentanyl was responsible for more fatalities than firearms and automobiles combined.
