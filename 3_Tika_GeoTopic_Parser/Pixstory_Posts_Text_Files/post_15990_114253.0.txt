Abstract 

Background 

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are common and disabling, necessitating lengthy hospitalizations. In this study we sought to identify potentially modifiable determinants of high-intensity hospital care use among adults with DFUs. 

Methods 

Three related case–control studies were conducted using Canada-wide cohorts of adults hospitalized with a DFU from 2011 to 2015. In study 1, cases comprised the top 10% with the highest cumulative 1-year acute care hospital costs; controls were randomly selected from those below the top 10%. Study 2 comprised cases/controls within/below the top 10% for cumulative acute care hospital length of stay (LOS). Study 3 included cases/controls within/below the top 10% for cumulative number of acute care hospitalizations. Using generalized linear models, predictor variables were tested between cases and controls, while adjusting for age and sex. 

Results 

In study 1, mean acute care costs among 8,971 cases and 3,174 controls were $71,757 and $13,687, respectively. Sepsis conferred the greatest excess cost (mean, $38,790; 95% confidence interval [CI], $34,597 to $43,508), followed by chronic kidney disease (mean, $30,607; 95% CI, $28,389 to $32,825) and major lower limb amputation (mean, $30,884; 95% CI, $28,613 to $33,155). In study 2, mean LOS was higher among 8,477 cases (69 days) than 3,467 controls (12 days). Lower limb amputation conferred the greatest adjusted excess in mean LOS (mean, 28 days; 95% CI, 27 to 28 days). In study 3, there was a mean of 3 hospitalizations among 10,341 cases and 1 among 5,509 controls. Peripheral artery disease conferred the greatest excess number of hospitalizations (1.3 more hospitalizations; 1.2 to 1.4). 

Conclusions 

Early aggressive treatment of chronic kidney disease and peripheral artery disease, alongside guideline-based amputation prevention strategies, may reduce high-intensity hospital care use among adults with DFUs.
