Oscars have been shocking over the years. They have always grabbed the attention of viewers with their shock choices of winners. Given that the past two years have been struck with Covid and Oscars have not had the amount of attention they want.. this year’s Oscars became a way back and Oscars came back. With all their drama in its purest form. 

From the choice of Best Actor and Actress to Will Smith losing his temper. Here is my take on all three moments, the awarding of Best Actor, Best Actress and why Will Smith losing his temper was justified. 

Starting off with the Best Actress snub, I want to say this as gently as possible, Oscars have lost their damn minds. Jessica Chastain is an amazing actress, one of the best of our generation but the fight was always supposed to be between Olivia and Kristen, no one else. They deserved it, while i adore Jessica with all my heart, she should not have won the Oscar this year, it just wasn’t right. 

I will need a separate post to express my views on Best Actor category, but the truth is it was supposed to be Andrew Garfield’s year and Oscars snubbed what could possibly be called one of the biggest snubs in their history. For me, they have become totally irrelevant after this year’s choices. 

Jokes have a limit, and Chris Rock crossed that one which he shouldn’t have. Calling a woman out for her choice of hairstyle is one limit that shouldn’t be crossed, especially after knowing that Jada has been public about her disease. Will Smith losing his temper and punching Chris Rock was justified. Scripted or not, Will Smith and comedians need to understand that diseases are not a topic of jokes.
