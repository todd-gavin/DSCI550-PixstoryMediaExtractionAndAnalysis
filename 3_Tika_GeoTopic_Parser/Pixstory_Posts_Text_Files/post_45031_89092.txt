Barcelona Women have remained undefeated this season and will enter the Women s Champions League quarterfinal second leg against Real Madrid with a first leg victory at the Alfredo Di St fano Stadium FIRST HALF In the first half Bar a were unrecognisable having played their worst minutes of the season so far A great Real Madrid squad came out with fantastic energy and stifling pressure without the ball and they were incredibly threatening whenever they had the ball which accounted for a lot of their awful play Bar a were taken off guard by Madrid s performance perhaps due to complacency and hubris and were unable to play their normal style They kept missing easy passes and never threatened in possession and their defence was a complete mess Madrid got whatever they wanted and Olga Carmona scored an early goal that set the tone for the rest of the game Esther Gonz lez Madrid s finest player was unstoppable and had two huge chances near the end of the half hitting the post from close range and forcing Sandra Paos into a big save Madrid could easily have scored two or three goals in the first half and they were clearly disappointed not to have scored more than once A mediocre Bar a team was rightfully behind at halftime and needed to play much better in the second half to have any chance
