Netflix just announced that they renew Formula 1: Drive to Survive for two more seasons which means, that if you are an F1 fan, then for the next two years your binge list already has one Documentary-Series.

I became a fan of F1 after watching the first and second seasons of the same Documentary-Series and now I follow every update of F1.

My favorite car in F1 is Ferrari and my favorite driver is Carlos Sainz.

Note down, if you are an F1 fan and which is your favorite car and driver.
