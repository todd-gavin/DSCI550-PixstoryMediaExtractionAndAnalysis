Emma Watson debuted a new pixie cut at the Prada Paradoxe fragrance launch party on Thursday (October 13) in London, England.
The 32-year-old Harry Potter actress had a very different hairstyle at the Kering Foundation’s Caring for Women dinner in New York City last month.
Emma's Harry Potter co-star Tom Felton wrote a memoir, "Beyond the Wand: The Magic and Mayhem of Growing Up a Wizard," which was released today (October 18). Emma wrote a touching foreword to the book.
"You know that person in your life who makes you feel seen?" Emma wrote. "That person who is somehow a witness to all that unfolds? That person who knows — really knows — what is happening to you and what you're going through, without anything having to be said? For me, that person is Tom Felton."
Tom admitted that he doesn’t think he was “ever in love with Emma” but “I loved and admired her as a person in a way that I could never explain to anybody else. We were kindred spirits.”
