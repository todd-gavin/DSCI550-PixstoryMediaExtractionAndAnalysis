Unique things that you can share with your therapist.

If it's more comfortable, wait till you feel safe and can trust your therapist before bringing in these topics. Patients have been hurt in the past by sharing something that then led to a screening call or diagnosis. My hope is that you have the opportunity to speak with someone who can hold space for anything you bring to the therapy chair that contributes to growth.
