Gabriel Jesus marked his Emirates debut today with an incredible four direct goal contributions. The striker was everywhere. First producing a moment of pure genius, as he lifted the ball over the goalkeeper when faced with the Leicester defender. His second, was a classic poacher's goal, popping up at the back post to score his second from the corner.

And he could've had more. Turning his defender, starting attacks, pressing all game long. One assist came from a great touch in the box and one came from a brilliant dribble.

The Brazilian showed everything Arsenal need from a striker today, and the Gunners seem to have made a world-class signing that will take them up levels.
