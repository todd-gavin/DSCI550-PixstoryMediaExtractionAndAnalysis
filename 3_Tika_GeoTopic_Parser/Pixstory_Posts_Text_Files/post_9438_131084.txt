It was their usual breakfast time like any other day Live and fulfilling moments of food and togetherness Giovanni tells his teenage son Andrea Giuseppe Sanfelice they will go for a jog together Then he gets a house call and leaves in a hurry He is a psychoanalyst who listens to his patients issues again and again hoping one day he would find the right solution for each Giovanni keeps himself calm and cool before them You wouldn t see him different in other premises of his life too When Andrea was caught stealing a fossil from the lab he doesn t make a scene He believes in the slow release of the truth from the accused His wife Paola Laura Morante involves more Daughter Irene Jasmine Trinca is cool and sporty The Son s Room is about this close knit Italian family and their disillusionment who would never see Andrea again Nanni Moretti s direction is distinct in normalizing grief with its solid abnormalities They did cry seeing his coffin but the family confused me with their routines Giovanni continues with his patients and Paula resumes her work But they never sleep together Irene goes to practice daily Eventually the unsettling grief with its gentle outer expressions started disintegrating them They kept visiting Andrew s room hoping to piece together his vibes into physical In one scene Giovanni goes to a music shop and asks for a piece his son usually listens to It becomes the background score of that house Irene loses her control on the volleyball ground Paola often breaks down Ironically the only living body now at Giovanni household is Andrea And the living deads wait for their salvation The Son s Room cannot be explained the hulking grief that blankets this Italian family can only be experienced through the poignant scenes created by Moretti who also acted as Giovanni It is easy to grasp melodrama but never the subtle deep grief takes charge on screen This could be one reason why critics sniffed when The Son s Room won the Palme d Or at the Cannes Film Festival
