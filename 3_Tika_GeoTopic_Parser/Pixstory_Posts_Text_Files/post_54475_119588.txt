The conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo DRC is one of the deadliest the world has ever witnessed One report estimates the death toll at million while a more conservative count puts it at one million dead Much of the conflict is centred in North Kivu and South Kivu provinces which lie on the DRC s eastern border The provinces border on Uganda in the north east Rwanda and Burundi to the east and Tanzania towards the south east Different scholars have attributed the recurrent conflict to ethnicity and nationality In recent years much of the focus has been on the illegal exploitation of Congolese natural resources However this does not explain the prevalence of the other two drivers of the conflict For this reason I set out to rethink the ongoing conflict in North Kivu and South Kivu as part of my PhD research I sought to establish whether the conflict can be considered as a political struggle between indigenous Congolese and Kinyarwanda speaking Congolese I also sought to investigate the contest for survival between Hutu and Tutsi elites Most scholarly works identify a conflict in North Kivu that dominated headlines in as the starting point of violence in the region But based on my research I have concluded that the conflict is two distinct conflicts that became intertwined over one and a half centuries The first is a much older conflict which started during colonialism and has as its source a local struggle for belonging The two conflicts The first conflict is rooted in Belgian and German colonialism in present day DRC Rwanda and Burundi Based on a racist notion popular among African colonists at the time the two colonial administrations gave privileged status to some of the local population based on ethnicity This explains how the Tutsi became the intermediate rulers for German and Belgian colonial powers in Ruanda Urundi the colony that gave birth at independence to Rwanda and Burundi Read more
