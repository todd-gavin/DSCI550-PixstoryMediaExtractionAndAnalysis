A video is viral on social media claiming that it is from France. The Islamic call to prayer (adhan) can be heard in the background and hordes of people can be seen offering prayers on the streets, in a large area surrounding a mosque.
This video has been shared on Twitter by Sagar Kumar of Sudarshan News with a caption in Hindi that reads, “This is Paris on Fridays…This will be India’s picture tomorrow if we don’t wake up.”

A couple of other users also shared this clip with a Hindi caption and called for bringing laws for population control. Another Sudarshan News journalist tweeted, “This is the “street” of Paris! The population of “jihadis” in Paris has been increasing steadily over the years. The population of Jihadis in our country is also increasing continuously. That’s why population control law is necessary.”

Viral since May
The video is viral on social media since May of this year. Back then it was shared with a Hindi caption that read, “There remains no space on the streets for ordinary French citizens to walk because 25 years ago, France was preaching “a liberal mindset” to its citizens. Now they are learning a lesson.” The captions even then claimed it to be from France and had used cryptic language that is along the lines of population replacement conspiracy theory.

The video has been shared on Facebook as well.
Fact-check
We performed a reverse image search on Yandex using keyframes from the viral video. It yielded multiple results including a tweet dated July 17, 2015, where the same mosque with the gold and green minarets can be seen, surrounded by visually similar-looking structures when compared to the viral video. The tweet is linked to a report by a Russian news agency on Muslims celebrating Eid-al-Fitr in Moscow in 2015.
