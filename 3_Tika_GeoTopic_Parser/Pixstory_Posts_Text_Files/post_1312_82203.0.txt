Scuderia Ferrari’s iconic red car has been a part of the F1 championship since it’s very inception. Every year, the world of motorsport looks forward to seeing the new contender brought in by Ferrari. This year is no different.

Even though Ferrari will be officially launching their 2022 car later today, someone on the internet leaked photos of the car a few hours ago. Someone with access to the to the car took a picture and posted it online. While many pounced onto the leak to get a look at the new car, I myself have done my best so far to avoid getting a look at it.

I will watch it be unveiled the way it was meant to be unveiled.
