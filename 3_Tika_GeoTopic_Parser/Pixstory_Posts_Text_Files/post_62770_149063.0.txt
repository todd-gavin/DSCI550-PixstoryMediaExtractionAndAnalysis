Feminism is not a difficult concept. It's just one thing – equal rights for all. Now how did that become so controversial? Simply because people in power, in this case – men, are afraid to lose that power.
Ask a man some book recommendations on second world war, he'd tell you about books on the second world war. Ask him to tell you about Christianity, he'll name some books about Christianity. Ask him about Patriotism, he'll tell you the best books written on patriotism.
Ask him for some book recommendations on feminism, he'll tell you how reading books on feminism will make you biased and how feminism does not welcome critics and how feminism has oppressed men. Basically anything but the answer.
Nevertheless, coming back to the topic, here is a list of some books to understand feminism written by women. These will help you understand what different women feel about feminism, coming from different backgrounds.
