This happened with me a couple of weeks before! 
That was the first time when I was travelling in metro. Me and my college friends were coming back from Akashvani Studio. We took the metro from Rajiv Chowk metro station. I had to exit from the Vishwavidyalaya Metro Station. Two of my friends had to take the exit at different other metro stations, which came before Vishwavidyalaya. 
I bade them goodbye and they left. Now I was all alone. First time alone in the Metro! 
I was already scared. There was a sudden announcement, then. The voice wasn’t much clear. I confirmed it from others in the metro. I came to know that, as per the announcement, the metro needed a service and that it won’t go further after Vishwavidyalaya. Oh gosh! I was saved! It nearly scared the hell out of me! What if the train could have stopped before going to Vishwavidyala! 
I really thanked my God! 

I have sworn, never to travel alone again in metro!
