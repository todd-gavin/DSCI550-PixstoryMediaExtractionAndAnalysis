Dua Lipa doesn't need an intro as her songs speaks. Her career is definitely based on her voice and the singer also goes through an effective diet to maintain her physique. 
So let's see what Dua Lipa eats in a day
BREAKFAST
Her breakfast consists of banana and cashew butter, which gives her plenty of plant based protein and potassium. And she also includes eggs and fruit to her meal. 
LUNCH
She eats salads, lean wraps and other veggie meals which won't make her feel bloated. 
DINNER
She keeps her dinner healthy, but if she have some cravings them she would let herself indulge in those goods. She believes in eating the foods she craves at the moment and doesn't believe in the concept of cheat days.
