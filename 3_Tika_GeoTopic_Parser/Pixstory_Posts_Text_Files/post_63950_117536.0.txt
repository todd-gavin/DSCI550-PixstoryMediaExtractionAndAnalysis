Sometimes, songs made by artists with a more commercial or mainstream factor in mind, tend to become overblown in size, becoming overplayed and eventually overrated by music critics and magazines. Rock bands have been the biggest victim of this phenomenon.
 
Sometimes they are genuinely good and only start losing their appeal due to being overplayed, while sometimes, they are either just painfully average overshadowing songs much better or just being outright bad.
 
 This leads to these songs often being featured in various lists such as Billboard Top 100 or ‘Greatest songs of all time’, when in reality these songs are either good, average or otherwise they just plain suck.
 
Rock bands either cook up or have to compose jazzed up mainstream songs by agencies which tend to become criminally overplayed and eventually overrated, leading the public to essentially become sick of both the song, and unfortunately sometimes the artist as well, when unfortunately that song may very well be a poor reflection of that group or artist’s true talent.
