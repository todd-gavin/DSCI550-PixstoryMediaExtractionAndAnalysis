It’s that time of year. The North London Derby. At home. Half past twelve kick off on Saturday. The Emirates Stadium is going to be absolutely popping. Here’s how I want Mikel Arteta to set Arsenal up tomorrow…  GK – Ramsdale – Obviously. Best ‘keeper in North London, by the way. LB – Zinchenko – Probably the hardest pick in the team. I see why people want Tierney. He offers more defensively and was really good against Brentford. But if they are both fit, and seeing as Kulusevski is likely to miss out, I want Zinchenko starting. He helps us dominate the ball and gives Xhaka more freedom going forward. CB – Gabriel and Saliba – Nothing to add. Simple. RB – White – Assuming he is fit, he deserves to keep his place. DM – Partey – Not like we have much choice here, to be fair. He NEEDS to be fit. #8 – Xhaka – Our best player last month and will be excellent tomorrow. #8 – Odegaard – Captain of the team. These are the games we need him to step up in. He has to control everything. LW – Martinelli – One of our most threatening players, will run whoever Spurs play RWB absolutely ragged. ST – Jesus – The main man. We brought him in to elevate us in these sorts of games, let’s see if he’s up to the task RW – Saka – Last time, he said, ‘Imagine scoring in the North London Derby bro’ and then did it. Same again this year please, B.  Tricky game but we know we’ll probably have a lot of the ball. Let’s hope everyone is firing on all cylinders tomorrow. What would you change? Tierney or Zinchenko? Let me know!
