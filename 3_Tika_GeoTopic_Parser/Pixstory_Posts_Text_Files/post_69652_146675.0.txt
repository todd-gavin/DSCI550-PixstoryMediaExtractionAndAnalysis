Personal History!‚öΩÔ∏èSince you all know my introduction from my first postüòä.So basically how my Football carrier begins, since from my childhood i love this sport but that time i am not very much introduced to this sport. One day, only one of my school coach called me and asked if i wanted to play for the school team. I said yes at that time, so the other day I joined the school football academy.So I started playing in my school team and day my day my game was improved. From the starting i wish to play as a striker because i like dribbling and scoring goals to make myself shine.After a few years at the age of 18, one day my frined called me and asked if i wanted to play professionally in Delhi B division league.of cours, i said yes, so the next day i went to the place where the trials was held. The coach of the club was impressed with my game and  select me for this league.So I selected for the club named Union Football Club as a striker.So after the team selection our training session begins, by training professionally I am able to improve my game even more through professional training.So, i am still playing and my future football career is going well.
