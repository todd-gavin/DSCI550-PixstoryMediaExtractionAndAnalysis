Sri Lanka stunned Australia in their third and final Twenty20 international after skipper Dasun Shanaka hit an undefeated half-century to lead his team home in a nail-biting finish on Saturday.
The hosts were chasing a target of 177 to finish the series on a high after going down miserably against the visitors in the first two matches.

Fox Sports reported that Shanaka scored an unbeaten 54 off 25 balls with five fours and four sixes to seal a four-wicket victory.

Shanaka and tailender Chamika Karunaratne shared a 69-run stand for the seventh wicket after they had been struggling at 108 for six in the 15th over.

Sri Lanka needed 59 off the final three overs, with the pair facing Josh Hazlewood, Kane Richardson and Jhye Richardson.

Needing 19 off the final over bowled by Richardson, the skipper hit two fours and a mighty six to level the scores with one ball remaining, after the Australian started the over with two wides.

Richardson then bowled a third wide with the final ball to hand the win to the home side.

“Process is always important,” Shanaka said after his player-of-the-match performance.“They took a brave decision to bat first, it wasn’t the best idea to bat first in these conditions. We should take this momentum in the ODI series moving forward,” he added.
