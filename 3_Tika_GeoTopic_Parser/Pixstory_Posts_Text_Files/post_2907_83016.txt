Amid what seems the countdown to Russia s invasion of Ukraine French president Emmanuel Macron made a last ditch effort to avert the military action brokering a meeting between US president Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin The two have agreed in principle to meet but given the increasingly belligerent stance from both sides the meet if it takes place at all is not expected to resolve the crisis Amid continued heavy shelling in eastern Ukraine Macron burnt some midnight oil late Sunday and got the two leaders to agree to a meet but it seems only tentative as of now The summit schedule and agenda will be decided when secretary of state Antony Blinken meets Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov this week There were no indications of the start of any preparations The Kremlin spokesman said it was too early to talk about plans to organize any summits The White House press secretary meanwhile repeated that the US is committed to pursue diplomatic options but added that the talks could happen only if an invasion hasn t happened The added comments in tune with the repeated remarks from the US officials that Putin has made all preparations to strike do not inspire much faith in the talks From the other side it is not words but deeds that create tensions As a precursor to the military action Russia held military drills in neighboring Belarus deploying troops there It had promised to remove them by Sunday They have not moved yet Russia has placed more than soldiers at the Ukrainian border said to the largest military buildup in Europe since World War II The summit if held will have to consider Russia s demands already rejected by the Western powers that they guarantee NATO won t allow Ukraine and other former Soviet countries to join it as members It also wants them to stop weapons deployments to this tiny neighboring country and roll back NATO forces from Eastern Europe The other issue at the meet could be the strong sanctions the US is threatening on Russia as deterrents Also see
