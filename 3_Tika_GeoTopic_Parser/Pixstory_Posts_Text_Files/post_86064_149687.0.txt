Hello everyone ✨️✨️✨️ 
Don't you all get excited and inspired by the great leader by their speech??
Do you ever think about how do they develop this skill within themselves??
Let's discuss the same-
1. Before becoming a speaker be a good listener. Try to listen for understanding the context.
2.  Whenever you get any chance to speak don't feel shy or hesitant, it's the only method to groom yourself.
3. If you feel nervous or have anxiety before speaking, trust me you are going on the right path, just trust the process.
4. You can speak in front of the mirror on any random topic, and by, this you not only boost your confidence, however, but you will also gain more knowledge.
5. Most of us have a misconception that Communication means ENGLISH. My friend that's not the case. Communication is above any language. 
6. Communication means how to deliver your message to the next person it includes how you speak and most importantly what is your stance and gestures while delivering your message. 
That's all from my side, wish you all HAPPY LEARNING and every one is unique in their way. Accept yourself and be confident ✨️
