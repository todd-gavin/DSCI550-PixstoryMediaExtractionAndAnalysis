Kolo Toure was one of the most astute signings Arsene Wenger made for Arsenal. There is a fascinating story about the Ivorian’s trial at Arsenal. During the trial, the ball was rolled into Thierry Henry and Kolo Toure smashed into him with a tackle that would have got him sent off in a game. Henry was hurt and Wenger cautioned Toure to refrain from tackles. However, he repeated the same thing on Dennis Bergkamp. Later the ball arrived near Wenger who found himself at the receiving end of a two-footed tackle before he could do anything about it. Toure was in tears, but Wenger – ice pack on his ankle – decided he wanted the man on his team. He was signed from Ivorian club ASEC Mimosas for a fee of just 150,000 pounds. He only got to make 9 starts in his first season which included deputising in midfield and at right back. Toure became a proper member of the first team at centre back in the 2003-04 season. With a solid partnership between Sol Campbell and Kolo Toure in defence, Arsenal famously went undefeated this season. In 2005-06, he was part of the team that set a European record of ten consecutive clean sheets on the way to the Champions League final. This run comprised of shutouts against star-studded Real Madrid and Juventus teams. Between 2002 and 2009, Toure made 326 appearances for The Gunners. 
He moved to Manchester City in 2009. Kolo Toure won his second league title with City in 2011-12 but was only able to make 14 appearances. He is one of only 9 players to win the Premier League title with two different clubs. In 2013, he was signed by Liverpool FC where he played till 2016. He spent his last year in professional football at Celtic; he made 20 appearances in a season where they won the domestic treble without losing a single game. He also made 120 appearances for Cote d’Ivoire between 2000 and 2015. He was part of the team that won the Africa Cup of Nations in 2015 and scored his penalty in the shootout against Ghana in the final.
