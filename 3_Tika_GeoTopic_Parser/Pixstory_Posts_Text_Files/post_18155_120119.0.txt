If Shakira is found guilty in her upcoming trial for alleged tax fraud, prosecutors in Spain say they would urge a judge to sentence her to eight years and two months in jail.

(AP) MADRID — In the event that Colombian music artist Shakira is found guilty in her upcoming trial for alleged tax fraud, prosecutors in Spain announced on Friday that they will urge the court to sentence her to eight years and two months in jail.

Shakira is accused of failing to pay the Spanish government 14.5 million euros ($15 million) in taxes between 2012 and 2014. Her full name is Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll. The prosecution declared that they will also pursue a $24 million ($24 million) fine.She is accused with six crimes, according to the indictment. This week, the singer turned down a plea bargain from the prosecution and chose to go to trial instead. There is no definite date for the trial.

Shakira "has always complied and abided by the law, exhibiting excellent behaviour as a human and a taxpayer," according to a statement sent by her publicists in London on Friday. The Spanish Tax Agency was accused of abusing her rights by the publicists.

The musician has deposited the sum she is said to owe, along with 3 million euros in interest, according to Shakira's Spanish public relations staff, who made the announcement earlier this week.The Grammy winner allegedly should have paid taxes in Spain as she spent more than half of each year between 2012 and 2014 there, according to Barcelona prosecutors.

Shakira, who has two children with FC Barcelona player Gerard Piqué, recently called it quits on their 11-year relationship. The family formerly called Barcelona home.
