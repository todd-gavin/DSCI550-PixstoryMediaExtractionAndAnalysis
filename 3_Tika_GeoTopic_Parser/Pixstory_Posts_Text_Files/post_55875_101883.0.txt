There is a question among republicans about whether their candidates should show loyalty toward trump. A slight majority of Republicans do want their candidates to focus on showing loyalty to Trump, but nearly half don't see a point. Overall we get a picture that Americans see parties diving them not only in the terms of demographics but also in policies. Polls also suggest that Americans believe that Republican Party is fighting for White people more than for Black people â€” by more than two to one. 

Many accuse the republican party fights against the interests of Black Americans than being neutral toward them. It's similarly true for views of the Republican Party's approach to Hispanic people, with more feeling it works against them, rather than for them, and by more than two to one, against LGBTQ people than for them. Americans do think the GOP fights more for religious people than do Democrats.

Democrats on other hand fought for Black and Hispanic Americans more so than for White Americans. Americans are more likely to believe the GOP fights more against the interests of women than for women. Republicans are more likely to say White Americans suffer "a lot" of discrimination than they are to say Black Americans do.
From many points, the democrats are deemed as the forward and good guys and republicans have a negative image in that aspect.
