To deepen the dialogue between participants, some Art Residencies are also provided for the period of the Event.The curatorial team at Nine Fish Art Gallery for Art35 has over seven years of experience in the organisation & support of cultural programs and Art Residencies. Since 2016, Art35 has been successfully growing and the number of applications clearly make it a sought-after Exhibition as well as Art Residency programme.Starting with just painting and sculpture, today Art35 has expanded to include artists from other fields of practices too. Art35 has since hosted and presented visual artists, performance artists, photographers, curators, writers, sculptors, designers, media artists and more.
