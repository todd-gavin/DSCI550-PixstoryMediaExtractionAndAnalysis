She said that a primary problem is that many families still in Afghanistan are unable to safely travel to a third country where they can do the biometrics and submit the paperwork necessary to get to Canada.
"They're going to have to go to an office that's run by the Taliban right now and ask for passports," she said. "As you can imagine, red flags and alarm bells go off when the entire family shows up saying they need a passport to go to Canada."
Mr Zahed, for his part, said that the lives of family members still in Afghanistan are at risk each day they remain in the country.

While one of his two brothers was successfully smuggled out of the country to Turkey, another - who stayed in Afghanistan - has gone missing. His fate is unknown.
"The Taliban have been searching houses," he added. "I've got two other colleague that live here [in Canada] One has lost 11 [family members]since the Taliban took over. The other's sister was killed in a school. It's been really, really dangerous."
Another former interpreter, Ottawa-based Ghulam Faizi, told the BBC he has 18 members of his extended family left in Afghanistan, where they are living in hiding.
Three other family members have made it to Pakistan, where they have been waiting in vain for permission to travel to Canada.
"They've been there three months and now their Pakistani visas have expired," he said, saying some have never received a response from Canadian officials.
Many of the interpreters and those working on their behalf are frustrated by the treatment of Afghan allies when they look at how Canada is handling the process for Ukrainians fleeing war.
