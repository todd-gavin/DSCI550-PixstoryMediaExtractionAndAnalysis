Dr. D. R. Patil in his work “The Antiquarian Remains of Bihar (1963)” has given a fuller description of the site. He mentions that the mound is thickly covered with broken bricks and pottery which has been identified as the Northern Black Polished Ware (NBPW) indicative of human presence at the site between 600-200 BC. The evidence of pottery substantially corroborates the tradition about the Chero Raja as the builder of the site. He mentions that the site thus appears to represent quite an early site and deserves to be thoroughly explored further. On a closer examination Garrick concludes that the site of Deo Markandeya contained the remains of a complete religious establishment. But he did not take much notice of the existence of NBPW at the site, which indicates that the temples may have been built on an earlier habitation site which Garrick took to represent a religious establishment attached to the shrines.


The area around the ancient site is now quite well populated. It has remained in occupation since the most ancient times. Several generations have found spiritual solace in visiting this very site.

A large school has been recently built just next to the ancient site, which has now reduced the view of the site from a distance as it may have earlier seen by Buchanan and others. There seems to be an urgent need for systematic exploration of the site and its proper documentation for knowledge of the generations to come.
