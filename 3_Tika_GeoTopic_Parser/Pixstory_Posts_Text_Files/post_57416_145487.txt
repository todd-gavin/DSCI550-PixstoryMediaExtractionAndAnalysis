That is what is being said in the parent post Constructive criticism helps not negative ones And no critics in literature never aim to consider their criticism greater than the work itself this is so badly articulated instead whenever someone is making an opinion on anything they focus on proving their ideas and If their thoughts won t be persuasive then it would not work as critique Likewise work needs to be persuasive to speak for itself accepting criticism is necessary but you can t agree or submit to whatever is being said every time You refute and deny because for you those opinions don t matter or so to say they re not so appropriate to criticise your work Negative criticism and words are made out of spite sometimes to put down the work and the artist It is biased and ignorant of the good aspect the work might have Here we have our side to decide and act If rightly said the right kind of criticism can give the artist an advantage to perform and improve but the mere aim of fault finding can demotivate and humiliate
