World Mental Health day is here!!💚
The day is observed around the world to raise awareness about the significance of mental wellness.🧠✨
According to the World Health Organization, the day offers an opportunity for all those working on mental health issues to speak about their work. 📚💻
The day highlights the significance of how the efforts in this direction are crucial and how more needs to be done.💟
World Mental Health Day🧠💟 was observed for the first time on October 10, 1992. It was an initiative by the World Federation For Mental Health, a global organisation with over 150 member nations.💝
In the Indian context, conversations around mental health are fast gaining a stronghold.💪💚
Especially after the outbreak of the pandemic😮‍💨. The lack of social interactions, remote work, and being confined in homes🏫for prolonged periods ⏳have been impacting the mental well-being of thousands of Indians. Indian companies had made employee mental well-being their top priority.💝
 Several organisations have come forward to devise and implement newer ways to help those dealing with mental health issues.⚡
