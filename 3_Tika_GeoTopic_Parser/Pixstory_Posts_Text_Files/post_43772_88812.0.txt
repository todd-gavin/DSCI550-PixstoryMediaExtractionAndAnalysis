With Southampton in the top half of the Premier League and Hasenhuttl having previously worked with Ralf Rangnick at RB Leipzig, Hasenhuttl has emerged as a candidate to take over at United this summer.

Rangnick, United's interim manager, will begin a two-year consultant post at Old Trafford in the summer and will have a voice in who gets the permanent job.

"When this question comes up, I will listen to my stomach and say, 'what is for the best?"' Hasenhuttl said ahead of Southampton's Premier League home game with Newcastle on Thursday.

"I can guarantee that in the past that has never proved me wrong and was always the right decision. There are not a lot of scenarios where I can imagine I go from here.

"I have here everything I need as a manager. I have a fantastic team to work with, an unbelievably good atmosphere in the club, and everybody is backing and supporting me.

"To enjoy it when things are coming together and everything is working fine is the best position to be in as a manager.
"Me and my wife love it here. We love the people; they are so nice and friendly.

"Everywhere I go, even when we did not have good games, they are unbelievable. I cannot imagine having a better job."
"I play against the best managers and best teams in the world and can compete with a young team.

"I also like to watch the Champions League during the week. But sometimes it's easier to sit at home on the sofa, watch it relaxed and concentrate on the game at the weekend against one of these teams than to play (in it) yourself.

"This doesn't mean I'm not looking to be successful. I'm also driven for success, but it's important that you also know what you really want."
