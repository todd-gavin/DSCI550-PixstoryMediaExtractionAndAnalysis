The pandemic did a 180Â° turn to our lives. 
Usually I would complain about all of it because as I should, right? Our vacation plans have turned to dust, the uncertainty about one's future, new found anxiety that comes with crowded places, but one thing that I can't and won't complain about is the "work from home" advantage. 
I feel a person is way more productive in a comfortable setting like their home. It has also helped to maintain a perfect balance of work between both the husband and wife. Infact, a major chunk of employees have called out their respective companies for their return-to-office plans.
