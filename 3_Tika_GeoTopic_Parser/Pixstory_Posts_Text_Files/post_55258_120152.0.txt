Congratulations to Satyakaam Meerut that started a #SayNoToPlasticBags mission as part of #PlasticFreeJuly. Jute bags were distributed to each and every student of the school with a message to avoid plastic bags completely. This program was launched by eminent anchor and journalist Ms. RICHA ANIRUDH.
Another project launched is a start-up by the students to grow vegetables with the help of experts for the technical and the financial aspects. The natural farming project will be funded by the school management initially till it becomes self-sustainable. The profit generated during the process will be credited to the welfare fund for the students.
