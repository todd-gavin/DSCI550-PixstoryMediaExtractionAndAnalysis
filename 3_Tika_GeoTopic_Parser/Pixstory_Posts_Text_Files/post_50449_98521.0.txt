Oh man! I am right now 18 years old and going to turn 19 in this June but I still watch Shinchan ðŸ˜…

I don't know who still watches cartoons like Shinchan in this age as well. But honestly I can't never get rid of this cartoon. One of the best memories I had from my childhood is that whenever I came back from school, I just start watching Shinchan.

My obsession was on another level ðŸ˜Œ.I mean I used to be known among my friends circle through Shinchan...just everybody knew about it. Now I can even imitate just like Shinchan.... another talentðŸ˜Ž and used to do activities just like he do...like teasing your mom ðŸ˜œ.

Well I specifically don't know why I had so huge obsession . But yes, it may be because it is such a joy to watch, so relaxing . Just like any another cartoon it does not display any superpowers.... which becomes just so boring with timeðŸ˜¬

Well...we all had some of our favourite cartoons to watch which meant  special to us!
Do just let me know ðŸ˜€
