Have you ever felt shame?ðŸ«£
Personally, it's crippled me in past. Toxic shame can cut us to the core, making it challenging to offer ourselves self-love.
But, by creating safe space for our shame to be witnessed and felt, we can process through it and realise it. And when that happens, at least for me, it's ugly and messy during, but glorious afterwards.
ðŸŒŸ I'm honoured to offer you a safe space to sit with shame or any other suppressed emotions that are no longer working toward your highest and greatest good.ðŸ’–
