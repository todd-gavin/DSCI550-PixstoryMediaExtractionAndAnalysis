This morning as I thought about my life and how did years go by I got to thinking about the past and the concept of closure Before I delve any further into the relationship between past and closure I feel it is pivotal that I explain what closure is to me For me closure signifies putting an experience to rest meaning that when I do look back at an experience it would not haunt me anymore For some people school days were days of the glorious past For me it is awkward beyond expression I have got to put this out School sucked for me especially high school I was bullied for being fat with squinted eyes Guys at school were assholes sorry for the profanity but they were and I do not want to see anyone from school ever again I have been struggling to deal with mental health issues and while I struggle less to deal with it now that doesn t make it easy People say it was a long time ago adding that I need to move on It s not that I want to hold on to it I am doing my best to deal with it It is just that it is not easy to talk about it making it a Herculean task to ask for help I am slowly and steadily learning how to ask for it Coming back to the main plot why do we seek closure To move on they say I couldn t help but wonder why would someone who wanted to move on want to relive those experiences again I guess it is a way to look at our fears in the eye and try to move on hoping that life has something good stored for us We all want to feel worthy of something and I guess in my case closure is that one way ticket to peace We all have experiences that date way back And moving on from them is not easy but we have to However there is no rush to do so Take your time I guess I m ready to put it to rest now
