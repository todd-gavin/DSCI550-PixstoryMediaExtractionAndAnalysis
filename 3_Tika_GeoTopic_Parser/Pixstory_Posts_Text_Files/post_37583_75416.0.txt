A satirical reference to the age old proverb- 'cast not pearls before swine'- which apparently pre-determines who's worth the wisdom and who's not. A beautiful reminder that each one of us, heathen or not, is capable of defining their own standards, principles, ethics, without monopolizing knowledge, and without being condescending. Basically, live and let live!
