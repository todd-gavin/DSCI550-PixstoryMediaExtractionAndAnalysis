In support of the 'Sport For Health' partnership between the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) and WHO, FIFA and Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, prominent athletes have shared their views on the importance of sport for promoting physical and mental health. 
The Healthy FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 partnership, also known as the Sport and Health project, is supported by three key pillars — health promotion, health security and health communications.
“I’m proud to be connected with the WHO and this initiative, because it makes people aware that through sports you can have a better life,” said champion footballer and Qatar Legacy Ambassador Ronald de Boer.
In a video message, sharing his views about the benefit of sport in promoting mental health, the former Dutch professional footballer said, “Mental health is a very under estimated disease. Because you don’t see it from outside, and when you feel comfortable with your body, you are physically well. I think this will also help you mentally, and that’s why sport is very important.”
