Life is full of ups and downs We see and experience things that perturb and disturb us and then we experience and witness things that delight and excite us No one truly knows why it is so But what we do know is that we have to live it so Things don t feel right at times you don t feel right sometimes When you introspect to look for what is wrong you in certain moments realise oh perhaps you re missing something What it is exactly that you re missing is hard to find When you do figure it out you only think of having it in your grasp People feel wrong to you for you with you sometimes Identify why if you can t then perhaps its not meant to be that way We all belong to these feelings as they belong to all of us Emotions are what bind us together by commonality and what creative stark distinctions based on how people act on their emotions When something feels off like you don t belong in that moment that feeling is next to hopelessness Our aim should be to find what makes us feel as if we belong to a place with a person with a family we created from the dirt the essence of this existence We all belong to various sects formed on the basis of religion gender caste creed ancestral lineage place of birth and most notably experiences Our experiences do indeed define and shape us as they tend to generate feelings and memories within us making us have habits and actions influenced by them someway Shared similar experiences bring people together to help each other to be with each other to have each other grow and develop to find their way in this world We find a sense of belonging in any and everywhere and thing In books music movies TV shows famous personalities academic fields laborious careers structural organised living and what not Dreams and fiction are all realities and parts of this reality as well but they have that extra something that makes us feel right at home where we belong Image Source Pinterest
