Liverpool claimed their second title of the season on Saturday, as they defeated Chelsea in the finals of the FA Cup. Just like the Carabao Cup final a couple of months ago, the match was pushed to the penalty shootouts, after no goals were scored in the 120 minutes of play.

Despite winning the final in the most dramatic fashion, Liverpool fans were handed a scare, as Mohamed Salah was injured in the first half itself. He played no part in the second half, as Jurgen Klopp decided against risking the Egyptian star. He played no part in the second half. When asked by the reporters about his involvement in the UCL final against Real Madrid, Salah dismissed injury concerns, and stated that he will certainly be involved in the mix.

"I'm good. Of course," Salah stated when asked about his participation in the UCL Final against Real Madrid, as reported by Goal. Liverpool have just three fixtures remaining to end in what could be one of their most successful campaigns. Next up, is an away trip to Southampton, which is a must win fixture in order to keep the pressure on Manchester City.

Mohamed Salah might not play a part in that fixture, and could instead be called upon for the final home game against Wolves on next Sunday. Salah will certainly want to be ready for the European final against the Galacticos, given that he was injured during the final clash back in 2018. 

Jurgen Klopp also stated that Mohamed Salah's substitution was a precautionary measure, given the fixtures that are piled up for the next two weeks. "Mo came and he said he could carry on, but he felt a little thing. I hope he will be fine," Klopp stated.
