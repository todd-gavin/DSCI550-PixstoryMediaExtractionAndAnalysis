Homework may look stressful, but kids work through it. If they manage to do it, what's the harm in making them learn the ways through life?

Our world is becoming more and more competitive on a daily basis. No matter where they are, children must study everything they can to succeed. We must educate our children to the greatest extent feasible in order to maintain a balance of knowledge throughout the world. In terms of education, homework is essential to prevent academic lag.

It is easy to complete assignments during class and have them turned in at the end. Everyone is watching while also working on the assignments given by the teacher. The child has to work independently at home. They must read or reread the text related to the task if they have any questions.

It makes them efficient. They get to learn to ask questions. Not to mention, homework teaches them to manage time. They get to know their strengths and weaknesses in a subject. Homework essentially make them understand themselves better.

It's not practical to make them do the entire curriculum in school alone. If they don't get homework, they'll be far behind other kids.
