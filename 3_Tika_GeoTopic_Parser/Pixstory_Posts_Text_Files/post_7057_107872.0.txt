On 6 June, The Probe published an interview by these reporters with Amardeep Sharma, former Managing Director of Almas Global Opportunity Fund (AGOF), a Cayman Islands-registered entity. While Sharma claimed that everything about the “winning” bid by Star9 Mobility Solutions Private Limited – of which AGOF is an important part – to acquire a majority stake in the public sector undertaking Pawan Hans Limited (formerly Helicopter Corporation of India) is above board, several doubts and unanswered questions remain.

On 29 April, Star9 Mobility was declared the winning bidder for the government-owned helicopter service provider. AGOF holds the largest (49%) stake in Star9 Mobility that has bid Rs 211 crore for the Indian government’s 51% stake in Pawan Hans.

On 16 May, these reporters published an article in The Wire and NewsClick investigating the antecedents of the Star9 Mobility consortium, pointing out that there were questions about whether AGOF met the eligibility criteria laid out by the government to participate in the bidding and that an adverse order had been passed against it by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) a week before Star9 Mobility’s selection as the winning bidder. On the same day, it was reported that the privatisation of Pawan Hans had been “put on hold.”

On 28 May, we wrote in The Probe a second article delving deeper into the antecedents of AGOF wherein we detailed the links between AGOF and Kudakwashe Reginald Tagwirei, a controversial businessman from Zimbabwe. Our report described how AGOF had allegedly acted as a front for Tagwirei to channel his funds and that the fund had continued its association with him even after he was sanctioned by the governments of the United States of America and the United Kingdom. The article further pointed out that two government documents suggested that allowing the sale of Pawan Hans to Star9 Mobility would constitute a violation of government rules – due to the adverse order by the NCLT against AGOF and due to the fund appearing to not have met the eligibility criteria to bid for the shares of the government company.
