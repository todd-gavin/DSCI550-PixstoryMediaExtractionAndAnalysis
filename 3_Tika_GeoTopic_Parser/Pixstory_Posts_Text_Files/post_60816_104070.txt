Honestly summer months are the ones i dont look upto at all But I ve developed some habits which help me have a good time One of my favourite summer activities is swimming Jumping in the pool is absolutely relaxing A visit to the hills to be away from the delhi heat becomes a frequent thing I ve also developed the habit of giving more time to the things that i enjoy doing and that has really helped me along the way And ofcourse a game of valorant with my friends is a must Other than that ice creams and iced teas literally feel like my best buddies
