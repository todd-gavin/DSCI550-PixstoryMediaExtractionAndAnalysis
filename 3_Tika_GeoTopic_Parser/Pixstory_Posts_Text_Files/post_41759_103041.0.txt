Former New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori has been named as the Australian men's cricket team's assistant coach. 

IE reported that Vettori has coaching expertise in the Indian Premier League, Australia's Twenty20 Big Bash tournament, England, and the Caribbean, having played against Australia in 19 of his 113 Tests for New Zealand. 

In March, the former left-arm spinner served as a spin bowling consultant for Bangladesh and Australia during their successful Test series in Pakistan. 

He will lead Australia's bowling attack beginning with the Test tour to Sri Lanka next month. Andre Borovec has been engaged as an assistant coach for the Australian A team in Sri Lanka. Both have previously worked with Andrew McDonald, the head coach.

In a statement announcing the appointments Tuesday, Cricket Australia said Vettori’s “international experience in all forms of the game as a player and coach is almost unrivalled and his strategic insights, coaching approach and collaborative style will be invaluable for Andrew and the team.”
