There are so many effective ways to train your core during pregnancy that may not look like typical core exercises

Here are 3 movements you can implement in to your pre or postnatal training for core strengthening!  

1. Single arm DB farmers carry:

Holding weight in one hand Keep shoulders and pelvis in a straight line as you walk
forward 8-10 steps.

Switch hands at the end and walk back.
Adjust weight as needed.

2. Single leg deadlift to row:

Holding weight in 1 hand, opposite hand to standing leg (so same arm and leg are moving).
With a slight bend in the standing knee hinge at the hip (use wall for support if needed)
Keep back straight and send bum back.
At the bottom of the movement pull the DB in to your waist sending the elbow back.

3. Weighted Bird/Dog:

All 4's position with hands under shoulders and knees under hips with neutral spine/pelvis.
Use DB in one hand. Raise that hand and opposite leg.
Maintain table top like position. Do not let the
shoulders or pelvis twist so only raise as far as you can whilst maintaining form.
Bring arm and leg back down. Repeat 10 times on one side before switching!


These 3 exercises are fantastic for core engagement and not a crunch in sight! Give them a go!
