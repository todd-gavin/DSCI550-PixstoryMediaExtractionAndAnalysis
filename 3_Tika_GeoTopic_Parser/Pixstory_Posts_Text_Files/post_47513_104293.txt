With Dominic Calvert Lewin playing through injury too Since then Everton have turned it around and found their rhythm somewhat atleast They still did lose a few games here and there but the change in intensity desire and pure energy for the team was visibly there in each of those players individually Lampard is an excellent man manager and Goodison Park wouldn t be see Premier League football next season had it not been for him The season closed with defeat to Arsenal but victories over Chelsea Manchester United Leicester City were particularly enjoyable The crowning jewel of the season though was the win over Palace overturning a half time deficit Hit of the Season Richarlison The Brazilian may have an inflated ego and an incredibly luxurious lifestyle to accompany but none can deny his role in saving Everton from the jaws of relegation this season Flop of the Season Allan The ex Napoli midfield player failed to have the impact he was initially brought in for Perhaps the physicality of the Premier League was overwhelming we rarely saw flicks of quality from his boots Top Scorer Richarlison undoubtedly goals in the league add another assists to make that goal contributions across the length of the season for a relegation threatened team Invaluable contribution Richarlison deserves to play for a better team
