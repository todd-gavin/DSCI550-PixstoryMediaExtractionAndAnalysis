Smoking is injurious to health and when people are trying to get out of it there are various methods like approaching a rehabilitation centre or going for chewing gums A new study gives us an insight into a new method of going without cigarettes for months that s by receiving noninvasive low intensity electric or magnetic impulses and people were twice likely to stay for three to six months without cigarettes which was better than receiving the placebo treatment Researchers from University of Dijon in France collected the data from various studies that involves subjects The results were published in the journal Addiction The results appear to be robust and we feel confident in suggesting that noninvasive brain stimulation is a technique of interest for both short term and sustained smoking cessation lead researcher Dr Benjamin Petit said in the press release Research is applicable to other conditions The study pointed out that in recent years a new non pharmacological method noninvasive brain stimulation NIBS has emerged as a new therapeutic option for several conditions including specific pain management weight reduction alcohol use disorder or depressive disorder The most common forms that are used are NIBS which are transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS and transcranial direct current stimulation TDCS The latter process includes giving low intensity direct electrical current through the subject s brain using a pair of saline soaked surface sponge electrodes which is placedbon through scalp that modulated neuronal excitability TMS makes use of a metallic coil that s placed against the patients scalp This could makes magnetic pulses through the patients cranium to induce brief electric currents in the cortical tissues The cortical neurons becomes depolarized and this depends on the frequency of the pulses the excitability of the targeted cortical area can increase or decrease There is a lot of interest in brain stimulation especially in addiction centers and mental health clinics Dr Manish Mishra the medical reviewer for Addiction Resource told Healthline The paper shows promising results despite the small sample size Sources
