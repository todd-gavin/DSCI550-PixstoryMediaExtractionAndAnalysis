In June 2021, I took part in my first pride month to support my friend who recently came out as gay. I went to my first pride march and saw support pouring for the LGBTQ+ community all over the US. The happiness of my friend was palpable. Moreover, in our town, everywhere we went: be it cafés, shopping complexes, even my hairdresser and small business, we saw a pride flag hanging in front of every business. The colours of the pride flag were all over town. I remember my friend saying to me how represented and validated he felt. 

But as soon as Pride Month got over, I got the biggest eye opener of my life. 

I finally understood that big corporations used the LGBTQ+ community as tokens to gain brownie woke points. For them it is not about the representation of showing support to the community, it’s all about tapping into this marginalised well and use the emotions of people to generate more revenue. 

Big corporations and even small businesses will come up with elaborate marketing campaigns showing support to the LGBTQ+ community but you take a hard look at them, you will realise that they on ground level, they couldn’t care less. You will see their employees from the community being treated unfairly and even sometimes, a bias in their hiring policy. 

We need to realise and call out this behaviour. The community is more than a marketing campaign and activists fighting for basic human rights are more than tokens. 

Not one homophobic person is going to see an ad for a cookie and realise that his perspective was wrong and suddenly accept his gay son. Rather, corporations, if they really want to help can consider making substantial donations to organisations doing actual work and not exploiting the community for their capitalist agenda.
