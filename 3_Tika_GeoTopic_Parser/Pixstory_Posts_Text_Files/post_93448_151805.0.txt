"Good friends look out for one another... Close friends understand each other, but TRUE FRIENDS endure...beyond words, distance, and time...!"Many of us have made friends over the years. We make friends as children and then lose touch as we get older. Other friends we make as adults and keep in touch with as long as we are in close proximity and it is convenient to keep in touch, but as time passes, one moves away or our busy schedules gradually pull us apart and we begin to lose touch. Those friendships are classified as "good friends" or "close friends," as stated in the opening quote. But then there's that last group of friends, those we refer to as true friends-  those we have a mutual caring for, and we understand each other's hearts, and where bonds are formed between us that span any distance in proximity, and where the bonds run so deep that no amount of time apart or lack of words can change how we feel about that friend. These are our true friends, and if one enters your life, treasure it! I will be eternally grateful for the true friends I have in my life.
