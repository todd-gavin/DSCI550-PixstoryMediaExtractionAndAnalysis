Many people choose food to help them deal with stressful situations. But relying on food could be helpful? Of course not; it could be acceptable when it is done for some time and not always.
Frequently stress eating can have negative impacts.
Unfortunately, emotional eating doesnâ€™t fix emotional problems. Instead, it usually makes you feel worse. Afterwards, the original emotional issue remains, and you also feel guilty for overeating.


After the emotional danger has passed, there is usually a sense of guilt and remorse after realising too much food has been eaten. But unfortunately, this guilt also can lead to more emotional eating outbursts or low self-esteem, resulting in a vicious circle.

Those who tend to eat when stressed or anxious are comforted by the feeling in their stomach that masks their emotions. Unfortunately, this often results in overeating, stomach pains, and nausea. The impact of emotional eating is quite severe, and you may feel these symptoms even days after eating a larger quantity of food during one short period.

Repetitive emotional eating can result in a whole host of weight-related health problems. Diabetes, high blood pressure, fatigue and high blood pressure are all examples of how your body pays for over-eating outbursts.
