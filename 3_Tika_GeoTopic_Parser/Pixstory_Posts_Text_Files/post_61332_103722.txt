Decoding Indian Babudom Data mis entry continues These documents are also required for getting benefits under the welfare schemes implemented by the government All these are important documents and help people in ease of living However there are instances of data entry errors in processing these identity cards It may sound a small or insignificant concern but has wide ramifications I have seen so many people applying online for correction or queuing up outside government offices to fix such data errors or mis entries What is frustrating is that in a majority of cases they were victims of data mis entry by those feeding the data It becomes highly inconvenient for people to revisit the formalities in order to fix the incorrect data in their identity cards At times somebody s name or address gets misspelt on Aadhaar or EPIC From incorrect mentioning of date of birth age gender to family details spouse mother and father as the case may be an individual faces any or all of these mostly due to error in data entry I myself have been a victim of data mis entry and can very well imagine the pain and agony one undergoes to get the corrections done In most cases all these errors happen at the entry level that is by the person feeding the data The carelessness in data entry is a national problem and it has spread its tentacles to the private sector as well wrong entry in health or insurance policy among others I would not say that it is done on purpose but it is a major reason affecting good governance initiatives It can also be held responsible for creating a negative perception about the country s governance system as almost everyone needs such documents with correct entries related to their personal details Why is it difficult to mention the name address family and required personal details correctly in the government database or on identity cards official documents issued by the authorities To be continued
