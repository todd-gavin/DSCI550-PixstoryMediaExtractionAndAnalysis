Lionel Messi left Barcelona to join PSG last summer. The transfer shocked a lot of people as no one expected the Argentine to leave his boyhood club. However, since the transfer, Barcelona president Joan Laporta has said multiple times that he hoped Messi would return one day. 

However, Lionel Messi and his father have now responded to the same. They have reportedly asked Joan Laporta to stop making such claims publicly as per the Daily Mail. 

Jorge Messi (Lionel's father) was fed up with Laporta that he rang the Barca president in March to politely ask him to refrain from making further references to Lionel Messi in interviews and to stop going back on the past. However, Joan Laporta has continued to use the Argentine's name in future interviews since then. 

This has reportedly angered both Lionel Messi and his father and the duo has reportedly made their feelings clear to Joan Laporta once again. It has to be seen if the Barca president listens to them this time around. 

The relationship between Barcelona and the Messi family strained after the club had to take back their contract last summer, hence signaling Messi's departure. Hence a return to the Camp Nou looks unlikely for Lionel Messi at least until the summer of 2023.
