Franco Di Santo (2008-2009)
The young Argentine wasn't ever skilled or experienced enough to break the curse, or the one-season time constraint, as he moved on loan for Blackburn in 2009–10 before heading to Wigan completely after that. He featured in 8 Premier League matches for Chelsea but did not score any goals.
Fernando Torres (2011-2014)
The Spanish striker moved from Liverpool to Chelsea in 2011 for £50 million, breaking the previous British transfer record. Fernando Torres was loaned out to AC Milan in the penultimate year of his deal after playing for the team up until 2015. He eventually transferred to Atletico Madrid, where he played for three seasons. In his last season of professional play, he represented Sagan Tosu in the J-League before retiring in 2019. 
Radamel Falcao (2015-2016)
On a season-long loan from AS Monaco, the Colombian attacker joined Chelsea in 2015. Radamel’s time in the League was not up to the mark as he only scored a single goal in his eleven appearances for the Blues. Falcao, who currently plays for Rayo Vallecano joined the Spanish team in 2021.
Alvaro Morata (2017-2018)
In 2017, Chelsea acquired the Spanish international on a five-year contract for a £70 million transfer fee. He was, however, loaned out to Atletico Madrid after one and a half years, and in January 2019 he made the permanent switch to the Spanish team for an estimated £58 million transfer price.
Alvaro Morata was assigned to Juventus on loan in 2020, and the Italian side extended his loan agreement for a further year in the summers of 2021.
