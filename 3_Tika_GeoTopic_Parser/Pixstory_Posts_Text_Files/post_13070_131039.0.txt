the decision of the Security Council; There is a possibility of extending the exemption of 6 senior Taliban officials from the travel ban
With the expiration of the exemption period for 13 senior Taliban officials from the travel ban, the members of the Security Council will decide on the extension of the exemption of some Taliban officials by the end of Monday.
The temporary exemption period for 13 high-ranking members of the Taliban ended on Friday, 28 Asad, and the members of the Security Council could not make a decision until that day due to differences.
 America has proposed a plan to the members of the council, based on which, only 6 high-ranking members of the Taliban will be exempted. Among these members, apparently, the name of Amir Khan Motaghi, the foreign minister of the Taliban, is also seen, who is in charge of leading the group's diplomatic efforts to expand the scope of interaction with the world and to recognize the Taliban government.
If other members do not oppose this plan, the travel ban exemption for 6 Taliban officials will probably be extended for another 3 months.
