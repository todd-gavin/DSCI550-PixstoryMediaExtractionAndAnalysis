The situation in Afghanistan is more serious than ever The return to power of the Taliban almost a year ago and the consequent political instability have seriously aggravated the condition of the country, already suffering from decades of wars, crises, climate change and drought. The United Nations has estimated that the of the Afghan population already lives below the poverty line and that two out of three children, or more than millions, are in desperate need of humanitarian aid. This is exactly why the field work of the OTB Foundation continues after having invested in the empowerment of women in the country and having actively helped the population in the emergency following the return of the Taliban to power the foundation of the OTB group has now chosen to help the most fragile Afghan children those who cannot even count on their own families Thanks to the now consolidated relationship with the NOVE Onlus association and in collaboration with the Ministry of Afghan Labor and Social Affairs MoLSA OTB Foundation has chosen to support the public orphanage of Kapisa an Afghan province northeast of Kabul closed by the Taliban and recently reopened The orphanage houses orphaned children or children whose parents are too poor and unable to provide their subsistence The project aims to provide them with a welcoming and safe place that also provides for their education the orphanage equipped with an internal school up to middle school saving these children from the streets from exploitation and probable abuse This project ensures them daily meals supplies of clothing materials basic hygiene goods as well as incentives for orphanage operators who are currently not paid by the State to guarantee assistance to the children hosted In fact these children enjoy better conditions in the orphanage than at home where they are often exploited or in any case hardly have access to education In the West, the current trend is to close large orphanages, making orphans welcome into families or small structures, but in a country in the conditions Afghanistan finds itself today, everything is very difficult. It is difficult to find funds even among the large organizations that are currently concentrating their forces elsewhere in Ukraine for example
