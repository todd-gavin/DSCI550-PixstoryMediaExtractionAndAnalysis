The Argentine legend made a remarkable move from Barcelona to Parc des Princes in 2021, but speculation about his future move is already circulating.

Lionel Messi startled the football world when he announced his departure from Barcelona in the summer of 2021, opting for an unexpected new challenge by signing as a free agent with Paris Saint-Germain.

The seven-time Ballon d'Or winner has only been at Parc des Princes for a few months, but speculation is already circulating about how long he will stay in France and where he might go next.

When does Lionel Messi's PSG contract end?
After welcome him through the doors at Parc des Princes, PSG signed a marquee signing to a two-year contract, which will ostensibly end in summer 2023.

However, under that contract, there is an option for a 12-month extension, meaning Messi could stay until the summer of 2024, when he will be 37 years old.

It remains to be seen whether he comes close to honouring the deal, given the numerous rumours circulating about a move abroad.

A retracement of steps has been speculated on since he exited Camp Nou through the exits.

Barca has made no secret of their desire to have Messi return in some capacity in the future, with Dani Alves indicating to Radio Catalunya that he may be reunited with a former teammate in a playing role.

"Messi is the best player in the history of football," the enigmatic Brazilian full-back has declared. It's strange not to see him here, not to have him on the squad.

"Sometimes things donâ€™t happen as we dream. I already told him that he is not going to be in any better place than here.

"He told me the same when I left. It would be very good if Messi finishes his career here. Finishing it here would be a great gift for him, and the club could take care of it."
