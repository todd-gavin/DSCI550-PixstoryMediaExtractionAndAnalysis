The Black Lives Matter Movement which has taken over the states (and world) over the last year is one that started online. The foundation of the same was laid with the murder of George Floyd in Minnesota in 2020. 

While the movement in taking shape on ground with protests, discussions on higher level and policy change, the efforts done online for the same have not diminished. 

During the pandemic when the digital world replaced the tangibility of the real world, various creators and influencers came up to create places for discussions and debates about the BLM Movement. 

While some say that they are only doing it for fame, it doesn’t matter what their intentions are because their content is reaching right people and making them aware of their surroundings. 

While some conversations barely scratch the surface but still it provided a bit of direction for those who want to do more. People with a limited view into the hardships and discrimination faced by black people on daily basis are doing their bit and at the end of the day, it’s the impact that matters. 

Pandemic has surely affected the ground reality of the movement and now as everything is returning to normal slowly but surely, we will see if the movement will be reduced to a hashtag on social media.
