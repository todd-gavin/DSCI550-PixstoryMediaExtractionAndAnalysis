Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced his visit to India, to discuss the country's ongoing economic crisis. 
Wickremesinghe addressed the Parliament saying that, “We are continuing our talks with India. During my brief meeting with Prime Minister Modi in Japan, I conveyed my wish to visit New Delhi to brief them on our situation. Mr. Modi has always extended his support to us. I have always appreciated India’s assistance in our crisis. India will continue to extend their support in our rebuilding effort.” 
Since January, India has been a determinant provider of financial assistance of worth $4 billion to Sri Lanka, when the later nation declared itself bankrupt with shortage of food, medicine and other essential items. 
Apart from India, Sri Lanka has other bilateral creditors where China stands first with 52% debt, Japan with 19% debt and India stands third with 12% debt. 
And after signing an agreement with creditor nations Sri Lanka will be able to  bridge finance with lenders like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank of around $1 billion. 
However, the Asian Development Bank has already agreed to provide a loan of $500  to the island nation.
