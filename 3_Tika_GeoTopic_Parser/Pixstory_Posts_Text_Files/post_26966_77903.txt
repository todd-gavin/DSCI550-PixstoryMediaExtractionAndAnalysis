The Roman couturier has designed two new tuts for the international Gala Les toiles on stage on Sunday and Monday January at the Auditorium Parco della Musica in Rome A few years ago while I was tidying up my archive of drawings for the Foundation I came across an old yellowed envelope whose content took me back in time to when I was a year-old student of the Academy of Fine Arts said the couturier The envelope contained sketches of my costumes for a musical magazine that was to be held in Buenos Aires I still remember with what passion and how much anticipation I dedicated myself to create those costumes Too bad that, as often happens, that project didn&#39;t go through The events of my professional life took the turn we all know but if things had gone differently today maybe I would live in Argentina and I wouldn&#39;t be a fashion creator but a costume designer
