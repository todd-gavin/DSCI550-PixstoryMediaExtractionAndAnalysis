On Sunday, Boraâ€“Hansgrohe rider Jai Hindley won the Giro d'Italia for the first time after completing the last stage, a 17.1-kilometer time trial through Verona, safely ahead of Ecuadorian contender Richard Carapaz. 

TOI reported that Hindley gained a commanding lead over Carapaz in the general classification after a strong finish on Saturday's penultimate mountainous Giro stage, meaning he only needed to avoid disaster in Verona to win his first Grand Tour title, which he achieved with ease. 

Hindley had reason to be cautious heading into the season finale on Sunday. In the Milan time trial in 2020, the Australian lost a Giro championship that he had in his hands against Tao Geoghegan Hart, with the Briton pulling back 39 seconds in the last 15.7-kilometer stage.

However, this time Hindley's efforts in the final kilometres on Saturday left Carapaz for dead, after he had gone into the 20th stage behind the Ecuadorian in the general classification, and he held a significant one minute and 25 second overall advantage ahead of the time trial.

Carapaz, who had looked set to add to his 2019 title with another Giro title before Hindley's Saturday turnaround, went all out to spring a surprise, and was faster in Verona, finishing 10th on the day, but it wasn't enough, as Hindley cruised to the finish line, receiving a standing ovation from the crowd.
