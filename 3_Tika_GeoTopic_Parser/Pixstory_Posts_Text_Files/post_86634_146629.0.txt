For the first time in history, the FIFA Football World Cup is taking place in the Middle East.
Thirty-two teams from around the world will compete in one of the biggest sporting events in the world from November 20 to December 18.
Qatar is the smallest nation to host the World Cup. The country of some three million people will welcome 1.5 million international visitors.
If you fly into Qatar, you will land in the capital, Doha, at one of two airports.
The country’s main airport, Hamad International Airport (HIA) 📍 is expected to process up to 10,000 passengers per hour during the 29-day-long tournament.
Doha International Airport 📍 is Qatar’s second airport, and 13 airlines will be operating out of it. Both are less than a half-hour’s drive from Doha’s city centre.
Staff at the airports offer service mainly in English but a wide range of languages is also spoken, including Arabic, Hindi, Tagalog, and Urdu.
Qatar is a small country, with a total area of 11,636sq km (4,493sq miles). It takes about an hour to cross the country east to west and about two hours north to south.
More than 80 percent of the country’s residents live in and around Doha, along the country’s east coast.
Options for getting around include public transport like the metro, tram and bus network; rental cars; Karwa taxis; or ride-hailing apps like Uber and Careem.
Football fans with digital Hayya cards travel for free on public transport between November 11 and December 23.
Qatar has a lot of markets, and Doha’s Souq Waqif 📍 is by far the most famous.
Enjoy getting a little bit lost in the winding alleys and streets as you browse clothes, crafts, spices, jewellery and more.
The Souq also has a great dining scene, with restaurants and street food vendors offering a taste of Middle Eastern cuisine - including Qatari, Egyptian, Iranian, Moroccan, Syrian, Turkish, and more.
You can also catch a street performance, browse through art galleries, or head on over to try holding a falcon - the national bird of Qatar - in the adjacent Falcon Souq.
