The Committee to Protect Journalists on Friday called on Taliban officials to release Khalid Qaderi, an Afghan journalist, immediately and unconditionally.
The committee called for the dismissal of all charges against Mr. Qaderi and called on the Taliban to refrain from arresting and imprisoning members of the press.

A Taliban court in the city of Herat in mid-April sentenced local radio presenter Khaled Ghaderi to one year in prison for propaganda against the group's government.

A local journalist, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Committee to Protect Journalists that Mr Qaderi did not have access to a lawyer and that Taliban officials forced him to sign a document on which he would not have the right to appeal.

"Taliban officials must release Khalid Qaderi immediately and unconditionally and ensure that members of the press are not imprisoned for their work," said Steven Butler, co-ordinator of the Committee to Protect Journalists' Asia.

 "The conviction of a journalist on trumped-up charges using flawed judicial processes marks a new stage in the Taliban's crackdown on Afghanistan's independent media."

Khalid Qaderi is the first journalist to be sentenced to one year in prison by the group's military court after the Taliban came to power.

He was arrested on March 17 by Taliban intelligence in Herat.

A local journalist told the Committee to Protect Journalists that the Qaderi had beaten Mr. Qaderi during his detention.
