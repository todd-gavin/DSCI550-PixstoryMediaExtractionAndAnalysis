In a survey by Pewresearch org despite the voiced opinion against abortion many Americans favour certain regulations on access to abortions For example seven in ten said that doctors should be required to inform a parent or legal guardian of minors seeking abortions And most of those who say abortion should be legal in some cases and illegal in others say that ch stage a pregnant woman is in should be a factor in determining whether abortion is legal or illegal of U S adults say abortion should be against the law in all cases with no exceptions this means that nearly two thirds of the public thinks abortion either should be entirely illegal at every stage of pregnancy or should become illegal When asked about the legitimacy of abortion at weeks of pregnancy which is described as a point when a healthy fetus could survive outside the woman s body with medical attention Americans are about twice as likely to say abortion should be illegal as to say it should be legal at this time point vs with saying it depends However in a follow up question of those who initially said abortion should be illegal at this late stage go on to say that in cases where the woman s life is threatened or the baby will be born with severe disabilities abortion should be legal at weeks An additional answered the follow up question by saying it depends and reiterate that abortion should be illegal at this stage of pregnancy even if the woman s life is in threat or the baby faces severe disabilities Are these remarks the concerns or double standards Americans have about Abortion We need to think of some way both parties get satisfied After all everything isn t black and white there are aspects in between too or does it count when it is about the privacy or right one has on one s own body Comment your opinion on notes
