THE MODERN MYTH 
The worldâ€™s combat against environmental destruction has been blithely reduced to an incessant blame game. On the side-lines, we are running into the jaws of global warming and a global water shortage. On the front, we are blaming each other, first as individuals, then as communities, then as nations. 
The hefty promises by world leaders are only hollow and apathetically near sighted. And the modern myth that capitalism and nature are perfect opposites stands unabashedly.  The nature that could sustain generation upon generation of human beings certainly cannot fall short of resources in three decades. 
The root of the issue lurks in our greed. Our needs were always satisfied and will continue to be satisfied. We are wired to seek more and more, no doubt. But if we as a community step forward to strike a balance, then there is light certainly at the end of the tunnel.
