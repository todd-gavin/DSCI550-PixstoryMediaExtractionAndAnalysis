During the match between the two teams on Sunday, video of Sevilla player Ivan Rakitic
expressing his admiration for Barcelona's fans has gone viral.

Rakitic and the rest of Julen Lopetegui's high-flying squad travelled to the Camp Nou late last
night for a crucial confrontation in La Liga's bid for Champions League football.

 Despite the fact
that the visitors were ultimately defeated, Rakitic managed to put his frustrations aside in order
to show his gratitude to the Barcelona supporters. Of course, this follows the Croatian
international's six-year trophy-laden stay in the Catalan capital from 2014 to 2020.

After being hailed by two members of the Blaugrana's fanbase at the pitchside hoardings
following the match, Rakitic handed over both his match-worn jersey and shorts in a gracious
gesture:

The Croatian midfielder was a favourite among Barcelona fans during his time at the club.
Barcelona beat Sevilla 1-0 with Pedri scoring a spectacular goal.

As previously said, while bringing attention back to the outcome of Sunday's events at the Camp
Nou, Rakitic was obliged to accept a hard-fought defeat at the hands of his old club.

 This was
thanks to a solitary goal scored by Barcelona on their way to a sixth consecutive La Liga victory.

The evening's defining moment came just inside the last twenty minutes of play, when Pedri's
individual brilliance saw the midfield prodigy waltz past a pair of Sevilla players before slamming
the ball into the far corner of Bono's net:
