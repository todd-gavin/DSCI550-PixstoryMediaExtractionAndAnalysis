Manchester United has started to shine under the new manager Erik ten Hag after the initial hiccup in the English Premier League and the UEFA Europa League. The club which was touted as a contender for the Premier League title in 2021/22 broke down by the end of seven game weeks. The former manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked from the job and RalfRangnick was appointed. Ralf Rangnick was appointed as the interim manager and a future director of football. However, it did not go well as Manchester United failed to finish in the top five let alone the top six. Due to the poor form of West Ham United on the last day of the Premier League 2021/22, Manchester United is in the Europa League.
The team looked weak in every part of the pitch at the start of the transfer window. However, the club hierarchy was able to pull off a few deals to sign players across all fronts to back the manager. At the moment, Manchester United is in the top half of the points table with a game in hand. Ahead of the grueling 2022/23 Premier League season, here is our Manchester UnitedSWOT Analysis.
Strengths
One of the key strengths of Manchester United is their defense and midfield. The defense has hit the consistency and the addition of Lisandro Martinez has proved to be fruitful till the moment. Also, the arrival of Christian Eriksen and Casemiro has strengthened ManchesterUnited’s midfield which was thin following the departure of Paul Pogba, Juan Mata, and Nemanja Matic. Antony’s arrival has also added flair to the Red Devils’ attack.
Weakness
The weakness of the Manchester United squad lies in their attack. The departure of Edinson Cavani and suspension of Mason Greenwood are not yet filled by the club. Though the club has Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, and Antony along with Ronaldo, players are prone to injury. The lack of depth in attack can wreak havoc for the club in the ongoing season.
