Double Olympic medallist PV Sindhu finally won her first singles gold medal at the Commonwealth Games after a 21-15, 21-13 win over Canada's Michelle Li. Sindhu has now completed the set, having won bronze in 2014, which was incidentally the year Li won her gold medal, silver in 2018 and now gold in Birmingham. Sindhu had strapping on her ankle and it seemed to hinder her movements early in the match. However she seemed to have gotten over it and was relentlessly darting around the court in the second game.Â
