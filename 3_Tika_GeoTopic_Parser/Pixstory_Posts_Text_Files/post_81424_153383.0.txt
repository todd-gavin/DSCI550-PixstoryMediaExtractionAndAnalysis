Ahead of one of this season's biggest tests against Liverpool, Mikel Arteta spoke to the press about our opponents, our start to the season, and the positive transformation of the club over the past couple of years.Here is everything he had to say:𝐨𝐧 𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐦𝐮𝐜𝐡 𝐡𝐞'𝐬 𝐥𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐠𝐚𝐦𝐞...Again, it's another really exciting game to play against one of the toughest opponents in this league. It's going to be a really demanding match and it's gonna require us to be at our best again,𝐨𝐧 𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐢𝐭'𝐬 𝐚𝐧 𝐨𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐭𝐨 𝐦𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐚 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐠𝐮𝐞...Every game is the same. Obviously, it's a big match. It's a fixture that everybody's looking for, against an opponent that has shown in the last five or six years the level that they have. And we have to show those opponents again that we have reached the level and we are ready to compete against them.𝐨𝐧 𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐦'𝐬 𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐡𝐚𝐬 𝐞𝐯𝐨𝐥𝐯𝐞𝐝 𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐭 𝐲𝐞𝐚𝐫...I'm very conscious that we can get much better than where we are today. And not only that: we have to do better to be a team that wants to win and the challenge now is to do that every three days.𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐦 𝐧𝐞𝐰𝐬...We will have more news tomorrow. We have another training session and we will know more tomorrow.𝐨𝐧 𝐟𝐞𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐞𝐱𝐭𝐫𝐚 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐫𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐝𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐭𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐬𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐝𝐮𝐥𝐞...Well, we know that the fixtures that we've been given have no precedence in this league because of the World Cup and with everything that we have to play in between. And then every team is different, every squad is different. And if you start to risk, you make the situation much worse. If everybody's available and you have robot players that can play every three days, life is much easier! So it's something that we have to experience, and test because at the moment, we don't really know how it's going to play out.
