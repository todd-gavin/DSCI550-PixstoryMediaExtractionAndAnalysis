According to Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, the government is currently more concerned with calling a referendum on the political rights of Indigenous people than with moves to establish a republic. DW reported that a pillar of Albanese administration policy, The Voice to Parliament is a referendum that grants Indigenous people the right to be consulted by MPs on issues that affect them. One debate at a time, says Albanese"The idea that you would have multiple debates at once I think is not feasible," Albanese told ABC Radio Sydney on Thursday."I want Australians to concentrate on the Voice to Parliament," he said when answering a question about the future of Australia under a monarchy.He emphasised once more that keeping the monarch in place as head of state was currently the top concern. "We should be proud of the fact that we share this continent with the oldest continuous culture on earth, at least 65,000 years. That should be something that needs to be fixed before other matters are debated."Although, the center-left Labor Party leader's party wants an Australian president to replace the British monarch as head of state, he had recently skirted the issue saying that now is the time to pay tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth II, and not to pursue "questions about our constitution."For the Queen's funeral on September 19, Albanese will depart for London on Thursday afternoon with 10 "ordinary individuals" who have made a difference in their communities.
