Perched about feet meters up the slopes of the Prealps in southern France a humble rock shelter looks out over the Rh ne River Valley It s a strategic point on the landscape as here the Rh ne flows through a narrows between two mountain ranges For millennia inhabitants of the rock shelter would have had commanding views of herds of animals migrating between the Mediterranean region and the plains of northern Europe today replaced by TGV trains and up to vehicles per day on one of the busiest highways on the continent The site recognized in the s and named Grotte Mandrin after French folk hero Louis Mandrin has been a valued location for over years The stone artifacts and animal bones left behind by ancient hunter gatherers from the Paleolithic period were quickly covered by the glacial dust that blew from the north on the famous mistral winds keeping the remains well preserved Since our research team has been carefully investigating the uppermost feet meters of sediment on the cave floor Based on artifacts and tooth fossils we believe that Mandrin rewrites the consensus story about when modern humans first made their way to Europe Human origins researchers have generally agreed that between and years ago Neanderthals and their ancestors occupied Europe From time to time during that period they had contact with modern humans in the Levant and parts of Asia Then around to years ago modern humans essentially us expanded throughout the rest of the world and Neanderthals and all other archaic humans disappeared In the journal Science Advances we describe our discovery of evidence that modern humans lived years ago at Mandrin That s some millennia earlier than our species was previously thought to be in Europe and over a thousand miles west kilometers from the next oldest known site in Bulgaria And fascinatingly Neanderthals appear to have used the cave both before and after the modern human occupation Full story at The Conversation Image Credits
