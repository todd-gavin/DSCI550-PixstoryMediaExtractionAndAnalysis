Draft opinions circulated among Supreme Court justices are meant to allow for deliberation and editing before a final version is released They are not the last word nor ready for public reaction But on the evening of May Politico published a bombshell a leaked draft of an opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito that overturns Roe v Wade and Planned Parenthood v Casey the two rulings that gave constitutional protection to the abortion right While the final text of the opinion in the case of Dobbs v Jackson may be somewhat different the meaning of the current draft is clear First the powers of individual states to determine whether abortions are legally available are increasing Second the Supreme Court s barriers for overruling a precedent are decreasing State by state voting Under American constitutional democracy many decisions are made by majority rule accomplished through elections This applies to routine regulations like drug laws or speed limits But other decisions are beyond the reach of majorities and protected by individual rights guaranteed under the Constitution Under Roe v Wade the abortion decision fell into the category of rights But the leaked draft opinion moves abortion from being a constitutionally guaranteed right to an act whose legality is determined by state laws That means it falls under majority rule determined by the citizens of each state through their elected state legislators Alito is saying that when the Constitution does not recognize a clear right the people must elect representatives that share their view rather than appeal to courts The Alito draft repeats its core holding several times The right recognized in Roe v Wade has no basis in the Constitution s text or in our Nation s history The court that decided Roe Alito writes usurped the power to address a question of profound moral and social importance that the Constitution unequivocally leaves to the people Therefore it is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people s elected representatives Read more
