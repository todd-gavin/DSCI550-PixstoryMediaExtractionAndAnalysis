I think it is completely true because I  have this penchant for horror movies, and I don't miss any of them; I definitely see the good ones.
And honestly, it does a lot in calming you and helping you with anxiety.
When you allow yourself to get triggered in a safe environment, it actually acts as therapy, and that's how horror movies work.
Our body and mind hint at danger, but the thought that we are shielded really helps.
It can actually teach us to deal with real-world stress. According to a founder of psychotherapy, we intentionally expose ourselves to anxiety-producing stimuli during a stressful film. We usually don’t engage in the same unhealthy coping mechanisms that we utilize in real life. We learn how to manage stress at the moment. This practice can translate to helping us manage everyday stressors and fears.
This is how catharsis also works, and we keep ourselves at ease.
