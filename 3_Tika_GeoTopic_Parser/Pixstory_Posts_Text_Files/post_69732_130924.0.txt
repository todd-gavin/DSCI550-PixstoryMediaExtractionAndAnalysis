1. [+144] 150,000 won... that's the price of a VIP seat at any other concert...;;;

2. [+142] I guess SM's prices are nothing compared to this..

3. [+29] 150,000 won was already too expensive. Why is it the richest who are always the greediest... why copy Hybe's pricing..

4. [+25] What is up with these prices... I'm scared that the other concerts are going to start raising theirs too now

5. [+13] That's a shameless price

6. [+4] It's still cheaper in Korea compared to foreign countries.. those same seats would go for 700,000 won here ðŸ¥²

7. [+1] These prices... this is worse than SM

8. [+110] There needs to be a cap on idol concert tickets. These companies get so blinded by the way they see fans to take for fools and see no limit to their greed.

9. [+11] The fact that it's being held at the olympic gymnastics arena means the price was easily predicted
10. [+2] So do they only want adults to attend or what?

11. [+9] That's damn expensive ã…‹ã…‹

12. [+13] Crazy with greed...
