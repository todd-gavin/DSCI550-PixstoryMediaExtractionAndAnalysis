No bowler won India more Test matches than Anil Kumble, and there probably hasn't been a harder trier either. Like the great tall wristspinners Bill O'Reilly and his own idol Bhagwath Chandrasekhar, Kumble traded the legspinner's proverbial yo-yo for a spear: the ball hacked through the air rather than hanging in it, and came off the pitch with a kick rather than a kink. The method provided him stunning success, particularly on Indian soil, where his deliveries burst like packets of water upon the feeblest hint of a crack.
In a brilliant though often downplayed career, Kumble claimed virtually every Indian record. In 1999 in Delhi he swallowed all ten wickets in an innings against Pakistan. In December 2001, on home turf in Bangalore, he became India's first spinner to take 300 Test wickets. A year later, almost to the day, he became the first to do so in one-dayers. In August 2007 at The Oval he went past Glenn McGrath's 563 wickets and chalked up what, judging by the pure ecstasy of his reaction and the dressing room's, was perhaps his most cherished feat of all - a Test century that had been 17 years and 118 matches in the coming. In January 2008 he broke the 600-wicket barrier.
Less than a month after his 37th birthday, he was named India's Test captain for the 2007-08 home series against Pakistan. He went on to win the series, the first home triumph against Pakistan in 27 years
His form slipped thereafter and there were calls for him to quit following a wicketless performance in the Bangalore Test against Australia in October 2008.  During the Delhi Test and announced his retirement, fittingly at his favourite venue. He finished his career as the third-highest Test wicket-taker (619)
