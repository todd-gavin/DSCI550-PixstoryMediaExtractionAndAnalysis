Fashion&#39;s Cyrano de Bergerac the ideal son between Phoebe Philo and Raf Simons has finally decided that the spotlight could turn on him Over the years whenever a designer left his post as creative director Matthieu Blazy was always at the top of the list of the totonome but always remained in the shadows until last November The fashion world was shocked when Daniel Lee left the real motivations are buried in a blanket of fog after only years Bottega Veneta but when Blazy&#39;s name was mentioned a sigh of collective relief Yesterday February the new Bottega Veneta debuted and there are many things to say about it After the fashion shows in Berlin and Detroit after seeing the fir green boxes in the tik toks of the coolest kids Bottega Veneta back home Home means first true but home also means subtlety it means understated luxury and intriguing simplicity The opening look of the last rows may have seemed trivial to the point of disrespectful given the scope of the event but what many do not know is that white tank top and those jeans are made of leather All the skirts were leather as well as the suits and the crinoline stuffing the flared skirts and anything that remotely looked like cotton well it wasn&#39;t The skirts the boots and the moccasins the flats the clogs and the purses were leather woven motif that has been synonymous with the Bottega Veneta name for years There have been no revolutionary clothes that trigger the immediate need to wear them or streetwear sneakers and sweatshirts Bottega seems to have gone beyond the fashions and market demands Bottega is back home
