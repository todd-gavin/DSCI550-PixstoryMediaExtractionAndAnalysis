It's official: Five of That '70s Show's six original youthful stars have signed deals to return for the Netflix sequel, That '90s Show. 

Hollywood Reporter said that following months of talks, Topher Grace (Eric Forman), Mila Kunis (Jackie Burkhart), Ashton Kutcher (Michael Kelso), Laura Prepon (Donna Pinciotti), and Wilmer Valderrama (Fez) will all make cameo cameos in the sequel series. Danny Masterson (Hyde), who has been charged with three counts of rape, will not be present. The star has vehemently refuted the allegations. 

In October, That '90s Show was renewed for a second season. The comedy is set in 1995 and follows Leia Forman, Eric and Donna's daughter, as she visits her grandparents and forms friendships with a new generation of Point Place kids.

Original â€™70s Show stars Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp reprise their roles as Red and Kitty, respectively, and exec produce.
