If Amanda could travel back in time, she’d encourage herself to relieve the pressures of being a perfectionist: “When I was younger, I really wanted to do the best-best-best of me, all the time,” she says.

The defender would also embrace making mistakes, and become comfortable with the risk of trying something she wasn’t necessarily the best at: “Relax in that, and know that you will develop doing that,” Amanda would tell her younger self.

Though the defender loves training on the field as hard as she possibly can, she’s found a balance in compartmentalizing her game by finding value in making time for herself through hiking, studying, and spending time in the forest.

“I always get a lot of energy going outside in nature,” she says. 

Amanda’s family has been one of her biggest sources of encouragement — the defender’s parents, two brothers and grandparents never miss watching a game, creating a comfort in consistency. 

“Knowing that they are there and supporting me no matter how it goes in the game. I’m not only a football player in their world – I’m their daughter or sister or girlfriend. So for me, that's really really nice to have around,” Amanda says. 

Ten years into the future, Amanda hopes to start a family of her own — where that is in the world, is still for the player to find out.
