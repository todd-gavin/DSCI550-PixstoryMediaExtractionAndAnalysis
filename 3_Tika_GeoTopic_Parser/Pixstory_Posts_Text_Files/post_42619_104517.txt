Today the whole world is celebrating World Bicycle Day and spreading the message to use bicycles as much as possible which will lead to a healthier lifestyle In April the United Nations General Assembly declared June as International Bicycle Day So today I am telling you the story about when and how I got my first bicycle and what impact that bicycle leave on my life On rd August I came back from my school and I found my dad in the house who usually was at his office at that time and my mom was present at home as usual After that I went to the washroom to get freshen up but when I came back to the drawing room my dad told me to bring a copy of the particular subject which I don t remember now from the cupboard in my room I went to my room thinking about why my dad is behaving so weird today and also I was thinking that what I had done today so that Dad had to come home from the office in the afternoon That walk from the drawing room to my bedroom was so tough but as soon as I entered my room and open the light the room I got a shock and I shouted Wow because dad brought me my first bicycle of my life and when I came back to the drawing room to hug my parents they started singing Happy Birthday song to me because rd August is my birthdate too From sitting behind dad on his scooter or motorbike to riding a bicycle all alone is a life changing moment for me as well as all the children out there because from this moment onwards you think you are grown up and a sense of independence comes into your mind So this was my first bicycle story and if you have interesting stories like these then please note them down and feel free to tell them
