I feel like when you take a bath in a pond you are completely connected with the world The pond is connected with the ground EARTH Soil unlike your Swimming pool with tiles Dharti ki god mein The pond has a lot of SPACE unlike your tiny little bathroom Jagah hi jagah hai The pond is made up of WATER obviously but it is in the natural process unlike the motor pumps Jal prachal The pond is kissed by SUN unlike your dryer in the bathroom Sunheri lehro k bane The pond reflects the beautiful SKY unlike the mirror in your bathroom Ashman k niche The pond is surrounded by trees which gives you fresh AIR unlike suffocation in your tiny room Tazi ehsaash k saath That s all elements made up SPACE AIR WATER SUN EARTH Thnks Stay Khush
