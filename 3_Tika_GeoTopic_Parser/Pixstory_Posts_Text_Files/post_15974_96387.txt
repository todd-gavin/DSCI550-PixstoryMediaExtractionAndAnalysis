Prof Amalia Gastaldelli PhD ngel Rodr guez MD Summary Background Tirzepatide is a novel dual glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide GIP and glucagon like peptide receptor agonist under development for the treatment of type diabetes The aim of this substudy was to characterise the changes in liver fat content LFC volume of visceral adipose tissue VAT and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue ASAT in response to tirzepatide or insulin degludec in a subpopulation of the SURPASS study Methods This substudy of the randomised open label parallel group phase SURPASS trial was done at medical research centres and hospitals across eight countries Argentina Austria Greece Hungary Italy Romania Spain and the USA Eligible participants were adults with type diabetes a baseline HbA c mmol mol a BMI of at least kg m stable weight were insulin naive and on treatment with metformin alone or in combination with a SGLT inhibitor for at least months before screening In addition to the main study inclusion criteria substudy participants had a fatty liver index of at least Participants had an MRI scan and were randomised in the main study to subcutaneous injection once per week of tirzepatide mg mg or mg or subcutaneous injection once per day of titrated insulin degludec using an interactive web response system and were stratified by country HbA c and concomitant oral anti hyperglycaemic medication The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in LFC as measured by MRI proton density fat fraction MRI PDFF at week using pooled data from the tirzepatide mg and mg groups versus insulin degludec Analyses were assessed in the enrolled MRI population which consisted of participants in the modified intention to treat population of the main study who also had a valid MRI at either baseline or after baseline This is a substudy of the trial registered with ClinicalTrials gov number NCT and is complete Interpretation Tirzepatide showed a significant reduction in LFC and VAT and ASAT volumes compared with insulin degludec in this subpopulation of patients with type diabetes in the SURPASS study These data provide additional evidence on the metabolic effects of this novel dual GIP and GLP receptor agonist Sources
