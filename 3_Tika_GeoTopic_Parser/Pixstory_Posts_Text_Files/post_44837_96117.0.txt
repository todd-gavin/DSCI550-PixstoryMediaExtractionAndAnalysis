Shaun Wright-Phillips

Wright-Phillips, who played for City in the second tier and the Premier League across two 
seasons, may have seen the club's metamorphosis better than anyone.

“The realisation kicked in for a lot of people the day after I went back as there was talk about 
Robinho signing,” he told The Sun in 2019.

“Within 24 to 36 hours later I was training with him. You think, ‘The owners are serious about 
this, they really want to do it.'”

Although the former England international retired from professional football in 2017, his son D'Margio is now a City player.

Carlos Tevez

Tevez, who is already in his third season with Boca Juniors, led the team in scoring in the 
Primera Division in 2019-20 and has signed a new deal despite being 36 years old. He'll call it 
quits when they no longer want him. 

“Other times, I missed the club when I left, but this time it won’t be the same,” he told Canal 13.

“I won’t go to another team and I’ll retire with this jersey."

“I don’t want to retire and then become a coach or director. I must prepare for such a role first.”
