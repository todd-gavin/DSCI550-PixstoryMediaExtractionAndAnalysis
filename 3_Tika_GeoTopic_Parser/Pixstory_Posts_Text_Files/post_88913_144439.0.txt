The Environment ministry cleared the decks for the controversial 16,610 hectares of developmental projects on the Great Nicobar island. 
The projects will address several pressing concerns related to maritime security, economic growth, and quality of life for the local population. 
According to the Niti Ayog's report, the project is expected to cost  ₹ 75,000 crore which includes the construction of the Greenfield international airport, an International container terminal, a Thermal power plant and a township- which is expected to accommodate upto 6.5 lakh people on the island.
Currently the island is a home to approximately 8500 people, most of them are from indigenous Shompen tribe. 
The great Nicobar island represents a significant economic development opportunity as the main east-west shipping route that links east asian exports with the Indian ocean, Suez canal and Europe runs just to the south of this island. "By building container port in this location, India can participate fully in the global shipping trade" and generate lakhs of new jobs, the report said. 
Adding to this the airport proposed at Gandhi nagar-shastri nagar area would be a joint military-civil, dual-use airport, under the operational control of Indian Navy.
Whereas the proposed township and power stations will complement and supplement the economic activity and tourism development. 
However, it has been mandated that the project will lead to irreparable environmental damages involving the cutting of over 8.5 lakh trees, loss of 12-20 hectares of mangrove cover, claiming of 298 hectares of sea bed, coral translocation and destruction of 30 of the 51 active nests of the Nicobar megapod.
Specific conversation and management plans would be set up for the protection of the same.
