The Manchester United star lost a huge amount of money because of the former US president But what exactly is it about According to the New York Post it all starts in Cristiano Ronaldo was still at Real Madrid while Donald Trump was still an entrepreneur who had recently run for the White House During that year the Portuguese bought an apartment in the Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue for millions of euros In for Trump he won the elections and was elected President of the United States This last event together with some attitudes of Trump himself have unleashed a lot of pressure on CR to get rid of the investment linked to such a controversial character Already in Ronaldo he had put the apartment up for sale for about millions of dollars which at the exchange rate is less than half the initial price The arrival of the pandemic has then brought the entire real estate sector to its knees, causing the market to drop even more. The Portuguese thus found a buyer willing to pay out only millions of dollars, around million euros at the exchange rate, thus recording a loss of well millions in total for CR Credits profile photo twitter Manchester United
