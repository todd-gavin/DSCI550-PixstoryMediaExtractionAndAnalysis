"Dancing Lessons," a deliciously surprising romantic comedy appearing live March 11-20 at the Public Theatre, 31 Maple St. in Lewiston, or on video on demand March 15-20, kicks off the second half of the season. Thursday through Saturday at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., and Saturday at 3 p.m., the curtain will be raised. 

The play, which is a mix of humour and drama, follows the storey of a science professor and a professional dancer who live alone in a New York apartment building two floors apart. Senga is cooped up in her apartment with a terrible leg injury that puts her profession and identity in jeopardy when Ever, a socially awkward geoscientist, unexpectedly knocks on her door in dire need of a dancing lesson. 

These two mismatched souls engage in a series of amusing and sad dancing lessons that swiftly lead both of them out of their comfort zones after he offers her a ridiculous amount of money to teach him certain dances so he can avoid embarrassing himself at an awards night. 

According to a press release from the theatre, "'Dancing Lessons' is the right piece for this period of time," says director Janet Mitchko, "and a beautiful antidote to the feeling of isolation that so many people have experienced throughout COVID." It's about two people who have lived incredibly secluded lives and discover how to interact with each other in unexpected and enjoyable ways.
