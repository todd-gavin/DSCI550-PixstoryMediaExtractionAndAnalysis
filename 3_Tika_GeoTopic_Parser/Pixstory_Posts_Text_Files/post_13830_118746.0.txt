In 2022,  when elite football nations are gearing up for the battle royal in the Qatar World Cup and the less  fortunate ones are waiting with bated breath to watch some quality encounters, Indian football are struggling to avoid a ban that could be imposed by FIFA unless a democratically elected body takes charge of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) by the middle of September. Currently, the AIFF is run by the Supreme Court appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) after Praful Patel was removed as the president by the Apex Court.
Thankfully, the threat of ban seems to have been eased a bit after the Supreme Court last week agreed to finalise the draft constitution of the AIFF, which has been framed by the CoA. It happened after a senior officer of the Government of India stepped in to inform the court that the elections are necessary to avoid elections. A bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud noted that CoA had submitted the draft on July 15 and 250 comments have been received by CoA. A counsel representing some state associations contended before the bench that the administrator cannot go beyond the National Sports Code, and added.
The bench, also comprising justices Surya Kant and AS Bopanna, asked the parties involved in the matter to identify key issues to be addressed by the court. A joint secretary of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports also urged the bench to consider the objections to the new draft constitution expeditiously, in view of FIFA’s deadline and the importance of hosting U-17 Women’s World Cup in India, as well as India’s participation in the Asian Cup. After hearing arguments, the top court scheduled the matter for further hearing on July 28.
A delegation of FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has already set the Committee of Administrators (CoA) a deadline of July 31 to amend the statutes of the Constitution and conclude the elections by September 15, 2022.
