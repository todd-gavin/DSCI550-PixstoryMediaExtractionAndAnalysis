According to the reports instead of Jacqueline Fernandez actor Sonal Chauhan will be playing the lead opposite Nagarjuna in The Ghost. It is said that Jacqueline walked out due to the money laundering case controversy. 

"Makers felt Sonal Chauhan was the best fit for the lead role opposite Nagarjuna in The Ghost. They felt both the actors Sonal and Nagarjuna would make for a fine on screen pair and that's when they approached her. The two are definitely going to portray some great chemistry in the film‚Äù said a source.
