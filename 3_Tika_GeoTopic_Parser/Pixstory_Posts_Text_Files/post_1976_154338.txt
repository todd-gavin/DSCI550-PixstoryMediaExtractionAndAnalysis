United States Congressional representative for Colorado s third district Lauren Boebert was mocked by liberals on Twitter following her tweeting the following Two Words Let s Go Brandon These tweet was an obvious reference to Joe Biden s gaffe when he in a speech stated Let me start off with two words Made in America Unsurprisingly liberals are so unable to understand a joke that they instead resorted to mocking her The obvious irony in all of this is that them mocking her means that they inadvertently mocked Joe Biden After all if far left liberal gun activist David Hogg thinks that she is an idiot or if Democratic Coalition Against Trump chair Jon Cooper believes that she is such a friggin moron then obviously they must think the same of Joe Biden if he couldn t figure out the difference between two and three words right
