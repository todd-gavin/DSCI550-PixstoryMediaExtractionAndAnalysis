The film starts with the quote “I did what I could, I don’t think I did so badly” by Diego Maradona and I think director Paolo Sorrentino was talking about himself and the film he made.
This movie is based in the 1980s when people of Napoli are more worried about the transfer of Maradona than anything else. This movie is not just a story, it’s a journey of Fabietto (played by Filippo Scotti). The Hand Of God is not a perfect movie because every character got a problem of its own and Fabietto is the epic center of it. Will Fabietto have the willpower to come out from those problems or he will get distracted? 
Things I liked about the movie are:- 
1. Director uses the wide frames to tell you how lonely the characters of the movie are and there are lot of frame with water in the background which tells you how emotional the characters are.
2. The performance of all the actors is very good, even they are speaking Italian but you will understand each and everything because of the expressions given by them.
Things I didn’t like about the movie are:- 
1. There is no English dub available, the audience can watch the movie if there are no subtitles in it but the jobs get tough when the audience has to read the subtitles first then watch a movie.
2. There are two references of why the film got the title ‘The Hand of God,’ but I didn’t get convinced with both the references.
3. The first 25 minutes are all over the place, you have to be patient while watching the movie but after that, the movie is good.
‘The Hand of God’ is available on Netflix and the runtime of the movie is 2 hours 10 minutes l and if you want to explore a new culture with the help of a movie then you should watch this movie. Wait for the magic to happen.
‘The Hand Of God’ got a nomination in Oscars for The Best International Film. Will they win it or not?
