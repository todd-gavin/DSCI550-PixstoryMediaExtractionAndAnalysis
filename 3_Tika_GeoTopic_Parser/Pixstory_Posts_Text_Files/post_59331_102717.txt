I am comfortable sharing over here So I go to swim occasionally with my friends and the last time I was there I encountered with something terrible I forgot to bring my Swimming Trunks with me and had to borrow one from my friend And we both have world s apart physique His waist size is like I am just And surely the pants did not fit and even I did not pay any attention We went besides the pool changed the clothes and I took a dive like I usually start and lo before I could do anything the pant was floating away with the little waves created from the dive And I had to take cover behind my friend before somebody took hold of the pants and waved it in the air like a flag Pictures were taken of me and I felt like I was dying of embarrassment Luckily the pool was private and the pics are only in the groups But now I am the topic of daily conversation in my group P S Don t Judge
