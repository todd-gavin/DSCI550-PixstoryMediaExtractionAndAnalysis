College life is fun but nothing compares to school life. 

Who doesn’t miss those boring uniforms, the big gang of friends you made for life, fights over window seat on a school trip. 
School life is made up of inherent innocence that is somewhat lost in college. In college you are constantly worrying about your career and your grades while in school you “did your homework but forgot it at home” every other week. 

In college, you are overtly aware of how you look and how the world perceives you but in school you were getting dirty everyday in the games period. Life was not lived on social media but in the playgrounds. 

Yes, cafe hopping with your friends is fun but it is not the same as that ten hands in a single lunch box every single day. 

Parties with friends are fun but I get nostalgic for the giddy feeling you got as your mom did your make up for the annual day as you danced away with your friends. 

If you are lucky, the friends you made in school will be dancing at your wedding too but sometimes, like memories, the friendships just live on in photos.
