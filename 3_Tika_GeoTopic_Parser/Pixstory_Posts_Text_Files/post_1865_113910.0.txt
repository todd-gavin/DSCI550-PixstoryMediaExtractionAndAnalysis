A plant-based meat brand decided to take an unusual — and cannibalistic — route to sway people to try their product.

European company Oumph! developed the Human Meat Plant-Based Burger — a burger they say tastes just like people — for those willing to indulge in fake human flesh.

During Halloween last year, the company set up a food truck in Stockholm, Sweden, serving the "scariest plant-based food ever."

The company released a short advertisement, complete with a sinister voiceover depicting dark scenes in a kitchen as a a chef develops the human-based meat. The commercial then dares people to try it.

LOLA MullenLowe, Madrid the agency behind the campaign, said they wanted to "convince" meat-lovers that plant-based products could "replicate the taste of any meat."

And of course, a solution was to make a tasty plant-based human meat burger!

The campaign won a Silver Prize at Cannes Lions Festival, an international festival for the creative marketing community.

The burger itself is made with soy, mushrooms, and wheat protein as well as "plant-based fats and a mysterious spice mix."

"No humans were injured in the development of this product," the company said.

Well, thank you for the confirmation!
