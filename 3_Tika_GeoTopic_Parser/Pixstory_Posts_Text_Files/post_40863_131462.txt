Alone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt Wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night Kindling a fire and broiling the fresh kill d game Falling asleep on the gather d leaves with my dog and gun by my side The Yankee clipper is under her sky sails she cuts the sparkle and scud My eyes settle the land I bend at her prow or shout joyously from the deck The boatmen and clam diggers arose early and stopt for me I tuck d my trowser ends in my boots and went and had a good time You should have been with us that day round the chowder kettle I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west the bride was a red girl Her father and his friends sat near cross legged and dumbly smoking they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders On a bank lounged the trapper he was drest mostly in skins his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck he held his bride by the hand She had long eyelashes her head was bare her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach d to her feet Walt Whitman
