While different ways of tackling the problem are being discussed and experimented at various levels in different geographical areas, it seems proper to document and thus share my experience in dealing with the problem as the Superintendent of Police in Rohtas between the years 2008 to 2011. 

Rohtas, badly affected by Maoist activities for almost two decades also had one of the most difficult terrains which was geographically very challenging for regular policing. A large part of the district consisted of hilly areas covered by dense forests. 

The Kaimur Hills which originate near the Banks of the Sone in Rohtas, further extend to the Sonebhadra district in Uttar Pradesh and there after to the Vindhya Ranges. The hills also extended southward to the Chotanagpur plateau, and provided an easy travel zone for Maoists right from Andhra Pradesh via Chattisgarh and Jharkhand to plains of Bihar. The Maoists called this zone as the Sone Ganga Vindhyachal zone. From times immemorial, the Kaimur hills had always proved as a challenge to any invader. 

The invincibility and strength of the Fort has been mentioned by several chroniclers like Ferishta and travelers like Tavernier. So much so, that the Forts of Rohtasgarh and Shergarh situated on the top of Kaimur Hills, were actually believed to be invincible by means of direct war in history. They had always been captured by deceitful means.
