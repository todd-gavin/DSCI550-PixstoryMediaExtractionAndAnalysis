Santana Rabang has been hearing stories and learning about the Nooksack Indian Tribe since she was a small child growing up in Deming, Washington, near the banks of the Nooksack River. 

She claims that her Native American identity was passed down through the generations in the Nooksack community. 

“I was raised in this community my whole life since birth. I've known that I am Nooksack. I was raised in Nooksack. That was instilled in me,” Rabang told ABC News.

“That ancestral knowledge that's passed down generation and generation. It's not that plastic tribal I.D. that states I'm Nooksack. It's the fact that my great grandmother told me I'm Nooksack.”

Rabang and 300 other members of the Rabang family were disenrolled from Nooksack in 2016, when she was still an adolescent. Years ago, when a prior tribal chair questioned the Rabang's tribal ancestry, the movement to disenroll began.

According to former chairman Ross Cline Sr., the "Nooksack 306," referring to the members and families who were disenrolled, were "incorrectly" enrolled in the 1980s. The tribe contends that the people who are being disenrolled have no Nooksack ancestors. 

Santana and many others are still striving to protect their ancestors' history and their way of life on the reservation. 

Over 60 persons who self-identify as Nooksack but have been disenrolled are risking eviction from their homes as a result of the disenrollment process.

This is not what they deserve, in my opinion. But, they are determined to fight as long as they can and it’s high time we come together to support our Native American friends.
