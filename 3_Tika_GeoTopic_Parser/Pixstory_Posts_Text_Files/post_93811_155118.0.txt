ISL 2022/23: The Indian Super League is on its way with the fifth match concluded today. East Bengal hosted FC Goa at the Salt Lake Stadium Kolkata. Goa played their first match of the season while East Bengal came off after a disappointing loss in their first game. 
Both the teams started off well but seemed quite unprepared. Both looked terrible with the ball as they kept losing possession with some loose passes. In the meantime, East Bengal created a chance but failed to convert it. Though the first goal was not too far as FC Goa in the seventh minute deposited the ball into the goal. Brandon Fernandes gave East Bengal and early lead within just 7 minutes. It was another display of poor defending by the red and golds. 
East Bengal looked desperate for their equaliser but failed to change the scoreboard before the first half. After the half time East Bengal was seen in a different flow and in the 64th minute they scored their equaliser from a penalty. Goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh committed a poor foul and thus conceded the penalty. 
The game was looking to be a draw again but the major change took place in the injury time. Edu Bedia scored at the 90+4' mark and shattered the hearts of East Bengal fans. It was a long-range freekick and the East Bengal defenders were in tears while clearing it. Absolutely sensational from Bedia and it might seal the game for them in the final minutes. 
East Bengal unfortunately ended up in the losing side again after a last minute goal from Goa. Totally a mixed game with attacks from both the teams. It was a thrilling contest but both teams needs improvement in a couple of departments. Goa were the better side in the first half but East Bengal bounced back in the second half, still it didn't helped them get the match draw. Goa would be looking to take on their momentum in the next games of the season
