Dr. Aqsa Shaikh, Co-Lead TransCare MedEd; Associate Professor, Community Medicine, HIMSR (edited, in the speaker’s words):

It's very interesting to reflect on the story behind the TransCare project, and how such a diverse set of people came together to work on a common goal. 

It was September 2020 and we were passing through the first wave of COVID-19 in India. During that time, I had a COVID infection and I got admitted in my own hospital where I work as the Associate Professor of Community Medicine and I was also the Nodal Officer for COVID. 

I was admitted for 10 days – remember that I’ve been in this hospital or college for the last nine years now. This is the institute where I transitioned. A lot of doctors who are residents in that hospital were my students. So they are aware about my process of transition. Most of them know me quite well.

In spite of that, when I was admitted as a COVID patient, I was on the patient's side, and my transness was completely ignored, it was invisibilized. 

When the medical history or surgical history or past history or any significant history was taken, I was never asked about my experiences as a trans person in those moments. My gender was not asked to me -- it was assumed, 'Okay you look like a woman so it's a woman.' 

No one asked me in which ward I will be admitted -- of course, there are no gender-neutral wards in my hospital, as is the case with most of the hospitals.

Sadly, since all this information – which is important for providing care to a trans person – was not documented, there was an error in the diagnosis process for detecting pneumonia because the breast implants I have were thought to be some shadows in the lung.
