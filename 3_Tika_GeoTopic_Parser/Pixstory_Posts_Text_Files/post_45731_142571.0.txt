According to a blog post published by NASA on Monday, the agency is now aiming for a September 27 launch date for its unmanned Artemis 1 mission to the Moon. Phys.org reported that engineering teams would need to successfully complete a test to fuel the Space Launch System rocket and obtain a waiver to avoid having to retest the batteries on an emergency flight system that would be used to destroy the rocket if it deviated from its intended path before the date could be set. The timeframe would be advanced by several weeks if the rocket had to be wheeled back to its assembly facility because it would not be granted the waiver. On September 27, a "70-minute launch window opens at 11:37 am EDT," with an ocean splashdown for the Orion capsule. A potential next date comes on October 2.The Artemis 1 space mission hopes to test the SLS as well as the unmanned Orion capsule that sits atop it, in preparation for future Moon-bound journeys with humans aboard.
