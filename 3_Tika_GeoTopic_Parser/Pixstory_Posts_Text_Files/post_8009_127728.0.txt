Loss of 500 million dollars to Afghanistan's economy due to the deprivation of girls from education
 Deprivation of girls above the sixth grade from education has resulted in a loss of at least 500 million dollars for the Afghan economy in the last 12 months.
According to UNICEF's analysis, by keeping girls away from secondary and high school education, Afghanistan will lose 2.5% of its GDP annually.
This organization published in its report and said that if three million girls can complete their education and participate in the labor market, girls and women will contribute at least 5.4 billion dollars to the Afghan economy.
 The non-financial consequences of denying girls from education in the future will be the lack of female teachers, doctors and nurses
