Inflation is leading to several union strikes which increases the fear of a general strike. The worker's demand is fair as they need a wage rise during the soaring prices.  Will it lead to a general strike?

A general strike is "the stoppage of work by a substantial proportion of workers in several industries in an organized endeavor to achieve economic or political objectives".

The last attempt in the UK was in 1926 when three of the then five million trade unionists took industrial action for nine days.

However, is highly unlikely this year. Only TUC - the umbrella organization for most of the UK's unions - can organize a strike of this scale.

The leader of the RMT rail union, Mick Lynch, says there are situations where he would call for this, but his union has only around 80,000 members.

It would need much bigger unions - such as Unite - and those regarded as more moderate, such as Usdaw, on board if it were to succeed.
However, this does not mean we will not see lots of industrial action this year.

On Thursday, Unite workers at the country's largest container port, Felixstowe, voted for strikes.

But there is the potential for much more widespread action this autumn, with teaching and nursing unions, for example, unhappy with their below-inflation pay awards.

Unions might find it difficult to ensure a minimum level of service is retained, as they would not be able to urge members to work.

But if workers do not provide this minimum level of service, unions could potentially face legal challenges from employers, which could prove costly - as Ms. Liz Truss says, minimum service levels would be negotiated with each industry.
