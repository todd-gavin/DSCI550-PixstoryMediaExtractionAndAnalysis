You probably connect Michael Jordan with his legendary Air Jordans, a now-iconic shoe because of its record sales numbers. What you may not know is that these shoes used to be against NBA dress code. Michael Jordan paid an NBA fine each time he wore them rather than play the game without them. Eventually, the NBA allowed the shoes on the court.
