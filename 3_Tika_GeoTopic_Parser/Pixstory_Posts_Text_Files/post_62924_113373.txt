That video is truly disturbing Like that s a lot of red flags right there The drawings of a gunman being shown again and again actively shooting killing people with bright red color all over The drawings were chilling the lyrics the calling he was talking about Everything about this video screams white supremacist violence This guy CONFESSED he wouldn t be able to stop himself How did no one even think of reporting it to the authorities And it was took down today After eight months Never tell me again that white supremacy doesn t flow in this system
