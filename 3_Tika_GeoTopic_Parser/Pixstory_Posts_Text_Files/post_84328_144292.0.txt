On September 2020, Mikel Arteta became the head coach of Arsenal F.C. as you may know, the  club had a shaky start with the new manager, with the former Arsenal captain with inconsistent results and the bar raised high. Being the youngest manager in the league, Artera was criticized harshly for losing the first few matches of the league in 2021. Fans were outraged, demanding to remove Artera from the club. Compared to Arsenal's glorious past, led by Arsene Wenger who won 3 Premier League titles and 7 FA Cups during his 22 year spell. Does that mean that Arsenal will no longer return to it's former glory with Mikel? I think not. Mikel Arteta has been a part of Arsenal far longer than just a manager, first being a captain who won Arsenal a FA Cup, to be head coach and currently be appointed manager. Comparing the statistics of Arteta's  first 100 PL(Premier League) games to Wenger's, and it is much more similar than what people make it out to be. Nevertheless, I believe that Arsenal led by Arteta and his players can surpass Wenger's achievements, leading Arsenal to greater heights.
