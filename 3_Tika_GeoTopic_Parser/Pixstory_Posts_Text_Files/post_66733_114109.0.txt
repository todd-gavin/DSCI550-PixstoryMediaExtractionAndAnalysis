On a clear day, it's hard to beat the beauty of Wineglass Bay in Tasmania's Freycinet National Park. Lay eyes on this luscious jewel from the lookout, with its curving bush-fringed shoreline, stark-white sand, and sapphire waters, and you'll be spoilt forever.

After soaking up the views, take the 20-minute walk from the lookout to the southern end of the beach, where you can gaze up at the Hazards, the pink-tinged granite peaks punctuating one end of the bay.

Sea kayaking, sailing, and fishing are favorite things to do here, and bushwalking is especially popular.
