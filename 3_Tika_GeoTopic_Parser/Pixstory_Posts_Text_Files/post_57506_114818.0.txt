The sonnet by Sylvia Plath (read it in full here) is very much about craft, about delivering a tough resonant argument. It concerns the art of rhetoric, densely and self-consciously built, full of literary references and brandishing its knowingness. French words (ennui, jejune, blasé, insouciant) enforce this sense of sophisticated hopelessness.

Tea leaves thwart those who court catastrophe,
designing futures where nothing will occur:
cross the gypsy’s palm and yawning she
will still predict no perils left to conquer.
Jeopardy is jejune now: naïve knight
finds ogres out-of-date and dragons unheard
of, while blasé princesses indict
tilts at terror as downright absurd.

The beast in Jamesian grove will never jump,
compelling hero’s dull career to crisis;
and when insouciant angels play God’s trump,
while bored arena crowds for once look eager,
hoping toward havoc, neither pleas nor prizes
shall coax from doom’s blank door lady or tiger
