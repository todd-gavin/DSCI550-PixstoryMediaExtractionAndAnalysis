Today’s match between Manchester City and Liverpool will decide who will have the edge to win the Premier League. It’s “Now or Never” for both the managers of the team.

Both teams played 30 matches till now and Manchester City is the table topper with 73 points and Liverpool is second on the table with 72 points. 

If Manchester wins the match today they will take the lead of a total of 4 points and if Liverpool wins the match today, first they will leapfrog Manchester City to become the table topper and will take the lead of 2 points.

Everyone is saying that this match will be the title decider but what I think is, after this match, seven-match will still be there to play and in seven matches anything can happen.

So, yeah whoever wins today’s match will have the upper hand to win the league but there will be no guarantee that either Manchester City or Liverpool will win the league.

Manchester City will be heavily dependent on the tactics of Pep Guardiola because the bonding of the team players is top-notch but one bad decision from Pep Cham ruins everything for the team.

On the other hand, playing 11 of Liverpool is almost the same in every match because of that Jurgen Klopp doesn’t have to worry about anything, just one tweak here and there can settle the comfortable win for Liverpool.

The draw will be the worst result for both the teams as well as the premier league because if the draw will be the result of the match then everything will remain the same and the hype of this match will be wasted.

As a neutral, I want a high-scoring match but I think whoever will score the first goal will concentrate on defense.
