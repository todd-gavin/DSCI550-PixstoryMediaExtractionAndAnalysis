Manchester United ended their 7-game winning streak across all competitions last night as they failed to defeat Chelsea in the Conti Cup semi-final. Skinner’s side were aiming to reach their first ever cup final but were handed a 3-1 loss by Emma Hayes’ side. Pernille Harder and Jessie Fleming and Jessica Carter scored for the hosts. A brilliant Jackie Groenen back-heel assist to Vilde Boe Risa denied Zecira Musovic a clean sheet.


The absence of Hayley Ladd and Ella Toone was a big loss for Marc Skinner. Lucy Staniforth, Jade Moore are already injured and with Ladd’s suspension, United found it hard to stabilise their midfield. In the absence of their star CDM, Skinner decided to field a midfield trio of Jackie, Boe Risa and Zelem; neither of those players can perform the role of Hayley Ladd. As a result, Chelsea were easily able to capitalise on this issue and scored two goals in a span of 5 mins. 

United went with Leah Galton, Martha Thomas and Alessia Russo upfront. Russo acted as a makeshift RW but often switched her role with Thomas and Galton. Leah is a winger who likes to cut it; Russo prefers to play from the middle; Thomas is an out-and-out number 9. So in hindsight, United did not have anyone who could stretch Chelsea’s backline out wide. And without Ladd, Blundell and Batlle were offered less freedom to play higher up the pitch and were often caught in wrong positions while United were defending. 

Skinner subbed in Fuso and Bruun in the second half. Fuso was brilliant on the ball and was causing issues to the backline but before United could try to dig in deep, they were reduced to 10 players after Sophie Baggaley was sent off. 

United’s memorable Conti Cup run might have come to an end but there is plenty left to play for. Learn from this game and improve!
