Shark Tank India season 1 may have concluded but the show continues to find new reasons to stay in the headlines. From the colourful personalities of the show’s ‘sharks’ to the entrepreneurial talent from the country put on display, Shark Tank has been fodder for social media conversations and memes. One such entrepreneur, Rohit Warrier who invented a glass shield called Sippline who was rather brutally rejected on the show is now busy poking fun at ‘sharks’ Ashneer Grover and Vineeta Singh. The two ‘sharks’ had doubted the viability of the product and asked Warrier ‘dhoondh kaun raha hai hai?’

The Sippline founder has now shared a video on social media trolling them by sharing online search statistics for Sippline. The product which was termed by Ashneer as ‘waahiyat’ in rant on the show according to the owner is now being widely searched for on social media.

According to Rohit Warrier, some 3 lakh people are looking the product on Instagram while the number is significantly higher on YouTube with 15 lakh searches for Sippline. The video also claims that the product is also getting attention from other parts of the globe.
