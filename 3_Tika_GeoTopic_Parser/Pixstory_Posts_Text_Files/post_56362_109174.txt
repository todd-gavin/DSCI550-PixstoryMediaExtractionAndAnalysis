Found this quote today and I started to wonder how often can we keep our energy positive We can try but circumstances sometimes need some negativity to find out what trouble you are in and who is manipulating you Yes we all know what we are today because of our experiences and yes both good and bad experiences contributed to the person you are today Secondly what kind of person are you today That question is relevant so understand you thoroughly so that you know your toxicity you know your negativity and where does that come from If you know the source then it is easy to treat yourself So can t you stay positive you can but you have to understand that life isn t all about positivity as we know positive and negative charges coexist similarly negativity and positivity coexist So take your take to understand yourself and try to choose those things that give your happiness without physically or emotionally destroying an individual intentionally That s the best we can do in this world
