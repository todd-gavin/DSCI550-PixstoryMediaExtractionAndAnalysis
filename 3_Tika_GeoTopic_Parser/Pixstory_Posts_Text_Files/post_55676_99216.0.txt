During a tense pre-election debate, Prime Minister Scott Morrison promised that Australia would cooperate with its friends to prevent China from establishing a military facility in the Solomon Islands. 

AlJazeera reported that following Beijing's declaration last month that it had inked a security pact with the Solomon Islands leadership, China's growing weight in the Pacific has become a hot political topic in Australia ahead of the May 21 elections. 

Although the China-Solomons agreement has not been made public, a leaked document has frightened governments in the region, notably passages that authorise Chinese naval deployments to the Solomon Islands, which are less than 2,000 kilometres (1,200 miles) from Australia.

Pressed during the Sunday debate on what that red line means, Morrison said: “Australia would work with partners to ensure that that type of an outcome would be prevented.”
“The Solomon Islands government themselves have made it very clear to us that that is not an outcome that they are seeking or supporting either. I believe it is not in their national interest to have such a presence,” he said.
