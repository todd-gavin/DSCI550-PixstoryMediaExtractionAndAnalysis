â€” Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church. (Ephesians 5:25-29)
How did Christ love the church? He risked it all for her. He gave his life as a sacrifice to purify and safeguard her. It's an beautiful idea. Christian faith holds that Jesus loved his followers so much that he laid down his life for them. Therefore, husbands should also adore their wives just as much. This verse implies that husbands should love sacrificially and protectively for their wives in the same way that Christ gave His life for His wife, the church. They are not to rule over her; rather, they are to nourish and protect her. They are to be selfless and loving.
