Each droplets was felt with a warmth of the season, 
That smell of the soil was something we all used to wait for. 
Until, that day, when newly built houses was destructed 
Pieces of lands breaking down and waters takes them for a ride to float
When cars became a pool of sand 
Rain never felt the same,
There is a lovely feeling attached to it, but with a slice of fear
