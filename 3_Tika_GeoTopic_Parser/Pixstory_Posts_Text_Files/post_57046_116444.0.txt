You have completely misinterpreted the parent post. 
See, the problem is not praising. It is about inflated praise, using words like "perfect" or "incredibly good" instead of just saying it with a simple good. 
Always trying to use hyperbole for what you say for your kids would not make them better people; instead, it will harm their performances.

Inflating praise can lead to praise addition when your child compulsively performs behaviours to earn approval.
Besides being addicted to the praise or becoming highly narcissistic, what else is more important is that children always have the sense to determine genuine praise.
Children with low self-esteem do not respond correctly to such words high degree; it creates some impossibly high standards that are not easy to meet every time.
It will be more helpful if parents don't use lavish words to applaud their child; the words can be genuine or easy, just like what you observed.

Also, there's a difference when you praise someone for their abilities or praise them for the efforts they put in. For example, praising a child's intelligence can teach them that this is a fixed trait they can't control. But, on the other hand, it can make them wary of trying anything new if they don't maintain high standards.

So inflated praise can have negative impacts in both ways, either making a child excessively narcissistic or maybe demotivating them more by setting high standards.
