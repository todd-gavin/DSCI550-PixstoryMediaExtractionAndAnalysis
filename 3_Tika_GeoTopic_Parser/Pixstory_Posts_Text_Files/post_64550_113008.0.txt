The market managed to eke out moderate gains amid volatility and rangebound trade in the week ended July 1, continuing the uptrend for yet another week. Tepid global cues and caution ahead of June quarter earnings weighed on the sentiment.

On July 1, a hike in the export tax on oil producers pulled down the oil & gas space as well as the market but later in the day other sectors helped narrow the losses. At close, the Sensex was down 111.01 points, or 0.21 percent, at 52,907.93, and the Nifty was down 28.30 points, or 0.18 percent, at 15,752.

Consolidation is expected to continue, with all eyes on corporate earnings and global cues, including the release of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting’s minutes, experts said.

"Participants will be closely eyeing its results for any change in the guidance amid the fear of a global slowdown. Besides, the performance of the global indices, crude movement and updates on the ongoing tussle between Russia-Ukraine will be in focus," Ajit Mishra, VP-Research at Religare Broking said.
