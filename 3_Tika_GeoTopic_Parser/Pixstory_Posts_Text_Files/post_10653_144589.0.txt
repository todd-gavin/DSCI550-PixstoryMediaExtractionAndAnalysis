Abhijit Singh Chadha regained the top spot after he carded a five-under 65 in round three of the Rajasthan Tourism presents Jaipur Open 2022 powered by AU Small Finance Bank being played at the Rambagh Golf Club in Jaipur.

Chandigarh lad Abhijit (62-69-65), who led the field in round one before slipping to second position in round two, got back to the top of the leaderboard with a two-shot lead at 14-under 196 on Friday.

Om Prakash Chouhan (67-66-65) of Mhow, who has made five chip-ins in the tournament so far including two in round three, played an error-free round of 65 to gain four spots and end the day in second place at 12-under 198.

Bangladesh’s Jamal Hossain fired the day’s best score of 63 to move up 15 spots to tied third at 11-under 199. Bengaluru’s Mari Muthu (67) was also in tied third place.

Halfway leader Amrit Lal of Chandigarh dropped to tied seventh place at nine-under 201 after returning a 73 on Friday.

Local professional Girraj Singh Khadka was tied 28th at three-under 207. Amateur Manoviraj Shekhawat, the other Jaipur golfer to make the cut, was 50th at six-over 216.

Three-time PGTI winner Abhijit Singh Chadha’s day was highlighted by his three long birdie conversions from a range of 15 to 30 feet on the second, fourth and 18th as he did well to negotiate the tricky greens.

The 31-year-old Chadha, a winner on the PGTI last year and currently 17th on the tour’s merit list, also set up three tap-in birdies with his exceptional wedge shots. His seven birdies were accompanied by two bogeys.

Abhijit said, “I managed myself well despite the conditions not being easy as the wind was swirling around and the greens were tricky. I stayed patient and I’ve been rewarded for that. I was also very consistent with my putting.

“The wind generally doesn’t have much of an impact here in Jaipur. But this week we’ve had more windy conditions than usual for this venue.”
