miart 2022
 From 1 to 3 April 2022, miart, the international modern and contemporary art fair organised by Fiera Milano, returns, confirming the dates announced and repositioning itself, as is traditional, in spring.
In an April full of important events for the art world, miart will be the first art fair of 2022 organised in Italy and among the first in Europe: the symbolic start of a new phase, the first movement of a possible new symphony.
 
In the second edition headed by Nicola Ricciardi, miart strengthens its international scope and puts the link with the city back at the centre, once again playing a leading role inside and outside the exhibition centre.
