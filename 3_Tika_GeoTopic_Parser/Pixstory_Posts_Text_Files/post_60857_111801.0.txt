I made these illustrations as a tribute to all the doctors and medical staff that help save lives around the world by sacrificing so much.

Last summer I did not think I would have lived to turn 20 this year. It was COVID's 2nd wave and I was desperately trying to breathe in and out. I couldn't breathe in or out without my attempts turning into bouts of cough. I ran several different tests and found out I had a severe case of COVID. After consulting several doctors, I had to be immediately admitted before it was too late. The situation at that time was so severe, it was impossible to get me admitted anywhere because there was no vacancy. I was starting to breakdown mentally and felt bad about causing my family extreme stress.

Just when I thought I would not make it, I received my life's greatest blessing disguised as a doctor's grace. He assessed my condition and admitted me right away. 

I felt so alone being isolated from friends and family but I always felt happy when the doctor who was treating me came by regularly to check up on me. He would cheer me up and give me the motivation to continue doing what I liked instead of despairing about my situation. He'd tell me that I was doing really well and he was surprised at how quickly I was recovering, given my condition.

Every day I would thank and appreciate all the medical staff attending to me and everyone else in the COVID ward. That experience really put things into perspective and I received a second chance at life.

After numerous injections, IV drips, blood tests, I was declared COVID free. But those two weeks that I spent in the hospital ward felt like a nightmare. I was glad that the medical staff was working around the clock to make sure I felt comfortable.

I am left with some lung damage (mostly recovered) and I continue to receive treatment from dedicated doctors and medical staff. This is my heartfelt thank you to you on Doctor's day ‚ù§
