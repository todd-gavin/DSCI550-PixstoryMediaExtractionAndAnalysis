Miquel Soler

Soler, who alternated between midfield and left back, was more daring than the majority of his teammates. He not only played for Barcelona and Real Madrid, but also for Espanyol and Atletico Madrid, the two cities' second teams.

In 1983, he made his first-team debut with Espanyol, and by 1988, he had moved on to Barca for a three-year stay.

He spent a year with Atletico Madrid before returning to Barcelona, but he struggled to reintegrate into the club and went for Sevilla, where he became a crucial player.

Soler's form at Sevilla won him a move to Real Madrid, but he only lasted a year, concluding his playing career with Real Zaragoza and Mallorca before heading into coaching.


Over the years, plenty of other players have crossed the Clasico divide.

Alfonso Albeniz, who was born in Barcelona in 1886, was the first. He won trophies with both clubs and later became the Spanish ambassador to the League of Nations after serving as a director at Real Madrid.
