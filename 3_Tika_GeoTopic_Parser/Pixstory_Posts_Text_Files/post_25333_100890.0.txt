Five Feet Apart is one movie I'll recommend everyone to watch, its sad tho, putting it out as a disclaimer because I particularly don't like watching sad stuff eitherðŸ˜‚ life is already sad enough.
Anyways, if I write the story here, I'm afraid I might give out spoilers. This movie, I saw it back in 2018, and I've rewatched like 7-8 times till now, so just trying to convince y'all to watch it.
