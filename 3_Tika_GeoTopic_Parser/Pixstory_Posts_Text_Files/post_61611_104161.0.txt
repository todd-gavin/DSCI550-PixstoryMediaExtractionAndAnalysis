It was June 27, 2002, when the rest of the world was living out a normal day WWE was gifted with the arrival of their mainstay attraction and the man who would go on to be the face of the company - John Cena. 

Cena debuted when he answered WWE Hall of Famer Kurt Angle’s open challenge to kick off what in retrospect would be one of the greatest wrestling careers ever. Although Cena lost that night, the future 16-time World Champion left a lasting impression in the eyes of many fans, and was even greeted with a handshake from none other than the deadman himself – The Undertaker. 

Fast forward to June of 2022 and the WWE has announced that they will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of Cena’s WWE debut throughout the entire month of June. They have also revealed the hashtag #CenaMonth. 
John Cena has had a long illustrious career for the WWE, both in and out of the ring, while he is a multi-time champion, and a decorated hall of famer for his in-ring accolades, his philanthropy work outside the ring with Make-a-wish foundation is in itself a tall order. Cena has granted more than 650 wishes for the organisation. 

It’s unclear whether we will see Cena in a WWE ring during the 20 year anniversary celebrations, but the Hollywood star did tease a potential return recently saying it’s been too long since he’s made a comeback.
