First a disclaimer, well disclaimer of sorts may be . 
Not a great fan of gay comedies, especially the ones on OTT. Always thought they are an overdose of nudity. 
Too much to handle for an old school me. Stop judging. I am not a homophobe, I don’t even want to sound cheap and produce evidence by saying the cliched “I have so many gay friends”. Well the truth is I am not comfortable with the uninhibited skin show be it from anyone and so much man nudity is a no no. 
Having said that I, however loved “uncoupled “, currently streaming on Netflix. I won’t say it’s the first gay romance I watched, have watched movies and also comedies like Grace and Frankie but honestly for Grace and Frankie . 
But this one was all hearts. I watched the show for Neil Patrick Harris who held my interest in the trailer itself-primarily because he is one of the sexiest gay actors, also the scene was interesting. A man confesses being deserted by his partner of 17 years on the laters birthday without any reason. Just like that for the ‘want of more space’. Harris as Michael steals the show, his struggle to accept that his relationship meant nothing and some one could end it just like that. His struggle to lead a normal life even with betrayal engraved in his mind. The series shows Michael trying hard to accept his new relationship status. His quest to find peace and life again. 
The series is also a fresh take on normalising gay relationships, in communities, societies and in peoples minds. There are some other interesting sub -plots which keep you hooked.
The series also breaks stereotype-all the gay men were not lusting each other as generally shown in such comedies. Also that Gay men have great friendship among themselves and with others.
There is everything in this series- both slapstick comedy and sensitivity. It has all the emotions in just the right dosage. Someone rightly said, it’s sex and city of gay romance. And yes married gay men are husband/husband not husband/wife.
