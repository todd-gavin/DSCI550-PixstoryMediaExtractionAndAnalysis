How can I improve in soccer dribbling⚽️?So these are some points that will help you to enhnace your dribbling skills:1. USE YOUR ARMS.When you dribble with speed move your arms as you would when you sprint without the ball.Keep your arms out at all times when dribbling around defenders. You can use them to improve your balance, and keep players farther away from you. 2. STAY IN AN ATHLETIC POSITION.An athletic position will help you remain balanced. Good balance will help you cut quickly in any direction while retaining control of the ball.3. USE THE FRONT FOOT OF YOUR FEET.Every good speed and agility trainer will tell you to land on the front of your feet. Landing on your heels will slow you down and reduce your balance.Land on the front of your feet every step, whether you are dribbling forward with your laces or cutting across your body using an inside touch.4. USE YOUR PLACE FOOT CORRECTLY.When you dribble forward your place foot should push off the ground just like you are sprinting or jogging.When you cut to change directions your place foot should hop slightly. This makes the movement quick and natural and helps you retain balance.5. RAISE YOUR KNEE.Speed and agility coaches will tell you to raise your knees high to build momentum.Most players have little or no knee movement, which reduces their speed when dribbling.Tell me some more in the notes….Thankyou❤️⚽️
