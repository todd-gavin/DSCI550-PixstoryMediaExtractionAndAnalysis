Celebrating yrs of Independence Tryst with Destiny The speech delivered by India s first prime minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru on the eve of the country s Independence on midnight of August The text of the speech Part That future is not one of ease or resting but of incessant striving so that we may fulfil the pledges we have so often taken and the one we shall take today The service of India means the service of the millions who suffer It means the ending of poverty and ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity The ambition of the greatest man of our generation has been to wipe every tear from every eye That may be beyond us but as long as there are tears and suffering so long our work will not be over And so we have to labour and to work and work hard to give reality to our dreams Those dreams are for India but they are also for the world for all the nations and peoples are too closely knit together today for any of them to imagine that it can live apart Peace has been said to be indivisible so is freedom so is prosperity now and so also is disaster in this one world that can no longer be split into isolated fragments To the people of India whose representatives we are we make an appeal to join us with faith and confidence in this great adventure This is no time for petty and destructive criticism no time for ill will or blaming others We have to build the noble mansion of free India where all her children may dwell The appointed day has come the day appointed by destiny and India stands forth again after long slumber and struggle awake vital free and independent The past clings on to us still in some measure and we have to do much before we redeem the pledges we have so often taken Yet the turning point is the past and history begins anew for us the history which we shall live and act and others will write about
