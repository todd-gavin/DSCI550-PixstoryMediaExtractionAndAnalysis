Many leftists argue that healthcare should be universal but why exactly? People should pay for their own health care rather than relying on the government to provide it. The right to health care is paid for by taxes in a single-payer system, and individuals who work hard and pay those taxes are obliged to fund health care for others who are unemployed. People in the United States already have the right to acquire health insurance, but they should never have the right to free health care. Health care is a service, not a right, that should be paid for. People may use more health resources than necessary when they have universal health care and are not personally liable for the expenses of medical treatments, a phenomenon known as "moral hazard." According to the Brookings Institution, people living in poverty saw doctors 20% less frequently than those who were not. This was before Medicaid was implemented in 1964. However, by 1975, persons living in poverty who were placed on Medicaid saw doctors 18% more frequently than those who were not. Even though they, like other US residents, had guaranteed access to emergency treatment under federal law, a research published in Science found that 40 percent of 10,000 uninsured Portland, Oregon residents who obtained access to Medicaid made increased trips to emergency rooms. Because Medicaid gives low-income people a right to health care, extending it to the whole US population could exacerbate the problem of overuse of health-care resources.
