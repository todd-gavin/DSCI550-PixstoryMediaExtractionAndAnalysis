I did not choose to be a follower, Jesus chose me to be a follower, so I am one. He was gracious, not because I deserved it â€“ because He was Him.

I grew up with Christian parents, I have spent my entire life in church. I have seen people's values in terms of friendship, family, and generosity to strangers. The church used to gather for meals as a time for celebration, fellowship, and Christian family. In the church, I saw people making genuine relationships with other members, and it was so easy to see just how sincere it was in how they behaved. Spending so much time with God and His people made me realize just how much His grace and miracles are in this world. Just how He is so gracious to choose us.

The people He has chosen are never abandoned by Him. So wasnt I. God pursues me with His unwavering love no matter how many mistakes I make or fail. He shows me His love for me when I can't hang on or believe.

His kindness is unfailing. His love never wavers. Like Peter, I might lose faith and fall into the water, but Jesus is there to support me. And that is the reason I am a Christian.
