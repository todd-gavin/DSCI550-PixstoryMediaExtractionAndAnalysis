I hate it when people write about a certain era and don t pay attention to the social norms and ethics of that era I like to read characters working around the difficulties and or ease that setting brought If you re going to make your character behave how one would behave today might as well write your story in the present time What s the point of bringing in a society that you wouldn t even consider I also don t like reading unnecessary details Like if I don t wanna know if her hair was of the color of chestnut or raven I have no interest in knowing what kind of blue his eyes were like ocean or like the nightsky Same with what color the room is what kind of curtains there are how hot was the tea or how bitter was the coffee I don t like all of that
