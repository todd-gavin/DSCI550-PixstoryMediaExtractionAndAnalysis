 I will always credit my presence in the sports industry to my mother She is the primary reason I always strive to do better play better and be better As a child I was always active with never ending energy and a thirst to do something It was my mother who identified this spark in me and harnessed it by making me try out both badminton and singing What started as something to keep me engaged and active changed my life in indescribable ways My mother loved sports She wasn t a sportsperson but knew I was good at it and always encouraged me to do better Coming home from games my mother would motivate me to try more explore more avenues to win more And this always pushed me to do better at everything I tried my hand at be it singing or playing badminton This I realized is something that a lot of parents don t offer to their kids especially when it comes to the sports industry So this is an open letter to all parents requesting you to involve your kids in sports Aside from the fact that playing badminton made me respected and revered internationally it also helped me be disciplined I fervently believe that every child in every family should be involved in some sports Be it kabbadi or badminton or hockey the sport doesn t matter The discipline and the strength it provides a child with make all the difference Sports teach children how to be brave in any situation how to fight for something and most important of all how to conquer easy distractions and become a person with strong physical and mental well being It is not necessary for every child to play sports competitively but it is imperative that they are involved in something that interests them as it shapes them into a completely new person Had it not been for my mother s push I would not have been here Hence it falls upon you as parents to let your children learn more explore more and most important of all play more
