‌Recently White- House has highlighted that pregnancy-related death rates are high in black women. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Black women die at three times the rate of white women. 
‌
‌Health experts point to the fact that other developed countries have significantly different approaches to motherhood than the US, including paid maternity leave, access to postpartum care and enough maternity care providers etc. So the crisis among Black women is an indication of racism in the nation’s healthcare system – from who has access to care to attitudes toward Black people and their bodies.
‌
‌According to the Guardian, Alma Adams said "It doesn’t matter what your socioeconomic status is. It doesn’t matter how much insurance you have, or how much education you have, Those things don’t matter. This could happen to anyone. Look at women like Beyoncé and Serena Williams, who had these near misses because the doctors didn’t pay the kind of attention that they should have.”
‌
‌I mean this is a serious allegation and the facts and surveys show the same. Since last month was related to Black Maternal Health, Black women in the house tried to bring attention to the bills that could address the dangers of black women's pregnancy.
‌
‌Lauren Underwood, an Illinois congresswoman and registered nurse said: “It takes women in these spaces to call out problems, set an agenda, and bring together a coalition of legislators, advocates, and community members to work toward comprehensive, evidence-based solutions that will save moms’ lives". Many Congresswomen have pointed out the inequality when it comes to the pregnancy of Black women in Health care. This racial bias in health care is a serious issue and should be addressed by the house. If this is the cry of Congresswomen, imagine the plight of many-coloured women in the country.
