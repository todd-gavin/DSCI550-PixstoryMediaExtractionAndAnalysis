i carry your heart with me i carry it in my heart i am never without it anywhere i go you go my dear and whatever is done by only me is your doing my darling i fear no fate for you are my fate my sweet i want no world for beautiful you are my world my true and it s you are whatever a moon has always meant and whatever a sun will always sing is you here is the deepest secret nobody knows here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud and the sky of the sky of a tree called life which grows higher than soul can hope or mind can hide and this is the wonder that s keeping the stars apart i carry your heart i carry it in my heart E E Cummings is considered one of the greatest American poets of the th century and this poem is his most famous work The poetry of Cummings is revolutionary for its unconventional punctuation and phrasing This poem can be compared with a sonnet due to its similar structure but Cummings does add modern twists to it It begins with the speaker describing the ubiquitous influence of his love in his life and goes on to touch several themes including oneness and love as the originator of life Its popularity can be assessed from the fact that its opening line is still often tattooed by people and that its lines have been used by several artists including in the song Ion Square by English indie rock band Bloc Party E E Cummings is renowned for his love poetry and i carry your heart with me is one of the most famous love poems of all time
