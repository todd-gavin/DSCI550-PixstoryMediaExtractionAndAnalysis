Ever thought ðŸ¤” that white peacock who does kung fu would become one of the most well written villains? 
Lord shen from kung fu panda 2 is one of the most or I dare say the best villain out there . He is my favourite. Throughout the movie he his presence feels threatening and invokes fear in the audience. He is not insanely overpowered but uses his tactics to win the fight . His animations and fight transitions are graceful that it feels you are watching a dance performance. People sympathized with him and hated him at the same time . He started a genocide in order to make his parents proud of him . Behind his graceful, sharp and sleek nature he hides his insecurities.
