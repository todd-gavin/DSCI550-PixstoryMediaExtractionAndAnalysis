Wrestling just seems to be cursed right now. 

Another wrestler from AEW has seemingly injured himself. . On the latest episode of “AEW Unrestricted,” AEW owner Tony Khan confirmed that Kyle O’Reilly of the Undisputed Elite has suffered a real-life injury.

“Kyle O’Reilly had been on fire,” Khan said. “That’s a real-life, legitimate injury and Kyle O’Reilly is out, not sure how long, but, you know, it’s a big loss and we were not expecting that.”

AEW has a rampant case of injuries going around as some of their biggest stars in Kenny Omega, Bryan Danielson and CM Punk are all sidelined with the injuries

WWE has also faced the brunt of this curse, as 2 main event caliber superstars of Raw, former legacy teammates, Randy Orton and Cody Rhodes are both out nursing injuries that have put them on the shelf till the next year.
