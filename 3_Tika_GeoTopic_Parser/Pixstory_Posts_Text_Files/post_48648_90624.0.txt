There's no denying what Mr Smith did was in the spur of the moment and it could have been handled in a better way, but we can't blame a man for standing up for his wife while she's being insulted in a crowd like that because of something she can't control, that is, her illness.

The joke made at the event by Mr Rock was in poor taste and despite him not having any ill intentions towards anyone, that is something I am sure of, what he did was not okay and it was just a matter of time he was confronted for something like that.

His joke has offended many people and perhaps both men involved in this could have shown a better behaviour. But many times, sh*t happens. And it did, this time too.

Hoping the matter is solved soon, and is not dug unnecessarily deeper by the media and public. And hopefully everyone affected by this is okay.
