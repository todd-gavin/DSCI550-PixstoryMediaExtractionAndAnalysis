Leonardo Del Vecchio, an industrialist who mixed eyewear with fashion and created an empire for eyewear, died at 87.

The company, now called EssilorLuxottica, announced his death. No cause was given. A company spokeswoman said he had died at San Raffaele Hospital. 

He was the chairman of the world's largest producer and retailer of sunglasses and prescription glasses Essilor Luxottica.
Founded it in 1962 when he was just 25, he envisioned success that changed his life and career.

Luxottica produced glasses for luxury brands like Ray-Ban, Armani, Bulgari and Brooks Brothers. His business made him Italy's richest man. 
He was an indefatigable presence in European boardrooms and the architect of the 50-billion-euro merger—equivalent to around $53 billion—of his sunglasses juggernaut Luxottica with French lens maker Essilor. He served as executive chairman of the combined company until December 2020, when he handed over day-to-day operations to a chief executive.

His childhood was imbued with sadness as he grew up amidst the situation of poverty. He was sent to an orphanage at age seven because his widowed mother could not afford to support her five children.

Leonardo's hard work and dedication gave him a chance to become the most renowned and wealthy man. He never stopped inspiring people, not with his work but also with the urge to do the best.
