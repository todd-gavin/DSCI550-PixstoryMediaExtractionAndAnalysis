We, in front of you, have strong reasons for many of our inhumanities and informalities. Our reasons are mostly very valid. Our logic is so strong that you have no choice but to remain silent. We've done something interesting: we've created a situation where whatever you say is naturally wrong and whatever we say is obviously right. Then the result is that a person whose words are all or most of them wrong probably does not have a sound mind. On the other hand, whoever all or most of his words are correct, definitely has a lot of wisdom. Let me give some examples:
 We have decided that wherever we find you alone, we will harass you, threaten you and play with your body and mind if our lust is not restrained. We have made the situation so that we can do these things. Now, you say that it is wrong to say that a woman should not travel alone. We say that this statement is not only wrong, but comes from the depth of wisdom. You say and we say and we do not reach a conclusion. After all, you play the game and travel alone. You will return after a while. Your heart is broken and your mind is tired. The coldness of fear is still in your eyes. Is there any news? You say that they hurt you. They have bothered you. They have chased you. They made fun of you. They have insulted your rights. And we are not surprised. didn't we say How many times we repeated that we know the situation and you did not believe. You always stand in front of us, but in the end it turns out that what we said was true
We do not allow a woman to be a manager. We do not allow any woman to supervise men. We do not allow women to sit in the position of managing affairs and be cooked in the process of trial and error. We do not let women learn management through experience.
