Three people familiar with the multi-pronged interventions told ET that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) sold about $10 billion in the past two weeks to prevent a sharp upward revision in inflation forecasts, as it sought to cushion the domestic impact of imported transport fuels, for which a 10% increase in base price assumptions now seems a near certainty. 

"Imported inflation is relevant in the current environment because imports accounted for roughly 20% of our GDP in FY22," Madan Sabnavis, Bank of Baroda's chief economist, said. "Imports are expected to grow this year, forcing the RBI to intervene to stop the rupee's rapid devaluation. This is a significant threat to the economy, as it has the potential to destabilise all macroeconomic projections."
