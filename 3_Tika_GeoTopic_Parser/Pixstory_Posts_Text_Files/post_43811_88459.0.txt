For falsifying vaccine records, the German coach, who departed Weserstadion in November, was given a one-year suspension.

Markus Anfang, the former Werder Bremen coach, has apologised and explained why he used a bogus Covid-19 immunisation card.

When the claims first surfaced in November, Anfang resigned from Weserstadion, citing a wish to remove himself from the "stress" of the situation while German authorities opened a full investigation.

The 47-year-old, who had previously rejected the allegations, was found guilty of falsifying vaccine documentation two months later and was banned from football for a year.

What has been stated so far?

Anfang finally came forward on Saturday to apologise for his behaviour in the ZDF sports studio, saying that he failed in his job as a sports professional and caused a lot of unneeded grief to people closest to him.

"I have in no way lived up to my role as a role model. I have disappointed many people, lied to them and done a lot of damage to my family," he said.

"I can understand that many people are angry and disappointed. I would love to turn back the clock and undo this mistake."

"I'm still afraid of the vaccination. He had a very bad heart attack, was more dead than alive, was resuscitated nine times," Anfang said of his father's cardiac arrest. "I experienced it first hand and when you see all this, how your dad fights his way back to life - that just does something to you. This fear that I have as a result is difficult for me to take away."

"I wasn't vaccinated, I lied, I didn't tell the truth because it was for me at that moment it was like I can only stay in the job and do my work with a vaccination. That's when I made this mistake. I'm terribly sorry."
