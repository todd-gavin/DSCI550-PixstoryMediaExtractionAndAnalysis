Last but not the least I went to kamla nagar market which is nearby north campus .

And just ate the best momos their from my favourite place 😍 which are again were super delicious and reasonable , they cost me Rs.30 .

-King momos (A momo stall serving veg, paneer and chicken momos) in kamla nagar , opposite to spark mall 

And ganne ka juice which costs me Rs.10 from a local vendor in the market . 

And after all this my 100rs challenge came to an end with full satisfaction of my tummy 😍😂.
