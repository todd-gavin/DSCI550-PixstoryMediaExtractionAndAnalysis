I ve realized during the past few years since the pandemic started that experiencing such toxic and negative responses can be so confusing As a person going through this for years I knew that I wasn t being treated well but I could never connect the dots between the definition of abusive behaviours vs what was really happening Knowledge is truly power as it has opened my eyes to understand what exactly I ve been experiencing and how to prevent it from breaking me apart any further For the longest time I didnt understand what or how to implement boundaries or thresholds on people even those very close to me such as family I always thought it was disrespectful to do so even if they are treating me wrongly Now with the knowledge I ve gained and awareness between what is what I m able to draw the line slowly between what is enough for me and not feel bad or guilty about it Healing and taking back your life confidence self worth and self respect is soooo essential Something I feel like I once had and lost cause I gave those who disrespect me the rights to my life I wish everyone going through this gains their life back one step at a time in this upcoming new year and is able to live their best life
