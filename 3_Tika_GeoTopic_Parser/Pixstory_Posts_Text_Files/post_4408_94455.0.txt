Surprise Me is available when you watch Netflix on a TV. It instantly plays a TV show or movie that you haven't watched before.

You can find Surprise Me in the menu, when selecting a profile, or as a row on the home screen. 

It helps you choose what to watch. So this way, you wonâ€™t waste time finding the right movie/show!
