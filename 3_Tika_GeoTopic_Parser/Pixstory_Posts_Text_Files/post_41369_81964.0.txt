Officials from the US intelligence community claim that a conservative financial website with a sizable American audience is boosting Kremlin propaganda. 

U. S News reported that on Tuesday, US intelligence officials accused a conservative financial news website with a large American audience of spreading Kremlin propaganda, as well as five media outlets targeting Ukrainians, of following Russian operatives' orders. 

According to the officials, Zero Hedge, which has 1.2 million Twitter followers, published pieces written by Moscow-controlled media, which were subsequently reposted by outlets and persons who were unaware of their ties to Russian intelligence. The officials didn't indicate whether they felt Zero Hedge was aware of any links to espionage agencies, and they didn't claim that the website had any direct ties to Russia. 

Zero Hedge refuted the allegations, saying it seeks to "present a diverse range of perspectives."

On the condition of anonymity, the officials briefed The Associated Press on sensitive intelligence sources. It was President Joe Biden's administration's latest attempt to publicise US intelligence conclusions concerning Russian engagement in Ukraine as part of a deliberate campaign to expose and influence Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions. Officials from the United States have already accused Putin of orchestrating a "false-flag" operation to establish a pretext for a fresh invasion of Ukraine and revealed what they believe are final-stage Russian preparations for an assault.
