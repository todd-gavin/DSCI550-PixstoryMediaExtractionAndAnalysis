Meet LEO, my first kid ❤️
I have 4 rescued dogs, Leo is the eldest and the most pampered one and also the shortest of all. He has those cute pink  lips of his. He gets excited whenever anyone comes at my place or whenever I take him out for a walk, as he loves people.

Anyway, I'm pretty sure atleast once in your life you have wondered if your pet could talk? Right? What they would have talked about? How would it feel like? Would they be annoying or super cute?

For now let me expand a bit of my imagination about Leo and about how he behaves normally. According to me if he could talk then he'd say-

1. Stop kissing me, you annoy me at times. (because trust me, he runs away whenever i try pampering him and also he runs away only from me😢)
2. You are annoying but i love you. ( because sometimes he actually comes to me and rests on my lap)
3. Where is my food? (like all the time!! )
4. Treatos would do, if not food. (definitely, all the time)
5. Did I smell other dog's scent on your clothes? (if I meet some other dog and then come home)
6. I don't need a bath, I'll just lick and clean myself. (everytime I'd take him for a bath)

And most importantly he'll behave self obsessed praising himself all the time because he's my kid😂

What do you think your dog would talk about if he could have?
