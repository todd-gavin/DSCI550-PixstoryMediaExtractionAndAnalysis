 Netflix has announced that the martial arts anime, Kengan Ashura, will come back for a second season on the streaming platform in 2023. A new visual poster was also released featuring the characters Kazuo Yamashita and Ohma Tokita to commemorate the announcement. The first season of the anime series premiered in July 2019 on Netflix and got positive reception at the time of its release. However, due to COVID-19 pandemic production process was stalled causing the second season to be delayed.
The Kengan Ashura anime is based on the manga written by Yabako Sandrovich and illustrated by Daromeon. It was serialised on Shogakukuan’s Ura Sunday website from April 2012 to August 2018. It also has a sequel manga titled Kengan Omega, which began serialisation in January 2019. 
For those unfamiliar with Kengan Ashura, it has several things in common with the story of Baki The Grappler, focusing on very large muscular men settling their differences with their fists, albeit without energy blasts or spirit guns. Where Ashura differs from Baki is that here, each fighter typically represents a major company in their fights, with the outcomes of said battles determining the future of corporate takeovers and decisions made in the boardrooms. Kengan Ashura follows main character Tokita Ohma, a Kengan fighter.
The following description has been provided by MyAnimeList for the anime: "Business deals are usually made through meetings and contracts; but in the world of Kengan Ashura, businesses resort to other means to make their decisions: by hiring gladiators. Yabako Sandrovich's Kengan Ashura depicts a world brimming with action, violence, and martial arts—one where powerful gladiators have fought in grand arenas since the Edo Period to settle the disputes of wealthy businesses and merchants.”
