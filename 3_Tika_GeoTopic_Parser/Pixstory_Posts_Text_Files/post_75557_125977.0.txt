So, we all know the feeling of going to school it is fun but can be very tiring. Like we are kids let us sleep, and they are the one to tell us "You need to have a good amount of sleep " How are we going to do that if we have to wake up six o'clock in the morning. Ok so we all loved online school..... For the first two months then it just became boring and we had to do it for 2 whole year and you tell us we were being over dramatic. You try sitting in front of the computer for more then 4 whole hours. Then come the so called "most amazing years of your life " Offline school years..... Like I want to study believe me but you expect us to stay awake for 6 HOURS. And then coming the suspicious substance they call "food" Like do you want me to believe that the thing that a 2 year old child can make is "hard worked food". Then comes the mean teachers only some teachers in the whole year are nice to you the rest hate the word students but they are desperate. Well if there is anything I miss please tell me.(PS:sorry teachers it's for a joke ).
