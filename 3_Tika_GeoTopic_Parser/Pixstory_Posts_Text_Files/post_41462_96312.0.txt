In alternate-shot play Friday at the windswept TPC of Louisiana, Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele fired a 4-under 68 to keep their one-stroke lead in the Zurich Classic of New Orleans. 

On Thursday, US News reported that the Presidents Cup and Ryder Cup partners set a competition record with a 59 in best-ball play. They were 17 points behind. 
After 67s, David Lipsky-Aaron Rai and Doc Redman-Sam Ryder finished second and third, respectively. 

Brandon Grace-Garrick Higgo and Cameron Tringale-Wyndham Clark were both 15 under. Tringale and Clark fired a 67, while Higgo and Grace shot 64.

Scottie Scheffler and Ryan Palmer, the Masters champions, compromised for an even-par 72 to reach the cut at 8 under. Jay and Bill Haas, a father-son duo, also made the cut on the number, following a 65 with a 71. Jay Haas, who is 68 years and four months old, is the oldest player to ever make a PGA Tour cut. 

On sponsor exemptions, Robert Garrigus and Tommy Gainey followed a first-round 61 with a 78 to miss the cut. Garrigus announced earlier this week that he is requesting for a release from the PGA Tour in order to compete in the inaugural LIV Golf competition. 

On Saturday, the format returns to best-ball. Alternate shot will be used in the final round.
