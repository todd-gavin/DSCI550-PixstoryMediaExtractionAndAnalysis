Consumer drug ads are so common in America that people don't realise the malignant effects of using them as a major public health experiment. Each year billions of dollars are spent on these ads without considering the harm they will inflict on people.

A study also found that "out of 195 countries in the world, only two allow direct to consumer advertising of pharmaceuticals with product claims, i.e. U.S. and New Zealand."
Very little is done to understand how it can affect the patients' health.

Drugs do have benefits, but unprescribed drugs have more cons than pros.
Besides that, there is no evidence to claim that consumer ads can improve treatment quality. 

Ideally, drug ads should be informative enough to talk about all the risks and benefits instead of specifically talking about the benefits and concealing the risk and rather emotionally enticing people to buy a drug by calling it a lifesaver.
That's what most companies do; the focus is on proliferation and earning by selling the drug, not the precious lives that would be affected by taking an unprescribed drug.

The other menace these ads create is that it tries to coax people to ask their doctor for a specific drug instead of talking to their doctor about what suitably right thing should be done for their health.

A lot could be said or written to enumerate these advertisements' harmful effects, but political leaders and actors would not cease using their influence to promote them.
