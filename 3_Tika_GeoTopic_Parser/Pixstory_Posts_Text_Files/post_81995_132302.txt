You re two days into the week and that can only mean one thing your desk isn t looking how it used to And no matter how much you say you like it this way your mindset definitely doesn t agree It could be that your to do list has seen better days you have way too many tabs open on your computer or you can t see through the pile of probably unnecessary but keeping just in case bits of paper but none of it is going to help you focus So use Wednesday morning to restart your computer dust your workspace and redo your to do list
