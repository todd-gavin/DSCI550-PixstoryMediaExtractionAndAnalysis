Rolling started the match on a positive note as he took the offensive route. 
After some initial exchange of blows, Rolling brutalised Riddle by pushing him into the barricade before sending him crashing through the announcers’ table. 
Riddle recovered to inflict some damage on Rollins, who hit Riddle with his own move before talking smack to the wrestler. 
The direction of the match turned against as an out-of-control Riddle tried to end things with a chair after a flurry of chops to Rollins’ body. 
But, Seth Rolling managed to evade the fatal attack and hit a stomp on his opponent to seal the victory.
