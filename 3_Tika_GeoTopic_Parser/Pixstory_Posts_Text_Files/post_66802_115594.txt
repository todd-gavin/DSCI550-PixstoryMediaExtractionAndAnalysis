Banned Homework Really So many researchs conducted have suggested that we get a deeper understanding of the topic if we practice it again within hours That is the whole purpose of homework So make it make sense to me of why it should be banned It inculcates values like dedication and discipline among children which goes a long way in their life So NO homework should not be banned
