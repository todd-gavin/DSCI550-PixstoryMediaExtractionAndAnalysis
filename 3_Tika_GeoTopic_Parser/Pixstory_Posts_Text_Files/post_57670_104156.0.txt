Depp-Heard's case has come to an end with Johnny Depp's win.
The jury awarded Depp $16 million for the damages. It has also awarded Heard $2 million in compensatory damages.

People supporting Depp in the case were filled with happiness. 

The 58-year-old Depp filed suit against Heard over an op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post in December 2018 in which she described herself as a "public figure representing domestic abuse." Heard, who had a starring role in "Aquaman," did not name Depp in the piece, but he sued her for implying he was a domestic abuser and is seeking $50 million in damages.
Heard countersued for $100 million, saying she was defamed by statements made by Depp's lawyer, Adam Waldman, who told the Daily Mail her abuse claims were a "hoax."

The jury has been working painstakingly through a special verdict form that contains dozens of questions.
The eight-page verdict form contained 24 questions relating to Depp's suit against Heard and 18 questions relating to her countersuit against him.

Heard spoke in a statement after the decision of the jury,
“The disappointment I feel today is beyond words. I’m heartbroken that the mountain of evidence still was not enough to stand up to the disproportionate power, influence, and sway of my ex-husband.
I’m even more disappointed with what this verdict means for other women. It is a setback. It sets back the clock to a time when a woman who spoke up and spoke out could be publicly shamed and humiliated. It sets back the idea that violence against women is to be taken seriously. 
I believe Johnny’s attorneys succeeded in getting the jury to overlook the key issue of Freedom of Speech and ignore evidence that was so conclusive that we won in the UK. I’m sad I lost this case. But I am sadder still that I seem to have lost a right I thought I had as an American — to speak freely and openly.”
Her statement has posed many questions about women's rights in America.
