My kitchen window sill is adorned with planters.ðŸª´
Food cans are the best to upcycle into planters as they have a coating inside to stop them rusting. 

This craft is sure to be a hit since you probably already have most of the materials on hand at home. You can brighten your kitchen or office with these tin can decorations. If you donâ€™t want to plant real plants, you can use fake plants too! Try it out and make an amazing decor planterðŸª´.
