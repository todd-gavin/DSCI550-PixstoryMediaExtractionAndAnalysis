Kanye "Ye" West has spoken out about Kim Kardashian's split from Pete Davidson.

The 45-year-old rapper, who made news earlier this year for expressing his unfiltered thoughts on the Saturday Night Live alum's connection with West's former wife, returned to Instagram Monday morning to take another shot at Pete. Kim and Pete called it quits after nine months of dating, according to reports on Friday.

In Kanye's caption-less post on Instagram, he simply shared a fake headline from The New York Times, reading, "Skete Davidson Dead at Age 28." In tiny font below, West addressed his ongoing feud with Kid Cudi by writing, "Kid Cudi meant to play funeral but fearful of bottle thrower".
