Fateh ki kachori near ludlow castle school Civil Lines Delhi This is one of the tastiest street food i ve ever tried in Delhi They are offering unique style of kachori which is so yummy will never forget this taste also they serve chole kulche which I don t like much but the kachori with tangy sauce is a must try Bhaiya selling this on a stall on cycle which could be unhygienic for some of you also there s no table or sitting arrangements But I would recommend to try this kachori once Also the price is not too high Just have it at Rs
