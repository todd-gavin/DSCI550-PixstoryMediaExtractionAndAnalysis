Another reason to like Pride and Prejudice is its wholesome dialogues; the words still have a special place in my heart.

"I Do Not Have The Talent Of Conversing Easily With People I Have Never Met Before."

"No, I Prefer To Be Unsociable And Taciturn. Makes It All So Much More Enjoyable, Don't You Think?"

 "Your Selfish Disdain For The Feelings Of Others Made Me Realize You Were The Last Man In The World I Could Ever Be Prevailed Upon To Marry."

"Your Mother Will Never See You Again If You Do Not Marry Mr Collins, And I Will Never See You Again If You Do."

"You Could Not Make Me Happy, And I'm Convinced I'm The Last Person In This World Who Could Make You Happy."

"Only The Deepest Love Will Persuade Me Into Matrimony, Which Is Why I Will End Up An Old Maid."

"You Have Bewitched Me, Body And Soul."
