I don’t have a visa for the US and I don’t want to apply for one. And I don’t want to fly for that long.
Jean-Luc Godard, the visionary and pioneer in film making once was selected to be awarded with honorary award from Oscar. Anyone associated with the film industry would dream off recieving an Oscar at some point of their career. Most of them consider Oscar as a token which is big enough to state their work is an ace! Or the academy turned the Oscars to be one of such kind.
Though Godard being one of the most followed and well renowned Auteur, he just simply refused to gain the title badge issued by the Academy. And when a reporter asked him about the stand he took, he justified by saying: 
I don’t have a visa for the US and I don’t want to apply for one. And I don’t want to fly for that long. Which is one of a kind gut for a film maker! He is always known for it ain't he!? Breaking the conventional procedures, throwing stones at contemporary issues and political moves, clearing his political ideologies and stands through the 24fps medium .. and what not! Godard was born to be Godard! 
Another incident to connect with this thread is the rejection of Oscar for the best actor by one of the best actor of all time, the legendary Marlon Brando. Brando showcased a scintillating performance in Ford Coppola's The Godfather. Anyone could undoubtedly go with the Academy's decision of selecting him as the best actor in 1972 for his performance in the same. But Brando blindly rejected it . The solid reason he put forward was the atrocities the American Indians had to face during that time form the native Americans. He sent in Sacheen Littlefeather to represent him at the stage and to read out the letter written by him. Though she faced many allegations on behalf the incident, recently the Academy seeked their apologies to Littlefeather.
