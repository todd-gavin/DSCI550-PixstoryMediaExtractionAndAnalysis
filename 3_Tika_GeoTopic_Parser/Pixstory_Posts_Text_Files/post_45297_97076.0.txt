Things haven't quite gone to plan for any of Manchester United's summer acquisitions.

Cristiano Ronaldo has relatively been the standout performer at Old Trafford this season.

Jadon Sancho has caught glimpses of his past self but one man who doesn't particularly seem to be in the spotlight anymore is Raphaël Varane. Former Leeds United footballer Noel 
Whelan had some harsh words for Varane, who continues to disappoint.

“He’s a world-class player,and he was supposed to be the one who was going to transform Man United and that defence. Everyone expected a lot more. His form has just summed up Man United’s season. Mistakes which have cost them dearly, just like that shocker against Arsenal."

Varane and Alex Telles were particularly criticised for their displays against Arsenal.

“There’s no continuity in this side whatsoever. It’s just a bunch of individuals out there. On 
paper, they look great – but they don’t have a way of playing. Varane just hasn’t played enough football. He should be one of these leaders in the side, but he hasn’t done enough – and he should be doing better, it hasn’t been good enough."

An injury plagued season simply never got going for the Frenchman.

“Ten Hag has got a lot of work ahead to work out how he’s going to fit all these superstars into one team.”

Varane will compete at December's world Cup, where Didier Deschamps' team will look to 
defend their crown. On the other side of the summer, comes a new dawn for Varane and for 
Manchester United. The ex-Real Madrid defender left the Bernabéu after a trophyless 
season, his first at the club. Nevertheless, he enjoyed many years of unparalleled glory in 
Spain.

“Varane has been so disappointing” Whelan concluded by saying…
