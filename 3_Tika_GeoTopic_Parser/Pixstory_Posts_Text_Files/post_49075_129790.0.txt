Everyone has the freedom of speech, no matter who they are or what they believe. This is one of the most fundamental rights that we have as human beings, and it's important to always remember to protect it.

Even the people you don't like have a right to express themselves freely. This includes people who you think are wrong, misguided, or dangerous. It's important to remember that even if they're making difficult or offensive statements, they still have a right to free speech.

Remember that freedom of speech doesn't just apply to people who agree with you - it applies to everyone. And that includes the people who upset you the most. 

Andrew Tate had the right to speak his mind which was taken away from him. It's nothing to be proud of.
