Humans’ olfactory capacity could be slowly fading out, going by some recent scientific studies. But it’s just a hypothesis, there is no final word. More studies and better fine-tuned research are needed to know for sure.

In the long story of evolution, the five sense organs help us ensure our survival. As eyesight became our dominant mode of ‘taking reality in’, the sense of smell took the backseat and it degraded over millennia, according to a longstanding theory.

Here’s an old research paper to support that theory: https://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2003/04/03/823577.htm
And here’s one that says it’s a 19th-century myth without basis in science: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aam7263

Against that background, Bingjie Li of the Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health and colleagues carried out a study that concludes that the human sense of smell may have degraded due to changes in the genes that encode our smell receptors: https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009564

It’s well known that there’s wide gap between one person’s sense of smell, and it has a genetic basis. That’s what this experiment was about (and not the slow loss of the capacity). Li and colleagues asked 1,000 Han Chinese people and 364 ethnically diverse people from New York to take a whiff of 10 scents. They included two odors that are often perceived differently or not at all. 

Participants were asked to rate the intensity and pleasantness of the odors on a 100-point scale. The researchers then looked at genetic variation in their olfactory genes, to find changes linked to how they perceive scents. They identified two new smell receptors (for those two difficult-to-catch odors).

Then the researchers studied the mutations in genes encoding these newfound receptors. And they realized that many humans had these receptors earlier, but not many have them now (which is why very few perceive these two odors today). 

In other words, many of our specific receptors have been switching off. 

This was, however, a small study and it should be expanded to include diverse ethnic backgrounds in order to give sounder basis to the hypothesis: https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-may-be-gradually-losing-their-sense-of-smell
