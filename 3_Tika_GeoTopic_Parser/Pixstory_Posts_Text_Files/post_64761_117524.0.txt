I am sure whoever is reading this has already seen the movie, if not I have already reviewed it so you can read that before continuing. 

Co-writer and director Bong Joon-Ho executes masterful filmmaking from start to finish, the performances are compelling, and the plot tells the story of a disillusionment arc in a visceral way. But I want to focus on one aspect in particular, the way "Parasite" cleverly utilizes symbols and motifs to express its theme. These are tools that can transcend culture and language, directing our focus to the film's exploration of wealth vs. poverty, again and again.
 
A symbol is simply a thing that represents or stands for something else. And as John Truby points out, this simple representation can have a powerful impact on an audience, writing "symbols give you a hidden language that emotionally sways the audience. Just as matter is highly concentrated energy, a symbol is highly concentrated meaning." There are many symbols in "Parasite,"
but there are two in particular that I want to follow, the viewing stone and smell.

The viewing stone is introduced early in the film, From the very first scene, we understand that they are living a life of poverty. But the son, Ki-Woo, believes they can work their way out of poverty and join the affluent class. When Ki-Woo’s friends gifts them this the captions for Ki-Woo's response say “This is so metaphorical”, the intention is clear, the viewing stone is a symbol. As Bong Joon-Ho says, "that rock is assigned this very unique position. It's a kind of obsession for the young son. Throughout the film, he's trying to imitate Min, his rich friend who initiated him into this world. Min disappears in this film after giving him the rock, but the rock is sort of the remnant of his character." The viewing stone represents Ki-Woo's belief that he is destined for a more successful future, just like his friend Min.
