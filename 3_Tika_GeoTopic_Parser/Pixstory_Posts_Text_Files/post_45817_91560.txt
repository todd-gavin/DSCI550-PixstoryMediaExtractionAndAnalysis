It took me a lot of time to learn about the space jargon When I was a child it was about shiny stars moons and planets but as I grew up I realised how much goes behind it Therefore I have always had a special respect for the scientists of our country They continue to take us to new heights A recent example of that is the Artemis Launch Now I had a curiosity about the countdown process when I was a child and I was always keen of learning more Therefore let s look at how this big feat will be achieved As SciTech tells us before the Artemis I mission launches on its way around the Moon the launch team at Kennedy Space Center in Florida and supporting teams across the country will begin the launch countdown about two days before liftoff The test crew may hold during the countdown as needed to evaluate conditions before resuming the countdown or use the test window or extend beyond it if consumables and resources allow them to fulfil test goals during the wet dress rehearsal test ahead of Artemis I launch Controllers will count down to T minutes and seconds and halt to demonstrate the ability to hold for up to minutes during the practise then restart until seconds before launch then pause the countdown Then they will recycle back to ten minutes before launch and conduct a second terminal countdown to approximately seconds before launch then end the countdown Teams may refine the coundown timeline ahead of launch based on experience with the rehearsal test
