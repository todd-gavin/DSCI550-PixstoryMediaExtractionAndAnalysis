Dissociated methodically By my soul For it has betrayed my conscious Desires the very things I ve lost I would ve sent flowers But they ll wither Cause I wouldn t have cared for them Just as my heart feels now There was a trust Which seemed to go two ways Though the tides stood in your favour Yet I felt comfort I built no walls I paved the way I obsessed as I always do My downfall was my blindness in love I doubted myself When in love I always did The very moment I knew it was real Everything came to an end The reasons don t bother me You had to so you did Well all of the lies did Thats why I m yet to break any promises I confide in myself I talk about you Cause I can t see you irritated If I talk about you to others There is no term Which could be used to describe this state Which I ve been left in Well I m hurt but not by your absence I admit there wasn t much time We didn t meet I couldn t stare into your eyes all day But I imagined it at every second Reality is bound by time Not imagination It was a really beautiful world that I had built In the end it was a hoax Hope isn t in me Cause I ve lost destiny To the illusion of life Its all down while I try to survive Whatever I still feel Doesn t bother you or anyone else It s just my concern This love always changes
