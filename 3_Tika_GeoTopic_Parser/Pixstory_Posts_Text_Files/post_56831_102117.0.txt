For Balenciaga's first New York show in 19 years (and first under creative director Demna), an entire section of Wall Street was barricaded to let attendees enter the venue inside the New York Stock Exchange on Sunday morning.
The Kering-owned French brand embarked on the unusual timing for a company first, under Demna's direction, to hold a show in the Big Apple. 

Event invitations were printed on Balenciaga's stacks-branded $100 bills bearing a disclaimer that "This invitation is for personal use only and is not tender." Celebrity guests included Kanye West, now known as Ye, Alexa Demie, Megan Thee Stallion and New York City Mayor Eric Adams. 

Alexis Stone, who famously dressed up as Mrs Doubtfire at Balenciaga's most recent show in Paris, this time served up some Dolly Parton cosplay complete with a blonde beehive wig and her famous bosoms. Other guests included designers Marc Jacobs and Vera Wang, singers Pharrell Williams, Offset and J Balvin, nightlife icons Susanne Bartsch and Amanda Lepore and the newly married Chloe Sevigny, who arrived with her husband. 

According to a news release from Balenciaga, the office wear is the beginning of a new line called Garde-Robe involving "wardrobe staples" that will be a perennial offering between ready-to-wear and couture.
