The midfielder complimented the French tactician for leading the Eagles to the FA Cup semi-finals.

Cheikhou Kouyate, a Senegalese international, has said that Crystal Palace manager Patrick Vieira is one of the greatest managers he has ever seen.

Vieira's qualities are underappreciated, according to Kouyate, and he will assist the team in going to the next level.

"I've been in football for 15 years, and he is one of the finest I've ever seen," Kouyate said on the club's official website.

"You see how tactically we play? He understands everything." Every time we play against them, he knows exactly what the other team is going to do. He understands how we'll play [to best deal with the opponent].

He tells us what we're going to do, and this makes the game simpler for all of the players. They may play any XI because it is simple for us.

When the former Arsenal manager met with the player for the first time after being chosen as Palace manager, he was impressed, according to the midfielder.

He said that when Vieira was communicating with the players, he was telling us what he wanted to achieve and where he wanted to take this football club.

I'm not sure who claimed [Palace may be relegated], but they're completely incorrect." Because you need to know that he's a brilliant mind and a kind person. "

After the Eagles were knocked out of the FA Cup by Chelsea, Kouyate expressed his disappointment that Vieira would not be awarded the trophy, which he believes he deserves.

"We have games against Manchester City and Chelsea that we want to win," he said. "This guy is incredible, and he's a fantastic manager." He also has a solid team of people working for him. He makes all of the decisions.

"This is why we are so disappointed that we will not be able to win the [FA Cup] final for him, because he deserves it."
