You contend that in order to protect the population from violent criminal elements we need well funded heavily armed police forces However there isn t enough data to back up that assertion In fact studies show that the police are not particularly effective in resolving violent crime I know many people think defund the police is more of an impulsive hurt angry thought but it is in fact well researched It was after Uvalde that I researched about the movement and that s when it started making sense to me The solution asked lies in community programs once again research backed Study has shown that they are an efficient way of reducing crimes and improving social harmony Not to mention a strong percentage of violent crimes go unsolved each year A PNAS study shows that in the US one of the main causes of death for young men is police brutality and violence One in black men can be being killed by police during their lifetime I do not understand how will we reform a system that is so strongly based on racism misogyny and queerphobia What is the centrist approach in this We ve had this system for so long and it just doesn t seem to get any better That being said defund the police is demilitarizing them Taking away their power but still having systems of support where they are social workers trained mental health support workers etc source
