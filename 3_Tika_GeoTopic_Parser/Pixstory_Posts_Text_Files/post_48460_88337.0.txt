Leviticus 20:13
If a man lie also with mankind, as he lieth with a woman
Is guilty of the sin of sodomy, this is a breach of the law in ( Leviticus 18:22 ) 
â€˜If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.

Both of them have done an abomination: he who lays and he who is lain with, both willing to commit the abominable crime; which may well be called an abomination, because it is opposed to nature and more than brutish, because nothing of the sort is found among brutes:

If he who is lain with is not coerced, they will undoubtedly be put to death, as Aben Ezra observes:

Their blood will be on them; they will be stoned to death, as the above Targum says.
