When we think of ratatoullie, the first image that springs to mind is that of Remy, the rat, pulling at Linguini's hair, controlling his every move in the kitchen. 

But did you know the movie was named after a French dish? Specifically, the very dish Remy prepares with Linguini and Colette to impress the food critic, Anton Ego. It was this dish that took Ego back to his childhood days, when his mother would lovingly serve him the warm, comfortable vegetable dish after a long day. 

The Provençal stewed vegetable dish ratatouille is popular in France. Ratatouille niçoise is the dish's full name, and as its name suggests, it hails from Nice. Ratatouille is typically served as a side dish, though it can be a meal if served with rice or pasta.

The best way to prepare ratatouille is up for controversy; some cooks chop and sauté, while others slice, layer, and bake. The essential ingredients, however, are generally acknowledged by chefs to include tomatoes, garlic, onions, courgette, aubergine, and bell peppers.

The ratatouille in the movie is called Confit Byaldi, a more modern interpretation of a Michel Guérard dish from nouvelle cuisine that American chef Thomas Keller popularised in his books, The French Laundry Cookbook.

Depending on how you make it, ratatoullie can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 5 hours to make. Having made it both ways, I can tell you from experience that although the longer version is definitely worth the effort, the short version is just as delicious. 

When I taste the tangy, flavourful sauce paired with fresh vegetables, cooked to perfection and served over couscous, I can see why Anton Ego put his faith in a rat. 

After all, anyone can cook, and a great cook can come from anywhere.
