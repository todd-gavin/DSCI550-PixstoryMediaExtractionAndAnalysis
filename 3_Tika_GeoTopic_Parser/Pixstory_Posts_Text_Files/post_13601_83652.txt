Damn the one who blows the trumpet of war Damn all those who as politicians and leaders set foot in those luxurious palaces and issue orders Do they really call themselves human beings because they run the pen and sign the decree of displacement and death of human beings If leadership is like that damn everything that is related to power and leadership I know politics knows no boundaries I know that politics according to the public has neither a sister nor a mother Politics is so dirty that it can never be predicted In fact those who sit in those soft leather chairs deciding and negotiating the lives and deaths of human beings have never been on the battlefield themselves His mother child sister brother and father are not fighting on the battlefield The consequences of war and displacement are not isolated to his family If that were the case they would never have acted so quickly to start a war and displacement He did not make anyone homeless They did not allow death and darkness on earth I wish we wished that the war was enough then the war would really end I used to say that homicide was enough and I was really getting to the end of it Our homeland has been burning in this dark smoke for years The smell of the suffering of my people has taken over the whole world Wherever you look at war and war Murder hatred terrorism drugs xenophobia ethnicity imposing ethnic beliefs of one nation on other nations eliminating and justifying some over others
