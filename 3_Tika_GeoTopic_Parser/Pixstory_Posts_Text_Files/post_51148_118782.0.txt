I feel my best when I do this series of things frequently. Movement is big one for me. I try to move for at least 30 mins each day. I can really notice a change in my mood when I don't vs. when I do. 

Next on my list is fresh air. Something I learned this year was that I can easily get 'cabin-fever' feelings when I'm inside for too long. Fresh air can really help to wake me up and motivate me. I love to read as you may know and I love how it can calm me down. 

Self care refers more to relaxing and winding down as well. Taking time to have a nice shower, do a face mask or paint my nails helps me to feel recharged. 

Something that makes me feel confident and motivated is when I take the time to plan out my day, week and month. I love to use a physical planner and my digital calendar to stay organized and reduce stress. 

As I live in another country as the majority of my close family, I love to use FaceTime. When I'm feeling down or in a rut, a FaceTime call with family always manages to put me in a better mood. 

The last energy giver on my list is dressing up. I love to take a bit of time in the morning to get ready whether it be to put on some makeup, wear a nice outfit or style my hair a bit. It makes me feel a lot more confident and ready for the day.
