American cuisine is the best in the world, in my opinion. Yes, because it has burgers and chicken wings but also because it is the best of everything- literally! Like many things American, the cuisine also has influences from elsewhere – German, British, Italian, Dutch, French, and Caribbean are only some of the cultures that have contributed to the food that is now considered typically American. 

People all over the world have this wrong assumption that American cuisine is equivalent to unhealthy food and it just consists of frying everything. That is just a stereotype that needs to be debunked. 

American cuisine is much more than that. It’s about rich flavours and spices that will satisfy your taste buds in every way! Let’s consider everyone’s favourite Buffalo Chicken Wings and Hot Dogs! 

The fried chicken wings with cayenne-vinegar hot sauce (buffalo sauce) are a popular pub snack, despite being invented in the 1960s. Buffalo chicken wings were first served in Buffalo, New York's Anchor Bar, and have since become one of the most popular bar dishes. 

Although HotDogs are the game changer! As CT tells us, an all-American hot dog is the perfect accompaniment to a summer barbeque or a baseball game. 

Although the hot dog was invented by German Charles Feltman, who served German sausage on buns to save plates, it was Polish immigrant Nathan Handwerker's hot dog stand Nathan's on Coney Island that made it a national icon. There are regional variations, such as New York-style with ketchup and relish and Chicago-style with a poppy seed bun.
