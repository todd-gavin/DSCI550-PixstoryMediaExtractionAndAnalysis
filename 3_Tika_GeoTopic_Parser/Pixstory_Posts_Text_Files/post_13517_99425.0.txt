Save the Children says nearly 10 million children in Afghanistan go hungry every day because of the economic collapse, the effects of the Ukraine war and the ongoing drought.

The agency said immediate food aid was needed in the short term, but was not enough to tackle Afghanistan's worst hunger crisis alone.

The international charity that helps children said in a report on Monday that despite the significant amount of food aid provided to families in recent months, 19.7 million children and adults - about 50% of Afghanistan's population - are still hungry. And they need immediate support to survive.

According to the report, from March to May alone, 20,000 people went hungry.

Referring to the freezing of Afghanistan's assets and the suspension of development aid following the Taliban's takeover of the country, the Save the Children said that these were Afghan children who were burdened by the policies of the international community. Policies that, according to the agency, have led to a sharp decline in liquidity and the economic collapse of Afghanistan
"Every day our front-line staff treat children who are dying right in front of our eyes because they only eat once a day," said the communications director of the Save the Children Fund.

Although it is estimated that 18.9 million children and adults will need food assistance from June to November this year, there is sufficient funding to support just 3.2 million people.
