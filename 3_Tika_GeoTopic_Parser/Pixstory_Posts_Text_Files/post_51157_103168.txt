It s a small cafe with a seating for around people Ambience was good service was also good Tried pizza and shakes their they were good and Pizza was quite good Drinks were ok shakes were too thick Best pizza won t be an overstatement However the good pizza comes with additional things which makes it as high priced as however four people can easily have their fill so it s a fair deal Shakes are exactly as said no compromise with ingredients Ultimate platter is a must have the variety is all what we Indians love to have and you exactly get it here Overall a nice place but could have been better
