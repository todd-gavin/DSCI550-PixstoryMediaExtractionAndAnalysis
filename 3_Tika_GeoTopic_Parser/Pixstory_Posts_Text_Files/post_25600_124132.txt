Warner Bros Discovery is planning to reboot the DCEU and their new plans are an insult to the success of the Arrowverse The DCEU has always kept itself separate from the Arrowverse so in that regard it makes sense that it wouldn t be factored into the future plans of the DCEU in any way However Warner Bros continuing to ignore it when they re trying to restructure the DCEU is both ignorant and incredibly limiting of their options Following the cancellation of the Batgirl movie Warner Bros Discovery has announced new plans for their programming that are a radical shift from what they had been previously doing One part of those plans is to focus primarily on making movies meant to go straight to theaters and eschewing streaming as streaming isn t seen as being as profitable by the company via Deadline This combined with reports of HBO Max cutting scripted shows suggests that the DCEU will only be doing big theatrical movies going forward Peacemaker notwithstanding It s clear that Warner Bros Discovery thinks that the DCEU can only work by focusing on the theaters but that mindset completely ignores the success of the Arrowverse For over ten years the Arrowverse has won people over with its take on the DC Universe and has provided an outlet for all kinds of stories that the movies wouldn t have time to tell If anything the Arrowverse proves that scripted content can work for DC so Warner Bros Discovery ignoring that to focus solely on movies does nothing but limit the scope of what they re capable of
