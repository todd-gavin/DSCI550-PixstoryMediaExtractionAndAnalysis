Mary Oliver was born in Maple Heights, Ohio, on September 10, 1935. As a teenager, she lived briefly in the home of Edna St. Vincent Millay in Austerlitz, New York, where she helped Millay’s family sort through the papers the poet left behind. In the mid-1950s, Oliver attended Ohio State University and Vassar College, though she did not receive a degree.

Oliver’s first collection of No Voyage and Other Poems (Houghton Mifflin Company) was published in 1965. She went on to publish more than fifteen collections of poetry, including Blue Horses (Penguin Press, 2014); A Thousand Mornings (Penguin Press, 2012); Swan: Poems and Prose Poems (Beacon Press, 2010); Red Bird (Beacon Press, 2008); Thirst (Beacon Press, 2006); Why I Wake Early (Beacon Press, 2004); Owls and Other Fantasies: Poems and Essays (Beacon Press, 2003); Winter Hours: Prose, Prose Poems, and Poems (Mariner Books, 1999); West Wind (Houghton Mifflin Company, 1997); White Pine (Harcourt, Inc., 1994); New and Selected Poems, Volume One (Beacon Press, 1992), which won the National Book Award; House of Light (Beacon Press, 1990), which won the Christopher Award and the L.
