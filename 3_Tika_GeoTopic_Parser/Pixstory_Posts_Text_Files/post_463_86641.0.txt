First the disclaimer. 
I have severe cervical spondylitis. And a few slip discs. All this happened when I was breaking my already weak bones in a gym some years back. So I offer namaz sitting on a chair as the doctor has advised against kneeling . 
Back to today. 
An afternoon meeting meant I had to leave by 11 am and the Friday prayer wouldn’t be possible. The meeting and few calls planned, made even praying in office a little tough. And I don’t know what happened I wanted to pray in the train. I have done my prayers in the taxi but never in a public space.
As a young reporter I had seen people spread prayer mats on the floor of the trains and others making way for them. But I have also seen what has happened in various places in NCR over Friday prayer. The ruckus, the shudhi.
So I decided to test the waters. In a female compartment of a metro train, where I have seen women chanting out from prayer books, watching OTT, reading books, eating their lunches and brunches. So offering namaz shouldn’t have been a problem. 
Once decided I somehow did not feel brave enough. I threw my dupatta around myself like a chadar. All the hand movements were under the dupatta . 
A woman next to me realised what I was doing didn’t react. No one even seemed to notice. In between prayers while I was saying my dua, I did notice a slightly older woman watching me continuously. As she realised I had noticed. She shifted seats and went to sit at a distance. God knows what made her shift. Since she was watching, may be she thought I would be uncomfortable, I don’t know what the reason was. Some people noticed chose to not pay much attention others didn’t even notice. The young crowd was too busy. So yes the experiment worked. 
I managed to pray and not get uncomfortable. Incase a situation like this arises will I pray again. Answer is Yes. Hate hasn’t taken very deep roots, hopefully.
