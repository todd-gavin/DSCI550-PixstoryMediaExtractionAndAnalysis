Marriage never comes with known repercussions it could be all good at times but messed up later So deciding it all earlier doesn t really make sense as anyone who chooses to get married never thinks of getting separated There s this love respect and care that brings anyone together so considering it as even an uncertainty will look futile to them Whatever happens in life is totally unpredictable and when someone reaches that point where they are left with nothing but getting separated they should do it Staying together may not be beneficial when your relationship is strained volatile or violent After all you could be all nice and happy faces in front of the kids but where will you hide those slamming of doors and noises of conflict at night During these times staying away is required and essential You can to some extent avoid putting your children into that custody chaos but where does the structural stability lie Creating a delusion would have far more ugly results than just making them witness the reality With time they ll comprehend and understand why the separation was necessary but staying in the ambience of abuse and fights will aggravate their psychological state of dissatisfaction and unhappiness So choosing to get separated while simultaneously making the splitting easier for your child would be a more mature idea Then they ll at least get time to understand both parents
