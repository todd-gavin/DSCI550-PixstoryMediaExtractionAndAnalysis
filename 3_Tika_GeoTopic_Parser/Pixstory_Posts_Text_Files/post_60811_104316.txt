Social media has influenced the life of each and every person be it a child or an adult Even thought it has numerous advantages the question remains whether it is good for our mental health or not According to me it is siginificantly affecting our mental health everyday Sometimes we forget that half of what we see on social media is not actually true What we see on social media is not the reality The main problem arises when we start comparing ourselves with others When that happens we can get caught in the circle of self doubt insecurity and much more The bigger problem arises when we fail to step back and recognize how unfair and unrealisitc these comparisons are So redirect yourself to the things that really matter If you can see that your mental health is getting affected because of this DO SOMETHING Try to ser limits for social media Focus on the real world and the things that actually make you happy Moreover assess where the negative comparisons are stemming from Put yourself first and respect your time Do more of what you love And always remember social media doesn t define anything
