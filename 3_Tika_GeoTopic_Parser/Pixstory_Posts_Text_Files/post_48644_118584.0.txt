I've heard it all my life that parents are strict so they can protect their kids, make them grateful.

But do they actually do it?

I have never seen one kid with strict parents in the best of their mental health. They have such low self esteem and negligible self worth. Let's not even start about those children having to lie to their parents all the time either because they know or at least fear thay their parents would never understand their situation.

And while the lying looks like it's children's fault, it isn't really. They're just kids trying to navigate through the world in best of their abilities. It's the parents that failed to build that trust.

Such parents tend to often victim blame kids for getting into trouble, and out of fear, the kids refrain from sharing with them what's going on in their lives. It's sad, really. I've seen so many young kids not tell their parents about the harrassment they've faced.

Many times such parents resort to corporal punishment, which is literally a federal crime.
