The purpose could be different, but what most people think before joining the gym is becoming fit.
And fitness is not about building muscles or just completely working on toning. It is more about looking into the internal aspects.
And the worst part about the gym is the time constraints and, obviously, the place.
If you miss your gym after some time, it will affect your workout and the whole body, but that never happens with yoga.
Instead, it could be peacefully done anywhere, even if you're travelling or at a different place; you don't need to hover around to find a place with heavy equipment.
Sometimes situations like distance, the weather, or other issues don't allow you to go to the gym, and there is the fall because even bunking your gym for some days will affect the entire process.
Whereas a yoga session doesnâ€™t require you to spend much money attending. There are yoga groups in different cities and free events. Plus, you can always check out videos and start following along since yoga is beginner-friendly, except for Power Yoga.
