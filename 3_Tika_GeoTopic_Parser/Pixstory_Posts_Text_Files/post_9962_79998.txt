 I am a land drowning in sorrow I m hungry I m very hungry like a baby whose mother is dead In fact hunger is my other name I do not know how many years I have been dying in bed with a hungry stomach and a wounded soul But by blowing my dawn I bloom I grow With the intense heat of the sun my heart faints I can not walk I can not speak I can prepare myself to face the dark night Because by giving birth at night my hunger expands I m not just hungry The whole city is caught in a storm of desolation Many sleep their children in anger to forget the sorrow of the bread But tomorrow with the dawn of the dawn the sorrowful ones again seize the miserable souls of the hungry I am a land devoid of peace the cradle of bloody revolutions massacres the birthplace of political prostitutes those who have sold the map of the homeland One should not wait for Hugo to be born to create Jeanne Valjean Or Heinrich Bell the narrator of The Bread of Youth No one comes and will not come Because hunger has taken over everywhere When Jean Valjean steals bread for satisfying his hunger he is sentenced to nineteen years in prison This is the fate of the extinction of humanity When the hungry wake up light hurts the wide openings of darkness In the words of Shamloo I will speak from your warm hands words sorrow for bread if it leaves People travel to the skies we still think of the one piece paintings on the moon s front One should be afraid of the warrior wave of the hungry It is the hungry who fertilize revolutions
