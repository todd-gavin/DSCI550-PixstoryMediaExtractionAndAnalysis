President Joe Biden announced on Thursday that he plans to designate Colombia as a key non-NATO friend, a move that will assist the Latin American country in areas including as defence, economic, and security cooperation. 

Biden made the statement while meeting Colombian President Ivan Duque for the first time at the White House. The visit comes after Biden administration officials met with Nicolás Maduro's Marxist government in neighbouring Venezuela, which has tense relations with both the US and Colombia, over the weekend.

U.S News reported that in order to avoid an embarrassing moment, neither Biden nor Duque mentioned the US-Venezuela meeting in public. Colombia is a key ally of the United States, and Duque leads the regional opposition to Maduro. 

Biden stated that he wants to bring Colombia into NATO. 

“That's exactly what you are, a major, major non-NATO ally, and this is a recognition of the unique and close relationship between our countries," he told Duque, who sat directly across from the president at a large table in the Cabinet Room, each leader joined by a small group of advisers.

"Colombia is the lynchpin, in my view, to the whole hemisphere,“ Biden said.

Biden's announcement, according to Duque, recognised "values and ideals" that both Western Hemisphere countries share.
