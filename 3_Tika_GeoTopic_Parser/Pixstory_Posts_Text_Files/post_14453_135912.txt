A team led by Dr Graham Hatfull from the University of Pittsburgh engineered phages to be more efficient at killing bacterial cells These were successfully used to treat a teenager with a life threatening antibiotic resistant infection after a lung transplant The teen required drugs to suppress her immune system because of the transplant This immunosuppression prevented her immune system from making antibodies that might have neutralized the phages before they killed the bacteria In a new case study researchers led by Drs Jerry Nick and Rebecca Davidson from National Jewish Health tested phage therapy in a year old man with advanced cystic fibrosis and a severe multidrug resistant Mycobacterium abscessus lung infection Hatfull s group screened a panel of phages for candidates that could kill the specific strain of M abscessus infecting the patient The patient received twice daily infusions of the engineered phages along with antibiotics Results from the study which was funded in part by NIH were published on May in Cell After about a year of phage therapy there was no evidence of ongoing M abscessus infection in cultured lung samples By the eighth month of treatment the patient s immune system had recognized and produced antibodies capable of neutralizing one of the phages However the other remained active With his M abscessus infection cleared the patient underwent a successful lung transplant The team found no evidence of M abscessus in the removed lungs or in the new lungs several months after transplant The patient remained on phage therapy at the time the results were published at days of treatment He has since been able to stop taking both antibiotics and phage In another study an international team led by Hatfull provided phage therapy for compassionate use in people with life threatening antibiotic resistant infections Most of the patients had cystic fibrosis and M abscessus infections For of them only a single type of phage was found that could likely kill their specific bacteria For the nine others the researchers identified two or more potentially useful phages Sources
