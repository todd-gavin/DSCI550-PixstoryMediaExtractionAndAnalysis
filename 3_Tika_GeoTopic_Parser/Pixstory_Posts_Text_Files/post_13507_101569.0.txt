Oklahoma State is hosting 1,800 Afghan refugees for the first time. NGOs have sought to accommodate newly arrived asylum seekers by establishing a special center for Afghans.

The state is located in the southern part of the central United States and has never had a significant Afghan community before.

Some Afghan refugees who came to the United States after the Taliban took control of their country on August 15, 2021, have been resettled in the state.
 "With the withdrawal of the United States from Afghanistan, our governor said he would be happy if Afghans came to this state. He says he was surprised to hear that the governor is a conservative," the Oklahoma Islamic Council executive director told Arab News.

"We now have the third new Afghan population in the United States, after California and Texas."

Afghan refugees can receive legal services and other assistance from the center.
