In the Apalazzo Gallery exhibition space in the center of Brescia, in the sixteenth-century frescoed rooms of an elegant building, the colorful and kitsch sculptures of the Mexican artist explode Anthropoform shapes covered with feathers and plastic beads in the name of the most holy camp typical of the ballrooms of the LGBTQ community Among references spiritual and folkloristic of the native cults of the artist abruptly interrupts the legitimization of the bad taste of excess and accumulation The unknown and perhaps only once human figures are dressed in embroidered garments that testify to the transformation from the real to the fantastic All decorated and when the light hits the fake crystals and the beads with which we used to make bracelets and necklaces as children, close and ancestral memories are rekindled in a confused and overwhelming dialogue
