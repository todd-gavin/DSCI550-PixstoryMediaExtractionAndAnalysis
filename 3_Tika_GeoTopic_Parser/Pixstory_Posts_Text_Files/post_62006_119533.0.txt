Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is only a few months away from closing out Phase 4 of the MCU in dramatic fashion. Part of that drama will include the introduction of Namor the Sub-Mariner, bringing Marvel Studios its own underwater hero similar to Jason Momoa's Aquaman from the DC universe.

Even with both Namor and Aquaman boasting similar powers, Marvel's aquatic warrior is a unique hero who stands on his own amongst the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and more. Falling more into the category of anti-hero than full superhero, Namor is known as quite the egomaniac who will stop at nothing to protect his people - and he's also one of Marvel's earliest mutants from the comics.

Of course, there is one outstanding issue that brings back comparisons between him and Arthur Curry: the two are both known as the kings of their respective Atlantis. Thankfully, upon Namor's introduction in Black Panther 2, fans may now have an idea of how the MCU will change that to bring more of a distinction to this new character.

Hasbro Pulse revealed a listing for an action figure of Namor the Sub-Mariner from Marvel Studios' Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.

This figure came with a description that reveals a major change to Namor's backstory from the comics for his MCU debut. On the big screen, he'll be the ruler of a nation called Talocan, an underwater civilization, instead of his usual kingdom of Atlantis.

While this isn't based on anything specifically from Marvel Comics, the name is similar to a place from Aztec legend called Tlālōcān, which is known as the culture's paradise for those who have died by drowning or lightning.
