The final seven episodes of "Ozark" will be released on April 29, finishing up the story of a couple, played by Jason Bateman and Laura Linney (Marty and Wendy Byrde), whose family relocates to Missouri and slips deeper and deeper into a life of money laundering, narcotics, and murder. 

Abc News reported that although Tom Pelphrey (Ben) is no longer on the show, his character has left an indelible mark. Pelphrey's character first appeared in Season 3 as Wendy's younger brother. Ben had bipolar disorder and had stopped taking his medication. He was a tortured soul with a golden heart. His unstable actions as a result put the Byrde's underworld operation in jeopardy.

“As an actor, there’s nothing you want more or there’s nothing more than having good material," said Pelphrey recently over Zoom. “I’d had weeks to prepare, so I memorized it back and forth and up and down, and I knew it as good as I knew my name. We did that speech so many different times in so many different ways and each time they would just let me go.”
