The NFL Pro Bowl, the All-Star game featuring the best football players in the NFL Facing off against one another, has officially been replaced with the Pro Bowl Games, a multi day event, where the best players in the league, showcase their skills and play a game of flag football.This change comes in the wake of the Pro bowl becoming less of a display of the leagues, best talent, and more of an embarrassing, exhibition, match or players, take it easy for fear of injuring themselves and tiring themselves out for their next games to win a pointless game. This is unlike the MLB All-Star game, for example, where the league that wins the game gets home field advantage in the World Series.This new change of pace seems like a welcomed opportunity for fans to see the most talent coming from the best players and seeing just how good they really are through skills competitions while also reducing the chance of injury and exhaustion.
