In the latest press event of the movie “Attack,” a journalist asked the question to Jacqueline Fernandez, How was your experience of working with John Abraham and Rakul Preet Singh in this action-packed movie? 

To that Jacqueline replied, It’s amazing as you know I worked with John in four movies already and if I talk about Rakul, actually we didn’t share a single frame in the movie but I hope that in “Attack 2,” we have some scenes together. 

Another question was asked to Rakul Preet Singh, Your character in the movie is a Scientist, so what type of Research or preparation you did do to pull off this character? 

Rakul Preet Singh replied to this question by saying that, Most of the Research was done by our intelligent director, he understood everything about the technology he used in the movie, my preparation for the role was to learn to use the machine perfectly and how to pronounce the technical words and Lakshya showed some clips to help me to observe the body language of the scientists.
