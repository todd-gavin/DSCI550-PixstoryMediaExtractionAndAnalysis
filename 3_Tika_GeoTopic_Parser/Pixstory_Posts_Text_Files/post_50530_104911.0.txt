The bounty of the earth is not inexhaustible. Driven by greed, we abuse the earth’s resource.🤕

Life isn’t all about grab-grab, waste-waste, though frankly that’s just the way we like it.🙅 This planet and all the wonderful things nature has created, belongs to us all. This world is miraculous in its infinite beauty and variety✨

The problems of global warming, climate change and rapid degeneration of the environment can seem too vast and overwhelming for us to contemplate. Yet, if we are aware and alert, as individuals we can work towards urging communities and nations to adopt proactive measures to protect the earth and move towards healthier, low-carbon societies.

Together, we can help mobilise public opinion within the community towards a change for the better. As aware and alert consumers, we can insist on buying products from businesses that have plans to sustain the environment; treat effluents before releasing them into the ecosystem, and invest in renewable energy.

 We must do our homework and ask questions.💁
