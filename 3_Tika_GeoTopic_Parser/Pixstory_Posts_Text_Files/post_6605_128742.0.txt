A video of a group of children performing a play onstage has been circulating widely on social media. In the 30-second clip, a boy removes the crown from a sari-clad girl’s head. Next, another female student standing nearby places a white cloth over her head. After this, all the children including the girl in the sari start praying namaz. While sharing this clip many are claiming that in a school in Lucknow namaz is being offered after the removal of the crown from Bharat Mata’s (Mother India’s) head. 

Sudarshan News tweeted the video and wrote, “Bharat ma’s (Mother India’s) crown removed, and has been replaced with hijab.”

It reads, “We have received a video through social media, in which a girl has been told to offer namaz after others remove the crown from her head. When we investigated the video, we found that it was recorded at the Shishu Bhartiya Vidyalaya in Malviya Nagar, Thana Bazar Khala.
