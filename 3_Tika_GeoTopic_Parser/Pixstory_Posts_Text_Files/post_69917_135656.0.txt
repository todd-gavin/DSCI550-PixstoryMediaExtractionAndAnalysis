The suspense action-thriller Ek Villain Return, released on July 29, 2022, received mixed reviews from critics and viewers, who enjoyed the movie for its unusual plot and exciting twists and turns.

The Mohit Suri-directed film will soon be available for OTT streaming for those unable to see it in theatres.
Netflix will start streaming the movie starting on September 9, 2022. The film is a spiritual successor to Mohit's suspense thriller Ek Villain from 2014, which stars Sidharth Malhotra and Shraddha Kapoor as two lovers whose lives are turned upside down when Riteish Deshmukh, the villain, kills Shraddha's character.

The movie was unofficially remade from the Korean thriller "I Saw The Devil".
Leading parts in the movie go to John Abraham, Arjun Kapoor, Disha Patani, and Tara Sutaria.
Rakesh Mahadkar terrorised Mumbai for eight years before a new serial killer was born. More deadly and brutal, yet still using the Smiley Mask as a disguise.

The tale of two guys in one-sided love is found in Ek Villain Returns. Who is the Hero and the Villain depends on the pathways they take to complete their love stories.
