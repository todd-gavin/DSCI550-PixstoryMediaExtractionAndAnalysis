While one of these articles doesn’t have the name of its respective publisher or a date, this didn’t stop social media users from sharing this image over several platforms.

Fact Check

One of the viral articles has the watermark of पत्रिका टुडे and was published on the 14th of July 2018. पत्रिका टुडे was found to be an inactive WordPress website. The article in question contains an embedded tweet from the 14th of July itself which has an image of a newspaper report headlined “बंगाल में मुस्लिम व्यसायियों के लिए कर भरेगी राज्य सरकार” (Translation: State government will pay tax for Muslim traders in Bengal)

The report claims that Dr. Amit Mitra, the then finance minister of West Bengal, has stated that the state government would take steps to pay the GST for the Muslim traders belonging to West Bengal as they have been adversely affected by the implementation of this tax. The report also claims that the Mamata Banerjee-led government would open offices that would help the Muslim traders with the filing of taxes.

The authenticity of the news report cannot be established since the name of the newspaper is not visible in the image. We tried reaching out to the Twitter user who had originally uploaded this image, but they did not revert to our messages. We also tried keyword-searching the headline but we could not find any article with the same headline. One conspicuous feature of this article is that the word “व्यवसायियों” in the headline has been misspelled- something that is not commonly seen in mainstream newspapers.
