Jordi Alba has equaled Guillermo Amor's record of 421 appearances for FC Barcelona after making his 421st game against Levante. 

Alba joined current teammates Gerard Pique and Sergio Busquets, as well as former teammate Lionel Messi, on the top ten list of La Blaugrana players with the most appearances.

On Sunday night, the left-back marked the occasion by assisting Luuk de Jong's late goal in Barcelona's 3-2 victory. Alba returned to Barcelona in 2012 after being discharged as a kid and has since become a key player for the Catalan giants.

Tito Vilanova, Tata Martino, Luis Enrique, Ernesto Valverde, Quique Setien, Ronald Koeman, and now Xavi have all used the technically gifted Spaniard. Alba has also won trophies, including five La Liga titles, a Champions League, and five Copa del Reys. He was a part of the club that won 286, drew 76, and lost 59 games throughout his 421 games with FC Barcelona.

The former teammate and present boss says he wants to make his former teammate and current boss pleased. Jordi Alba claims that the recent appointment of Xavi as manager has given Barcelona "extra motivation" to play well, with the left-back eager to honour the club legend. Alba also commended Xavi's training methods, which included fun activities at the beginning of each session.
