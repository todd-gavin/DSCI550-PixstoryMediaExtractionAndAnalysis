Much like the myth of misandry the myth of reverse racism exists too Now what is reverse racism Reverse racism is the belief that just like white people can be racist to people of color people of color can be racist to white people as well It is usually brought up in the arguments where BIPoC are demanding their rights or reparations The topic of reverse racism most frequently comes up during the conversation of Black Lives Matter However it s far from being the same just because of the fact that it is not institutionalized What does that mean Despite making up less than percent of the population Black people accounted for nearly percent of the over deadly police shootings by since according to the Washington Post police shootings database Police fatally shoot unarmed black people in the US is more than three times as high as it is for white people Although black drivers were statistically less likely to be carrying illegal things they were checked up to twice as often as white drivers Despite having similar rates of marijuana use black persons were times more likely than their white counterparts to be arrested for marijuana possession White people it s not about you You are not being threatened everyday of your life for your skin color So probably take a step back and do not be another hurdle in black people s fight for equality This attention craving needs to stop You need to join the fight and that would be the bare minimum
