Most elderly adults think of youth as arrogant, careless and opinionated and immature. Well, you are wrong, don't have prejudices in today's youth. Porn studies should have been initiated porn long ago. This failure may have reflected the sometimes furious contemporary debate within feminists between those viewing pornography as liberating and those who saw it as epitomising and bolstering phallocratic oppression.

‌By introducing it into studies we can experience a total change in the field of pornography. Porn has this immoral tag as its studies are considered disgusting. Consider it as any other field, we study astrophysics, gender studies or sexology. When we study violent crime and war we don't seem to promote it but analyse it. Why can't we accept porn studies? Its roots in the immorality attributed to sex and related acceptance- the same prejudice we do when we consider sex work as a sin! When we undermine porn studies we promote racist, sexist and unrealistic porn. Studies are here to make a change and analyse its problems and issues. If porn doesn't matter or is the last priority in studies why wouldn't you ban it after all? If porn exists there must be a discipline for its studies and its regulation. I mean even if it is banned altogether we would need some archives as it was a phenomenon that existed like any other culture!

‌The only way to address the problems in pornography is to investigate it. How does it impact our unified understanding of masculinity and femininity, does it oversee the promotion of unhealthy ideals, negatively impact our sense of self, body image, relationships, and so forth.
