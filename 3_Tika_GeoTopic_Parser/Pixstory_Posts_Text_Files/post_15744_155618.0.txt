For many like me, the channel already died almost a decade ago when it started making shit, scrapping off the classics. I'll remember cartoon network for what it was not for what it became!!
Anyways, listing some of the OG shows and my favs:
1. The Flintstones
2. Popeye
3. Scooby Doo
4. Tom and Jerry
5. The Powerpuff Girls
6. Dexter's Laboratory
7. Courage the cowardly dog
8. Ed, Edd and Eddy
Thank you Cartoon Network for bringing smiles and joy back in the day :)
Those were the best days of our lives...
Do leave your thoughts on this in the notes section and your favourite show on CN.
