I know it s a topic for giggles and laughters for many but the Creation is no joke It did happen you agree or you don t Last thursdayism or anything of that sort is only a poor attempt at countering that God created the heavens and the earth in six days in the beginning The numerous things that God made are contained within these days God rested on the seventh day after completing six days of creation Why is the seventh day regarded as the day of creation Because God designated the seventh day as a holy day Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing so on the seventh day he rested from all his work Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done Genesis God began by extending himself and sending his energy forth Everything in the universe including water is formed of light He created day and night by separating light and dark on the first day On the second day God created an expanse or as some translations call it a firmament The firmament separates the Earth from the heavens On the third day God achieved two distinct things The separation of land and water is one example The second task was to create vegetation On the third day God saw that it was good life as we know it started God created the Sun Moon and Stars on the fourth day God produced more life on the fifth day He thinks it s good once more This time however he adds something new He created birds and swarms to fly and swim On the sixth day of creation it became much better God created all kinds of animals as well as everything that creeps on the earth and considers them to be good On the seventh day God declared his entire creation to be very good and retired to his rest
