FC Zurich Arsenal Match Review Arsenal started their Europa League campaign as they mean to go on after a narrow victory against their Swiss opponents Arsenal started the game slowly but improved as the game went on A sloppy pass left Turner being pressed and giving the ball away with the finish went just wide After holding their own defensively the Swiss side were caught out on the counter A lovely ball down the channels from Vieira to Nketiah who put a lovely ball for Marquinhos who made no mistake with a stunning top corner finish after great pace to get on the end of it Arsenal continued probing but wasting opportunities was apparent again Marquinhos s brilliant movement again found himself free in the right position despite a scuffed finish just before the goal His pace directness strength in swinging crosses caused all sorts of problems for Zurich Vieira had a delicate chip just over the bar Arsenal generally just continued dominated the game advancing on with their impressive performances in the season After a pretty safe first half Arsenal conceded from the spot before HT A corner Arsenal failed to deal with which eventually led to Nketiah following through his man not the best awareness but a typical strikers challenge Kryeziu converted sending Turner the wrong way A minute of silence commenced with Black Armbands at HT after the Queen s extremely saddening passing Arsenal continued their theme of domination throughout the second half but once again didn t make their chances count such as Martinelli s volley just lacking the final product That was before an exquisite cross from debutant Marquinhos who was my MOTM evading the defender finding Nketiah for a good airborne finish past the keeper Brilliant movement to create the chance too A good start for the Gunners who ll feel frustrated they didn t make life a lot easier for themselves by taking advantage of their dominance but a comfortable away win to kick off the groups with a lot of changes can only be a good thing
