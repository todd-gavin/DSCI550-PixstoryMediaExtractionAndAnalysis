People are losing faith in democracy throughout the Western Hemisphere.

Across North, Central and South America, and parts of the Caribbean, only 63% of the public expressed support for democracy in 2021. This is a main takeaway from the most recent AmericasBarometer surveys we have conducted every other year: Support for democracy has declined by almost 10 percentage points since 2004.

The 2021 round – which encompassed 64,352 interviews of voting-age adults in nationally representative surveys across 22 countries in North, Central and South America and the Caribbean – offers important insights into what’s driving declining support for democracy in the region.

And it points to a possible explanation for the growth of support for authoritarian leadership in places like the United States, Peru and El Salvador.

Distrust in electoral politics

This waning support for democracy, which has parallels in other parts of the world, is alarming. Research has shown that mass support for democracy increases its odds of survival.

What is eroding democracy’s appeal?

A growing number of people view their elections, and their elected representatives, as flawed and untrustworthy.

On average, about 3 in 5 adults in the region think most or all politicians are involved in corruption. These views, however, vary quite a bit across countries. In Peru, 88% of citizens believe that most or all of their politicians are corrupt. Only 20% of Canadians feel that way about their leaders.

When asked to what extent they trust elections in their country, only 2 in 5 adults in the region gave a positive response. And in most of the countries we survey, less than half of all adults believe that votes are always counted correctly.
