Darkness is a defeat, 
The promise I'll keep. 
My power will only bring light, 
Set me free, open my sight.
Hear my voice, 
hear my vow,
The time to start my journey is now. 
Restore to me what is rightfully mine, 
A power that will brightly shine.
I call upon the light, the power, 
To shine throughout the darkest hour. 
Set me free from this bind, 
Let me see, don't leave me blind.
Hidden secrets, no more lies,
 Reveal what the magic spies. 
Let me see, open my eyes, 
My magic will only make you wise.
Mysteries to discover, Miles to cover. 
Make this unwanted war be over. 
Set me free. 
I'll keep my promise FOREVER.
