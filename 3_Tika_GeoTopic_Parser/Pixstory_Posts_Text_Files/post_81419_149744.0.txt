It’s time to have your say on who should be crowned our Player of the Month for September!While we may have only played three times during the month, there were still plenty of standout moments as we head into October still on top of the Premier League table, and winning our opening game of the Europa League.So who will walk away with the prize? Have your say by analysing our contenders and voting below:➡️ 𝐆𝐚𝐛𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐥 𝐉𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐬Having been crowned August’s Player of the Month, Jesus is looking to claim back-to-back awards to continue his impressive start to life at Emirates Stadium. He featured in all three games in September, with the highlight coming when he netted a fantastic header against Brentford in our last outing.➡️ 𝐁𝐮𝐤𝐚𝐲𝐨 𝐒𝐚𝐤𝐚Another player who featured three times was the England man, who started the month with a goal at Old Trafford. He would also claim two assists against Brentford via a perfect corner for William Saliba’s opener and then some direct running that carved out a shooting chance for Fabio Vieira.➡️ 𝐅𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐨 𝐕𝐢𝐞𝐢𝐫𝐚Speaking of the Portuguese midfielder, it’s been quite a month for the 22-year-old. After coming off the bench against Manchester United to make his debut for us, Vieira then impressed in his first start against FC Zurich, and then followed that up with his maiden goal in our colours courtesy of a thumping drive against the Bees.➡️ 𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐭 𝐗𝐡𝐚𝐤𝐚The Swiss midfielder featured in every minute of the three games, wearing the captain’s armband for two of them which brought victories in his homeland and west London. He also provided a delicious pass to set up Jesus’ goal against Brentford as he continued to show his impressive qualities in a more advanced role.So who gets your vote? Have your say using notes!
