Women's football has grown dramatically in recent years, inspiring many other women to
pursue careers in the sport. It has also helped women overcome their fear of being judged in
society around the world.
Football has given women a platform to showcase their talent, and many fans around theworld are more interested in watching women's football. Its trajectory has only risen, with somany fans coming to watch games in stadiums.
England women won the European Championship recently; something men haven't wonsince 1966.
And since then, support has grown exponentially, as have expectations. Women's footballhas come a long way from an empty stadium to a fully packed stadium. We take a look atthe top five women's football matches where stadium tickets were sold out.
