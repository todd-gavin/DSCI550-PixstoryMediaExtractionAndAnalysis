LeBron James is now worth a billion dollars. According to Forbes, the Los Angeles Lakers star is worth $1 billion, making him the first active NBA player to join the billionaire club. 

News portals reported that Michael Jordan, who got that name 11 years after retiring when his interest in the Charlotte Hornets climbed to 89.5 percent in 2014, is the only other basketball player worth ten figures. 

According to Forbes, while James has earned more than $385 million in pretax compensation throughout his 19-year NBA career, he has amassed the majority of his fortune off the court through some shrewd business manoeuvres in recent years. Those investments helped him reach the anticipated $1 billion mark, which he only recently passed.

Interestingly, What's even more incredible is James manifested this milestone after saying he wanted to become a billionaire in a 2014 interview with GQ.

"If it happens. It’s my biggest milestone. Obviously. I want to maximize my business. And if I happen to get it, if I happen to be a billion-dollar athlete, ho. Hip hip hooray! Oh, my God, I’m gonna be excited."
