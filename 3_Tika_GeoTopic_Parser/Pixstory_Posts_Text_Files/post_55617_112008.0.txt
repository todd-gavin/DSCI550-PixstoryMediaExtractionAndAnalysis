There are more than 2,000 species of spider in Australia and a few of them are dangerous to humans. All spiders have venom glands, and some species have fangs large enough to puncture the skin and cause a reaction.

As per NW, the first spider bite death recorded in Australia since 1981 was in 2016. However, approximately 2,000 people are bitten every year by redback spiders. An effective anti-venom for redback spiders was introduced in 1956, and funnel-web spider anti-venom has been given to at least 100 patients since it was developed in 1980.

Some spiders you need to watch out for in Australia include the Redback Spider and Funnel Web Spider!

Redback spiders are related to the North American widow spiders and these black and red beauties (sometimes orange too) like to hide away from the world in dark secluded spots such as letterboxes, under ledges, outdoor furniture, around bbqs and other hiding places; often decorated with sticky haphazard webs.

On the other hand, funnel webs aren't big fans of daylight so will hide away, with shoes and clothing being a known favourite hang out spot or in a small web-lined burrow outdoors. They can become aggressive if disturbed, often forming a characteristic strike pose with their front legs in the air and large fangs on show. 

Funnel web spider habitat extends primarily along the east coast of Australia, with summer being peak activity season. Sometimes these spiders are found in swimming pools.

So, if you are visiting Australia, watch out!
