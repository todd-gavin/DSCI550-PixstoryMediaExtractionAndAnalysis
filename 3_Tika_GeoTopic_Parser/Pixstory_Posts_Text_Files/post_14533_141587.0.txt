ðŸ‘‰Quit smoking. 
If you don't smoke, then it is well and good. But try to avoid exposure to secondhand smoke, which also can damage blood vessels.
ðŸ‘‰Always try to maintain a healthy diet. 
Opt for whole grains, fruits and vegetables, low-fat or fat-free dairy products, and lean meats. Avoid saturated or trans fats, added sugars, and high amounts of salt.
ðŸ‘‰Exercise is the best option.

If you're overweight, losing even a few pounds can lower heart disease risks. Ask your health care provider what weight is best for you.
ðŸ‘‰Try to relieve stress.
Stress can cause the arteries to tighten, which can increase the risk of heart disease, particularly coronary microvascular disease. 
ðŸ‘‰Avoid or limit alcohol. 
If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.
ðŸ‘‰Follow your treatment plan. 
Take medications as prescribed, such as blood pressure medications, blood thinners and aspirin.
ðŸ‘‰Manage other health conditions. 
High blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes increase the risk of heart disease so always engage in those activities that will help you to stay away from such clinical conditions.
