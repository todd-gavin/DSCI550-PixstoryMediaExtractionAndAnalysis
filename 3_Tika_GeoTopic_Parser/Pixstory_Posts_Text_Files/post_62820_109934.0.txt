This book is stressful, challenging and difficult yet incredibly insightful and significant. Since the end of World War II, attitudes toward unintended pregnancies, pregnancies out of wedlock, and decisions to have, bear, and raise children have changed significantly, according to Solinger's history of reproduction in America.

This book breaks the flawed perception of America being the greatest country ever.

Solinger does a great job of highlighting the ways in which white, middle-class mothers are idealised to the point of infantilization, while poor mothers of every color are manipulated and graded in entirely different ways. Another thing that's great about this book is it is told from a very intersectional point of view. It's a great and a heartbreaking, infuriating read on how people who are fertile, and women who aren't, have been oppressed in this country.
