The healing power of written words has stayed with people since ancient times.
Writing can calm someone; it is a therapeutic method to manage emotions.

It is found that people often tend to suppress their emotions and traumatic events as it takes a lot to say it all, but the writing could be helpful here; people can put everything they want either in their journal or even a digital notebook.
Studies suggest that bottled-up emotions cause stress, and purging it all out is necessary; writing can help it as it is a safe and confidential way of putting it all out.

Moreover, writing helps people know about themselves, their thoughts and emotions. We acknowledge our behaviour, feelings, values and motivation. 
Rereading what you have written can give you a more profound insight into your traits and emotions.

Few studies have even suggested that writing can help in better functioning of our immune system, improved liver function, and strengthened memory.
Surprisingly, writing therapy treats severe mental health conditions like Posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression and even bereavement.
So it is a panacea for all the problems.
