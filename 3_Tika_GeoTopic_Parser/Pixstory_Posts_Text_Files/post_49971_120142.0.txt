The Democrat Dean Phillips said he doesn't think Joe Biden should run for president in 2024. He had made this public statement. 

"I have respect for Joe Biden ... despite some mistakes and some missteps despite his age, I think he’s a man of decency, of good principle, of compassion, of empathy, and of strength," Phillips said in a radio interview on WCCO’s "The Chad Hartman Show" when asked if he wants Biden, 79, to run again.

"But to answer your question directly, which I know is quite rare, Chad, no, I don't," he said. "I think the country would be well served by a new generation of compelling, well-prepared, dynamic Democrats to step up."

He was asked if he would support other lawmakers who share this view to publically put forward this statement- he said that most democrats agree with him that it's time for a new crop of leaders.

"I think Joe Biden has served our country admirably with principle and with decency at a time when we surely needed it," he said. "But I am part of a caucus here in Congress where three top leaders are over 80 years old, where the president will be over 80 in the next election. And I think it's time for a generational change. I'm not too shy to say that I do believe that most of my colleagues feel the same way."
