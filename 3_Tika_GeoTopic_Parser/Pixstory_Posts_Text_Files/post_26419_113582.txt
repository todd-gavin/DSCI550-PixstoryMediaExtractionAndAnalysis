Maria Grazia Chiuri at Dior has been making the same collection for years now What the storytelling that she sticks on it changes every season She builds around tulle dresses and a reinterpretation of embroidered bar jackets a different meaning every time as if people didn&#39;t notice that the cuts and the colors are always the same This time she decides with a strategic move suitable for Barbara d Urso&#39;s TV of pain to talk about Ukraine Helped by the artist Olesia Trofymenko who collaborated with the maison for the creation of the embroideries and the decoration of the venue she pretended so that this couture had something different to say or rather that it had something to say But these are dresses with a folkloric flavor and structured jackets like a twentieth-century governess that do not speak of the world we live in, much less of the situation in Ukraine
