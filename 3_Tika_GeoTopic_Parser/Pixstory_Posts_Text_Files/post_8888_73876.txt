Prime Minister of Kashmir continues As regards the other question I have not personally as a matter of fact invited any political party or its leader to meet me so far but I met Sheikh Abdulla by chance only and I am willing to meet the other parties or their leaders Q Are the Government willing to release the Muslim Conference leaders A I am not in a position to answer that I have taken over only an hour back Q You have said you will solve important problems like food econonomic conditions and many other things Kashmir is a very cold country We expect snowfall in December I think you are already aware that J V Road is almost closed and the only other route available i e B C Road gets closed sometime during December and we are bottled up right up to April All the traders here used to collect goods during October and November but we have had difficulties and our information is that they have not been able to get things here Do you feel certain that within the little time that is at your disposal you will be able to transport all necessities of life which Kashmir needs i e at least lacs of people living in Kashmir will need for full four months supply of sugar salt wheat cloth etc A My answer is simple I can work no wonders Whatever has happened in the past cannot be undone All that I can say is that immediately when I came I asked the Deputy Prime Minister of India whether he could arrange carrier planes as far as possible to bring necessities here and take out the surplus stores The other thing I am trying to do is to keep the B C Road open as long as possible and at the same time if we can arrange for petrol we shall get as many trucks as possible from wherever we can find them by borrowing or taking on hire to do our best in this direction To be continued
