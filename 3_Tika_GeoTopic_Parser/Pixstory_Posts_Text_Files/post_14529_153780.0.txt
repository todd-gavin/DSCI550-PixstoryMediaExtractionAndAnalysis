Having healthy teeth can take a lifetime of care. It is crucial to take the right steps every day to take care of the teeth and prevent problems. It involves getting the right oral care products and being mindful of our daily habits. 
Here are some tips to follow for a better dental hygiene 
Don’t go to bed without brushing your teeth 
We know the general recommendation is to brush twice a day. And still many of us neglect to brush our teeth at night. Brushing before bed gets rid of the germs and plaque that accumulates throughout the day. 
Brush properly 
It is important to brush your teeth rightly, and if you don't its almost as bad as not brushing at all. Take good time and move the toothbrush in gentle, circular motions to remove plaque. 
Don’t neglect your tongue 
Plaque can also build up on our tongue. This doesn't just lead one to bad mouth odor, but it can also lead to other oral health problems. 
Use a fluoride toothpaste 
While we look into whitening power and flavours in the toothpaste, it's more important to look into fluoride content in the paste. 
Treat flossing as important as brushing 
Many of us brush but we often forget about flossing. Flossing not only just gets the little pieces of food or broccoli that could get stuck in between the teeth, its also a way to stimulate the gums, reduce plaque and help lower inflammation in that area. 
Flossing once in a day is good to get these benefits.
