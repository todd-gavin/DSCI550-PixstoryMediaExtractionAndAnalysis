The Solomon Islands' security agreement with China has turned Australia's election campaign into a foreign policy struggle over Canberra's difficult relationship with the Pacific. 

Channel News Asia reported that Australia's Liberal government, together with its friend the United States, pushed hard against the Solomons joining the deal, but neither succeeded in convincing Honiara otherwise. 

The full text isn't available yet, but a leaked copy sent shockwaves through the region last month, notably passages that would authorise Chinese naval deployments in the Solomon Islands, which are just around 2,000 kilometres from Australia. 

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been grilled on the campaign road ahead of the May 21 elections about his handling of the accord and his government's "Pacific Step-Up" agenda to boost ties with the area.

The issue erupted again on Friday, when Solomons Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare chastised Australia for its AUKUS security arrangement with the US and UK, claiming that he only learned of it from media reports.

He said the Pacific "should have been consulted to ensure this AUKUS treaty is transparent, since it will affect the Pacific family by allowing nuclear submarines in Pacific waters".
