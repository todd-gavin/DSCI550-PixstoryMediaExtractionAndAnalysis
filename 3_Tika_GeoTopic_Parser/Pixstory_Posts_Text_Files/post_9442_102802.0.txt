I am a bit sad thinking of the heydays of xyz Khans and Kapoors of Bollywood. Those were the times of wafer-thin commercial flicks. So, they loved and danced more onscreen assuming that’s the future. Charming stardom camouflaged them. Directors also chose the winning formulas sans brains and audience were on the same wavelength.

DNA of Bollywood scripts changed when a crop of new-gen directors came on board. Meaty scripts started demanding that big thing called potential acting. filmy romance and family melodramas soon found their exit. Many of the popular, chocolate faces and sexy figures disappeared from screens. But some put in admirable effort to pace themselves in the new race.

Yeah.. I am talking about Shahid Kapoor and his soulful acting in Jersey. How a previously ROM-COM actor has honed himself to this level of finesse made me write this. When Jab We Met was a success after a series of flops, a fair portion of credit was taken by Kareena, his co-star in this film. But Udta Punjab explored his potential in a new avatar. Another biggest opener, Kabir Singh lost in translation, though. There may be films I missed, let me know.

When I saw him as a withdrawn, incompetent cricketer in Jersey I really thought he is going through a tough phase in his personal life. His sad disposition hit me. Sort of restrained acting in every scene with essential emotions (not more, no less) makes it the best in his career. His love life, strained married life, the best father for his son, an obedient cricketer to his coach…Shahid was steady in essaying all. Lengthy, but I enjoyed his cricketer shots in this sports drama.

Jersey is a movie with a heart. Story has no frills. but a good script and minimal dialogs gave actors more space to act. Kinda ‘small is big’ feel. Arjun Talwar is going to stay with us ever. Hoping to see more talents from this proven actor.

Does that ring a bell for other Khans and Kapoors sitting at home?
