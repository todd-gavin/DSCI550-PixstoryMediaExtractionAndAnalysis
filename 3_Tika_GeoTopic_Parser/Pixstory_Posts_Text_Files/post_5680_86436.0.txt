All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), announced to field candidates on 100 seats in UP polls, has failed to open an account in the state.  

AIMIM leader and Hyderabad Lok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi had launched a new front, the Bhagidari Parivartan Morcha, comprising parties with a support base among Muslims, Other Backward Classes (OBCs), and Dalits for the upcoming Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh.

It is a political Alliance of AIMIM, Jan Adhikar Party of Babu Singh Kushwaha, Rashtriya Parivartan Morcha of Waman Meshram, Bahujan Mukti Party, Bhartiya Vanchit Samaj Party and Janata Kranti Party.
