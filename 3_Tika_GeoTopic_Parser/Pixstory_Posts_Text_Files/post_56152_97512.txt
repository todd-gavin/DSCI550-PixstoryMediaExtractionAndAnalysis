The sentence contradicts itself if everything can be forgiven why does blasphemy can t Can t God Holy Spirit accept criticism Doesn t the all knowing power know the intention or the cause behind it Mostly a believer speaks against God when after everything a religion wanted them to do like praying and all rituals still their problems aren t solved and in fact an utter tragedy happens If there is God they will definitely understand the situation behind it Moreover isn t this blasphemy predetermined by God These kinds of rules are just to keep the faith or the dominance of the figure of God intact so that people don t fall out of religion Some people speak out about the knowledge they have acquired They too have their own reasons Everything can be forgiven at times forgiveness doesn t matter people forget People apologize and act the same way People don t apologise we forgive them they still act the same Some people will apologize and change their behaviour The very basis of religion is weird because of the rules These unchanging rules control people s life Just imagine if all this was a huge joke to the people who put up religion and their intention was nothing but to put people through trouble and damage their mental health Religion injects fear Fear to do what people wish to do fear to live freely fear to love fear to sin fear to explore fear of God You have only one life forgive or better forget and move on with it Avoid those who don t match your vibes and go on with it In simple terms live your life without complications
