According to a 2013 report, here are some cases that explain just why people should be allowed to keep a gun:

On December 2nd, three or four armed robbers broke in a door and forced a woman to the floor at gunpoint while burglarizing her home in Yorkville, New York. Another neighbour, who had heard the ruckus from a bedroom, took a "long gun" and opened fire on the invaders, causing them to leave, according to police. During the shootout, the woman they had assaulted was wounded, but her injuries were not life-threatening.

A driver recognised a wanted murder suspect going down a rural road and held him at gunpoint until police came on Dec. 4, Alexander City, Alabama. A four-day manhunt had been conducted by the US Marshals Fugitive Task Force and local police for the culprit, who is accused of killing his girlfriend and her adolescent son.

Four armed intruders stormed into a home in Lacombe, Louisiana, on Dec. 8 and assaulted the homeowner, according to authorities. The homeowner was able to seize and fire his own weapon, killing two of the attackers and injuring the others, who are now facing a slew of felony charges. In the crossfire, the homeowner's 4-year-old daughter was hurt, but she is expected to recover fully.

People should be allowed to keep a gun to defend themselves in such life threatening situations, taking away that from them is cruel and wrong.
