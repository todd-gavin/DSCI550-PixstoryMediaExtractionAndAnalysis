Paris Saint-Germain are delighted to announce the homegrown midfielder has signed a deal through to 30 juin 2024.

Magnaba Folquet started playing aged 10 with Emerainville FC. After turning out for US Torcy,  she joined the capital club at 15.

The local-born youngster plays with the club's U19 side, but made some first-team appearances in 2020/21, and Didier Oll√©-Nicolle brought her into the first-team squad last summer.

Folquet has made five competitive appearances to date, including coming off the bench in the UEFA Women's Champions League quarter-final second leg win over Bayern Munich at the Parc des Princes this season. 

On the international scene, the Parisian has played twice for France at U17 level, and made one U19 appearance before being called up for the U20 squad during the last international break.

Paris Saint-Germain would like to congratulate Magnaba on her first professional contract, and would like to wish her all the best as she continues her career in the Red-and-Blue shirt.
