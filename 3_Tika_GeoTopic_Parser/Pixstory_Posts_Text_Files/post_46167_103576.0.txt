Whenever i think about Exercise , A lil bit tough exercise - Planks Comes in my mind ! ðŸ¥²

The plank is an isometric core strength exercise that involves maintaining a position similar to a push-up for the maximum possible time .

If you ask me ? Doing Planks Are lil bit tough for me ! So the chances of mistakes while doing it are more  ! One Must avoid Errors to get most out of this exercise and to avoid strain or injury !

Let me tell you Some Common Plank Mistakes ;

1 When you push your entire body forward with your feet , your shoulder is out of position and subjected to more weight . Your shoulders will tire out first instead of your abs , so you're not really targeting abs here .

2 Abs must not be relaxed . Be sure to squeeze them and maintain that position throughout the exercise . Squeezing glutes definitely helps you maintain that aligned position and gives you a constant reminder that things need to be tight , not relaxed .

3 When doing planks ,  you want everything to be aligned , from the top of your head through your hips to your heels . This way , you will engage thighs and abdominals to support your lower back .

Hold on guys ! If We put these mistakes aside , There are Alot of Benefits Of Doing Plank ! lemme tell you some ; âœ…
