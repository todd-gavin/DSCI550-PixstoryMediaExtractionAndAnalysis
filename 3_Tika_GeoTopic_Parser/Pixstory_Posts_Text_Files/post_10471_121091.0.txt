In the biggest blow to the al Qaeda group since its founder, Osama bin Laden was killed in 2011, leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed in a US strike in Afghanistan over the weekend according to US President Joe Biden. Bolstering the credibility of Washington's assurances that the United States can still address threats from Afghanistan without a military presence in the country, the drone attack is the first known American strike inside the country since the withdrawal of its troops. Condemning the strike as a violation of “international principles", Mujahid said it went against the 2020 agreement on a US troop withdrawal. Several activists had raised concerns that Zawahiri, who was unwell for a long period of time, received sanctuary from the Taliban following their takeover of Kabul in August 2021. In 2011, Zawahiri took over Al-Qaeda chief after US forces killed the terrorist group's founder Osama bin Laden.
