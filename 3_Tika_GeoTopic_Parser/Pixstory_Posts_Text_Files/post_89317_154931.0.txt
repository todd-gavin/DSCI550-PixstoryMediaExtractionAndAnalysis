THIS DAY THAT YEAR
On 12 October 1492 Christopher Columbus made landfall in Bahamas and found the New World. Whether his finding the New World was a good thing or bad is debatable. It lead to the destruction of the natives way of life and turned them into slaves. However he served as a link between the old world and the new one. It is believed that his journeys marked the beginning of colonisation and the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade. However his life had a great impact on the world's history as we know it be it  for bad or for worse and his actions will never be forgotten.
