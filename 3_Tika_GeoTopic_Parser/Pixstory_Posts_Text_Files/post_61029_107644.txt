I started playing Table tennis in grade and I remember practicing on a broken T T table in school and on the dinner table at home My main goal was to join the sports team in my school and table tennis was newly introduced I spend countless nights watching tutorials of serves spins shots and rules about table tennis I was able to get into the team and play for my school at the zonal level I saw the competition I had to face and after much persuasion my dad sent me for training during my summer holidays Thanks to my mentor and my trainer my team and I were able to go to the National Level during my last year of high school I feel elated and grateful for such an opportunity to explore build teams and connections and feel the spirit of sportsmanship
