Unlike most of the kids it has never been tough for me to express my love and emotions for you because that s how comfortable our bond has always been All these years you have been my best friend who listens to all of my senseless rants without complaining You have been my personal Sandeep Maheshwari everytime I needed motivation or advice You have been a saviour from mumma s scoldings You are the one who fought for me against this patriarchal society without even letting me know And for every big or small thing you ve done for me I can t even begin to tell how blessed and lucky I feel to have you in my life There are days when I feel like giving up but I look at you and remind myself how bravely you fought and overcame all the barriers of life On days when nothing works for me and I lose all the motivation your zest for life motivates me how easily you find happiness in all these little things of life how you re so content and grateful and how you never complain about things no matter how tough the situation goes Papa you know everytime someone says that I m exactly like you inside and out it fills my heart with so much pride for I always wanted to be like you Though I know it would take me a lifetime to become like you You re my real life superhero a real life fighter who inspires me everyday to become better and better No matter what I write it ll never be enough to express my love respect and admiration for you For all the sacrifices you ve done for me and are still doing I only wish I could repay a bit of it by making you proud all your life You deserve to be happiest everyday With love Your not so grown up daughter
