Former US-heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali was born on 17th of January 1942 in Louisville, Kentucky. Today would have been his birthday. On that occasion we want to share some rare footage of the civil rights advocate and boxing legend visiting war-torn Kabul in November 2002, only one year after the US Invasion. The 60 year old former heavyweight champion already suffered from Parkinson's disease when he toured a boxing club, school and women's bakery in Kabul, as well as met former president Hamid Karzai. Muhammad Ali who travelled in the role of a "U.N. Messenger of Peace" was welcomed by the local boxers, who couldnâ€™t believe their luck. The man and beloved icon on the posters and paintings decorating their sports club, actually came to visit. Later the footage shows him tasting some bread made at a women's bakery sponsored by the U.N. World Food Programme in Kabul. And he probably ended his tour in the Karte-Sei School which is located in one of the most heavily amaged parts of Kabul and has been reconstructed by the UN.
