Dwight Gayle has been acquired by Stoke on a free transfer from Newcastle. After being deemed unnecessary at St. James' Park, the 32-year-old striker signed a two-year contract with the Potters.

Gayle's contract with the Magpies had two more seasons left, but the Toon decided to let him walk away with nothing. The former Crystal Palace forward has a stellar record at Championship level, scoring 59 goals in 100 games for the second division.

After joining Peterborough United in 2012, originally on a loan, Gayle started to draw notice.

The following summer, he was acquired by Crystal Palace, and in 2014, as Palace rallied from a 3-0 deficit to tie at Selhurst Park, he became famous for scoring two of the dramatic goals that helped end Liverpool's title hopes.

Gayle was Newcastle's top scorer when they won promotion to the Premier League in 2017, but he only made nine appearances last season after spending 2018â€“19 on loan at The Hawthorns, where he scored 23 goals in 39 Championship appearances while playing for Palace in the 2016 FA Cup final against Manchester United, which they lost 2-1 after extra time.

Michael O'Neill, the boss of Stoke, expressed his belief that he will much benefit us. "In coaching, you bring your standards from when you were playing, and I believe everyone knows that John O'Shea had very high standards when he was playing."

Gayle joins Josh Laurent, Aden Flint, Gavin Kilkenny, Harry Clarke, and Liam McCarron in making the move to the Potteries in time for Stoke's Championship debut against Millwall on July 30.
