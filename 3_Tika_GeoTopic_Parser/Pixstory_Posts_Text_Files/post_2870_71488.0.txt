Inequality is contributing to the death of at least 21,000 people every day, or one person every four seconds. That’s a conservative estimate, a new briefing from Oxfam finds, based on data on deaths from lack of access to healthcare, gender-based violence, hunger and climate breakdown.

HOW MUCH?
The pandemic has added to inequality: The world’s ten richest men more than doubled their fortunes from $700 billion to $1.5 trillion ($15,000 per second or $1.3 billion a day) in these two years, while incomes of 99% of people fell and 160 million+ were forced into poverty. 

In other words, as Oxfam International’s Executive Director Gabriela Bucher notes, if these ten men were to lose 99.999% of their wealth tomorrow, they’d still be richer than 99% on this planet. They now have six times more wealth than the poorest 3.1 billion people.

WHY?
Extreme inequality is a form of economic violence. It doesn’t happen “naturally”, but is an outcome of deliberate policies and political decisions that perpetuate the wealth and power of a privileged few, harming the vast majority of ordinary people. 

Amid the pandemic, central banks pumped trillions of dollars into financial markets to save the economy, but much of that ended up lining the pockets of billionaires thanks to a stock market boom. Vaccines were to provide immunity to all, but rich governments let pharma billionaires and monopolies to cut off the supply to poorer nations.

Oxfam usually brings out the inequality briefing ahead of the annual Davos meet of the World Economic Forum. 

WHAT CAN BE DONE? 
As French economist Thomas Piketty has argued, taxation tweaks can make a lot of difference: https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/23/thomas-piketty-why-frances-rock-star-economist-still-wants-to-squeeze-the-rich Higher taxes on not only incomes but wealth too should be considered. 

A one-off 99 percent tax on the ten richest men’s pandemic windfalls, for example, could pay:
*to make enough vaccines for the whole world;
*to provide universal healthcare and social protection, fund climate adaptation and reduce gender-based violence in over 80 countries;
*all this, while still leaving these men $8 billion better off than they were pre-pandemic.
