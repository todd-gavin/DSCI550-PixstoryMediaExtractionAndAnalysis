Did American musician Joe Jonas just become an honorary member of BTS?!
Joe Jonas is famous for being a member of two other groups already, The Jonas Brothers (with his brothers) and DNCE. Yet, he may be looking to join another group.
While promoting DNCE's new collaboration single with Kygo "Dancing Feet" on TikTok, he also joined a filter challenge that assigns you "what band you are." Potential results include Fifth Harmony, One Direction, BTS, Little Mix, BLACKPINK, and his own group, The Jonas Brothers. Despite not getting his band, he was more than happy with the results as he got none other than BTS.
He even shared the video on his Instagram Stories with a heart-eyed emoji!
Joe is actually a proud member of BTS's fandom, ARMY. He and his brothers have spoken about their love for the group on multiple occasions. While Joe was excited to see BTS perform at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards, he even came up to the group during his own performance. He's a true fan. One time, he even revealed that BTS is his favorite boy band! So, we can totally understand why he was so excited about his filter results on TikTok. We can certainly relate, Joe! The feeling is certainly mutual, too, which makes one wonder if there could potentially be a collab in the future.
