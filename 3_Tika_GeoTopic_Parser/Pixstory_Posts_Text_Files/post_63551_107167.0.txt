I was 19 year old kid and this was the second month of my college life when I saw posters for blood donation by NSS.  I donated first time and felt some kind of satisfaction that i have done something or achive some kind of setisfaction  and was happy inside. That's how my journey of blood donation is started .  It's been 13 year and everytime i feel the same every single  time
.  Although I prefer to directly donate blood to an individual who is in need, instead of relying on various organizations for the same. it could be a friend , or a complete stranger, it doesn’t matter. 

Over the past thirteen years, I have donated blood several times, almost 25 - after which I lost count, when you’re donating blood, it’s an utmost priority to be in good shape. I’m a vegetarian, a mountaineer and a fitness enthusiast, this helped me to serve the cause better. I think behind this i have an impact of my mother she help a lot to others whatever she can do. She is my real inspiration. I am nothing infront of her.
