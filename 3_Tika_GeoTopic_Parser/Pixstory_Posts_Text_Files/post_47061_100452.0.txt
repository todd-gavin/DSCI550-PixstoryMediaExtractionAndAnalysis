Chelsea's striker scored two magnificent goals on Sunday to help the Blues win their third
consecutive WSL match, and she did it again at Wembley to lead her team to victory. Manager
Emma Hayes credited the victory to "human endeavour," while she admitted the performance
wasn't "perfection."

In the 33rd minute, Kerr scored against the run of play, heading home Millie Bright's right-wing
cross. The defender's delivery appeared to be heading for the goal, but Kerr was there to assist
it.

City fought back twice to force extra time, the first time thanks to a fantastic Lauren Hemp goal.

On the left side of the area, the winger beat Bright before curling a beautiful effort into the far
corner. Chelsea's Erin Cuthbert hit another stunning goal to put the Blues back in front.

Her
long-range attempt hit the underside of the crossbar and beat Ellie Roebuck.

Chelsea were on the verge of defending their title until Hayley Raso equalised for City. Raso
outmuscled Magdalena Eriksson before blasting past Ann-Katrin Berger, thanks to a wonderful
feed over the top from Alex Greenwood.

The spectacular climax included yet another dramatic twist worthy of the record-breaking crowd.

Kerr, though, scored the game-winning goal in the 99th minute, driving into the area from
midfield before her effort was deflected into the net by Greenwood.

Chelsea won despite being second best for the whole of the game. City had the majority of
possession and shots (23 to Chelsea's nine), but were foiled by an inspired Berger, especially in
the second half.

Man City's failure on Sunday is also the first time they have lost an FA Cup final after winning
their previous three. Chelsea got some retribution after losing 3-1 to City in the League Cup final
in March. This season, they added a second trophy to their collection and successfully defended
their title from the previous season, 2020/21.
