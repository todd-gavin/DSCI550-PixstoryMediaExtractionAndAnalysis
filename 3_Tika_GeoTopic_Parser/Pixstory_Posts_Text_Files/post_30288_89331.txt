Inter renewed Marcelo Brozovic&#39;s contract until it expired How Brozovic commented on the agreement reached I&#39;m really very happy I really wanted this renewal and the club knew it I never wanted to talk to any other team out of respect for Inter and its fans I always told my agents that I didn&#39;t want to talk to anyone other club unless Inter told me they would not want to renew my contract
