‌When people start to use 'no offence' the speaker and the listener knows that the speaker is going to utter an offence to somebody in the room. Similar is the case of comedy, Everything isn't a joke! 
‌
‌Just because your profession is Stand-Up Comedy, you can't stand up and say whatever comes into your mind and call it part of your profession. If so then why are work ethics for? Can butchers slaughter anyone they want just because it's their profession? No of course not, then why are there no standards set up for comedies. Comedies are meant to entertain the audience; without hurting any single one of them. If it's possible go on. 
‌
‌What is the most dangerous part of this? even if some of the audience laughs at these jokes; the comedian believes his purpose is served! When the audience is the king; Comedians attempt similar jokes to impress them. Please report immediately if you feel offended don't be ever afraid to speak up while you are being offended. Just that violence is not the option!
