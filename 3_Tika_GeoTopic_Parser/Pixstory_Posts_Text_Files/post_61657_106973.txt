Maxwell Jacob Friedman better known as his ringname MJF did not appear on AEW programming this week This left the wrestling world to wonder what s actually going on behind the scenes and what s next for the year old On last week s edition of AEW Dynamite MJF cut a scathing promo on AEW chairman Tony Khan calling him a mark The pipe bomb promo was targeted at various wrestling figureheads such as ex wwe stars who according to MJF were stealing money from him What happened next between the management and MJF is nothing more than speculation at this point AEW has since pulled all MJF merchandise from their shops and he s no longer listed on the company roster Furthermore the company went as far as removing MJF from their tv promos The wrestling journalists have always favoured AEW so it won t be a stretch to imagine that they have the inside knowledge of this being a pre planned strategy but they are helping the company keep this under the wraps MJF has piqued the interest of WWE They are eager to sign MJF to a highly lucrative contract Hopefully MJF sees the light of the day and goes to a company that will cheerish him rather than hinder his progress
