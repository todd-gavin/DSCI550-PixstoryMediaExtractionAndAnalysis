The football season in Europe is close to an end. We have reached the knockout stages in UEFA Champions League and Europa League along with a few final games to be played in the domestic cup competitions. Similarly, the English Premier League has eight gameweeks to go and the race is all heated. 

Ever since the 2018/19 season, the Premier League has become a two-horse affair. Only Liverpool have challenged Manchester City for the title and have even clinched one. However, in the previous season, the injuries and loss of form affected Liverpool and they had to settle for a spot beyond the top two. But, Liverpool are back in the business and are just breathing down their neck. 
At the moment, Manchester City and Liverpool have played 29 games and have 70 points and 69, respectively. The goal difference between the sides is just five. Manchester City have 50 whereas Liverpool have 55.
