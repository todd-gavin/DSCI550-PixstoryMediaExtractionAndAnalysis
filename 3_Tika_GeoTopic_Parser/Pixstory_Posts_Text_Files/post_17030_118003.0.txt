In the interview with the magazine, Ranveer discusses his work, his style, and his general comfort level with being naked.🤸‍♀️🤸
"It’s so easy for me to be physically naked, but in some of my performances, I’ve been damn fucking naked. You can see my fucking soul. How naked is that? That’s being actually naked. I can be naked in front of a thousand people, I don’t give a shit. It’s just that they get uncomfortable."
