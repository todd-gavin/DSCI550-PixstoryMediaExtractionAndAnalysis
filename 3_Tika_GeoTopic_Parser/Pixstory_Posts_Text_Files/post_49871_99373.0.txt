‌There are two types of fats saturated and unsaturated. Saturated fats from meat are not accused of modern diseases like heart disease, cancer, and obesity. Chemically processed and hydrogenated vegetable oils like corn and canola spur these conditions because they contain harmful free radicals and trans fats formed during chemical processing.

‌Non-vegan food also ignores fish- a vital source of the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA which are significant for brain function, lowering triglycerides, and reducing the risk of death from heart attacks and strokes.

Although the omega-3 fatty acid ALA can be found in plant oils, the ALA must first be converted by the body into the essential EPA and DHA. The process is ineffective and may not provide the same cardiovascular benefits as eating fish.

Vegans live longer is a myth as they focus on health more, work out, and exercise. Good exercise and a non-vegan diet also help to maintain good health. Eating meat dates back for ages and this has been a part of the diet of humans. So non-vegan consumption is no less healthy than vegan consumption.
