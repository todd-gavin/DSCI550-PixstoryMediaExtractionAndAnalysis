‘This city will eat you alive!’ If you’re a New Yorker, this phrase has been shrilly uttered in your ears by concerned relatives or by lifetime natives themselves. And it’s true. Each day, New Yorkers are gobbled up by fierce yellow taxis and hungry subways, only to be spit back out into their non-stop, wild, and terrifyingly exhilarating city.

A day in the life of a New Yorker is a normal, typical experience, really. It begins when you roll of bed and walk the entire length of your apartment to the bathroom with only one swift movement. You flick the light switch only to be courteously greeted by at least one creepy crawly roommate, yet it doesn’t faze you anymore in the slightest. You continue readying yourself for the day, donning your most weightless garments if it’s the exhaustingly humid summer, or layering coats, hats, and scarves like you’re Randy from A Christmas Story if it’s the frigid winter. With that, you step out of the apartment you had to purchase in, quite literally, a ‘New York minute’ and jump into the crowd bustling through the busy streets.

Subconsciously, and over time, you have accumulated your stride to the New York gallop. You’ve become an intricate maze runner, able weave yourself through groups and roadblocks without so much as giving a second glance upward. Whether you’re a student, a part-time worker, or even a Wall Streeter, you’re more than likely on your way to the subway for transport from point A to point B. As you arrive at your subway stop, you’ll observe visitors struggling with the kiosks to obtain a Metro card; you’ll provide directions to a hopelessly lost soul at least once; and you’ll more than likely assist someone in hauling a suitcase or stroller up the stairwell.

As you make your way to class or work, your affinity for the street car vendors will overpower your desire to maintain punctuality. After all, what New Yorker begins a day without a cup of coffee and a cronut?
