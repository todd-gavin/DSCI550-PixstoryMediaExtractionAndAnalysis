Naby Keita, a midfielder for Liverpool, has suffered a knee injury. In Sunday's 1-0 FA Cup quarter-final triumph against Nottingham Forest, Keita was one of four Reds players changed shortly after the hour mark.

According to the Liverpool Echo, the 27-year-old was set to meet up with Guinea's national squad this week ahead of friendlies against South Korea and Zambia.

The Guinea FA, on the other hand, revealed on Monday that Keita has not travelled owing to a knee problem, giving the Reds hope that the midfielder will not be side-lined for long ahead of a demanding April schedule.

Since returning from the Africa Cup of Nations in late January, Keita has played a key role for Liverpool, starting four of their past six Premier League games and coming off the bench in both legs of their Champions League round of 16 tie against Inter Milan.

With the quarter-final still goalless, he was replaced before Diogo Jota scored in the 78th minute, ensuring Liverpool's passage to the last four, with Manchester City awaiting a showdown at Wembley.

This is the midfielder's 15th setback since arriving at Anfield in 2018, when he was forced to miss 54 games.

The Guinean, on the other hand, has had a relatively injury-free 2021-22 season, having made 15 Premier League matches and five Champions League outings so far this season.

Keita will now miss the upcoming international matches against South Africa and Zambia.
