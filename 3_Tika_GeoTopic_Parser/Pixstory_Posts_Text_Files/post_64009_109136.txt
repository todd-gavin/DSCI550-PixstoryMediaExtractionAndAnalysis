It was the blue line Again As I was doing my daily ritual of picking up the metro from Vaishali I didn t know what the future held for me Well I didn t really know of it but I kind of anticipated it No I m not a fortune teller I m just a normal commuter who knows how blue line can be It was in Yamuna Bank when an announcement sent all the passengers rushing out of the metro Actually it said that the metro won t be going any further due to some technical glitch We were asked to switch the metro from there so we did That day the Yamuna Bank station was giving really strong Mumbai local vibes It was that crowded So finally our new metro began to crawl its way to the next station And after it reached there the metro started its journey back to Yamuna Bank Such a thing had never happened before not to me So back at our Mumbai local we all left the metro again only to find out that we had to wait another hour for another metro Two hours had passed and I was at the place where I should have reached in minutes Alone and baffled I decided I couldn t keep up with this The day had already been ruined I was already late for college So I decided to return home You might think I felt angry that day No I hadn t for it was not the first time I got stuck in the blue line I have become pretty used to these technical glitches and delays now thanks to the management Dear DMRC If You can t repair your metros at least inform us of these glitches beforehand There are office goers in your metro who can t use the same excuse of delay in metros again and again Please cooperate
