The weekend does not stop the glamor in Cannes No rest for the fashion system which, instead of enjoying the summer weather on the Côte d&#39;Azur, continued to keep its eyes focused on the various red carpets scheduled Because even the schedule could appear less bloated than in the previous days one never knows which guests were expected and could not have made their entrance onto the scene in front of the Palais des festivals et des congr s And not getting distracted certainly benefited the media and the fans present at the event who surprisingly found themselves in front of the diva par excellence Sharon Stone Few words and many, many flashes for her who has catalyzed attention on herself as did her Catherine Tramell in Basic instinct If we are talking about iconic moments then we cannot forget also a note, indeed a well-known colored shade of wisteria Carla Bruni, ex première re dame, showed up on Saturday as a surprise on the tapis rouge wrapped in a slip dress with all-over sequins designed by Celine and last night she certainly could not fail to support her sister Valeria Bruni Tedeschi during the screening of her film Les amandiers So she was a real flash magnet on Sunday too wearing a piece from the Saint Laurent fall winter collection
