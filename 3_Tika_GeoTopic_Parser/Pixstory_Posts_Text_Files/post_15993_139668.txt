 Abstract Aims Assessing the hemodynamic changes of diabetic retinopathy DR using harmonic analysis of both non invasively measured radial pulse and photoplethysmography PPG signals to propose a DR risk indicator Methods A total of patients with diabetes were followed on average of years The radial pulse and PPG signals were measured at the beginning of the trial Kaplan Meier curves of the DR risk indicator was analyzed In addition the correlation between the measurements of the radial pulse and PPG was evaluated Results In comparison of the patients clinical characteristics years of diabetes systolic blood pressure HbA C ACR urinary albumin and fourth harmonic C were higher in the DR group and eGFR and third harmonic C were lower Patients in the high DR risk group had a fold higher risk of developing retinopathy than those in the low risk group log rank test p lt The correlation coefficient between radial pulse and PPG measurements for C and C were and respectively Conclusions The harmonic analysis of radial pulse and PPG signals may be used to reflect the effect of DR in hemodynamics and the derived harmonic components may predict the risk of DR of patients with type diabetes Sources
