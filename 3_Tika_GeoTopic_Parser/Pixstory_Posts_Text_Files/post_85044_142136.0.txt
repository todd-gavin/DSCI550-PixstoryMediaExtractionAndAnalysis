This photograph is the favourite I have clicked till now. If one were to look at it closely, a lot is happening in this 3:2 frame. Minimal Photographers might not approve of this photograph but the street photographers will adore it. The beauty of this photo lies in how raw and natural the moment is. It feels real and unpolished. Capturing such moments makes me feel alive and gives a sense of purpose to my otherwise mundane life. I am a photographer, a student, and like all others my age, a little confused and a little foolish!
