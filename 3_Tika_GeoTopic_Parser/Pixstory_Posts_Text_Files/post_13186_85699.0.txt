Azar wore plastic sandals on his otherwise bare feet. It was so cold outside, that the puddles surrounding the leaking tents where 14-year old Azar and other Afghan refugees slept had frozen over. 

Despite the dire conditions at the refugee camp in Croatia where Azar had been living, he remembered the mountainous journey as being even more dangerous. "Fear is constant in the mountains," he said. "There were also wolves. That’s the scary part."

Azar's journey to get from Afghanistan to his leaking tent in Croatia had not been easy. Following a failed first attempt, Azar traveled through the mountains on foot to go from Afghanistan to Iran, from Iran to Turkey and from Turkey to Greece. After that, he traveled to Serbia, then Bosnia and finally to Croatia. 

"I feel bad in my heart," Azar said when discussing the other Afghan refugees he met all along the way and at the camp where he lives. "My only request is that you need to help these people. I don’t have any other demands.”
