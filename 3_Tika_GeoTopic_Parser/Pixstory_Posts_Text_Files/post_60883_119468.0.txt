If you like yogurt, cheese and pickles, then you would surely appreciate fermented food.

Recently, I have been trying to improve my gut health. Now, there are many ways to do that, but consuming fermented food is said to be the organic way to do it. 

The process of fermentation breaks down the carbohydrates in the food with the help of enzymes. They may include some good bacteria and yeast. Although the benefits of fermentation are still being studied carefully, research evidence suggests that fermented food promote the growth of probiotics in your gut (good bacteria) which aids in digestion and improves immunity.

You would have noticed that you might have had a diarrhoea spell following a period of consuming antibiotics. They slow down and destroy the growth of bacteria. The generation of Probiotics becomes extremely important to improve metabolism after this. Although people recommend eating fermented food, it would still be a good idea to consult your doctor for the best way to increase the growth of probiotics.

Food trends of 2022 indicate that fermented food is on the rise with the Global Fermented Food and Drinks industry expected to grow by $533.52 mn between 2022 and 2026. That goes to show how health conscious our generation is becoming. 

I love having fermented food like kimchi, yogurt and lacto fermented pickles. I don't trust the store bought ones even if they say they don't contain preservatives. I don't enjoy store bought fermented drinks too because some of them contain too much sugar. It's difficult to make fermented food at home when you're short on time or don't know how to go about it.

Nowadays, the internet and social media is filled with fermented food recipes and tools that make the process easy. Although my mom still uses traditional methods to ferment food but I'm not opposed to resorting to newer tools and recipes.
