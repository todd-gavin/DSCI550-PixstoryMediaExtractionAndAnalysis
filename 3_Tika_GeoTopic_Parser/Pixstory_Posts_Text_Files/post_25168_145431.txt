What I wore on my trip to Himachal Outfit day This off shoulder sweater which I ve owmed for more than year at this point but didn t get a chance to wear but now i finally did I paired dark blue skinny jeans with it because i wanted to wear boots and i feel boots look the best with skinny jeans even if skinny jeans isn t in trend anymore
