When thoughts, emotions, and sensations become too overwhelming, stress develops as a psychological response. Psychosocial stress, the most common type of stress, is the one that has the greatest impact on us.

When you're threatened by a social circumstance, you'll experience psychosocial stress. For example, psychosocial stress might occur when you feel threatened by your social status, social standing, social acceptance, or self-worth among your peers. When this happens, you may feel as though you are losing control of your social life.
These pressures can cause your body to respond with a stress reaction. Psychosocial stressors might make you feel socially alienated and unsupported. This reaction can make coping with psychological stress even more difficult.
How Does Psychosocial Stress Affect Us?
When we are exposed to psychosocial stress, our bodies respond by releasing stress chemicals such as cortisol, adrenaline, and even dopamine. When these hormones are engaged, our bodies undergo additional modifications, thereby starting the fight or flight response.
The changes our bodies go through during the stress reaction can be advantageous in the short term, but they also have long-term consequences. Cortisol, for example, can boost our vitality, especially when fighting or fleeing, but persistent cortisol release might compromise our immune system.

While adrenaline might help you feel more energized, it can also cause psychological and bodily harm if you can't control your stress response.

It is critical to manage stress, including psychosocial stress, because any type of persistent stress can have significant and long-term consequences for our mental, emotional, and physical well-being.
