Ronda Rousey returned to WWE for the first time since WrestleMania 35 at the 2022 Royal Rumble where she made an immediate splash by winning the 30-woman match, earning a title shot at WrestleMania 38.

Rousey couldn’t unseat Charlotte Flair as SmackDown Women’s Champion at that event but she soon put that right by making The Queen quit at WrestleMania Backlash.

Ronda Rousey carried her title, seeing off competition until Money In The Bank where, after a successful title defence against Natalya, The Baddest Woman On The Planet was undone by the new Miss Money In The Bank, Liv Morgan.

Morgan managed to roll up Rousey for the win and Rousey presented the star with the SmackDown Women’s Title before the two embraced. Things would not be so cordial after the two women faced off again at SummerSlam.

Rousey and Liv Morgan went one on one at the Biggest Party of the Summer with Morgan escaping with her title in dubious circumstances. Ronda Rousey had locked her armbar in on Morgan but as the former UFC star was fighting from underneath, her shoulders were simultaneously pinned to the mat. With the referee focussed on Rousey’s shoulders, he missed Morgan tapping out on the two-count and counted Rousey’s shoulders down.

An incensed Ronda Rousey snapped, first attacking Liv Morgan and then attacking the referee, locking him in the armbar as other officials tried to intervene.

WWE has now announced that Ronda Rousey has been fined and suspended by the company, meaning she will miss the upcoming SmackDown show.
