In a battle, a soldier went to bring his wounded friend back from the battlefield.
His Captain said, "Its of no use! Your friend must be dead".
But the soldier still went and brought back his friend.
Seeing the dead body, the Captain says, "I told you its of no worth. He's dead".
The soldier replies:"No sir, it was really worth it. When I got to him, my friend saw me, smiled & said his last words:

"I KNEW YOU'll COME"

Dedicated to all Great friends..
