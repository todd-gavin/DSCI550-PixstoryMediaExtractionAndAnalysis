I was this excited the day Dwighthoward joined Pixstory. The superman ignited Pixstoryâ€™s launch and now I look up to chrismattmann for the powered ascent ! 

Online toxicity is a threat to humanity. This crisis can only be tackled with thought leaders coming together with a sense of purpose and commitment. 

I want to thank Chris Mattmann for supporting this mission. Together, we aim to build the next generation of social media that can bring about a positive behavioural change. We hope to build a #CleanSocial to deliver a better world.

Thank you brother,

From team Pixstory !
