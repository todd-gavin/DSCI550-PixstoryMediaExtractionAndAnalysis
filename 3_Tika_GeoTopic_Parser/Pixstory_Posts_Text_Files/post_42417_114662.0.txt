It’s been four months since I started working for Pixstory as a Content Strategist and today I am leaving this great organisation to fave new challenges in life.

From writing movie & web series reviews to writing previews and reviews of Real Madrid matches of La Liga and UEFA Champions League, I enjoyed it all because I am writing about the things I love the most.

Covering my first press event for a movie named RRR and watching a movie named “Attack” on a press show gave me the proper vibe of a journalist.

From waking up at 5 am to cover the Oscars Ceremony and prepare notes while watching a movie & web series, the struggle was real.

I joined Pixstory because I liked writing a lot and when senior staff members told me to write about Movies and sports, it was like a cherry on the cake for me. Guidance from the senior staff helped me to improve my writing skills for sure and I’ll be thankful for that.

Before Pixstory, I was working as a freelancer but when I joined Pixstory I got to learn how to work Professionally and what it feels like to work when there is a deadline continuously giving you a headache.

At last, I want to say that, Thank You Pixstory and all the staff members, and I will continue to write (not regularly) on the app because I love writing and I hope our paths will cross again.

It’s more like a “See you soon” than a “Goodbye.”
