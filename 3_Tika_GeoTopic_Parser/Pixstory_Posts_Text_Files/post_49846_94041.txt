 Gun debate is never ending in America and the New York incident is yet another memory of it Guns do outnumber people in America Gun control has been an everlasting topic in America as some cannot live without it and some cannot live with it Most of the gun rights lobby groups have taken a stand against abortions because it is opposed by religious conservative groups that also support gun rights This interconnection of support groups divided between politics has almost made the gun debate never ending Yes in the war we needed guns to fight for ourselves against the British Yes they did take away our arms We needed our land and our independence It s an old story this is the United States of America in all its sense We are a new country founded a year back We did build in on the violence and what was it for For peace freedom and do guns offer that When somebody attacks you have to self defend by taking a life In every instance Then why is the law here if people take their chance to punish the culprits Aren t there other methods or safety equipment Police Finally are guns really for your safety or just a part you wish to carry in the name of culture
