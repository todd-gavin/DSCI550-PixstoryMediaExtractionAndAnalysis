On Sunday it was the final between Kerela Blasters FC and Hyderabad FC. Kerala Blasters who last won ISL in 2016, were looking to win it for the second time. Hyderabad had golden boot winner Bartholomew Ogbeche and Kerela had golden glove winner Prabhsukhan Gill. 


Hyderabad was on the back foot from the start, as KBFC had a really good opening 25 minutes, where a trio of Adrian Luna, Vazques, and Diaz created lots of trouble for HFC defenders. The game saw the return of the fans for the first time in 2 years after the Coronavirus Pandemic. 


The final was an eventful contest that saw impressive individual performances from both teams. KBFC had the best chance to win, as they created lots of chances but they were not able to finish off. 


In the 68th minute, KP Rahul came out of nowhere, and cooly slotted past Kattimani, who despite getting a hand, was not able to save it.  


When it looked like KBFC will win the ISL title, in the 88th minute Sahil Tavora scored a perfect volley, which went past the outstretched arm of Gill.  Hyderabad was back with a bang !!

The game went to extra time, as the scores were level 1-1. In 101 minutes, KBFC got awfully close to extending their lead.  Adrian Luna whips in a beautiful cross at the near post. Jeakson Singh gets the final touch on it, only to be denied for the second time by the crossbar. The first half finishes with both sides' level, going into the second half. The second half was the same as the first half, as both teams went into a penalty shootout to determine a winner. 



Laxmikant Kattimani redeemed himself, as he turned from villain to hero, and saved weak spot-kicks from KBFC players. The Nizam, went on to win the match 3-1 on the penalties shootout.
