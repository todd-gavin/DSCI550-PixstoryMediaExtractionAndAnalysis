Ohio and Louisiana, are considering measures that would allow teachers and other school staff to carry arms, despite opposition from gun safety supporters, teachers’ groups and school security experts. 
‌
‌Two states, Ohio and Louisiana, are now considering either lessening the regulations to arm school staff or permitting employees to carry a firearm after fulfilling the required training.

 Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an interview on Fox News on the day of the Uvalde school shooting that the state, which already enables teachers to be armed, should go further to ensure school employees have firearms. 

At least 28 states, including Texas, currently allow teachers or school staff to be armed in the classroom under differing conditions, 
The effectiveness of this notion is unclear and I think this will only add to the risk of gun violence. It would also put teachers into additional responsibility of protecting and even firing rather than teaching the children. It also heightens the risk of legal liability for teachers and schools. 

The bill headed to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s desk from the state’s Republican-controlled legislature would reduce the threshold for carrying a weapon. 

In Louisiana, state Sen. Eddie Lambert, a pro-gun Republican, revised a controversial gun bill passed by the statehouse on Wednesday, shredding the legislation of a criterion that would enable permitless concealed carry, to pursue a similar idea. Because it is too late to submit new bills into the legislative session, which ended Monday, his differences would delete the original idea of permitless concealed carry. 

Widely a large group of teachers do not support this idea and they don't think fighting back and causing a rampaging war in school is what we need in this situation. Violence should not be what the role models of students should do.
