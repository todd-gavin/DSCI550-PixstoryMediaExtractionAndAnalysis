Sunsets on the river are beutiful...the smell of water and the gras in summer eavnings...sounds and promise of short summer nights....the kisses that lovers shere and stolen moments in those hott summer nights....crickets that sing reminding us to engoy this warmth before winter comes ....water that flows rimindig us how ewrything pas....
