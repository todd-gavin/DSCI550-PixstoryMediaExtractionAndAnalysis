All believers, tells the Bible, are required to attend church in order to worship God, receive instruction from His Word (Acts 2:42; Hebrews 10:25), and form connections with other believers. All of these things are crucial to drawing closer to God and learning to live your life for Him. It provides you with a framework to help you stay focused on serving God and others.
You are a member of the Body of Christ once you have embraced Jesus as your Savior (1 Corinthians 12:27). The Church is that. There are various "body parts" in required for this Church Body to function properly, and you are one of those (1 Corinthians 12:14-20)! When the local church unites, they are doing what the early Christians did by gathering frequently for support, teaching, and simply friendship (see Acts). Coming together in this way is what allows the Body of Christ to function most effectively.
To be good Christians, we are required to attend Church. To keep our faith strong and not get distracted by the other worldly affairs and to keep close to God.
