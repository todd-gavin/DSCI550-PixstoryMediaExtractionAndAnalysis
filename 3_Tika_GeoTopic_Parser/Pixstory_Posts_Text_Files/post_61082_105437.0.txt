Itâ€™s a super easy ice-cream youâ€™ll ever make. I wanted to eat ice-cream so I decided to make it at home and then i found this quick and easy recipe online. No need to have an ice cream maker, no need to keep churning it or taking it out of the freezer to re-churn. You just need 3 ingredients and mix them well and then after 5-8 hours you can eat your chocolate ice-cream . 
Ingredients:
1. 1 can condensed milk 
2. 2 tetra pack of fresh cream 
3. 3/4 cup of cocoa powder 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
a generous pinch of salt (this really helps in bringing out the chocolatey flavour) 
Try it out at your home ðŸ˜‰
