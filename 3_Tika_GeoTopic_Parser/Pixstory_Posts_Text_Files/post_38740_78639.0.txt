Faivre ranks high in carries to danger zone, with him ranking 97 percentile in carries into the final third of the opposition half. He is decent in passes in final third with 77 percentile.

The Frenchman is brilliant at taking the direct route and take his man on, in 1v1 situations. His quick feet and agile movements make him such an asset on the wing, which defenders struggle to deal with. He tends to keep the ball close to his feet, almost as if it is glued to his boots. Defenders can try but they often need to double or even triple up on him, just to get the ball off. Nevertheless, he can sometimes lose the ball by engaging too many defenders in a dribble, often beating the first and second, but hackled down by the third defender.Faive ranks #3 in dribbles completed and dribbles attempted with 88 percentile. He is behind Sofiane Boufal and Kylian Mbappe.
