This series is absolutely incredible. 
The characters are so well and beautifully written. 
I personally love how the author incorporates all of the chaotic thoughts going through Juliette’s head. The characters are so likable, and you can’t help but fall in love with Warner and Kenji, and the dynamics a lot of the characters have (such as Juliette and Kenji’s friendship). 
This whole book is such a page turner, and the best thing is that you never know what comes next because things move very fast paced (at least, near the end, in the beginning it is a little bit slow). 
I am absolutely in love with the romance, adventure and dystopian theme in this book.
5/5 would highly recommend :)
