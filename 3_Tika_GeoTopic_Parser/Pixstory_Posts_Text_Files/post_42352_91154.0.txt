The international break is over and now all the players will look forward to completing their season with their respective football clubs.

Two national teams surprised me a lot and those teams are Spain and Portugal National teams. 

I liked the game with Portugal because in the last two games they played as a team and they were not dependent on one player that is Cristiano Ronaldo and also Cristiano Ronaldo looked good because he was looking to make more assists, he is looking to make more pass than to score a goal because of that he didn’t score a goal in two games.

On the other hand, Spain National Team looks they are a well-drilled team under coach Luis Enrique. In both games against Iceland and Albania, Spain had 85 and 82 percent possession which means they don’t want to give away the ball to other teams but that doesn’t mean they don’t score goals. 

Against Albania, they scored two goals, and against Iceland, they trashed them by five goals. 

As a fan of the Spanish football team, Euro 2020 broke my heart because I think Spain was the better team in the semifinals when they played against Italy but they take revenge against Italy in the Nations league semifinal and won the match. 

In November, when the team will gather again to play in FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar, I think Spain will be one of the contenders to win the tournament until and unless their key players got injured.
