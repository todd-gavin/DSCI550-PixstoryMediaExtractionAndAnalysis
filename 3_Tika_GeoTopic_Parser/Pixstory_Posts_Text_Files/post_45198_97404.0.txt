Mathieu Flamini

There isn't a greater narrative in any 'where are they now?' list than Flamini's. He concluded his
playing career with spells at Crystal Palace and Getafe after calling halt on his second Arsenal
stint in 2016.

But long before he retired as a player, he co-founded GF Biochemicals, a geo-energy firm on
which he now focuses. His commercial pursuits have proven extremely profitable, though he
has downplayed suggestions that he is now a multibillionaire. He and Ozil co-founded a
sustainable, vegan wellbeing personal care firm in 2018, and he is an avid environmentalist.

“Growing up by the sea, I could see from a very early age the impact of plastics in the water, on
the beach,” he told the Guardian in August 2020.

“It’s horrendous and makes you realise that, if we don’t change something, the place where we
live won’t be liveable any more. I was very aware of everything, very curious.

“I always told myself, ‘If I do something else later on outside football, I want it to be around
sustainability.’”

Theo Walcott

Walcott is back where it all started, having moved from Southampton to Arsenal when he was
16 years old in 2006. He scored 108 goals in 397 appearances for Arsenal, but when Saints
scored at the Emirates in December 2020, he still applauded.

“Scoring a goal, no matter who you play, is one of the best feelings and I scored many goals
here,” he said post-match. “But playing for Southampton is a massive thing for me so to score a
goal, why not? Why wouldn’t I celebrate?”
