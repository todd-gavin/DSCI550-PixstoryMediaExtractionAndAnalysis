Newcastle United have enjoyed a fabulous start to their 2022/23 Premier League season. The Magpies are now looking to build on this by bolstering their left-back position with Manchester United's Luke Shaw in January. 
As per Football Insider, "Newcastle United will make a cut-price move to sign England left-back Luke Shaw. The Manchester United defender is out of contract this summer and has struggled to cement his place in the Red Devils' starting XI."
Luke Shaw has featured in just 3 Premier League games for Manchester United this season. Manager Erik Ten Hag has preferred playing with new signing Tyrell Malacia in the left-back position. Injuries have also played their part in Shaw's emission from the starting XI. The left-back was not in his best form last season as well. 
Newcastle United currently occupy the fifth spot in the Premier League table following their 5-1 win against Brentford. The Magpies have Ritchie, Dummet, and Burn are possible options in the position, however, Luke Shaw would certainly boost their defence as they look to finish in one of the European spots at the end of the season.
It has to be seen if Luke Shaw would consider a move to Tyneside as his career with United has hit a snag over the past year.
