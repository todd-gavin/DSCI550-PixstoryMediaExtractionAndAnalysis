Thomas West, the US special representative for Afghanistan, said at the Tashkent international Conference that Washington is ready to discuss the release of frozen Afghan funds with the Taliban.

He emphasized that the international organizations should be assured through dialogue with the Taliban that there is transparency in this field.

Although his country has differences with the Taliban, but as winter approaches, the people of Afghanistan will face more problems.
For this reason, the United States is the largest donor of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and is ready to discuss with the Taliban about the release of the frozen funds of this country.

In this meeting, Rina Amiri, the US special representative on women and human rights in Afghanistan, also gave a speech.

Rina Amiri's speech was more focused on supporting the Afghan people's demand for girls' education, women's fundamental rights and political stability.

The international meeting of Tashkent on Afghanistan started on Tuesday with a delay of one day.
Representatives of America, Russia, European Union, China, Great Britain, India, Iran, Pakistan and several other countries are present in this meeting.

A delegation led by Amir Khan Motaghi, the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Taliban, participated in this meeting. However, Uzbekistan said that the presence of the Taliban in this meeting does not mean the recognition of the regime of this group.
