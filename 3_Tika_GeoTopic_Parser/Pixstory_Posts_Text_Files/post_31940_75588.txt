Manchester United have an incredible squad packed full of brilliant individuals in most areas of the field However the Red Devils need some new legs in the centre of midfield if they are to challenge for the Premier League once again One man who has been heavily linked to Manchester United this month is RB Leipzig midfielder Amadou Haidara BILD Now Manchester United might face competition for his signature from Newcastle United Daily Mail th January but you would think that the Red Devils should be able to convince him to move to Old Trafford Haidara is an all action midfielder who is fantastic at winning the ball back So far in the AFCON for Mali he has averaged tackles per game which is more than the likes of Fred and Scott McTominay have managed in the Premier League WhoScored Nemanja Matic still performs this role but at his legs are starting to fade and given that Haidara is only he has age on his side Ralf Rangnick also knows Haidara from his time working at Leipzig and he clearly impressed the German Haidara though isn t just fantastic at winning the ball back he also uses it wisely This season he averages progressive passes per game which is more than Fred or McTominay PlanetFootball So you can see that he not only wins the ball back but he passes the ball forwards as well He could be the man that tips the balance in United s favour against the likes of Liverpool Manchester City and Chelsea All of those teams have at least one progressive ball winner available to them and Haidara could be the man to fulfil that role under Rangnick at Old Trafford There isn t that long left in the January transfer window but this is a deal that the Red Devils have to complete
