Metastatic cancer occurs when cancer cells spread from a primary tumour to other tissues The organs impacted by metastases vary depending on their origin tissue Breast cancer frequently develops in the bones A team from the University of Geneva UNIGE and the ETH Zurich found a protein implicated in this phenomena This discovery may lead to the development of anti metastasis therapies This work is published in Nature Communications Cancer cells can infiltrate their microenvironment and spread to distant healthy tissue via blood and lymphatic arteries Metastatic breast cancer cells invade the bones but can also be discovered in the liver lungs and brain Tumor cell plasticity Cellular plasticity appears to be critical in the metastatic process even if the molecular and cellular processes are not fully known This refers to a cell s ability to change function or shape Metastatic tumour cells alter form and become migratory The mechanisms that drive the metastatic phases of breast cancer are of interest to Professor Didier Picard s research at the Faculty of Science His group studied these mechanisms in mice alongside Professor Nicolas Aceto s group at ETHZ The researchers looked into the protein ZEB which increases cell plasticity in breast cancer cell migration First author and researcher Nastaran Mohammadi Ghahhari says mice implanted with human breast cancer cells develop metastases to the lungs not the bones We wanted to uncover variables capable of generating metastases in bone tissue says Nastaran Mohammadi Ghahhari Bone metastasis In in vitro migration and invasion studies cancer cells expressing ZEB migrated to bone tissue unlike cancer cells lacking ZEB These findings were validated by transplanting human breast cancer cells into mouse mammary glands If the cancer cells didn t express ZEB they metastasized to the lungs However when ZEB was present bone metastases developed as in women We can therefore conclude that this factor is produced during tumour growth and that it leads metastatic cells to the bones says research co author Didier Picard This work demonstrates the role of tumour cell plasticity in metastatic processes and may lead to novel treatment methods to prevent metastases
