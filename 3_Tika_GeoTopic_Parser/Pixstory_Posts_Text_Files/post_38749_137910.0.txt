Manchester United vs Arsenal- The Invincible 2.0 run Broken
Defensive Contributions
Martinez made 2 tackles, he made 4 goal line clearances. He did well to keep the threat of Saka, Martinelli, and Odegaard out. He made an acrobatic goal-line clearance from Saka’s pass which saw him get injured and being replaced by Maguire. He made 100% loose ball recoveries in the defensive third of the pitch.
Verdict
Passes
Martinez made 34 passes out of which 29 were accurate. He had an 85% pass accuracy. He had a decent distribution play, which can be seen as he made 8 long ball passes, out of which 3 were on target.
Note:
Assist*: Passes that lead to shots or goals. In this case, Rashford showed two assists. I marked it specifically, which pass led Antony to score. While Bruno and Eriksen, 2 didn’t register assists for the first 5 games, however, they had one assist each against Arsenal. I have taken data for 6 matches, only for assists. The rest are from yesterday's match.
Verdict
United managed to break Arsenal’s unbeaten run. They will face Real Sociedad, Crystal Palace, Sheriff, and Leeds United in the next 4 games. Even though United are themselves on a 4-match unbeaten run, real tests will come thick and fast in the form of defending champions Man City, Chelsea, Tottenham, and Newcastle United. Will United under Erik Ten Hag, will be able to deliver the most eluded trophy or will it be another season of disappointment? Watch this space as the things unfolds.
