The atmosphere of a planet outside of our solar system has the first conclusive evidence of carbon dioxide in its atmosphere according to NASA s James Webb Space Telescope This observation of a gas giant planet light years from Earth orbiting a Sun like star sheds light on the planet s makeup and development The discovery which has been approved for publication in Nature provides proof that Webb might one day be able to identify and analyse carbon dioxide in the thinner atmospheres of smaller rocky planets With a diameter times larger than Jupiter and a mass around one quarter that of Jupiter WASP b is a hot gas giant Due in part to its high temperature about degrees Fahrenheit or degrees Celsius it is extremely puffed Unlike the cooler more compact gas giants in our solar system WASP b orbits very close to its star only about one eighth the distance between the Sun and Mercury completing one circuit in just over four Earth days Source
