Heavy defeat in terms of standings for Atalanta beaten at home by Napoli The hosts finished down in the first half before closing the gap and being punished again while they were looking for an equalizer The coach Gian Piero Gasperini analyzes the match like this The team entered very well in the match and put the opponents in difficulty Napoli managed the counterattack well and exploited the episodes We fell asleep a bit on the second goal If you go behind in this type of match you expose yourself I think the team straightened out a match that ended undeservedly later on in the effort made to equalize we conceded something The Champions League area seems far away despite a game to recover el Atalanta now fighting for a place in the Europa League cup in which they are still involved We have a game to recover but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s easy Sorry because we failed to win I am satisfied with the team&#39;s performance but we have to pay more attention to the episodes otherwise against such strong teams the result will inevitably be compromised concluded Gasperini
