Rising urbanisation, booming industrialisation, and associated anthropogenic activities are the prime reasons that lead to air pollutant emissions and poor air quality. It is expected that by 2030, around 50% of the global population will be residing in urban areas. Air pollution is one of the key global health and environmental concerns and has been ranked among the top five global risk factors of mortality by the Health Effects Institute. According to HEI's report, particulate matter (PM) pollution was considered the third important cause of death in 2017 and this rate was found to be highest in India.
The rising trends in population growth and the consequent effects on air quality are evident in the Indian scenario. As per WHO (2016) estimates, 10 out of the 20 most populated cities in the world are in India. Based on the concentrations of PM2.5 emissions, India was ranked the fifth most polluted country by WHO (2019), in which 21 among the top 30 polluted cities were in India. Various steps taken by the Government of India to control air pollution in Indian cities have been highlighted in the previous years. These measures have the potential to tackle pollution only if implemented successfully in the coming years.
