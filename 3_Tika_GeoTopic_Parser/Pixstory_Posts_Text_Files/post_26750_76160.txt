The question This is the question that every passionate fashion journalist or just teenager not wearing tracksuits hears from anyone off the field. I love following on instagram and reading in paper magazine Jos Criales Unzueta has perfectly summarized and compared what will be the men&#39;s trends and not only for next winter We will see a large use of sheepskin but not what grandmother left us in the wardrobe but a sheepskin with a new daring and contemporary shape The epaulettes or rather shoulder pads Huge jackets and coats structured like armor Long, very long gathered duvets with improbable shapes The quilted jackets too would remind us of our grandmother but here they are super cool bomber jackets and jacket-trouser suits that I don&#39;t think our grandmothers would wear destroyed patchwork and repaired sweaters as we immediately intuited when we saw the Etro show Very long and very wide trousers so much that we could see them dragging on the floor Maryjanas are once again worn by men Men also reappropriate another item of clothing purely feminine or skirts. But this time they are worn over a pair of trousers, perhaps structured and perhaps of the same fabric
