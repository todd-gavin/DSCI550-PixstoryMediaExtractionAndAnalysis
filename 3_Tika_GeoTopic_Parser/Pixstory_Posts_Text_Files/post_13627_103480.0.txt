The US Special Representative for Afghanistan met with representatives of political parties, women and civil society in Istanbul on Sunday.

This is the first meeting of the US Special Representative with the representatives of Afghan political figures in Turkey. The meeting stressed the need to agree on the achievements and rights of the people before forming an inclusive government.

During his two-day visit to Uzbekistan, Thomas West also met with a number of Afghan activists in Tashkent.

"They were concerned that Afghan women and girls were being deprived of their most basic rights, such as the right to education, free movement and employment," she wrote on Twitter.

Leaders of a number of anti-Taliban political parties recently announced at a meeting at Marshal Dostum's house in Turkey that they had agreed to establish a High Council of Resistance to save Afghanistan.

The party leaders also legitimized armed resistance against the Taliban in Panjshir, Baghlan, Takhar, Badakhshan, Parwan, Kapisa, Samangan and other parts of the country, and expressed support for armed resistance against the Taliban.
