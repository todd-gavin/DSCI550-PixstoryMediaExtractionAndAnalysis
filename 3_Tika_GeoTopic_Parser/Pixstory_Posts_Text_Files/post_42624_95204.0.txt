Today, when Osasuna will host Real Madrid, Barcelona will wish that Real Madrid drop some points in the match and Barcelona will have a chance to close down the gap of 15 points between Real Madrid and themselves and to some extent, make the La Liga title race little bit exciting.

Right now, Real Madrid is at the top position with 75 points after playing 32 matches and if I talk about Barcelona, they are in the second position with 60 points after playing 31 matches, so even if Barcelona won the ‘game in hand’ their points will be 63 and gap of 12 points will still be there.

To win the La Liga, Real Madrid has to win 3 games out 6 and if Barcelona wants to win La Liga, they have to wish that Real Madrid lose at least 5 games and Barcelona has to win all the seven matches, and as a football fan since eight years, this is NOT possible at all.

Talking about today’s match between Osasuna and Real Madrid, Real Madrid is a clear favorite to win the match but as a fan of Real Madrid, I know when Real Madrid are favorites of the match, they will make that match tricky for themselves and might drop points. In this season, when Real Madrid were underdogs , in that match, they performed well.

Osasuna is in the ninth position in La Liga, which means they are playing good football and they can cause harm to the visiting team.

Modric, Casemiro, Mendy, and Marcelo will miss today’s match against Osasuna and for sure Real Madrid will feel their void in the match.

So, let’s hope for a good match and on paper, Real Madrid should win the match but expect the unexpected from football.
