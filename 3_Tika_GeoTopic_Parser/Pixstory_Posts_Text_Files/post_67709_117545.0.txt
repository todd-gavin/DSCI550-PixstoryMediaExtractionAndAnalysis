As I am in final semester of our college all incidents are veruly memorable.I am a born foodie . I love to taste and try different foods of different cultures. The canteen in our college is not too big but it is a great area to spend quality times and reduce our anxiety. There are variety of dishes available there. From bengali rice to chowmin, egg roll, butter toast and many more irems . But we spent most of the times outside of the college for trying food . As my college is heart of kolkata at shyambazar so we try all type of foods . There are big restaurant to small food shops . The papri chat and dahi vada at 5 point crossing is one the most popular item. The Golbari  is an iconic place in kolkata whichbis just 5 minutes away from our college. The mutton dishes is very popular allover the city. The big restaurant like armenia and arselan are very popular for biryani but they require some time to reach. The small shops kachori shops and shakes shop are there. We can take any combination of shakes and juices . There are available various fruit juice like mango , pineapple , and moxed fruit  also available . The milk and curd shakes are also available which includes kaju , pesta and other dry fruits. It is a golden time of our life and the time passes soon . The panipuri or fuchka is one of the moat popular item all over India which I also like very much. When I am outside of home most of the time I try panipuri with adding chilies. There are many restaurants near it but I personally like KFC most but it is quite afr from our college. But it is an amazing place to spent quality time . That's a wonderful journey for my 3 years but it will never come again but the small funny moments always nourish myself. These give me a positive energy which helps me to go for a long path
