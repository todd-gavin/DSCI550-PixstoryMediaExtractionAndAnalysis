In the Supreme courts-the conservative majority has been making many decisions that have been changing the course of the era. The signature moment was the overturning of Roe v/s Wade. The court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization was an unusual decision whose effect was felt within hours, as Republican-led states began restricting elective abortions, and will play out over years.

They have done far more than that according to scholars. They always ruled in favor of religious groups and their conservative ideas. After a decade of Supreme Court inaction, they broadened Second Amendment jurisprudence to bless the right to carry a weapon outside the home. Also, the court’s powerful six-justice bloc restricted the ability of government agencies to allocate sweeping regulations of health, safety, and the environment without particular authorization from Congress.

The court has already agreed to revisit next term whether universities can use race as a factor in making admission judgments that have been allowed by previous supreme courts. The court will also decides whether the wedding websites can say no to same-sex couples-the conflict is billed as a free-speech case but was sparked by the designer’s religious beliefs about marriage.

Another issue is regarding federal election rules. They will consider a case that could radically change the way states set rules for federal elections, giving state legislatures almost total control over drawing the congressional districts in which candidates run and the rules of voting, even if state courts think they infringe the state constitution.
