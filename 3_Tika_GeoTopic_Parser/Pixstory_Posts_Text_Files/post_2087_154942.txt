Former Democratic Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard came out recently stating that she was leaving the Democratic Party In a lengthy YouTube video where she made the announcement she noted among other things that the Democratic Party was controlled by an elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly weakness In an interview with Tucker Carlson she elaborated on many of her views stating that The whole environment of fear that those in power these elitists in power have fomented to where people are afraid to speak the truth They re afraid to exercise their right to free speech because hey you might lose your job be canceled and be trashed And God forbid in Washington you might not be invited to the cool kids parties This comes as no surprise to many who have followed Gabbard as she has always been seen as a democrat who has broken from the left on critical issues However with this new step in officially announcing her break from politics the party may hopefully encourage others to do the same and restore sanity to the Democratic Party where it was lost to bring back reasonable democrats who are not afraid of disagreement but who embrace it
