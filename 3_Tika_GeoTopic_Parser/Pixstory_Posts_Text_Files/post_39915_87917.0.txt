Ingredients
2 cups (250g) maida/refined flour
¼ cup (60ml) ghee/clarified butter
200g mawa/khoya
½ cup (100g) powdered sugar
½ cup (50g) dry desiccated coconut
2 tablespoons suji/semolina
2 tablespoons charoli/chirongi
2 tablespoons raisins
8-10 kaju/cashews
½ teaspoon cardamom powder
Oil for frying

Recipe
In a large bowl add refined flour and ghee and rub them together till well combined. When you will hold it in between your palms, it will form into a ball-like structure.
Now add little water at a time and knead to form a firm dough. Once done, cover and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.
To make the filling, in a pan over medium flame dry roast desiccated coconut for 2-3 minutes or until it turns aromatic. Now remove it in a bowl. Similarly dry roast suji and dried nuts, like chirongi and cashews and then transfer them in the same bowl.
Further, in a pan add mawa, break the lumps and then cook for 4-5 minutes on low-medium flame until it turns soft and starts to release oil from the sides.
Mix all the ingredients. Further add raisins, cardamom powder, and powdered sugar and mix until everything is well combined. The filling for the gujiya is ready. Let it cool down for sometime
 For the gujiyas divide the dough into 19-20 balls/peda.
Now take one ball/peda and roll them into thin puri, cut it into a round shape.
Further, put a spoonful of the filling in the center of the puri. Apply water on the edges and then gently pick one side of the puri and fold it to the other side.
Now seal the sides and the corners by pressing it with your finger and then press the edges with a fork to give it a nice shape. Similarly, shape all the gujiyas.
In a pan over a medium flame add oil/ghee and once it becomes medium hot, add the gujiyas and while stirring it occasionally fry them on low-medium flame for 7-8 minutes or until they get a nice golden colour.
