Go ahead and ask any Oranje or any Manchester United fan about who THE SYSTEM is They ll come up with a quick reply consisting of three words JACKIE NOELLE GROENEN The Oranje have had three different head coaches Arjan van der Laan Sarina Wiegman and Mark Parsons since Jackie made her debut in and all of them would agree to the answer given by the Dutch and the Red Devils fans A box to box midfielder Jackie has been an integral part of the Netherlands team in the last few years Playing in her second European Championship the experience and the brilliance of Groenen was visible on the pitch against Sweden last night in the UEFA Women s Euro Group C game Even though Vivianne Miedema was awarded the Player of the Match award it shouldn t take anything away from Jackie Groenen The year old Manchester United midfielder started alongside Ajax s Sherida Spitse and Lyon s Danielle van de Donk in the midfield Miedema was often dropping in deep into the midfield to help with the ball progression and buildup so one might be right in assuming that Parson s side often had four players in the midfield last night Groenen made recoveries and was vital in winning the ball back Groenen wins the ball back for her team the commentary might have sounded a little repetitive as Groenen was present all over the pitch She also boasted a tackle completion rate pass completion rate interceptions and cross accuracy The Netherlands were defensively affected by injuries to goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal and center back Aniek Nouwen in the first half but Groenen was vital in stabilising the ship Around an hour ago the Netherlands Women s National team s twitter account reported that Groenen has tested positive for COVID and hence will be in isolation for the next few days Only time will tell if she would recover in time for the Netherlands next game against Portugal on Wednesday
