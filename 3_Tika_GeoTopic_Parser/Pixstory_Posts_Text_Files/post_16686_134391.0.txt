Vijay Deverakonda starrer Liger released on 25th August 2022. On that day, the Hindi version of the film just had paid previews, and it got a full-fledged release on 26th August 2022. Liger took a good opening in Telugu, but from day 2 it has been getting a bad response. But, to everyone’s surprise Hindi version is collecting much better than the Telugu version. Liger Hindi has collected Rs. 13.85 in its first weekend (including paid previews). 🎬👍🏻

Well, of course, it’s not great numbers, but Liger Hindi has already surpassed the lifetime collection of many Bollywood biggies that released this year.🔥🔥
