Amidst various states passing bills that harm LGBTQ+ youth and adults, some Democrats have made it their responsibility to preserve LGBTQI+ narratives for future generations to know. 
Congressman Mark Pocan has introduced two bills that will take the construction of the museum ahead. 
The first bill establishes an 8-person commission that would deal with logistics like developing fundraising plans, feasibility of construction and determining if the museum should be part of the Smithsonian Institution. 
Whereas second bill will actually create the museum.
What other steps can legislators take to preserve our narratives, and our lives?
