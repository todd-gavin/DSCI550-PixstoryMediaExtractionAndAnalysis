It is important that the role of the new TEA assisted evolution techniques be recognized as soon as possible to accelerate green genetics capable of protecting the environment protecting agricultural production with fewer pesticides defending the biodiversity heritage present in Italy from climate change and bringing research back Italian protagonist after the Covid emergency And what Coldiretti says in reference to the public consultation opened by the Commission to establish rules on plants produced with the New Genomic Techniques NGTs Agricultural research underlines Coldiretti today has new genetic improvement technologies available that allow to reproduce in a precise and targeted manner the results of the mechanisms at the basis of natural biological evolution grouped under the denomination Tea Assisted Evolution Technologies Techniques that do not involve the insertion of DNA foreign to the plant In order to be able to fully seize these new opportunities by enhancing the green primates of Italian agriculture in terms of typicality sustainability and biodiversity it is necessary to arrive at a regulation of the agricultural products obtained from these methodologies which today, explains Coldiretti, do not find an adequate place at the community regulatory level A great challenge to get farmers back as protagonists of the research without the results ending up in the hands of a few multinationals that own the patents continued the president of Coldiretti in underlining the need to defend and enhance the heritage of national agricultural biodiversity and the distinctiveness of our countryside, guaranteeing new growth and development opportunities for the national agri-food sector
