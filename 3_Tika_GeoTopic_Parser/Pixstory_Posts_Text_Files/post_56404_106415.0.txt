Don't ever bring back toxic people, I meant toxic people of any degree into your life unless they change completely for good why do you want to suffer? Why do you need so much negative energy around you? 

Toxic people drain out your life and they might not even care or realise about that. This doesn't justify their behaviour. Life is too short to waste upon such people. loneliness is better than having toxic people around you. Greif will be a part of leaving people in your life. You will never regret it in the future. It's okay to leave the place where you feel unimportant or people who make you feel less worthy.

You might go back to them when you are lonely but you can always seek help from friends or family or an expert. The process of healing needs to keep the issue away from you and going back to it doesn't help.
