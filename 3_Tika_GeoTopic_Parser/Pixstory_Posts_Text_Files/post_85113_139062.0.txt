Manchester United ensured a disastrous campaign last season and finished outside of a Champions League spot. The Red Devils eventually finished in sixth place which means they will be competing in the Europa League this season. Players were criticised heavily and rightly so for the team’s poor form last season. The poor form continued into the beginning of this season with United suffering damaging defeats to Brighton and Brentford.
Erik Ten Hag’s men have made a remarkable recovery to the bad start with four wins on the bounce. The Dutchman must be given praise for the recent good form as he was also under intense scrutiny after the 4-0 loss to Brentford. It was reported that Ten Hag was furious after that game and made the players train on Sunday which was the player’s scheduled day off. It is understood that the Dutchman joined in with the players in a run and United now look a completely different outfit.
It seems the players are willing to play whole-heartedly for the manager and this has been clear to see in the recent performances. United are also starting to adapt to Ten Hag’s philosophy with clear patterns of play visible in their football. While the Red Devils will hope they secure Champions League qualification by finishing in the top four, they also have a route to the competition via the Europa League. A trophy would be huge for this side and Ten Hag and we will look at three reasons why Manchester United can win the Europa League.
