Due to the small number of countries who play cricket it should not be an Olympic sport And I am not the first person to say this People have pointed out how only nations from some subcontinent are relevant for this sport As can be observed the bulk of cricket playing nations including South Africa Pakistan Sri Lanka and the West Indies are going through a decline in their governing bodies Moreover as ISC points out the Australian Cricket Board is also undergoing changes In New Zealand cricket is a minor sport with little fanfare The richest ICC boards are the two other nations India and England So can an Olympic sport be held with these nations where cricket That would be an utter waste of resources What do you think about it
