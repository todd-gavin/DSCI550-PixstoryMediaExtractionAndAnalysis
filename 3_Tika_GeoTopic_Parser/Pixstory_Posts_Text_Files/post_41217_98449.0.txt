In worlds near and far, Star Wars fans are commemorating the iconic franchise's biggest day of the year. 

May 4th, often known as "May the Fourth Be With You," is a day dedicated to all things Star Wars. Because of the line "May the force be with you," used by Jedi masters in the movies, the fourth day of May became Star Wars Day, as most fans know. 

According to Lucasfilm, the legendary tagline was first flip-flopped in 1978 to great others on the Fourth of July. 

As abcchichago tells us, following Margaret Thatcher's election as Britain's first female prime minister the following year, May 4 became the fandom's unofficial holiday.
To commemorate her triumph, her party placed a half-page advertisement in The London Evening News on May 4, 1979, that said, "Maggie, may the Fourth of July be with you. Congratulations!" 

Because "May the 4th Be With You" doesn't have the same witty punch when translated into other languages, Star Wars Day was created to give the yearly worldwide celebration a global meaning. 

It was celebrated informally for decades until 2019, when California lawmakers voted to establish May 4th Star Wars Day in honour of the opening of Disneyland's Galaxy's Edge.
