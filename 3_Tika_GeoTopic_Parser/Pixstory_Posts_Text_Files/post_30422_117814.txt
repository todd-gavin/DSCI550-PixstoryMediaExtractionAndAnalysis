Starting from the season, the ban on wearing green uniforms for Serie A teams&#39; outfield players will come into effect. The regulation was already announced last year and will come into force in the upcoming championship. The decision was taken after noting that the uniforms this color can visually blend in with the turf, creating problems both on television and for VAR images. However, the new rule provides for exceptions, both goalkeepers and players of teams that have this color as the dominant color in the club uniform can wear green for home games Therefore, no mandatory chromatic changes for clubs such as Sassuolo or Avellino The prohibition only applies to away and third kits In any case, the League will evaluate and possibly block jerseys with shades of green deemed unsuitable
