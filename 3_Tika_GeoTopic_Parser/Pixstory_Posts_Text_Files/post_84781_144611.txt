 Working in a park cafe is something which a lot of people don t like Not only they don t feel comfortable they also don t want to drag their work to a comforting place But is it that bad For a person like me who loves his work merging these two is never bad Its chilling its fun and its relaxing It helps me to increase concentration and focus It actually makes my work life balance better in a long run It also teaches me to not give a damn about others D PS Me working in a park on a day with internet issues at my place lol
