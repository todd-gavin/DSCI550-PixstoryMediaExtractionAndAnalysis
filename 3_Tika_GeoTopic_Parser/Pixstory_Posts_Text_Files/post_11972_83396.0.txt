Did you know that childbirth might lead to emotional, behavioral or even fatal disorder.
Postpartum depression is a complex mix of physical, emotional, and behavioral changes that happen in some women after giving birth. 
PPD is a form of major depression that begins within 4 weeks after delivery. 
The chemical changes involve a rapid drop in hormones after delivery.  levels of estrogen and progesterone, the female reproductive hormones, increase tenfold during pregnancy. Then, they drop sharply after delivery. By 3 days after a woman gives birth, the levels of these hormones drop back to what they were before pregnancy.
In addition to these chemical changes, the social and psychological changes of having a baby create an increased risk of depression.
