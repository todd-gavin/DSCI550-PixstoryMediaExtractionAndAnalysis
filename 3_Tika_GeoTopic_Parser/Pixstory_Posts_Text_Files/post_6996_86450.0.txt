The Probe team

In Goa, the BJP seems to have just touched the halfway mark with the party securing leads in 20 seats in the 40 member state assembly.

As per the current trends, the BJP is set to cross the Halfway mark and secure a hattrick. Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant told the media that if numbers fall short, the party will still form the government with help from smaller parties.

With the counting underway, there is a neck-to-neck fight between Chief Minister Pramod Sawant of the BJP and Congress’s Dharmesh Saglani with Sawant leading with a total of 11561 votes and Saglani pacing with 11175 votes.

In other constituencies, BJP’s Rohan Khaunte was seen leading in Porvorim with 11349 votes and Congress party candidate Michael Vincent Lobo was seen leading in Calangute with 9103 votes.
