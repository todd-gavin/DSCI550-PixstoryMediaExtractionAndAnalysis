California has brought in yet another law to tighten gun control. California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law that empowers gun violence victims to file civil suits against the companies that manufactured the firearms used in the crimes.

To the victims of gun violence and their families: California stands with you. The gun industry can no longer hide from the devastating harm their products cause," Newsom said in a news release.

A 2005 federal law protects gun manufacturers and dealers from lawsuits when the weapons they produce are used to commit crimes.
The California Assembly Bill 1594 "utilizes an exemption to the federal statute that allows gun makers or sellers to be sued for violations of state laws concerning the sale or marketing of firearms", according to the California news release.

"Our kids, families, and communities deserve streets free of gun violence and gun makers must be held accountable for their role in this crisis. Nearly every industry is held liable when people are hurt or killed by their products -- guns should be no different," the Governor was quoted as saying by CNN.

California has allocated $156 million in gun violence prevention grants to support nearly 80 cities and non-profit organizations implementing anti-violence programs tailored to their local communities.

The recent events of violence have reignited the gun debate yet it only sought to burn in California â€“ creating a safer environment by implementing laws.
