Martin Braithwaite is one of the hosts of players expected to leave Barcelona in the summer transfer window after being told by Xavi he is a surplus to requirements. 

The Denmark international has said he wants to see out his contract but he will likely spend the rest of the season on the bench if he stays.

The clubs have already been in touch to ask Barcelona about the forward’s availability ahead of the 2022-23 campaign. La Liga sides Celta and Valencia along with Premier League side Brighton & Hove Albion are all keen on the 30-year-old, according to Mundo Deportivo.

Brighton manager Graham Potter thinks Braithwaite might be a good option and the striker knows English football from his spell at Middlesbrough.


Meanwhile, Valencia is said to be looking for low-cost experienced players and Celta Vigo is looking for a replacement for Santi Mina. 

Braithwaite is contracted to Barcelona until 2024 but will surely struggle for game time next season, particularly if the Catalans do end up signing Robert Lewandowski.


The reports add that Seagull boss Graham Potter believes the addition of the former Middlesbrough striker would strengthen their squad for the 2022-23 season. 


Braithwaite who has scored 10 goals in 57 appearances for Barcelona across all competitions since joining the club in 2020, is under contract until 2024. 


Does Barcelona need him?

The fact is that Barcelona still has great forwards. While the transfer talks are still on with the Polish striker Lewandowski- Barcelona is looking forward to reconstructing their forward line again. 

With some great signings, head coach Xavi has been thinking about shrugging off Braithwaite. He already said at a conference that Braithwaite should think about his future with other clubs.
