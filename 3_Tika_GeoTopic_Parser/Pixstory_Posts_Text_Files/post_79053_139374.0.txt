Despite coming on in the 74th minute of a tricky away day at Old Trafford, Fabio Vieira managed to impress the Arsenal fanbase. Despite joining the North London side in the middle of July, his cameo against United was the first minutes we’ve seen him play in red and white – and, while the sample size was small, he managed to meet some of the high expectations we have of him.

Fabio was not cheap. He joined Arsenal out of the blue for a reported fee of £34 million – with journalists catching on just hours before the announcement. The ex-Porto man is known to be a creative midfielder – able to play not just in the advanced Odegaard role, but potentially as a left sided eight. His versatility across forward positions was clearly a big factor in us signing the Portuguese star, with Mikel Arteta praising this attribute weeks ago: “He has played off the left, off the right, he has played as a false nine, attacking midfielder. He doesn’t want to be locked into one position as well because he’s so used to it. That’s a really positive thing for us.”

I think what impressed me most about Fabio Vieira’s performance against Manchester United was the fearlessness. Let’s not forget – the Premier League is the hardest league to play in, especially when you’re thrown in against a fierce rival like United. In just 16 minutes, Vieira accrued 21 touches, took 2 shots, completed 2 dribbles and won all of his duels. Granted, he couldn’t impact the game on a wider scale, and he did look a little distance from being fully sharp, but for a Premier League debut – I was impressed. From the few touches he took, he looks like a top talent.

Tomorrow night, Arsenal face FC Zurich in the Europa League – the perfect opportunity for Fabio Vieira to start a match, and show the fans even more than what we saw last weekend. I for one can’t wait to see what Vieira can bring - let’s hope he show us all on Thursday evening!
