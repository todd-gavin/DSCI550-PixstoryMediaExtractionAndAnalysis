Today I went to my college Library alone I entered the college in the morning went to my class Then i got to know that there will be a surprise test later in the day I was feeling so tensed and anxious about this After the class i went to my college library I sat on a chair and opened my books A lot of students were in the library but no crowded noises were there The windows were opened and the fresh air was coming inside directly on my face Due to the Silence i could hear some birds making mesmerizing sounds The environment was so euphoric i started reading i felt like i was meditating alone somewhere in the nature As there were no noise pollution the environment was pure with the beauty of nature I spent some hours reading and experiencing the beauty of nature In this busy daily life i suggest you to spend some time alone with yourself where there is no distractions and only nature as your company The Library Let me know if you ever had any experience like this which made your soul happy
