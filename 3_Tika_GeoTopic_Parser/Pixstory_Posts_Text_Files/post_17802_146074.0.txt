Post Malone took a nasty spill during his Missouri concert Saturday. The singer accidentally fell into an open trap door in the stage. After crashing hard onto the stage floor, he clutched his rib cage in immense pain. After 15 minutes, he returned to the stage and thanked the audience for their patience.
“There was a big ass hole in the stage,” he told the packed crowd.
Clearly still in pain and holding his side, Malone managed to finish with a shortened set that included “Rockstar,” “Cooped Up” (with Roddy Ricch), “Sunflower” and “White Iverson.” In total, he performed 17 songs at the St. Louis concert, which is a handful less than the 22 songs he’s been averaging during his Twelve Carat Tour, as Rolling Stone points out.
Malone took to social media the following morning to further explain what happened.
“Whenever we do the acoustic part of the show, the guitar’s on the guitar stand and it goes down,” he said in a short video on Twitter. “And there’s this big ass hole, so I go around there and I turn the corner and I bust my ass. Winded me pretty good; got me pretty good.”
The singer added that he was taken to the hospital and given a clean bill of health. “They gave me some pain meds and everything, so we can keep kicking ass on the tour,” he said.
At press time, Malone was still scheduled to perform at Columbus, Ohio’s Nationwide Arena on Sunday.
