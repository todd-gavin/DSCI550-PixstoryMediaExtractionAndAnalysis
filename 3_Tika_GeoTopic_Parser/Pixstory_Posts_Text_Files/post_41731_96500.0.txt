According to a UK newspaper, Simon Katich, a former Australian batter, is one of the favourites to take over as one of two England cricket head coaching positions. 

The former excellent left-hander was singled out as the emerging - and leading - candidate to succeed Chris Silverwood. He spent time at the top of the order and in the middle. 

Fox Cricket reported that following the Ashes disgrace, many people, including former Director of Cricket Ashley Giles, were fired. 
The appointment of Rob Key, a former England top order batter who spent years dominating County Cricket with Kent, as their new DOC was one of the key parts of the jigsaw puzzle.

Key is believed to desire to separate the positions of Test coach and short-form coach, while Katich, despite having spent the majority of his coaching career in white ball cricket, is eyeing the Test role.

“Katich is regarded as a tough and tenacious coach, in keeping with his style during his playing career,”The Telegraph writes. “Should England decide to split the head coaching role, and appoint separate red and white-ball coaches, Katich could be a contender for either job, but appears much likelier to be the red-ball coach.”

Let’s see what happens next!
