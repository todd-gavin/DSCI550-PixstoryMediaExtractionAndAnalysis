Mallakhamb:
Itâ€™s an ancestral sport that amalgamates gymnastics with martial arts. Two of its versions include- the rope version and the hanging one! Here men flaunt not only their extraordinary strength, valor and prowess but also immense mental strength and concentration as they carry out their stunts.
