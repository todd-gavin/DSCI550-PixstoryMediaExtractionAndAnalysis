Has it ever happened to you when you opted for the best product from a large pool but then felt dissatisfied from your choice as it wasn't able to live upto your expectations? Worry not, this problem is faced by almost everyone. As the number of alternatives to decide from increases, one might think it is for the better, but it's the exact opposite. The variety of products makes you reluctant to buy one as you weigh the pros and cons. Even if you buy the most suitable one for your purpose, you will suffer from buyer's remorse. It was stated that an overabundance of choices can lead to anxiety, indecision and dissatisfaction. To know more about it, I recommend the book 'The Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less' by Barry Schwartz. In it, he elaborates the reason and links it to the inherent human greed for things not in his possession.
