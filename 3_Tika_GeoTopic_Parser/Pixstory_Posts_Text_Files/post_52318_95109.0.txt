If the second season of Euphoria taught us anything, it's that this is now Sydney Sweeney's world, and we're grateful to be a part of it.

For a variety of reasons, the HBO star has quickly become a fan favourite. Of course, there's her outstanding acting. But then there's her style: the dreamy Gen Z meets classy mashup. When she's not dressing up like a country music star — "In a good way or a bad way!?" will forever be stuck in our heads — she's hitting the red carpet, swimming, or relaxing at home in a reindeer onesie.

Sydney truly has the ability to do it all. Sharpay Evans would pay anything to be her. And, to be honest, I feel the same way. Sydney's style has evolved over time, incorporating current trends while remaining true to her clean and sophisticated aesthetic. She, like pop songstress Olivia Rodrigo, has come a long way, which is why we admire her style so much.

Sydney Sweeney, Laneige's first US celebrity ambassador, wore a blue suit to the brand's immersive beauty experience. The three-piece ensemble consisted of a bandeau top, a suit jacket, and flared pants. We adore the baby clue colouring and the matching white heels.
