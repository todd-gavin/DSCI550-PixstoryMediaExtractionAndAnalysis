No one has ever been poor by giving. Let's feed the person who's watching the Moon and thinking of hunger. Let's spread our arms to give a subtle comfort of fulfillment to the ones who need. Of we are fortunate, it's for us to spread our fortunes to others manifold.
Be kind, be gentle and be handsome by giving your helping hands to some.
