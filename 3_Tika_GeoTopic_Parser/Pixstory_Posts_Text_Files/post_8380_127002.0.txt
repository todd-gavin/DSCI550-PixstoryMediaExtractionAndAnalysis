India is celebrating its 75 years of Independence today! 

Yes, that's right, 75 years! This is a monumental day in the history of our country or as a matter of fact, for the free world. India has ever since its independence, become the torch bearer of hope for humanity and the benchmark of the welfare state in the world. The country that was torn down into pieces, into two nations, looted to its decimation, exploited to its death has risen from the ashes like a phoenix and is now shining like a north star in the galaxy of nations. 

75 years might sound like an era in itself but for a nation which was left with nothing but despair, poverty, chaos, starvation, inequality and whatnot, it was a process of nation-building de novo. It's popularly saidâ€” "to change your state, you need to change your state of mind first" which India did with all its might and determination. Let's revisit some of the unimagined feats that we have achieved in these 75 years:

A nation that became independent with a poor population has achieved self-sufficiency in feeding itself, India has won world cups, Olympic golds, made marks in different sports and at all the levels, developed its space agency: reached the moon, mars, launched hundreds of satellites, developed the indigenous missile technology programme, India has won wars, helped create a nation, created a robust financial system and economy that has survived international shocks time and again, became a nuclear power, became a knowledge powerhouse that provided the world with skilled manpower to innovate for the world, has one of the most powerful armed forces of the world, became the 5th largest economy, lifted billions out of poverty, gave itself a constitution that has survived the wrath of time, brought revolutions in the industry and agriculture that made it become one of the top exporters in the world, communication and internet revolution, achieved considerable standards of equality in public sphere, made majority of its population literate and made technology become a household thing for them, a pharmaceutical powerhouse that made it survive the worst pandemic of the century...
