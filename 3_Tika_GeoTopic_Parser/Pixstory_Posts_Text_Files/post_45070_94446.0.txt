Two of the youngest stars of the US women’s national team shone brightest on Sunday as 
they scored a pair of fantastic goals.

While Trinity Rodman smashed a stunning half-volley in the NWSL Challenge Cup, her 
compatriot Catarina Macario found the back of the net directly from a corner.

Rodman's wonder strike gave her side Washington Spirit a 2-1 lead over Gotham FC, and after full-time, the match ended 3-1 in Washington's favour.

Elsewhere, across the Atlantic ocean, Catarina Macario scored directly from a corner kick to

At the hour mark, up-stepped Macario, who decided to take matters into her own hands as 
she curled home an Olimpico to give her side the lead.

Despite the best efforts of a retreating Talaslahti, the goalkeeper couldn’t prevent the ball from going in as Catarina Macario executed the perfect lob.

With the goal against Fleury, Macario, 22 has now scored in her seventh consecutive match 
for club and country, finding the back of the net a staggering nine times within that period.
