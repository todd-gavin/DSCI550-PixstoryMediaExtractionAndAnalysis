It could take longer than expected for Matteo Berrettini to recover The goal of taking part in the Paris tournament after missing out on Montecarlo Madrid and Rome The goal is to take part in the Paris tournament The extended times put participation at risk, as has he himself said Now I have started moving my hand again the recovery is proceeding with the right timing I don&#39;t want to force the timing I will only go to Paris if I am in a position to go all the way At the moment more no than yes in case I will go directly to the tournaments on grass The right hand little finger problem warned him playing a backhand in Indian Wells He and his staff thought it was inflammation instead it was a lesion of a small particle above the right little finger that serves to hold the tendon in place So every time I played his backhand the tendon moved at that point the operation was necessary It is therefore possible that he will resume directly from Wimbledon tournament in which he reached the final last year losing on It will be a different season on grass because he won&#39;t get there with so many games behind him Wimbledon The year last i got the post losing in the final next time i hope to score
