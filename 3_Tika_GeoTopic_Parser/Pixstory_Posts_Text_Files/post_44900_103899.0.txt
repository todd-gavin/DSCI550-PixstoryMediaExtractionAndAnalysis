Bulgaria will welcome North Macedonia to the Ludogorets Arena in Razgrad for the first fixture of their 2022-23 UEFA Nations League campaign on Thursday.

Bulgaria has recently had a string of poor results. They are currently in horrible condition, and their defensive line up is underwhelming. However, they will have high hopes because they will have home advantage in the first Nations League match.

In their most recent friendly match, Bulgaria lost 2-1 against Croatia on the road. With that loss, they have now lost four consecutive games. Furthermore, they have lost each of their last three games.

Meanwhile, North Macedonia has recently had some unexpected results. They just defeated strong European teams to secure a place in Qatar for the 2022 World Cup. However, they were defeated by Portugal, putting a stop to their aspirations of visiting Qatar.

North Macedonia had won three consecutive games before losing 2-0 to Portugal. One of their victories came against Italy, when they knocked them out of the World Cup with a late goal.
