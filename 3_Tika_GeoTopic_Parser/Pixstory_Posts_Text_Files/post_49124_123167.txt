Allowing cell phones in the classroom would simply be encouraging distraction We know how kids get with phones it s like taking away their time to study away from them on purpose Having so many activities available on a single device will inevitably attract children to engage in them diverting them from their primary reason for attending school Their ability to concentrate or pay attention to the teacher will most certainly be affected In the end they re just kids They don t have the kind of self control that us adults do Not to mention if some student actually wants to study and concentrate there will definitely be another one creating disturbance in the class because he is busy on his phone Cell phones are a necessity definitely but not for kids and not in schools
