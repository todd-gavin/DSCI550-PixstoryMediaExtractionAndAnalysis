We all can agree that the pandemic has been really hard on us Especially the initial phase when no one in the office knew the effects of the virus how dangerous or contagious is it We as doctors in the clinic had to take double precautions because we had to treat patients who were infected I will not lie when I say that I was anxious and scared not for me but for my family It is our duty to take care of patients at the same time protect our friends and family It was a daunting thought of coming back home from the hospital as a carrier For the first month I had to maintain my distance in the house since I used to alway be in close contact with patients of the hospital By god s grace my family never got infected and we hit high rates of recovery but I just wanted to convey how we all are in the same situation same worry and thought for our family friends and even our self We are no different than the rest of the population Ijaz Ali Jeddah National Hospital
