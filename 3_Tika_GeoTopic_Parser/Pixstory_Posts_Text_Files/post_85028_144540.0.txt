#7 Valentino Mazzola: Italy
Valentino was a member of the excellent Tornio team that was killed in a plane crash. He was regarded as the greatest Italian player of all time and an excellent all-around performer. He was unlucky not to be able to lead his country to the World Cup because his time coincided with World War II, which thwarted his World Cup dreams.
#6 George Weah: Liberia
He was a well-known club player who played for a number of top European clubs. George Weah won numerous individual awards and trophies while playing in France, Italy, and Liberia. He won FIFA World Player of the Year once and first African player to win the Ballon d’Or. 
Despite being a big club player, Weah was a mediocre international player who never got a chance to guide his country to the World Cup. Over the course of 20 years, he appeared in 75 games and scored 18 goals.
#5 Duncan Edwards (England) 
The late Ducan Edwards, best known for his work rate on the field for Three Lions, died in the Munich air disaster. Injuries cut short his career, and he only made 18 appearances for England. Despite his youth, Edwards was a highly regarded player who received praise from Sir Bobby Charlton.
#4 Eric Cantona (France)
Cantona's short temper put him in many tense situations, which harmed him at the national level, as he was given less time to play for France. Henri Michel dropped him from the 1990 World Cup squad after a feud with the head coach.
Although he had great spells under Michel Platini and Gerard Houllier, and was banned from international matches, his Crystal Palace incident saw the United player miss the 1998 World Cup.
