Now more than ever, in the current global football scenario, it seems that the FIFA Ranking is little or not representative of the performance of the national teams in the major World Championships. And above all, it does not give any indication of the actual form of the teams preparing to face the Qatar 2022 World Cup in just over a month.
For instance, let’s look at this table’s top position. Brasil, firmly at the top of the FIFA Ranking with 1841 points, has not played a World Cup final for 20 years. Of course, we might truly argue that they won last America’s Cup in 2019, but what are the real antagonists, apart from Messi’s Argentina, Uruguay and (lately) Chile? Belgium occupies second place with 1817 points. In the FIFA Ranking, however, Spain is only seventh with 1715 points, a long way from Belgium, second at 1817 points. Yet, given the remarkable rise of Belgian football, it seems like they have never gone beyond outstanding performances and a semi-final qualification at Russia 2018, but nothing more.
Luis Enrique and his Spain
It is interesting to report the point of view of Luis Enrique, Spain‘s coach, after the last Nations League games, which are often considered a hindrance for many clubs, which frequently lose key players in the crucial moment of the season. The Spanish manager was involved in strong disputes over low performances, particularly after the defeat against Switzerland. So Enrique went on and shared the performance data in official competitions: Le Furias Rojas, in the last two years, has been the only team to reach the Nations League Final four twice, with a Euro 2020 semi-final lost and a smooth qualification for the next Qatar World Cup. Nonetheless, they remain seventh in the FIFA Ranking, far from Belgium.
