On Saturday, July 16, the Saints will play the Bundesliga team at Lavanttal-Arena, the home of
Wolfsberger AC of Austria. Kickoff is scheduled for 2 p.m. local time (1 p.m. BST).

Last season, Leipzig won the DFB-Pokal Tournament for the first time in their career after
defeating SC Freiburg on penalties with a fourth-place finish in the German Bundesliga,
ensuring them a spot in the Champions League once more. It was an especially pleasant victory
for the club after losing in the final to Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund in each of the
previous two seasons.

In the most recent season, Domenico Tedesco's club advanced to the semifinals of the Europa League, where they were defeated by Glasgow Rangers, and came within one win of the championship game.

The match against Ralph Hasenhüttl's previous team will take place close to the beginning of
Southampton's summer program, with the team departing on July 13 for their base in Velden am
Wörthersee.
