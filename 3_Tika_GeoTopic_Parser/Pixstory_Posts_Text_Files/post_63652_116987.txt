 Forsaken Eternity is a melodic symphonic black metal act from Portland United States who were formed in and released their full length debut seven years later Despite that the group brings in a great level of class originality and freshness to a genre that is growing incredibly stale Here we have a relatively young band who likes to keep things fast fun and is unafraid to diversify If adventurous galloping and fun metal is your thing then you won t be disappointed for the Portland outfit certainly did not waste any time throwing the listener into crushing metal oblivion going full auto with their opener Skywards Forsaken Eternity are unmistakably black metal but there s enough flexibility in their approach that it would simply be wrong to label them just that To get a sense of the band s sound imagine if Nightwish and Dissection had a baby and then imagine if that baby went to training with Kalmah and Children Of Bodom then you basically have A Kingdom Of Ice in a nutshell Granted it is a bit of an oversimplification but it works in general Fast or slow angry or adventurous Forsaken Eternity packs enough here to keep things fresh The guitar work on this album is brilliant featuring some really great hooks and melodies while the keyboards add a strong symphonic touch Forsaken Eternity add quite a lot of diversification to this already layered album with their bunch of influences particularly when they bring in their instrumental Sonata Concertata in Cm which definitely brings in the Yngwie Malmsteen influence serving as a great interlude Then you have songs like Shadow Fortress and Endless Light that are probably the best parts of the album A Kingdom of Ice represents hard work passion skill and creativity that results in simple yet dynamic songwriting which prevents the record from sounding old or stale This is an overall brilliant debut that helps an up and coming band with great potential to define and establish a sound that can be called theirs rather some sort of boring rehash Score Highlights A Dark Divinity Shadow Fortress Endless Light A Kingdom of Ice
