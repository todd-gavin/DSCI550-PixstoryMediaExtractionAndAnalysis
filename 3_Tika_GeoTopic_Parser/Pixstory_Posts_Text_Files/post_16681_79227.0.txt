From being an actor to producer and director, Kangana Ranaut in the past few years has been going from strength to strength. The actor has added another feather to her cap as she will be turning host for a reality show ‘Lock Upp’. Ranaut is collaborating with producer Ekta Kapoor for the show.

The show will see 16 contestants being locked up in a prison for 72 days. Apart from the actor playing the host, there will be a celebrity jailer too. Taking a dig at Salman Khan’s reality show Bigg Boss, Ranaut said, “Ye koi aapke bade bhai ka ghar nahi hai, yeh mera jail hai. I will have files of every contestant and their truth."
