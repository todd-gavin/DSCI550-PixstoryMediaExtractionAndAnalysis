I dreamed of having a bicycle as a child. I was in about the third grade of school when my father bought a printed bicycle for my brother, who is two years younger than me.
But I was not allowed to ride a bicycle because they said that a girl is never allowed to ride a bicycle because she has a hymen. In Islam, women and girls are not allowed, we are Muslims. I was 7 years old and I did not even know how to wear a tent. I always longed to ride a bike only once. Every night, when I slept, I dreamed that I had a bike.
It's going to be very hard for me, I promised myself I had to learn to ride a bike, at night when everyone was asleep I would turn off the lights behind our house there was a big field I would go there I would ride a bike, sometimes in the morning I woke up wetter. 

With a lot of problems along the way, I finally learned to ride a bike. It was my biggest childhood dream.
When we came to India, my older sister bought me a bike at the first opportunity, because she knew that a bike was my favorite thing. But unfortunately, a few months later, he stole the bicycle from the parking lot of the thief's house
I have been living in India for three years and a few months, yesterday was the best day that passed. ‚ù§Ô∏è
üö¥: We rode a 50-kilometer race from üìç Tilak Nagar to üìçIndia Gate, one of the busiest roads. This is the first time I have ridden such a bike ride in India for about 7 consecutive hours.
I felt the beauties of the city up close, the cool evening wind, the excitement of the people, the heavy traffic of the city, the residential buildings, India is a beautiful city,
Calmness, freedom was something I lost last year, but I felt it again yesterday.

When you believe in your abilities. Yes, there are no obstacles in your way. It is enough to have self-confidence and perseverance,
