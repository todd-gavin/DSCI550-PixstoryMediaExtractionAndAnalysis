Olive oil is a non-tropical oil renowned for its impressive fatty acid profile and research-backed health benefits, and extensive research on it continues.

It is a fundamental component and critical source of healthy fat in the Mediterranean diet â€” a pattern of eating associated with lower risks of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.

On the other hand, coconut oil is a tropical oil. It has been a staple for thousands of years in people's diets and traditional medicinal practices across West Africa, Sri Lanka, and other parts of South Asia.
Researchers haven't studied coconut oil as extensively as non-tropical oils, like olive oil. However, emerging research is uncovering some health benefits of coconut oil, in particular, it's potential to reduce the risk of heart disease

"Compared to a tablespoon of olive oil, a tablespoon of coconut oil contains about six times the amount of saturated fat, nearly meeting the daily limit of about 13 grams that the American Heart Association recommends. High saturated fat intake has been tied to increased LDL, or "bad" cholesterol, which raises the risk of heart disease.
Furthermore, olive oil, a central component of the heart-healthy Mediterranean diet, contains beneficial polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats." New York times report.

"Between the two, olive oil is a better choice, since monounsaturated fats can have a beneficial effect on your heart when eaten in moderation and when used to replace saturated and trans fats in your diet," said Annessa Chumbley, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the A.H.A., in an email.
