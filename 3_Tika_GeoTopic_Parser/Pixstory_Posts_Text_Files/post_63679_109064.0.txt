Tool is one of the most renowned progressive rock,borderline metal bands today. Going strong since the 90s, Tool need little introduction. 

The band is known for their complex time signatures, rhythmic experimentation, hypnotic sound and philosophical lyrics.
 
A lot of people love Tool, and while undeniably talented, Tool has its flaws that make not just me, but many others from not really care for them, let alone love them. The fact is that Tool sound so similar to themselves, that at one point it is next to impossible to really imitate them because they are really good at what they do.
 
 On the other hand, Tool sound exactly like themselves, making all their songs sound the same, or in a more accurate way, you’ve heard one Tool song, you have heard all of them, because they sound so similar. Because of this, it is really easy to identity Tool songs and yet because they are so creative, Tool songs are highly distinguishable from each other and yet very indistinguishable.
 
But the worst part about Tool is not the band, it is its fans. Seriously, if you ever encounter a hardcore Tool fan then cross the street. This band has the worst, most toxic and pretentious fandom of any band or artist there ever has been. Tool fans live under this delusion that Tool is the intelligent man’s music and therefore only a person versed in philosophy or music theory can ‘really understand’ them.
 
You can point out a hundred legit flaws, but for them Tool is that Holy Book which can’t ever be questioned, and if you don’t like them then you are not ‘intelligent enough’.
 
Then apart from that, there is the horrible tendency to spout off pseudo philosophical nonsense which is not only irritating, but also stupid beyond measure. So if you are a Tool fan who is capable of taking criticism, then good for you, I only wish there were more people like you. But for those Tool fans who treat them as the Holy Grail of music, you are the biggest problem of all.
