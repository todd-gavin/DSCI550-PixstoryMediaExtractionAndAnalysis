Steps to make Suji Toast :
1. Add the suji, onion, tomatoes, green chilies, coriander, cream and salt in a bowl.
2. Mix very well and keep aside.
3. On the bread slices spread the mixture evenly with a spoon.
4. On a hot tava or griddle, add 1/2 tsp oil for each bread. Place the filling side down and cook till the onion tomatoes are lightly browned.
5. Turn over and toast the bread on the other side.
6. The bread is nicely toasted. You can flip once or twice and cook more if required. The onions can be caramelized and the bread can be toasted more.
7. Remove the suji toast.
