Amid the ongoing assembly elections in UP, Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav tweeted a video of booth capturing and wrote, “Election observers should request the Election Commission to take cognizance of a video of booth capturing at Kunda by a party representative publicly pressing the vote button on behalf of women and cancel the Kunda elections immediately. The individual in the video should be identified and arrested immediately.” While he has since deleted this tweet, its archived version can be accessed here. ( Link https://archive.is/EMKle)

The clip is widespread on Facebook.

Old video from Haryana
Alt News had already debunked this video back in November 2020, when it was being falsely circulated as scenes from polling during the Bihar elections in Dhandli. This video was actually taken during the Lok Sabha elections in 2019. We used the video verification tool InVid to break the video into multiple keyframes and reverse search them on Google. This led us to a tweet thread from May 12, 2019 carrying the video.

The user added a tweet by the Faridabad District Election Office in the thread that said the man who was entering the polling booth has been arrested. It also stated that polling was never vitiated.

On May 13, 2019, NDTV reported that the incident occurred in Haryana during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Faridabad election office confirmed that senior election officers visited the booth and saw the polling agent trying to influence ‘at least three lady voters’. He was arrested shortly afterwards.

In sum, a video of booth capturing from the 2019 Lok Sabha elections was falsely shared by Akhilesh Yadav in connection with the ongoing UP assembly polls. Officials had arrested the individual seen in the video.
