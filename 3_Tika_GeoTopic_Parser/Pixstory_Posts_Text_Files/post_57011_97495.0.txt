The Way Down is a 2021 American documentary television miniseries directed and produced by Marina Zenovich. It consists of 5 episodes and premiered with the first three on HBO Max on September 30, 2021, with the last two premiering on April 28, 2022. The series follows Gwen Shamblin Lara, the founder of a diet program, Weigh Down Workshop, and The Remnant Fellowship, a church founded by Shamblin Lara.

The unbelievable true story behind the late cult leader and founder of the Remnant Fellowship Church, the series takes viewers behind the scenes of the church's destructive hold on its community through brainwashing weight loss techniques. The documentary narrates the story of strange happenings at church, including exploitation of labour, self-enrichment of the leadership, and hypocrisy of all kinds. 

The new season of the series contains two episodes; one talks about the crash, while the other is related to how more people came to speak openly about the church's hypocrisy and their experiences after the death of Laras.

In the first episode of the series as the crash, the expert Joe Lara explains it while some other people consider it as god punishment. “When bad things happen, it’s God’s judgment,” says a former associate of Shamblin Lara. “So if He takes seven of your leaders out simultaneously, what other message could have been sent?”

"Although the first season gave the impression that the documentary ended before the story did, the second gives the opposite: that the whole story was out there long before the documentary finished telling it", reported in Washington Post.
