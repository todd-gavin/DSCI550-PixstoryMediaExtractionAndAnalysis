Delhi is also currently observing ban on Plastic. Government imposed a policy on 1st July which says 'Ban on Plastic' i.e the supply of plastic has been stopped and the people have also been asked to minimise their plastic usage. From that day onwards many people have adhered to the same. This policy correctly works in the favour of our nature, and could add up to nature friendly environment. Many animals also has to suffer because of plastic as they unknowingly consume it.
