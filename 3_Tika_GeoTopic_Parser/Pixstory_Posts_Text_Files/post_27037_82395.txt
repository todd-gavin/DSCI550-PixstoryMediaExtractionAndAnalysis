Towards the end of th semester at my time in Amity University I thought that my time at theatre was over With covid being in all it s glory the dream of coming back to normal and have a staged performance seemed far fetched But finally the dream changed and adapted into the new conditions and all of us at Ta bir Dramatic Society thought of making a short film The challenges were several from finding people to participate to having narrow windows to shoot but we kept going in order to somehow make something out of it There were moments of hope as we felt that we got on course to make something worth while but all those moments were ruined by the pandemic Everytime we thought we were on course to make something nice Covid threw us so off course that the idea of going back to production and working on the project seemed like a dream Several lockdowns and waves were plenty to plant fear inside our minds and give us a reason to stop working on the project but somehow we kept coming back Today as I write this post I feel incredibly grateful to have worked on this project to have found our way into telling this story to have turned our passion into reality Mirrorball is a story about art and hope and it will be worth your time It took a lot of effort in making it and we are proud of it Mirrorball is out on YouTube now Link
