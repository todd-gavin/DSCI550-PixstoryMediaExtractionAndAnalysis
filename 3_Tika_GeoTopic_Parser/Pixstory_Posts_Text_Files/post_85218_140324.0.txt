Espanyol vs Sevilla Probable Winners
Both Espanyol and Sevilla have done very poorly so far in the first few matches of La Liga2022/23. Sevilla have just 1 point in four matches while Espanyol have 4 points in 4 matches.Â  However, Sevilla have recently seen a managerial shift as former boss Julen Lopetegui has been sacked after the poor performances and thus Espanyol might have an upper hand in the
upcoming match. Sevilla will take some time to settle under their new system and Espanyolmight just capitalize on that.
