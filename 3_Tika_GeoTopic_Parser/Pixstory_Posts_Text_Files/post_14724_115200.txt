 You finish your food faster than everyone around you It takes about to minutes for your stomach to signal the brain that you should stop eating If you re eating rather quickly your chances of overeating increase during this minute message delay You start to feel tightness around your waist Many people think we re supposed to experience feelings of bloat or a food baby after a good meal but this is a classic sign you went a little overboard The stomach will naturally protrude slightly after eating any sort of meal But if it s to the point where you have to unbutton your pants you re obviously overdoing it You feel like you need a nap What we commonly refer to as a food coma is just a symptom of fatigue from eating too large servings When you eat in large quantities your body releases large amounts of insulin to continue to help aid with digestion and absorption As a result insulin increases the amount of serotonin and melatonin in our brain which are chemicals synonymous with sleepiness and drowsiness You frequently experience acid reflux Big meals can also induce acid reflux though by placing added pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter which can cause acid or even small amounts of food to come back up This leaves you with serious discomfort and an unappetizing taste in your mouth Your heart races and your face flushes Eating large volumes of food requires high volumes of digestion to take place in order to efficiently break down the meal And with more digestive activity comes more blood flow This in turn causes your heart to work harder and pump more blood to the gut
