New research provides evidence that insecure attachment is associated with cognitive functioning in older couples The findings have been published in the Journal of Research in Personality I came across a book chapter that mentioned how attachment could be linked to Alzheimer s disease and I was hooked said study author Rebekka Weidmann a postdoctoral fellow at the Close Relationships Lab at Michigan State University The idea that what was going on in the romantic couple could be associated with cognitive decline in later adulthood was very fascinating to me So I emailed Prof Chopik an attachment expert to ask if he was interested to collaborate on a study on attachment and cognitive health Luckily he was and we planned and conducted the Attachment and Neurodegenerative Disease study which provided the data for the current article A large body of research has demonstrated that people can be secure or insecure in their attachments to others and insecure individuals can be either anxious or avoidant Anxiously attached individuals agree with statements such as I am afraid my partner may abandon me while avoidantly attached individuals agree with statements such as I don t feel comfortable opening up to my partner The researchers had couples who had been together for at least six months complete assessments of romantic attachment cognitive impairment dementia symptoms memory performance stress and relationship satisfaction The participants were years old on average and couples had been together for an average of years Weidmann and Chopik found that insecure attachment was associated with higher stress and higher stress was linked to greater cognitive impairment for both the participants themselves and their partners More anxiously attached participants tended to report more cognitive impairment including greater skill loss and worse memory for recent events Anxious attachment however was unrelated to dementia symptoms or memory performance Avoidantly attached participants on the other hand did not show a tendency for cognitive impairment Sources
