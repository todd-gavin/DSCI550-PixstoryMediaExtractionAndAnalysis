Moms probably don t find it surprising that they can actually feel every emotion that their child is experiencing and science now has an explanation for why this is the case In a recent study published in the Journal of Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience researchers used brain imaging to assess the neural empathy pathways in mothers and adolescents in an effort to better understand the enduring and unrivalled link between mother and kid Participants were asked to imagine a family member in an unpleasant situation before putting themselves in it fictitiously According to the study s findings the authors say that women who are mentally well have an inbuilt drive to make sense of and respond to their child s feelings and behaviours over the lifespan In order to be selective and protective of her own offspring this maternal emphatic bias has deep evolutionary roots at the brain level As a result mothers empathy encourages beneficial developmental outcomes in developing children such as emotional stability and controlled stress reactivity More surprisingly the researchers found that teenagers empathised with their mothers depending on the quality of their ties In reality teens ability for empathy increases in direct proportion to the strength of their mother child attachment
