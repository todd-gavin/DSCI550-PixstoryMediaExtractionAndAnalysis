Erling Haaland (Borussia Dortmund)
The awkward blonde behemoth has become the most sought-after player on the planet in the last 18 months. He's fast, he's big, and he can find the net's corner even when his eyes are closed. He also has a track record of delivering when it matters the most. Dortmund had a difficult season last year, but imagine how much worse it would have been if they hadn't had this truly world-class talent leading the line.

Karim Benzema (Real Madrid)
After all, in the 2010s, BBC was the main attraction in Madrid, and Benzema was a key member of that trio. The Frenchman hasn't slowed down over the years, leading from the front with power, hard-running, exceptional passing, and, as Chelsea found out the hard way last season, an unteachable eye for goal. Thank you very much; he's just as golden as the rest of your Galacticos.

Kylian Mbappe
Even since his amazing entrance into European football, Kylian Mbappe has progressed in leaps and bounds, becoming a fine left-winger last season and the focal point of the MMN front this season. He moves at a rapid pace, has an uncanny eye for goal, and exudes subtle flair.

Harry Kane (Tottenham Hotspur)
The England captain has developed into a Swiss Army knife of a forward, with passing range to make any deep-lying playmaker weep and off-the-ball mobility to tear any defence apart. To be honest, he was beneficial to Tottenham Hotspur last season.
