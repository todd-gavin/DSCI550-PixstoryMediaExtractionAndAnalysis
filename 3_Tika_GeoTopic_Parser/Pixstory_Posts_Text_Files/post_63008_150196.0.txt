The coastal Fort Myers area, from Englewood to Bonita Beach, is expected to experience seawater pushing onto land on Wednesday in amounts between 12 and 18 feet, according to forecasters. The forecast is only marginally less for the areas from Bonita Beach to close to the Everglades (8 to 12 feet) and from close to Bradenton to Englewood (6 to 10 feet), according to forecasters.
Other locations, notably north of Tampa and along Florida's northeast coast close to Jacksonville, might experience a lower but still deadly surge.
"Catastrophic wind damage" is occurring in southwest Florida. According to the hurricane centre, winds near Hurricane Ian's centre could reach 190 mph with gusts as high as 150 mph. Wind gusts exceeding 100 mph have already been recorded in numerous locations, including Sanibel Island.
Hurricane warnings have been issued for not just much of central Florida from coast to coast, but also for much of southwest Florida as Ian is predicted to maintain hurricane strength for a while when it traverses the peninsula.
12 to 24 inches of rain might fall in central and northeastern Florida, including Tampa, Orlando, and Jacksonville, as the storm is predicted to slow down. As a result, there is a top-of-the-scale risk of flooding rainfall in this region.
