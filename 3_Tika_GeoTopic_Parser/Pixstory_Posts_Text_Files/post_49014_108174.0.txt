Plastic straws account for 0.03 percent of global ocean pollution, while fishing nets account for 46% of global ocean pollution. Because fish retain a high amount of ecosystem nutrients in their tissues, transport nutrients farther than other aquatic animals, and excrete nutrients in dissolved forms that are easily available to primary producers, fish play a key role in nutrient cycles. Around intensive fish farms, waste from fish feed and faeces can pollute the water and seabed, resulting in poor water and sediment quality. Chemicals and pesticides (which are used in certain fish farming to manage parasites and disease) can potentially contaminate the environment and have an impact on nearby marine species. By undermining the resilience of many marine species to climate change, overfishing makes marine fisheries production more vulnerable to ocean warming, and sustained warming will thwart efforts to recover overfished populations. Mercury levels in some fish species can also be exacerbated. The danger extends beyond environmental degradation. It might lead to a food crisis and the loss of jobs for some of the 60 million people who work in the fishing sector directly or indirectly. So when I say you're making little to no difference by using paper straws, I am not kidding you. I think the best way to save the fish is by not killing the fish.
