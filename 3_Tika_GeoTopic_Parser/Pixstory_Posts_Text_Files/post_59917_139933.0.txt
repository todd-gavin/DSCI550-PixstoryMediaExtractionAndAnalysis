In Haryana, a 102-year-old man who was listed as dead on official documents went on strike on Wednesday to protest the state's decision to stop paying him a pension. To show that he was still alive, Duli Chand from the Rohtak district went before the media. Later, he organised a procession in the city in support of his claim and urged the government to reinstate his pension as soon as possible.
Since my previous old-age pension was withdrawn in March because official records indicated I was dead, Mr. Chand said, "I have been trying in vain to prove that I am still alive. His Aadhar card, PAN card, family ID, and bank statements were all displayed in front of the media as confirmation of his identification.
His grandson claimed that despite waiting more than a month for a response, he had filed a complaint with the Haryana Chief Minister's Grievances Redressal and Monitoring System.
When Mr. Chand spoke with the media, Naveen Jaihind, the old president of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) unit in Haryana, urged that his old-age pension be reinstated right away.
"It is regrettable that such senior citizens are being bullied by having their pensions stopped. Despite a complaint being filed with the Chief Minister's grievance redressal cell, nothing concrete has been done "He grumbled.
