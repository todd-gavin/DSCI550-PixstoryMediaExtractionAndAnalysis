When Trump became President, there was a sense when Donald Trump took office that he would be outmatched by the massive administration he had just inherited. And yes, he outmatched them, but not in a good way. 

I would like to borrow a few choice words of George Packer when he said that the new president was rash, naive, and almost chemically inattentive, whereas the bureaucrats were seasoned, astute, and protective of their institutions. They knew where the power levers were, how to use them, and how to prevent the president from using them. 

Trump's White House was chaotic and nasty, unlike any other in American history, but that didn't matter as long as "the adults" were there to stifle the president's irrational impulses, deflect his worst ideas, and quietly pocket the president's destructive instructions.

Trump was a narcissistic President who wanted financial gains for himself by imposing his will on others. 

The reports of AmericanProgress tell us that President Donald Trump's first 100 days exposed that his true policy goals were benefiting companies and the wealthiest few at the expense of everyone else, despite months of campaign promises to aid average Americans. Broken pledges, blatant conflicts of interest, and a blatant degradation of openness, ethics, and other democratic principles have defined his and his administration's conduct. Trump promised the American people as a candidate that "we'll win so much, [we'll] be sick and tired of winning." Wall Street, private prisons, the oil sector, and Trump's own family were the only ones gaining, not the American people.

Sure, that sounds “good”.
