Some of Sarah Hyland's former Modern Family co-stars were there at her recent wedding to her longtime partner Wells Adams in California.

All 11 seasons of the popular ABC comedy Modern Family, which aired from 2009 to 2020, featured Hyland as Haley Dunphy. Adams and Hyland started dating in 2017, and two years later, in 2019, they were engaged.

Adams is a radio host who has previously featured on The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise, two reality competition programmes. Additionally, he appeared in The Bachelorette's 12th season, where he placed ninth overall. Jordan Rogers was the season's victor.

Before this, Hyland and Adams had been scheduled to wed multiple times, but the COVID-19 epidemic kept forcing them to postpone the wedding. Two years after their first wedding date, in August 2020, they finally tied the knot last weekend after multiple postponements.

Many famous people, including Hyland's Modern Family co-stars Julie Bowen, Nolan Gould, Sofia Vergara, and Jesse Tyler Ferguson, attended the wedding, which was held in a vineyard in California. In the episode, Bowen portrayed Hyland's on-screen mother, Claire, and Gould portrayed Hyland's on-screen brother, Luke.

Vergara, who portrayed Gloria Delgado on Modern Family, attended the wedding with her son, Manolo Gonzalez Vergara. Ferguson played Mitchell Prichett, the uncle of Haley played by Hyland, brought his husband, Justin Mikita, to the wedding. 

Vergara shared a number of pictures from the event to her Instagram account, including a few with Bowen, Gould, Ferguson, and other attendees.

Hyland has appeared in a variety of modest roles in movies and TV shows since her stint in Modern Family, and she will also play the lead in the upcoming TV series Pitch Perfect. Presenting the US version of Love Island at the moment.
