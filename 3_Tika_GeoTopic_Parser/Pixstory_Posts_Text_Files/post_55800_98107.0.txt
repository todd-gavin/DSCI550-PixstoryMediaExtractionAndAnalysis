A Fraction of the Whole, by Steve Toltz, was published in 2008 and is a more picaresque tale.

It follows three generations of a quirky Australian family and the individuals who surround them. 

It follows the Dean family as they try to make their mark on the world, a journey that is both scathingly amusing and profoundly moving. 

Their son Jasper, in particular, concocts absurd schemes to improve the world, all while being haunted by his strangely vanished mother and a bizarre recurring vision. Is he condemned to become the lunatic father who reared him, or is he going to become a different type of mad?

This book is surely a page turner and should be next on your TBR!
