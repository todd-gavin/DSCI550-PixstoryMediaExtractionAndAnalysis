Well, I don't think any part of the award-giving system is free from unfair treatment.
Even the most renowned awards like the Oscars end up falling in the line where they promote some sort of supremacy and become ignorant of the fact that there are people who actually deserve their acknowledgement and consider it important.
With times things have changed and honestly speaking, even the jury members who are part of voting don't play fairly.
Everyone is there to do business irrespective of what they should really choose when deciding the winners.
Award ceremonies are more like a "carnival of immodesty", portraying and boasting their name and fame.
There's less than the least part of people left who actually care about the work, the movies, music, filmmaking or any artwork.
The hype is more important than the actual work, as all we need is content and red carpet appearances that will make headlines for days and weeks before and after the ceremonies.
Movie awards are completely trivialised and wasted, although there could be chances that some awards apart from movie awards are fair, like if we speak of literature awards or the ones acknowledging novels and books like bookers prize.
