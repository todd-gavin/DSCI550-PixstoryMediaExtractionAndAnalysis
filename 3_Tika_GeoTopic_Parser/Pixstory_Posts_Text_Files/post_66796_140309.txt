The tweets above are from African American professors outlining just their disgust for the Queen If these were directed at anyone else I would be offended but when it s directed against the person who spearheaded evils like colonialism and slavery its very hard to argue that they are wrong for their hatred towards that person If you take a walk down the history lane you will realise that the British Empire were the perpetrators of Slavery and the evils of Colonialism are still something that nbsp many countries suffer from So I don t find anything wrong with their anger or the tone which they have used for the former Queen Because let s be honest here the last colony to be liberated was South Africa in so it s not like she wasn t involved in it She has actively reaped benefits of colonialism
