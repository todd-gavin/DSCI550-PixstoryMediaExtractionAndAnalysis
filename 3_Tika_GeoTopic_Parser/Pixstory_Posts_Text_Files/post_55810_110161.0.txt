Alexis Wright is a member of the Wanyi nation of the Gulf of Carpentaria. She is a formidable writer of non-fiction, including Grog War, a study of alcohol abuse in Australia’s Northern Territory, and Tracker, a collective memoir of the Aboriginal leader Tracker Tilmouth. 

Lyrically complex, with sprawling narratives, Wright’s fiction centers Indigenous ecological knowledge in stories that revolve around ecological responsibility and land tenancy, drawing on oral storytelling traditions and myth. 

Her best work is The Swan Book—one of the earliest works of climate change fiction to exist encountered—which follows a mute young woman taken away from her home in the North to a Southern city flooded by the rising oceans.
