You can hear the faint drumbeats from Ukraine But the war has already commenced on one front information In an unprecedented move the US has started releasing some intelligence gatherings to prevent Russia from making a false case for an invasion The propaganda war has its benefits but there are risks too It s being called prebuttal exposing Russia s false flag operations to cook up a pretext to teach Ukraine a lesson This month the White House said the intelligence findings show Russia was laying the groundwork that frames Ukraine as an aggressor in the crisis Russia had sent operatives who could carry out acts of sabotage against Russia s own proxy forces and then blame the acts on Ukraine Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the intelligence was very credible Last month the US leaked to media an intelligence briefing which in earlier times wouldn t have been made public It released a map of showing positions of Russian troops in readiness for a massive military offensive against Ukraine Britain too joined the game last week saying Russian intelligence officers had been in contact with a number of former Ukrainian politicians as part of plans for an invasion Britain also said it had information Russia was considering former Ukrainian lawmaker Yevhen Murayev as a potential candidate to head a pro Russian leadership Though the British foreign ministry declined to reveal the source of this information it can be assumed it was spying Experts welcome this new trend since it factors in the public opinion But it has drawbacks too It can unwittingly expose sources and agents on ground In case of developing events publicity can preclude further access to information Intelligence assessments are often not hard and concrete they may shows only possibilities Photos of troop movements in themselves don t make a sound case In reply Moscow has cited past American intelligence failures for example the fiasco over Iraq s weapons programs In any case while Russia loves to engage in disinformation campaigns it has made itself proof from any negative publicity So it doesn t stand to lose anything from western prebuttals
