We have you covered whether you are planning a move to Australia for your international education journey or you have recently arrived and are still trying to get your head around everything. When you think of Australia, you might think of furry native animals, sports, and beer. But there's a lot more to what makes Australia the rich, diverse country that it is. We've compiled a list of the top nine things you should know about Australian culture, so let's get started.

1.The main values of Australians support equal rights and equal opportunity.

Australians are known for their open-heartedness and open-mindedness, and they believe that everyone has the right to a fair chance. This is evident in the widespread support for publicly funded health care and education systems. Australia is less socially hierarchical than England and is extremely multicultural, with the majority of the world's religions practised here. The Australian culture is a one-of-a-kind blend that cannot be compared to anything else.

2.Australia's Indigenous people are the world's oldest living civilization. 

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have lived in the country for 60,000 years. A special connection to the land, as well as a commitment to family and community, are important aspects of Aboriginal culture. The rights of various Aboriginal groups to live and manage on specific pieces of land are documented through art, stories, song, and dance.
