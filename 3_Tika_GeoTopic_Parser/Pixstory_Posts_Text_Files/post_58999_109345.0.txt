From Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport in Guwahati, it will take about 30 minutes to drive along National Highway 37. You will arrive to "Radisson Blu," one of Guwahati's most opulent hotels. The hotel is now the focal point of the nation's political upheaval. 42 Shiv Sena MLAs are currently camped here, thus this is why. Whose absence would nearly bring Maharashtra's Uddhav Thackeray government to its knees.

All of a sudden, this opulent hotel in Guwahati has taken on national significance. What's inside or the level of service the customers receive within the hotel has expanded recently.

Sources claim that 70 hotel rooms have been "booked" for a week. It is still unclear who did it. However, the Shiv Sena and Independents are among the 55 MLAs that are members of the house. The source added that renting the hotel for a week cost Rs 56 lakh. In addition to this, daily expenses total Rs 8 lakh, including food. That is, one crore 12 lakh rupees over the course of seven days. The price of private flights and the cost of a taxi from the airport to the hotel will be added to this. There are additional costs as well.

Looking at the hotel's website reveals that this month, every available room has already been rented out.
