Haji Najib narrowed his eyes as he focused on a shopkeeper yelling and waving his arms angrily at a small boy who skittered away in a flash and was gone, laughing as he waved his stolen treat triumphly in the air as he ran.

Haji Najib smiled as he saw the scene unravel in front of him, realizing he was looking at a glimpse into his own childhood.

Time had hardened him,transforming from a mischievous boy who would drive the shopkeepers crazy, to somehow a grandfather of the little boy he now carried on his back. How time could fly by so fast, and yet somehow, he felt that nothing had changed.

He laughed and shook his head as he remembered the beatings he would get from his father, when he'd stumble home with his pockets filled with stolen sweets. The beatings were worth the sweets though; somehow they tasted better when he'd steal them.

He wondered if the little boy had found a secure place to indulge in his stolen treasures yet. Ahhh what a thing childhood was, he thought. And he realized he was carrying yet another generation of childhood on his back, the little baby who had yet to taste the adrenaline and victory which these small moments would bring.

He crossed the street to the shopkeeper who was still fuming about the little thief, muttering curses angrily under his breath. Haji Najib let out a booming laugh, which startled the shopkeeper. He looked up irritated, as though annoyed that his string of vile curses had been interrupted.

"Don't let it get to you Shah Jan," Haji Najib told him, still grinning." Let these children live out their childhood with these fleeting moments of happiness. Anyways, we both know that you were just a good thief as any of us back in the day."

The shopkeepers face softened as he heard the teasing tone in Haji Najib's voice and he shook his head, starting to smile as though he was surrendering to Haji Najib's point.
