Vegas odds still have the Kings winning games this year This what I was also predicting a few weeks ago and history definitely says that that is a realistic optimistic guess But there is something different in the air this year Rumors are growing of a shadow in the West Whispers of a nameless fear De Aaron Fox and Domantas Sabonis have the potential to be good to great relative to their positions And surrounding those two in the middle of the floor with shooting from Keegan Murray Harrison Barnes and Kevin Huerter or Malik Monk should make this team a tough cover On the defensive side of the ball Brown has shown he has zero tolerance for not competing at a high level Note all of the quick timeouts he has called when someone misses a defensive assignment within the first minute of the last game We are not dealing with Luke looking lost on the sidelines Walton here And Brown actually has some good defensive pieces to work with It was only the preseason but the team showed great dedication to defense and they have the defensive players to back it up The team will surely have early losing streaks that challenge their confidence and make them think they are the same Kangz from the last years I am particularly interested in seeing how they respond in those low points My bet is this is the year they will not crumble but will instead rise to the occasion and the rest of the league will look on and ask Who is this arising like the dawn fair as the moon clear as the sun and terrible as an army with banners
