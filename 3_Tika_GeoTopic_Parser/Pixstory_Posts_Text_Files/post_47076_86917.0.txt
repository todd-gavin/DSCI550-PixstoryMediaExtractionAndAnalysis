Skip Bayless slams against the nine-time NBA All-Star, claiming LeBron James must compensate for the former's shooting woes
Skip Bayless of Fox Sports reacted sarcastically to LeBron James' 50-point effort against the Washington Wizards. According to Bayless, James' most significant accomplishment during the game was compensating for Russell Westbrook's poor performance.
Westbrook had a bad night, scoring five points on two of eleven field goal attempts and one of four free-throw attempts. The former Oklahoma City guard's playmaking was crucial to the game's outcome, as he dished out nine assists.
Bayless, on the other hand, went after Westbrook, accusing him of being the league's third-worst free throw shooter and third-worst three-point shooter. He stated the following on Twitter:
"Best thing LeBron did tonight was overcome yet another horrendous shooting night by Westbrick - 2-11 from the floor and 1-4 from the free-throw line. He's THE worst 3-pt shooter in the league and the 3rd worst FT-shooter.”
Russell Westbrook missed several close-range shots. At one point, the Los Angeles Lakers were trailing the Washington Wizards by nine points, but LeBron James sparked the game with a 19-point third quarter. On 18-of-25 shooting, James finished with 50 points, seven rebounds, and six assists. He made six of nine long-range shots, helping the Lakers stop a two-game losing streak.
