The first leaders' debate of the 2022 federal election campaign is on tonight. 

Here is what you need to know, and how to follow the developments.

Who is debating?

Prime Minister Scott Morrison will go head-to-head in a debate with Labor leader Anthony Albanese in Brisbane.

Mr Morrison is no stranger to leaders' debates. He took part in three during the 2019 campaign. This will be Mr Albanese's first.

The two leaders will face questions from a group of 100 undecided voters, Sky News says.

Sky's political reporter Kieran Gilbert will moderate the debate.

When is it on? 

It all starts at 7pm tonight, Wednesday, April 20.

Officially named the Sky News-Courier Mail People's Forum, the debate is taking place about a week and a half into the election campaign.

How do I watch? 

The debate will be televised on Sky News Australia.

We'll also be covering it in our election live blog.

What issues might feature in the debate?

These are some of the key themes that have emerged so far:

Debate over what a national anti-corruption watchdog would look like, and whether voters even care

Katherine Deves, Mr Morrison's pick for the seat of Warringah, has come under intense scrutiny and apologised repeatedly for a series of social media posts in which she made controversial comments about transgender people

There have been gaffes. Mr Albanese couldn't name the unemployment rate on the first day of the campaign, while Mr Morrison said he "misspoke" when he got details of the unemployment benefit wrong

The Coalition was quick to jump on Mr Albanese's language on immigration and offshore detention

Scare campaigns have emerged early. Mr Morrison has turned to the decade-old issue of mining and carbon taxes. Labor is promoting a spurious claim that the Coalition intends to put all age pension payments onto cashless debit cards.  

If you feel like this campaign has gone back to the future, you're not the only one.
