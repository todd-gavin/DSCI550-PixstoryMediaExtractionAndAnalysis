In a recent interview with the digital platform TALENTO A BORDO Rafael Nadal weighed in on what he thought was the perfect definition of talent The year old stated that in sport the player who wins the most is the most talented one Talent is something that I think people get a little bit confused about For me it s not playing pretty or hitting the ball very hard Some have the talent to hit hard others to not miss any ball some to make a great cut and others to move very well But in tennis as in all sports the ultimate goal is to win So for me the summary is clear the one who wins is the one with the most talent Nadal said Tennis fans have since taken to social media in reaction to his words While some agreed with Nadal a lot of people had different opinions Some even suspected that the Spaniard might be taking a dig at Roger Federer since the Swiss now stands third in the Grand Slam race behind Nadal and Novak Djokovic
