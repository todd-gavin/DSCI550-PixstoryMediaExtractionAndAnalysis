Bella Hadid walked the runway at the end of the Coperni Spring/Summer 2023 show in Paris Friday evening wearing only nude underwear.
The model was then surrounded by a group of "scientists" who sprayed her body with a liquid that turned into a dress.
Per Vogue Business, the technique was created by Fabrican -- the liquid contains cotton and other synthetic fibers. Even more wild, the solution can be removed and reused in a similar manner.
