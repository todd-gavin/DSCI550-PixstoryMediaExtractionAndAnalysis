On the road to Jammu, Verinag is another spring of great significance and beauty with deep blue water that also springs from the base of a high scarp of a mountain spur. Jehangir constructed a pleasure garden and a summer residence here. The Emperor Jehangir has built an octagonal pavement around the spring. The Emperor was so enamoured of Verignag's beauty that, while he was ailing at Chengas Village near Rajouri, he asked to be buried there.
And following the spring's construction and the design of the adjacent garden, he said that it is difficult for a traveller to name another location of such beauty after having travelled the length and breadth of the earth. About 26 kilometres from Anantnag Town, in the Tehsil of Shahabad Bala, is this tourist destination. The area has been developed with a tourist bungalow, a rest area, and some huts.
