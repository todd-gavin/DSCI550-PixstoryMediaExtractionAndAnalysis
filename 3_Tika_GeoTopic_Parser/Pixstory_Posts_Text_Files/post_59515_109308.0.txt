INCREASE THE DEVELOPMENT OF WOMEN'S FOOTBALL 

FIFA continues to place a high priority on women's football since it represents the game's greatest chance for expansion. Despite the fact that the game has developed rapidly at all levels, there is still a tonne of unrealized potential due to the sport's growing popularity and love. In order to elevate women's football to its rightful place in society, FIFA is investing in specialised money, human resources, and creative, specialised development programmes.
