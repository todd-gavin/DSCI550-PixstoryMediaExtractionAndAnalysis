Google and the US space agency worked together to assist local governments monitor and forecast air quality more effectively. In order to produce high-resolution air quality maps very instantly, NASA and Google will create cutting-edge machine learning-based algorithms that combine space data with Google Earth Engine data streams. “We’re thrilled about our partnership with NASA to make daily air quality more actionable at a local level," said Rebecca Moore, director at Google Earth, Earth Engine and Outreach at Google.News 18 reported that the outcomes will lead to the assessment and forecasting of dangerous pollutants, like nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter, at the city-scale and in close to real-time. Two brand-new, automatically updated NASA data sets have been added by Google to the Earth Engine Catalogue. These include information from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 and the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Composition Forecasts (GEOS-CF) (MERRA-2).To map and forecast areas with poor air quality, these provide satellite observations of contaminants. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), harmful air pollution causes harm to both people and the environment and accounts for around 7 million annual deaths globally.
