What is anxiety?

Hope you never have experienced anxiety but if you ever did that, it's a painful , exhausting experience mentally.

But if you never had the experience , and want to understand how it looks and how it feels?

I could list some symptoms to identify it but there's a better way to understand it.

A short film by Contentkakeeda named - What is anxiety - Mental health motivational video.

This twenty one minute long short film beautifully portrays the concept of anxiety.

And also shows it's not due to a problem that exists ,it can persist after the problem disappeares.

It also shows the ignorance of the topic , and also of the anxiety of our loved ones after not being able to identify it or after ignoring it.

But atlast it shows that how we can overcome anxiety !

This is a great initiative and would a great recommendation to have a better understanding of concept.

Thank you for reading
