Let's talk about still evolving women's representation in films. We see films every day and women being naked is the main part of most of the movies. Can we count it as a celebration of sexuality? No how can it be when only women are celebrated? It isn't a celebration but it is the male gaze which views women as objects of sexual appeal. 

Women were largely represented as mothers, caretakers, and sacrificers. When a woman breaks the societal norms she is a villain and nothing else. When she chose to live on her terms she is imperfect. She always had to find 'true love, which makes her complete. However, empowering she may be, in the end, she will be a perfect mother and wife. 

Where are the imperfect, normal women in the cinema, why are still very less women superheroes and why does the audience cant accept and acknowledge a women superhero as they admire a male superhero. Why do cheap romances still win box office when good quality movies that discuss real issues of women fail. Does this mean the film industry has achieved supremacy over equality? We can see differences and representations but how many? Most importantly is being well-received.
