Assuming that liking the music is a given its all about the performance. Listening at home the music is still great but its only the music, at a concert you have the complete performance. The theatrics of the show, the lighting, the interactions between performer and audience and also within the audienceâ€¦..all of this combined make a live experience so much more than listening at home.
