As we enter in the final part of the Valentine’s week, Love needs to be expressed like never before. Here we talk about a movie which shows love as is. Not only the love shared in a romantic relationship, but also the love people have for their life, the love they have for their dreams, their passions. 

La La Land is set in L. A. where Sebestian portrayed by Ryan Gosling is a struggling artist trying to figure out a way to rejuvenate the love for Jazz in people and open his own club. 

Mia portrayed by Emma Stone is a struggling actress going from audition to audition trying to find her way into Hollywood and leave her mark. Mia and Seb first encounter is one that is very interesting. 

Through the course of the movie Mia and Seb fall in love with each other and their respective arts and passion. Their musical journey is one for generations to watch, enjoy and learn from, learn how one move can change the whole course of the story, how sometimes “letting go” is the most loving thing to do. 

La La Land is the perfect Valentine’s watch for you and your partner and don’t forget to raise a toast to the ones who dream, foolish as they may seem.
