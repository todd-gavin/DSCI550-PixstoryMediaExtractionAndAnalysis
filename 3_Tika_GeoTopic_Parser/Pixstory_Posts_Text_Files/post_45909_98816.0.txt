Children are a product of their parents love and every child in the center of their parents’ universe. 

As soon as it are brought in this world, a child becomes the sole focus of its parents and they keep themselves on the back burner for the rest of their lives. 

Parents go hungry but they always endure that their child is full, they might wear sub quality clothes and may not have had access to premium quality education but do better than their best to ensure that their child has the best. 

Parenting is a tough road and parents are only humans so they are bound to make mistakes. That doesn’t mean we call them “toxic”. Due to a generation gap, there might be some decisions of parents that the child may not agree with but at the end of the day, they have the best interests of their child in mind. 

Moreover, the world is a cruel place and it’s the job a parent to not only protect their child but also prepare them for the world. 

The fact that they have a lot more experience of life cannot be ignored and it’s their duty to use this experience to make sure that their child does not make the same mistakes they did. 

There are various ways to do this and to each his own. Being “strict” or “controlling” is a part and parcel of parenting and it always comes from good intentions.

However, it is true that one can only realise this when they become parents themselves.
