Good Morning, Veronica is a Netflix crime drama that was created by Raphael Montes, who also wrote the novel on which the show is based. The first season was released in October 2020, and the second season was released on Netflix on August 3, 2022. 

I have been waiting for s2 for a long time now and am definitely going to watch this before anything else! 

The show has Tainá Müller, Elisa Volpatto, Adriano Garib, Silvio Guindane and César Mello in the lead. Season 2 will focus on how veronica will bring justice to society as everyone thinks she is dead, but in reality, she isn’t.
