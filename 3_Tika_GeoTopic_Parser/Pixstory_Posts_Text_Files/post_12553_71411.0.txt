According to the Alzheimer’s Association, keeping your brain active may help increase vitality and possibly generate new brain cells. They also suggest that a lack of mental stimulation may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.

Here are a few tips and tricks to keep your brain stimulated:

▪️Spend some time each day reading, writing, or both.
▪️Never stop learning. Take a class, go to a lecture, or try to acquire a new skill.
▪️Tackle challenging crossword and sudoku puzzles.
▪️Play memory games, board games, card games, or video games.
▪️Take on a new hobby that requires you to focus.
▪️In addition to thinking exercises, your brain benefits from a good physical workout. Just 120 minutes of aerobic exercise a week can help improve learning and verbal memory.
▪️Avoid junk food and be sure to get all the essential nutrients you need through diet or dietary supplements. And, of course, aim for a full night’s sleep every night.
