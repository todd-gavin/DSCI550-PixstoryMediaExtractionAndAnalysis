The Polytechnic of Milan and the European Institute of Oncology today kick off a framework agreement for scientific research through the establishment of the joint research center ONCO TECH LAB Modeling and Applications for Human Health which will combine the know-how of the Polytechnic of Milan in artificial intelligence in robotics and cutting-edge tissue engineering technologies and the extensive knowledge of the IEO in the life sciences. For IEO, the objective of the agreement is also that of developing a new research culture that embraces the technological development of discoveries. on the discovery and publication of data to the new logic of concrete application of research products it is difficult for a laboratory researcher to think of research even in terms of patents or start-ups However, this evolution is essential today to increase the research machine Technology plays a fundamental role today biomedical research can no longer feed itself but needs a technological ring around it that allows it to develop into models and applications for health Currently this role is played by various incubators and start-ups that revolve around IEO The agreement with the Polytechnic will allow us to have a single reference partner capable of participating and contributing to the entire research process from hypothesis to application declares Roberto Orecchia Scientific Director of the IEO The birth of ONCO TECH LAB explains Guido Baroni Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the Milan Polytechnic and coordinator of the joint Research Center represents both a point of arrival and a relaunch of scientific and clinical research collaborations between the Politecnico di Milano and the European Institute of Oncology in the field of tissue engineering and artificial intelligence applications to diagnostic imaging and surgical robotics in the oncological field The initiative stems from the awareness that the synergy between biomedical research and technology is the winning strategy for bringing together different skills and developing a common language to support research and training This is the model implemented in ONCO TECH LAB a multidisciplinary flywheel for transfer scientific discoveries into the reality of patient care in an increasingly efficient way
