Indian streetfood is one of the best I've tasted, I don't know about you but we call it bhelpuri here where I live and its bomb I tell you, I'm pretty basic when it comes to my food actually, I'm not much of a foodie. But when it comes to trying out different streetfoods, I always choose Indian and bhelpuri tops it. I've always loved spicy and savoury stuff over sweet one, and it is the perfect savoury and the one I gravitate towards the most.
