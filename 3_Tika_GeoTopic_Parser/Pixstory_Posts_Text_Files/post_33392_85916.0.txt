Visit to Narwar fort continues.....

There is no mention of Narwar till the next 150 years, but it seems probable  that the last Parihar Raja, who made his escape from Gwalior when the Fort was captured by Iltutmish in AD 1232, must have sought refuge in the neighbouring stronghold of Narwar. He is called Sagar or Sarang Deo by the Hindu Chroniclers, but by the Muhammadan historians he is styled Milak Deo, son of Basil and Deobal. From the tradition of the Kacchwahas it is believed that Narwar must have fallen into the hands of the Parihar Prince of Gwalior in AD 1129.  It is certain that 19 years after attack of Iltutmish in AD 1251, Narwar was in the possession of a Hindu Raja called Chahada Deva, who is said to have strengthened the fortress, and who surrendered the fortress to Nasir-ud-din Mahmud of Delhi. Regarding Chahada Deva, in one of the Narwar inscriptions it is said that he belonged to the royal race, which indicates that he may not have belonged to the Parihar dynasty. Coins of Chahada Deva are dated in AD 1246 to 1254 and of his son Asala Deva from AD 1254 to 1279. Similar coins are found of Malaya Verma Deva from 1280 to 1290 AD. Ferishta has also given an account of the siege of Narwar, where the host was defeated with great slaughter after a few months siege.

Inscription of 1270 AD at the Sati Pillar near Kulharas bears the names of Asala Deva, son of Chahada Deva and another at Narwar Fort records  him as the grand father of Raja Gopala who made a grant. As coins of Gopala and Ganapati are not found though their names are found in inscription of the genealogy of 1231 at a baoli at Sarwaya, it is inferred that they must have become tributaries of the Sultan of Delhi. It seems probable that the expedition recorded by Ferishta in AD 1293 may have been directed against the king of Narwar.
