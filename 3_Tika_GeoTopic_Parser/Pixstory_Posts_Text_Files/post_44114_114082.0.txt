With the addition of striker Sébastien Haller from Ajax, Borussia Dortmund's offensive makeover has proceeded. Erling Haaland and Steffen Tigges were previously sold by the German giants this summer in order to make room for the intriguing newcomers Karim Adeyemi and Jayden Braaf.

Sebastien Haller has officially signed a four-year deal with Borussia Dortmund from Ajax. Haller has performed admirably for Ajax, scoring 47 goals in 66 games and assisting the team in winning the previous two Eredivisie championships as well as the KNVB Cup in 2021. 

During the Champions League last season, he was in excellent form, scoring 11 goals in eight games.

Erling Haaland left a void at Dortmund after moving to Manchester City, and Haller seems poised to fill it. Prior to moving to West Ham, Haller struggled while playing for Eintracht Frankfurt, where his reputation had already started to skyrocket.

Haller's biggest talent is finishing, and Dortmund's acquisition of him seems promising. 

The Bundesliga may provide the ideal setting for the Ivory Coast international to thrive.

Haller's reputation has improved over the past two years, which led Dortmund to sign him in the hopes that he will maintain his remarkable goal-scoring streak. 

The 27-year-old will be playing in the Bundesliga for the second time; 

he previously had a fruitful two-year stint with Eintracht Frankfurt before moving on to West Ham.

Dortmund, who placed second to Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga last season, has spent over £47 million this summer before adding Haller to bolster the club. First to join the team was Niklas Sule, followed by Nico Schlotterbeck, Karim Adeyemi, and Salih Ozcan. The group is now under the direction of new head coach Edin Terzic. The start of the 2022–23 Bundesliga season is set for August 5.
