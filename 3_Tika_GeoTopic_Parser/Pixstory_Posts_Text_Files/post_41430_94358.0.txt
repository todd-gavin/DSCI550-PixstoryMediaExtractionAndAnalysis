The daffodils have sprung, the fall foliage has been brushed away, and the Boston Marathon has returned to its rightful place in the spring. 

On Monday, the world's most prestigious marathon will run from Hopkinton to Copley Square, three years after the last Patriots Day event and six months after the COVID-19 epidemic delayed, postponed, and delayed again the 125th edition. 

“We went for a run this morning and I was like, ‘OK, this is what it’s supposed to be. This feels normal,’” 2018 winner Des Linden said last week. “The energy feels right back where we left off. So that was a nice reminder.”

More than 28,000 runners have signed up for Monday's 26.2-mile marathon, including 11 former champions and what could be the quickest field ever, after a smaller and socially separated bunch ran in October.

US News reported that organizers who had 30 months between the 2019 and ‘21 events and then just 139 days since the only fall race in Boston Marathon history.

“And we can’t wait,” Boston Athletic Association President Tom Grilk said.

Monday’s forecast calls for temperatures in the 50s with no rain, and only the possibility of a slight headwind late in the afternoon for the stragglers.
