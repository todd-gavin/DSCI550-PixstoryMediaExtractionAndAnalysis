First thing first I like Tom Holland He has a certain innocent charm about him which he has retained since he started playing the star stuck Spider Man moving around Robert Downy Junior s iron man avatar As my children are avengers fans have watched everything that s avengers Holland has evolved as a good actor while retaining that boyish charm He seems most amiable So what let him to say good bye to social media What was affecting his mental health he said the reason to bade good bye was his metal Health which he has to protect Hello goodbye I have been taking a break from social media for my mental health he wrote and that s what got people wondering We all know celebrities take breaks from social media but why do they feel the need to do so Stars including Selena Gomez Kim Kardashian and Sarah Hyland have taken breaks from social media in order to refresh their minds they have said So why is there a need to do so is the negativity in social media impacting the celebs who otherwise lead very high stress life My little brain that I have tells me it must be difficult As an onlooker who is watching it from a distance and I think one needs to have a very thick skin to be social media Imagine coming back home and finding thousands of strangers abusing you your family your dress sense your food even your dog Must be difficult to deal with so much negativity and toxicity on a daily basis Social media can get scary Look at closer home Aamir khan one of the most sensitive and creative actors is facing all negativity on social media A section of people are calling for boycott his movie because of his movie PK Doesn t matter if he has had many super hits since or if the director was from the community it is supposed to have hurt Hate trolling and division Do you even want social media which propagates this Pixstory can be a better option
