Following the success of director Matt Reeves’ darker and noir oriented take on ‘The Batman’, the director had also announced a separate spin off show for the movie titled ‘The Penguin’ which as its namesake is supposed to be based on one of the most powerful crime lords of Gotham and one of the Dark Knight’s biggest enemies.
 
 Actor Colin Farrell who played the character in the movie is scheduled to play the crime boss in the series has revealed where HBO Max's upcoming series will pick up from while sharing new details about its opening scene.
 
 The actor said that he has already read the script for the first episode, and it begins just a week after The Batman concludes while Gotham City deals with the flood that occurred during the third act of the film.
 
"I read the first script for the first episode, and it opens up with my feet splashing through the water in Falcone's office. Even just that alone, I read it, I was like, 'Oh, jeez.'" Farrell said in an interview with Extra.
 
He further added “It's lovely. It's so well-written. Lauren LeFranc has done such an extraordinary job, and she's writing the whole thing and show-running. She is formidable. It's just an exciting prospect. I love that character. I was greedy with it. I felt like I didn't have enough. I wanted to do it more and more and more."
 
The actor has previously discussed The Batman director Matt Reeves's involvement with the project, saying he wouldn't direct any episodes, but he's working on every aspect of the show. "He's so obsessive about what he does, but he's all over [HBO Max's] The Penguin [series] as well. I mean, he's not gonna direct it but he's all over the structure of the scripts and who's gonna direct them. And so, it's exciting." Currently there is no release date for the series though it is likely to bring in several new elements.
