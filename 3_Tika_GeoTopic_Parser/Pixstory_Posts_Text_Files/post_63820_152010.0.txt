 Re-releases of hit games is not a new trend in Playstation, rather it seems to have become a wave as there is a whole list of remastered editions of various Playstation titles coming one after the other, most of which no one really asked for but they were made anyway. 
Now adding itself to this long list Playstation games remastered somewhat unexpectedly alongside games such as Marvel’s Spider-Man, Uncharted 4, The Last Of Us and more is Horizon Zero Dawn which is coming to PS5.
Details on the remaster are scarce at the moment and it is currently unclear whether this is a "from the ground up" remake of the 2017 title or not, but reportedly it includes new character models, lighting, and animations. 
It’s also likely that it will incorporate new accessibility features, quality of life improvements, and compatibility with the DualSense controller alongside some other improvements, be they related to visuals, mechanics or interface.
According to reports, this new remaster will bring Zero Dawn closer in terms of visuals to its successor, Forbidden West. 
In addition, reports also claim that Guerrilla Games is currently working on a Horizon multiplayer game for PS5 and PC as the studio had long intended to expand the Horizon series into the multiplayer space. 
Ultimately however, these plans never materialized so that the development team could focus on other areas of the title.
