Marnus Labuschagne and Steven Smith posted hundreds to help Australia to 298 for five at stumps on day one of the second test against Sri Lanka on Friday. IE reported that Darren Lehmann in 2004 had been the last Australian batsman to score a hundred at the spinner friendly turning tracks in Galle International Stadium.

Labuschagne, who was given a life on 28 when Niroshan Dickwella missed a stumping chance off Ramesh Mendis, posted his seventh test hundred and the first overseas while Smith hit his 28th test hundred and the second against Sri Lanka.

The pair added 134 runs for the third wicket in 223 deliveries as Australia consolidated its position. The stand was eventually broken when Dickwella completed a stump with Laubschagne on 104 to give left-arm spinner Prabath Jayasuriya his maiden test wicket. He faced 125 deliveries and hit 12 fours.

Australia, which won the toss, lost two quick wickets after Labuschagne’s dismissal as Jayasuriya made an impact. The left-arm spinner’s first 12 overs had cost 54 runs and fetched no wickets but his next 10 overs produced three wickets for 22 runs as Sri Lanka staged a comeback.
