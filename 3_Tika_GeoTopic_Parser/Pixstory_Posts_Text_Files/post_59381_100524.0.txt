Paris
Its literal meaning is "an imaginary being of myth or fable"
And to be honest, that is what I felt when I saw the Eiffel Tower with my eyes.

The Eiffel Tower has been named after its creator, Gustave Eiffel. It's an iron-built, 984 feet tall structure standing beautifully in the capital of France, Paris. It was built to be one of the main attractions at the Exposition Universelle at the Champs de Mars in 1889. It was built to celebrate the French Revolution's centennial year and its purpose was to show the other nations the power and the industrial abilities of France. 

For as long as I can remember, Paris has been my dream. Its culture, its food, its people and most of all its paintings, have fascinated me beyond words.

Since Paris is called the City of Love, whenever there's a scene where there is romance or happiness, that scene will definitely take place in the beautiful capital of France. 
A lesser known fact is that Paris is also called the City of Light because it was one of the first European cities to adopt street lighting. 

It is home to the world's biggest art museum and also the world's most famous painting ever, Mona Lisa. 

And do we need another reason to love France? If yes, then well, it has more dogs than humans. 

Safe to say, the city of love is literally loved by everyone.
