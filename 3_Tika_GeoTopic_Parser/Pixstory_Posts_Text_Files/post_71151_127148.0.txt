Wicker is the name given to items created by weaving and twisting together tiny slices of wood. Wicker willow is the term used for such crafts when willow wood is used in their production. These beautiful handcrafted wicker willow articles are known as Veer Kani or Keani Keam in Jammu and Kashmir. 

The state of Jammu and Kashmir's artisans are renowned across the world for their ability to create Kangri, or baskets, out of willow wood.

Although the willow weaving craft is commercialised, craftspeople continue to use old-fashioned methods to create wicker goods. Now, the production of Kashmiri Kangris is not the only use for willow woods. This plant is used by artisans to create a variety of items, including picnic baskets, tiffin boxes, lampshades, chairs, tables, trays, curtain rings, and cycle baskets. 

The fact that willow wicker art has not yet been mechanised is its best feature. To create beautiful items, artisans continue to handcraft the intricate interlacing of willow stems. Additionally, wickers manufactured from willows are useful in addition to being aesthetically pleasing. These goods are strong enough to support the weight of additional items.
