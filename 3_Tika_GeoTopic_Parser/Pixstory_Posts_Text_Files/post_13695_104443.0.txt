Today, June 3, coincides with World Cycling Day. Although this day is celebrated in other parts of the world, it is not celebrated in Afghanistan because of the problems that the Islamic State of Taliban has created for the people. June 3, 2018 has been designated by the United Nations as World Cycling Day. Although this day has not been celebrated this year, in previous years Afghanistan Day was well analyzed.

Pedaling for peace
I hope and wish that the girl and boy cyclist of my country will ride again without fear and apprehension. I know how hard it is to give up years of dreaming and suddenly stay home.
For the sake of peace and freedom, I feel sorry for you Afghan cyclists. And today, for the sake of peace, I am riding again to share in your grief (Pedaling for peace). I hope you will never give in to the ignorance of an ignorant group.
