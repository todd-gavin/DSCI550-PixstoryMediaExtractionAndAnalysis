The transition from high school to college is an important phase for adolescents in social as well as academic aspects.👩‍🎓📚
While your high school friends were probably in your class or sports team, you probably meet your college friends in a different way.⚡🤝
 But what if you have the same best friend who accompanied you from school to college!?🤔♥️
Isn't it the best thing ever!?🥺💕
On my personal experience I got my best friend who is always by my side since we were in high school.🎒
She's really the best.💕
Sometimes she gets jealous of my other new friends 😂but that's okay to me as she loves me so much!💕
I love her as well.She is my constant.🥺💕♾️
Hope so our friendship never dies and grows better in upcoming years!😌💕🤝
