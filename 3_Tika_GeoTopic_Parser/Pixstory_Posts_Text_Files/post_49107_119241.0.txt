I don't understand this. One moment feminists say that women don't need anyone in life and the next moment they ask men to participate in their games. Choose a side. Do you or not need men?

I don't understand why men are expected to participate in this manhating leftist propaganda. Why must we take part in something that's against us?

Men and women are created to balance each other. We are equal in the way we should be but there is a natural order of things. Even after that, today women are exercising all the rights men are. You can vote, you can work, you can seek divorce and what not? If anything, I'd say women enjoy more rights than men in certain fields!
