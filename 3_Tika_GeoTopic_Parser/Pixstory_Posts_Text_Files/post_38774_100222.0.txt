His ability to sense danger and drop deep, where he can make important interceptions and tackles is very good. Sosa usually runs back and covers his inside center-back if they are drawn out of shape defending and moving forward to help the team. His recovery pace to collect the ball is quite good. He has an impressive reading of the game. Luke Shaw and Alex Telles usually get drawn out, and they are not able to reach their defenders in time when a dangerous pass has been made.


We can see when we compare with fellow Manchester United left backs, we can see that Alex Telles beats both of them to it. All three are very poor defensively, but Telles pips both of them. Sosa has made 1.16 and 1.23 in defensive actions per game. Compared to him Shaw has made 1.37 and 1.14 defensive actions per 90. While Telles has made 2.30 and 1.80 in defensive actions. He has won total defensive duels with 57% and he made blocks 1.76 per 90. Luke Shaw has made successful defensive duels of 46% and he made blocks 2.39 per 90. Alex Telles won the duels with 54%, having made 1.75 blocks per 90. He is not a dominant defender, but he jumps to action when called upon.

Goal Scoring


Sosa is not big on scoring goals. Despite his attacking output he has managed only 1 goal. However he has made 8 assists, which is noteworthy. Compared to him Shaw has made 3 assists before he got injured, and Telles made 4 assists. Both of them have 0 goals to their name. Sosa has taken 24 total shots out of which 6 were on target.

Comparisons


Borna Sosa will surely be an upgrade over Luke Shaw and Alex Telles. His ability to not get drawn out and sticking to center backs and his attacking displays in form of crosses, passes and assists will surely interest Erik Ten Hag.


We can see that Sosa pips both of them in a lot of aspects. Apart from his defensive output, he outscores both of them in almost everything.
