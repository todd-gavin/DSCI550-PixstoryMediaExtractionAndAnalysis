AC DC is one of the most popular and enduring rock bands in history Over the course of their career they ve released some of the greatest songs ever written Though their music can be classified as hard rock AC DC s songs are often about love and life Some of my favorite songs of them would be Highway to Hell Duh Obviously A classic rock song that tells the story of a man who s been hurt by betrayal and violence in his past It features strong guitars and drums and it has become one of AC DC s most popular tracks Thunderstruck is another hit song that speaks to me the power of love It features trademark vocals from Bon Scott as well as catchy hooks that will stick in your head long after you hear it You Shook Me All Night Long is a powerful ballad about a relationship that falls apart Bon Scott belts out some amazing lyrics with emotion on this track which makes it one of AC DC s most memorable tunes Truly a wonder
