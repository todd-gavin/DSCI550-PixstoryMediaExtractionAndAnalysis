In the 1920s and 1930s, the ketogenic diet became popular as an epileptic treatment. It was created as an alternative to non-mainstream fasting, which has shown promise as an epilepsy treatment. Due to the emergence of new anticonvulsant medications, the diet was eventually widely abandoned. Although it was discovered that these drugs could effectively control most cases of epilepsy, they nevertheless failed to achieve epileptic control in roughly 20% to 30% of epileptics. The diet was reintroduced as an approach for controlling the condition for these people, particularly youngsters with epilepsy. 

Dr. Ananya Mandal wires that fasting's involvement in sickness treatment has been known to mankind for thousands of years, and it was examined in depth by ancient Greek physicians and ancient Indian physicians.

"On the Sacred Disease," a treatise from the Hippocratic Corpus, outlines how dietary changes aided epileptic management. In the collection's "Epidemics," the same author relates how a man was cured of epilepsy by fully abstaining from food and drink. 

Fasting as a cure for epilepsy was the subject of the first modern scientific investigation, which took place in France in 1911. 

In the 1960s, subsequent study revealed that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) create more ketones per unit of energy because they are delivered swiftly to the liver via the hepatic portal vein rather than the lymphatic system. In 1971, Peter Huttenlocher developed a ketogenic diet in which MCT oil provided 60% of the calories, allowing for more protein and carbohydrates to be incorporated than on the original ketogenic diet, allowing parents to cook more enjoyable meals for their children with epilepsy. Many hospitals have also embraced the MCT diet in place of the traditional ketogenic diet, but others have used both.
