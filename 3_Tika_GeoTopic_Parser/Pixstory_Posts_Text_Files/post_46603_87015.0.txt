Former US President Barack Obama turned 60 on August 4, 2021, and he apparently prepared a lavish celebration. According to reports in the US media, the former President hosted a large party over the weekend, with a guest list of roughly 500 people, give or take a few. 

Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey, and George Clooney are among those who received invitations, as have friends and family members of the Obamas' former staff. Guests were invited to donate to a list of chosen charity in lieu of gifts for the birthday boy, according to the news website Axios, which disclosed details of the celebration.

The 500-person outdoor celebration was undoubtedly expensive, but that was not a concern for the 44th President of the United States of America. The party was held at Barack and Michelle Obama's $15 million seafront residence on Martha's Vineyard, which they purchased in 2019. 

According to CelebrityNetWorth, a website that tracks such things, Barack and Michele Obama's total net worth is $ 70 million in 2021, and they made their first million from his first book royalty three years before Barack Obama became President in 2005. Barack Obama had never made more than $30,000 a year until 2004, while Michele had always made far more.
