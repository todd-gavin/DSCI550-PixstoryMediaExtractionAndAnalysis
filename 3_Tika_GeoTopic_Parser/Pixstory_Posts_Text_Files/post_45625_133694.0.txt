I have some excellent news for those All American fans who have been eagerly anticipating finding out what happens to their favourite group from Crenshaw and Beverly Hills. 

Whattowatch reported that the premiere of All American season 5 is quickly approaching, and if prior seasons are any indication, the new batch of episodes should be equally intriguing. 

So what can viewers anticipate from Daniel Ezra's (Spencer James) friends? 

The CW network in the US will broadcast the All American season 5 premiere on Monday, October 10, at 8 p.m. ET/PT. If you miss the show, it is free to watch on demand the next day on The CW app. The seasons 1-4 are, by the way already on Netflix!

Are you going to watch it?
