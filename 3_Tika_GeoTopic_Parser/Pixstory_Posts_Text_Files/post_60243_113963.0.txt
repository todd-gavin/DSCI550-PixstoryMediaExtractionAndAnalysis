Bajrang Dal, the younger arm of the Vishva Hindu Parishad, claimed it would soon publish helplines for anybody receiving threats from "Islamic extremists" due to their social media activities.

Surendra Jain, joint general secretary of the VHP, alleged in a video message that following the savage killings of Kanhaiya Lal in Uadipur, Rajasthan, and Umesh Kolhe in Amravati, Maharashtra, efforts had been taken to instil fear throughout the nation.

Mr. Jain made an appeal on behalf of the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) to members of the "Hindu society" to report any such threats they receive to the police without delay.

"Bajrang Dal activists will always be prepared to assist you if the police do not intervene, he added, adding that "Helpline numbers would be made public." You can reach Bajrang Dal workers through these helpline numbers whenever such a crisis arises."

The VHP and Bajrang Dal state sections will shortly distribute the helpline numbers, according to a senior member of the organisation.
