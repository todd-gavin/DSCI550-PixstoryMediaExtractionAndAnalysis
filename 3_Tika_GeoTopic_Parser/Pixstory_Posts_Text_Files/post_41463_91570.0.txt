The core values of any sports are teamwork and dignity and any iota of politics taints these virtues. However, it seems that this is not the conventional way of thinking.

The most politically heated of confrontations on the field in Qatar has been conjured up by a World Cup buildup loaded with controversy and geopolitical connotations. 

US News reported that the United States will face Iran, just as it did in the 1998 FIFA World Cup final, despite the fact that diplomatic relations between the two countries have yet to be restored since they were cut in 1980.

“(A) political group, but I’m not political,” Iran’s Croatian coach, Dragan Skocic, said. “I focus on football. I think this is the best way in sport and also we should give people the chance to make the situation better.”

The hope is for a replication of the calm surrounding the 1998 match in France, when the Iranians presented their American opponents with white roses before prevailing 2-1.

“It's 24 years later from 1998 and further removed from the 70s and both nations have evolved tremendously since then,” U.S coach Gregg Berhalter said. “For us, it's a soccer game.”
