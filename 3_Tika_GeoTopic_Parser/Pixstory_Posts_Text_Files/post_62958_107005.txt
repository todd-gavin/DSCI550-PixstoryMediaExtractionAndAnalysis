During World War II six men raised the American flag at Iwo Jima in this Pulitzer winning photograph by Joe Rosenthal This image was used by the American administration to encourage the entire country further Three of these six men had died in the battle of Iwo Jima which was still far from done Now if they all died in the conflict the government s encouraging message will no longer be inspiring As a result they attempted to save the remaining three Two of them agreed to end the conflict Ira Hayes the sixth man refused to be rescued However he was taken out of the fight He spent the remainder of his life in unremitting guilt after learning that his buddies had died in the conflict Rosenthal on the other hand would be accused of arranging the incident for his film which he would justify as serendipity
