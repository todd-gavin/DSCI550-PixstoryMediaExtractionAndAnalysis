After the defeat in the Champions League final Jurgen Klopp comments philosophically on the existence of the match between Real Madrid and his Liverpool When the opposing goalkeeper is the man of the match it means that something is not right for the other team He made three incredible saves but I would have liked to have had more clear chances We made too many pointless crosses in the final The German coach took a result very sportily which punished Liverpool more than it deserved Not an incredible result, a normal football result We made many more shots and many these in goal but the decisive statistic in favor of Real Madrid scored a goal we didn&#39;t Unfortunately it&#39;s very simple and just as hard but we have to respect it Not even this great disappointment takes away the usual sympathy from Klopp who half-jokingly already looks to the future Dove the next Champions League final Istanbul I already book the hotel
