The new episode of Koffee With Karan 7 saw Kabir Singh co-stars Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani. The two stars spoke about their films, careers, relationships and more. During the episode, the actor spoke about his marriage to Mira Rajput, with whom he has 13-year-age gap. The actor tied the knot in July 2015.

When Karan Johar asked Shahid Kapoor whether it was a conscious decision to marry someone from outside the industry, he said, "So for me, it was very simple. I have two very distinct sides to myself. One is obviously what people see of me being an actor, and from the fraternity,and i have homely and spiritual side to myself.
I really struggled with that and I was 34 and I had been living on my own for over ten years and just at that time, through family , everything came up but it just happened and we met and it's the best thing that happened in my life. And I feel she brings so much into my world and she balances me out and we have beautiful children. And I am very thankful for that

Karan asked Shahid whether he encouraged her in her career domain as she has "become a bit of a strong influencer." Shahid added, "I don't know how much she sees I have. I am not a very in your face kind of a person. When we got married, I was 34 and she was 20. So I had to approach it very differently. She needed to be cared for, with kid gloves. She had left everything in her life and had come to Bombay. I was very established in general and this world of films can be very intimidating and judgmental. Sometimes, I used to feel like I know too much and I think I can tell her what to do and how to be. But I used to sometimes do it from a place of wanting to protect her. This is because I had been in that place myself. I was this kid from Lokhandwala, who at 21, did well and didn't know how to be."
