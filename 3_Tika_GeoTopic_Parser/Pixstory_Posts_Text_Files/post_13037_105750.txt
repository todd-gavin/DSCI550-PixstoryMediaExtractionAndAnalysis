On these hot summer days the year old Sweeta works hours a day in Chandni chowk with her bare feet burn in the scorching heat She begs To meet the needs of a family of five members she is begging and lives with her father mother and older sister in Lal Qala When I asked her Why And who Who has adorned you like this She said that my mother made me like this I should work outside Sweeta starts working every day from AM and works hard on the sidewalks with passers by on a hungry and thirsty stomach for a piece of halal bread until midnight The money that passers by help him daily is about rupees With this money she rents a house provides electricity and provides food for her family She said I wish I had a book and a notebook I know a lot of kids who go to school and study unfortunately i can t I wishes to go to school She says I work hard to go to school one day I have a bright future It is true that I have difficult living conditions right now my mother forces me to begging but I know that the hardships of my mother s life make her do this This child has an innocent and smiling face But behind this face and makeup hides a lot of pain and unspoken things Note she wanted to talk more but I could not talk more because I speak Hindi very slowly
