Of all the places to be at in the world, Cobham is not the place to be. Chelsea's senior team seems to be struggling as it is, and their youth side hasn't done too well either.

 Looking to strengthen their youth teams, the club have approached Arsenal talent Khayon Edwards despite transfer sanctions currently in place.

Edwards is by far the Gunners' most impressive footballer. Soon to turn 19, his season was cut short by injury last month. Reports suggest the striker is keen to extend at Arsenal but for a player with this kind of potential, It's hard to deny interest from other top clubs â€” even if it happens to be one of Arsenal's direct London rivals. 

Before picking up the injury in March, Edwards scored 21 times and assisted 5 for Arsenal's U18, U21 and U23 combined.

Despite having turned come of age just last year, the Englishman has received an impressive number of call-ups for older age groups at the academy. 

His finishing, strength and stamina have impressed coaches at the academy and he's looking toward greater things on the other side of his injury. Whether that be at Arsenal or elsewhere (unnamed teams from Germany are said to be interested in his signature), only time will tell.

As for Chelsea's academy, they've endured a pretty painful season so far. The U23 team are rooted to the bottom of Premier League 2, despite having one of the more talented, resourceful backgrounds among those parttaking. 

To survive this season would be one thing, and to build on that in the coming seasons a completely different prospect. Acquiring top youth proposition from around the country would undoubtedly make things easier for that. Whether it be Edwards or anybody else.
