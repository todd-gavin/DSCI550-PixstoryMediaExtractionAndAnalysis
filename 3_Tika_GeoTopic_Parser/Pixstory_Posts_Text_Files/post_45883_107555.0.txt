Father's Day is approaching, and if you're planning a day at home with your father, you can watch a movie. All you need is a tub of popcorn and your father's favourite snacks.

How about The Pursuit of Happyness? Itâ€™s an all time favourite of mine! 

The Pursuit of Happyness is an American biographical drama film directed by Gabriele Muccino and features Will Smith as Chris Gardner, a homeless salesman. The movie's story is about an entrepreneur, Chris Gardner, and his time while he was homeless. 

Based on a true story, the show depicts the struggle that Chris Gardner went through to provide for his son and how he single-handedly raised him while also pursuing a job as a stock broker, eventually becoming a millionaire.
