Important victory for Sassuolo by Alessio Dionisi at home against Atalanta A brace from Traor decided the match At the final whistle, the Neroverdi coach commented on his team&#39;s performance We certainly saw a good Sassuolo We also made important performances in other matches also against Spezia in the last at home You have to have the right attitude you have to defend well and you have to hope that they give you something We could have closed it earlier we changed the negative trend with Atalanta If we look back I think we must be aware that we have what we deserve It cannot be taken the good and discard the negative We are ambitious but we have never thought about Europe We are not satisfied but we must be aware of our means and know that we must deserve the position we have by trying to take the one in front
