Tyson Fury is officially retired from professional boxing, but that doesn’t mean he is finished with competing in combat sports, and he has one eye on working with a WWE legend.

Fury called it quits on an unbeaten boxing career in April 2022. But he made it clear that he is “going to do some exhibition matches,” which he insisted are “not real fights, they’re purely entertainment factor.” 

Gypsy King claimed that he would like to step into the ring with Mike Tyson as well, as it would be a clash of titans making it a spectacle to see. He also name-dropped The Rock as a potential opponent, stating “that would be fantastic,” with the Hollywood star being a well-known fan of Fury’s.

Fury has mentioned it many times that he is happily retired but he also used the popular wrestling phrase "Never say Never".

Fury, in the post match conference of his last professional fight, mentioned that he would love to be at Cardiff at the UK premium live event, now titled " Clash of the Castle". He also called out Drew McIntyre to a bout at the live event, while there has been no confirmation since then, the match is heavily speculated to take place at Cardiff
