Piatek the one closest to Salernitana we are working hard to make him available to the coach within a few days I can say that the footballer is delighted to play in Italy and to wear the grenade shirt we are now filing out the final details with Hertha Berlin There have been some steps in forward in the middle of last week I was convinced only the signature was missing Salernitana would take a big forward And I wouldn&#39;t forget the value of the elements already in the squad including a champion like Ribery With these words the President of Salernitana Iervolino opened the arrival of Piatek who after the loan experience at Fiorentina he returned to Germany at Herta Berlin The player would be happy with the Italian destination and therefore the deal can be closed in days
