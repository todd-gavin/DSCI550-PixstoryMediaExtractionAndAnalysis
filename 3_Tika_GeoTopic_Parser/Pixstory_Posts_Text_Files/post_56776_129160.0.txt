Just a few behaviour changes can make it easier for teachers who put their whole life into helping child's growth.

What you can do is tiny but can be very effective and stress relieving.

Try laying the groundwork for a close partnership by telling the teacher how excited your child is in her class. And share the goals you set with your kid. She'll appreciate your proactive approach.
Stay on top of class events by reading her notes or website posts.

Appreciation is necessary; we all need it, so try to appreciate teachers.
Send thank-you notes once in a while. ("Sam really enjoyed making slime during science yesterday.‚Äù) Teachers love knowing they matter in a child's life.

Besides this, do not always consider what you want for your child but also what a teacher wants for your kid.
Ensure your child gets a good night's sleep (it's the number one request from most teachers!). Tired children have difficulty focusing and may become overly silly or emotional in class.

Lastly, try to be understanding. Teachers face a difficult job: Balancing the academic, social, and emotional well-being of a roomful of kids, plus keeping parents happy, isn't easy!
