Jasprit Bumrah wreaked absolute havoc in the first ODI, returning figures of 6/19 in an exceptional spell of fast bowling that ripped through England's batting line-up at The Oval
Bumrah also registered the third-best figures by an Indian bowler in ODIs, now only behind Stuart Binny (6/4) and Anil Kumble (6/12). He joined the elite list of 10 Indian bowlers to have picked six wickets in an innings in ODIs.
