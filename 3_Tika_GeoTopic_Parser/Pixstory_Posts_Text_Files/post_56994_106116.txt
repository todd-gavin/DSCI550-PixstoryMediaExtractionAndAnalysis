In a world where most people are obsessed with monogamy and believe that there should be just one partner their polyamory relationship gives them options and denies restrictions that a monogamous relationship foists upon them Monogamy can be toxic for people who don t want to follow traditional marriage Monogamy tells you that you re solely for your partner s happiness as they are for yours And that if you like someone besides them that is not true love So we fall into this habit of always seeking the one and believing that we wouldn t need anyone else when we find that person In the process we forget ourselves our own needs our happiness There are myths that people turn to polyamorous relationships because they want to be involved in more sexual relationships at a time But this is entirely wrong for most people it is more like having someone to have a conversation with and sharing different life situations Besides all polyamorous relationships do not have a space for infidelity it annihilates all the ideas of someone cheating on their partner It is accepted and known to the partners that despite having one partner there are other people in their life
