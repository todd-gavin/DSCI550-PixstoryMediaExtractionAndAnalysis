Immediately after the end of the Barcelona tests where Alfa Romeo showed interesting but not superlative things, the day has come to unveil the livery of the new Hinwil racing car. The white and red colors are much sharper than last year and Bottas and Zhou will bring around the world a very nice car with a prominent red. Hopefully it will be a winner too
