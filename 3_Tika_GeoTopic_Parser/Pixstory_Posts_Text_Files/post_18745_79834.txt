For the first time since the news of her disappearance had spread, a newspaper managed to meet Peng Shuai the tennis player who reappeared this summer as if by magic as if she had never been at the center of research and a thousand theories as to why she had disappeared And returned to spoke and did so with l&#39;Equipe journalists to whom she first of all told that she was fine and that she had never disappeared but indeed I have never disappeared said Peng Shuai Simply a lot of people like my friends including those from the IOC mi they sent so many messages and it was almost impossible to reply to all of them But I always kept in touch with my closest friends I spoke to them I replied to their emails and I also spoke to the WTA But at the end of the year their computer communication system The site was changed and therefore many players had difficulty connecting at the time But we always kept in touch with colleagues I don&#39;t know why the news spread that I was missing Meanwhile the IOC president Thomas Bach would also like to meet you I would like to thank all the ATP players and WTA all the athletes and all the personalities who have worried about me in large numbers the tennis player told the Equipe but I didn&#39;t think there was such concern for me and I would like to know why such concern was a huge misunderstanding and I don&#39;t want to add hype to it
