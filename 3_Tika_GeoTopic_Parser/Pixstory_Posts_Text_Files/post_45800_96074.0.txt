NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory has discovered evidence that black holes are destroying thousands of stars in their effort to gain weight in a new scan of over 100 galaxies. 

NASA TV reported that the four galaxies depicted in this figure are among 29 galaxies in the sample that showed signs of black hole growth around their centres. X-rays from Chandra (blue) have been superimposed on optical views of the galaxies NGC 1385, NGC 1566, NGC 3344, and NGC 6503 taken by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. The developing black holes are indicated by the boxes that appear in the roll-over. 

These new findings point to a violent path for at least some of these black holes to grow to their current size, implying stellar annihilation on a scale that has rarely, if ever, been seen before.

Two types of black holes have been studied in depth by astronomers. Black holes with a mass of 5 to 30 times that of the Sun are known as "stellar-mass" black holes. Supermassive black holes, which weigh millions or even billions of solar masses and reside in the centre of most major galaxies, are on the other extreme of the spectrum. 

There has also been evidence in recent years that an intermediate type known as "intermediate-mass black holes" (IMBHs) exists.
