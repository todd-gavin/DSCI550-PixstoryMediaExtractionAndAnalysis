Are you REALLY what you eat? 🤔

Acne can be hugely affected by the food we consume. Here are 5️⃣ food categories that may be affecting your acne and skin health: 

🍫 SUGAR
➡️ Contributes to inflammation in the skin and causes insulin levels to increase, which causes acne.

🥛 DAIRY
➡️ Contains components that may affect a person’s testosterone levels, stimulating oil glands. 

🍟 SATURATED FAT
➡️ Has high concentrations of insulin growth factors, which increases the production of sex hormones, leading to escalated acne production.

🌶️ SPICES
➡️ An excess of spicy food can cause inflammation in the skin and digestive tracts.

🍞 REFINED CARBS
➡️ Spike insulin levels, creating conditions that exacerbate acne and sebum production.
