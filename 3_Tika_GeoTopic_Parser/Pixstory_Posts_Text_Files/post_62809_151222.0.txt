Last Thursdayism is basically an idea that the universe was created last Thursday. It was made with all the traces of a history spanning many billions of years. Every person was born with recollections of an imaginary past. The remains of animals that never existed were arranged on Earth to simulate an evolution that never had place. The remnants of supernovae that never occurred, background radiation from a Big Bang that never occurred, and so on were all over the cosmos.
Any proof used to disprove this was, of course, created Last Thursday along with everything else, so it can never be disproved.
Last Thursdayism cannot exactly be logically refuted. The argument made in its favor are, in a way, not counterable. 
But since it fails to explain or anticipate any observed phenomena, it can be safely dismissed as a scientific hypothesis. As a metaphysical or spiritual explanation, it can likewise be disregarded because, as far as I can see, it offers no consolation, value, or purpose.
Last Thursdayism does what it was meant to do. It proves that there's no creator and if there is, it was created last Thursday. The logic used in it is the same logic that's used in Christianity. That there's no evolution.
So if one doesn't make sense, the other doesn't either.
