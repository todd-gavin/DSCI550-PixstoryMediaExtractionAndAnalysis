As I was still wiping my tears, the post credits showed a very haunting line. Something that impacted me as much as the movie did. 
It said 
SINCE YOU STARTED WATCHING THIS MOVIE, EIGHT WOMEN GOT RAPED SOMEWHERE IN INDIA. 
I was watching A Thursday, a stellar performance by Yami Gautam Dhar and good supporting cast including Karanvir Sharma. 
A play school teachers holds 16 children hostage and demands to meet the Prime Minister of India and who for a change is ( thankfully an educated, caring, sensitive) woman. The loving, everyone’s favorite teacher Naina is suddenly a depressed, crazy woman who is holding children on a gun point. But why ? 
Just because you are depressed doesn’t mean ur psychotic. U don’t loose ur bearings in depression.
As the reason of her act becomes evident , your heart breaks for her. 
When she tell the prime minister she might understand what a girl goes through after being raped but she might not understand how it feels. How it feels when even in the moments of passion with ur lover you tend to feel the hands of the monster on you. And u have to tell ur self you are safe. 
Ofcourse only a woman who has gone through such a trauma in her life can feel it. 
Being women in a country like ours, most of us have experienced that unwanted touched, that conscious rub on your back in a bus or metro. Each one of us must have felt some unease at some time in our life. So actually no one but the victim would imagine what being raped is all about. Sure she would see that persons face in every betrayal in life. She would want every girl safe.
A strong point of the movie was also the character of Nainas fiancé, Rohit. Who understood her pain, did not judge. Who was there for her always.
I would love to believe that Rohit never left Nainas side. Never gave her more betrayals, understood her through out her life. 
I wish woman like Naina all the love.
