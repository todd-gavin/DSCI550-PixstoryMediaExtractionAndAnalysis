Chick fil A the popular fast food chain recently came under fire After users on Twitter suggested that a reply tweet by them was racially charged In response to sarcastic tweet by a black male discussing Chick fil A s lack of spicy chicken nuggets Chick fil A replied Your community will be the first to know if spicy items are added to the permanent menu Don If you re having trouble figuring out what the controversy is you re not alone Only those who see race in everything and assume that every one is racist I looked up the phrase your community and assumed it meant the black community This is a typical example of the problem that persist on Twitter where people try their hardest to find controversy in the most benign things This only serves to embolden hate in non racists accomplishing the exact opposite of what people who call out non racist things as racist want What will we say when we see a true gross act of racism Will we call it by the same name that we called a poor choice of words racist
