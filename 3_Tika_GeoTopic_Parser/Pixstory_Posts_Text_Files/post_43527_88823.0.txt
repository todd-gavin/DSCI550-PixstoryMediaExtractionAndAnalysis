The latest Instagram photo shows Jimin wearing a basic white T-shirt, black jeans, and covering his face with his hands, but has once again received an explosive response. When Jimin first opened his account, he received massive attention from worldwide fans and debuted at 23rd place in TOP 1000 Instagram influencers, the highest among BTS members, according to HypeAuditor, a global influencer marketing platform. Jimin has steadily maintained his rank in the Top 20, despite the fact that he is barely active on Instagram.
