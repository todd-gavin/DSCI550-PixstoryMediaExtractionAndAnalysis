The famous model, media personality and socialite, Kendall Jenner, shares about her struggle with social anxiety. 

She explained about her anxiety hitting the peak and described it as,“My anxiety (especially social anxiety) has been on 100 lately. I’ve come to a place where I don’t feel bad about it,” captioned a post in Instagram. 

She went on and added on how she manages her feelings of anxiety by cultivating “a calmer, more positive mindset” at the beginning of her day, and by acknowledging her need for personal space and “alone time.” 

Jennet has shared about her symptoms of anxiety in the past interviews. 

In a interview with Vogue last year, she told clinical psychologist Ramani Durvasula, PhD,  that she had come across the physical symptoms of anxiety from an early age. 

“I remember being really young—I’d say 8, 9, 10—and having shortness of breath and going to my mom and telling her that,” Jenner said. As she grew older, she developed a sense of panic and fear and continued to struggle with it. “I’ve had times where I feel like I need to be rushed to the hospital because I think my heart’s failing and I can’t breathe and I need someone to help me,” she said at the time of last year’s interview.
