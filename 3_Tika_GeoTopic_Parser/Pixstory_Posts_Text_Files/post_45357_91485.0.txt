Patrice Evra, a Manchester United great, has revealed that his decision to represent France
over many African nations was obvious because he was up in the former's environment.

Since he was born in Dakar, the versatile defender had other alternatives, including playing for
Senegal. He may have potentially represented Cape Verde, as his mother was from the island,
or Guinea, as his father was from the country.

However, this was not the case; the now 40-year-old chose to play for Les Bleus, for whom he
went on to compete in a number of big tournaments, including the World Cup.

"That is why I said to all the footballers to carefully pick their national team," Evra told Arise
News, as quoted by All Nigeria Soccer.

"I was born in Senegal. I could play for Senegal or France, I spoke with my parents.

"I grew up in France, my choice was natural to play for France because you just think about
playing with the big players but actually it is just politics.

"Like you said when you win with France you are a French player when you lose suddenly you
get your Senegalese passport, so that's why when you make your decision you have to be really
careful on all of that."

The former Manchester United defender paid a visit to Lagos, Nigeria, to help a chess initiative.

Evra played for some of Europe's top clubs over his 20-year career, including Manchester
United, Juventus, Monaco, Nice, and Marseille. During his career, he won 21 major trophies,
including five Premier League crowns, three EFL Cups, and the 2007-08 Champions League
with Manchester United. His move to Juventus in 2014 resulted in him winning the Serie A and
Coppa Italia in consecutive seasons. After making his senior debut for Les Bleus in August
2004, the left-back has played 81 times for his country
