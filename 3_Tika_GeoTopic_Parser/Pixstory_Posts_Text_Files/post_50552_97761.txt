Being the very fine string in the guitar of my owners I ringed like the harmonious luxury I produced tones that reflected happiness and confidence Making the ears go smiling I was doing the best Until something snapped Something inside me cracked I was still the string in the guitar But the harmony was gone For the only sound they could hear was the screech and the pain Keeping me aside They gave me silence Growth occurs in desperation Your most substantial power in Yet I just couldn t move I was habitual of human touch Someone who could make me verse Yet the hands now were all dirty And no one had cared to show me mercy So I revolted and left the guitar I wonder if it lived or died without my feathers But I can t go back into the dirty puddles For if I went in My sharpened edges will give them cuts And I will again be placed in the dark room Or maybe replaced by something better
