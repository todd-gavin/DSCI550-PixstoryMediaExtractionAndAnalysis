Yes the society is judgmental . It sucks . I’m not saying that everyone is judgmental , but a handful of people are . That’s the harsh truth . Often times , it comes down to the way a woman looks or dresses . Not just for what she wears but ' Women are judged for being emotional ’ — yet it’s more acceptable for men to get upset and angry ! 🙄❌

You really never know what a woman is good through ! So stop judging her for the things ! Almost everyone has an opinion on a woman’s clothing , appearance , her behaviour , the way she talks and much more things ! A lot of people have this misconception that women dress up to get attention . Being a woman , I can say that women like dressing up for themselves too . From the length of her skirt , the tightness of her jeans to the depth of her cleavage , from the height of her heels to the colour of her nail paint – people tend to judge women by their exterior . 🤚

Woman's go through alot and it's not a joke ! If she is pregnant the society will judge ! If she can't get pregnant the society will judge ! If she is on her periods the society will judge ! I mean why ?? 😑🤔

Out of all the things in life you could be worried about , it should not be about what a woman wears or how she is behaving ! 🤚

STOP JUDGING WOMAN'S ❤️
