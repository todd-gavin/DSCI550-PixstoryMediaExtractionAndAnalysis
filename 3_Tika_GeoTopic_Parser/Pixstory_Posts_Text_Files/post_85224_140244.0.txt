#3 Zico

Zico's presence was a huge influence on the Brazilian team as he led them to three WorldCups. His first World Cup came in 1978 when Brazil finished the tournament in third place.The 1982 World Cup proved to be a pivotal one as Brazil included some best players.

Although players couldn't form chemistry during play and Brazil failed to qualify past thegroup stage.

1986 was the last time Zico could win a trophy with Brazil, and Selecao reached thequarter-finals of 1986 World Cup but were defeated in penalty shootouts in France.

#2 Paolo Maldini

The most consistent player you'll ever witness in football, Maldini spent 14 years playing forItaly and played in four World Cups, but the World Cup was never in his destiny. He starredin the 1990, 1994, 1998, and 2002 World Cups before retiring from international football.

His first World Cup exposure came in 1990 when Italy made it to the semi-final but lost toArgentina in penalties. He steered Azzuri to the final of the 1994 World Cup, but theycouldn't prevail in a penalty against Brazil.

The 1998 World Cup also culminated in disappointment when they played dominatingfootball but still went out of the tournament, losing to France. 2002 was upset, as they lost tohost nation South Korea in a 1-0 golden goal.

#1 Oliver Kahn

German had a wall in front of their goal when Kahn made his debut, replacing AndreasKöpke. Despite winning the Euro in 1996, Kahn failed to win the World Cup. He was calledup for 1994 World Cup but was an unused substitute.
He had a similar situation in the 1998 World Cup as Germany still employed Andreas Köpke.He eventually made his World Cup appearance in the 2002 World Cup, in which Germanywere the least favorite to progress further in the tournament.
Kahn's incredible goalkeeping was a key to Germany making it to the final, where they lost2-0 to Brazil.
