The Knicks honoured United States Army Retired Sergeant First Class Luciano Yulfo, who served in the military for 36 years, during a break between quarters at Madison Square Garden in 2016. They also gave him a new service dog as a gift.

Yulfo was injured while serving in Afghanistan in 2014, and he was stationed at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center until his retirement in April of this year. He had been on the waiting list for a service dog for 18 months. The Knicks and Paws of War then surprised him with Murphy, a very pleased puppy.

As part of their Hoops for Troops initiative, the Knicks have recognised various military members during games. In addition to being recognised on the court, awardees are invited to a practise to meet the players.
