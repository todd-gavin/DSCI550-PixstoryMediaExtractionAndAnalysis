Today February is International Headscarf Day World Hijab Day was launched in by Bangladeshi Nazma Khan from USA and now it is celebrated by many countries all over the world The aim of this day is to invite women from all religions and backgrounds to wear the hijab Islamic veil for an entire day This would allow those who don&#39;t usually use it to identify with the daily experience of veiled Muslim women with lots of discrimination and difficulties The initiative has undergone major conflicts between the Islamic traditionalist world and the feminist world For western secular feminism, all religions use women&#39;s bodies, sanctioning and institutionalizing the disparity of power through the dress code in the public space. This is also manifested in covering the head, therefore the veil would be nothing more than an expression of misogynistic religious oppression. term Hijab deriving from the root jb make invisible hide from sight hide cover also indicates any barrier of separation placed in front of a human being or an object to hide or isolate him from view If on the one hand this day can be interpreted as the celebration of the pride of veiled Islamic women who carry out the mission of fighting discrimination by raising awareness and educating on the other hand, there are various groups of Islamic feminist activists including the six protagonists of the film women leaving Islam provocatively launched on February 1st who on this day share hashtags such as nohijabday to challenge religious misogyny To get closer to the topic, I recommend reading Sexual Ethics and Islam by Kecia Ali
