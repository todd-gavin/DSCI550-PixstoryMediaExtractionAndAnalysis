Since past two years, we know the world have been close to a constant state and have been at a verge. And in order to stay uninfected from the virus we have followed certain difficult restrictions which was not just for ourselves alone but for everyone else as well. 

Researchers stated that to make decisions while at a point of stressful circumstanceses like the pandemic for example can lead to decision fatigue. 

What is it decision fatigue ? 

It is a idea that while a person makes a lot of decisions, and when an additional  decision needs to be made it gets more worse. 

Ken Yeager, PhD, director of the Stress, Trauma and Resilience (STAR) Program in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center said that “On average we will make more than 35,000 decisions a day". “Some require little attention like what will I wear today or what will I have for lunch. Others are much more complex and have greater weight in their impact.” 

During the pandemic, even the smallest decision made holded a great deal of weight.  

According to a survey from the American Psychological Association published in October 2021, 32 percent of Americans had trouble with even basic decision-making, such as what to wear or what to eat due to COVID-19-induced stress. 

In a survey conducted by the American Psychological Association that was published in October 2021, almost 32 per cent of Americans had difficulties while making even the simplest and basic decision-making, like what to wear, what to eat due to the stress related to Covid 19. 

People who were more likely to report face these difficulties in decision making and much of the pandemic associated stress were younger age groups and parents of  18 year old or younger.
