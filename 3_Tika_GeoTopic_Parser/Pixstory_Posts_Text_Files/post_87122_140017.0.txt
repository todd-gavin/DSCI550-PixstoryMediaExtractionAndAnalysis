Chelsea Football Club have appointed Graham Potter as the new manager. The appointment comes after Chelsea parted ways with Thomas Tuchel yesterday. Brighton granted Chelsea permission to speak to Potter and a 5-year deal has been agreed. The 47-year-old manager stated that he was ‘incredibly proud and excited represent Chelsea. Chelsea’s owner Todd Boehly declared he is ‘thrilled’ to bring the manager to Chelsea.
While Chelsea have endured a disappointing start to the season under Tuchel, it must not be forgotten that he achieved success at the club by lifting the Champions League in his first season. The team also had a clear identity and playing style under the German but it appears that something has gone on behind the scenes which led to his exit. Potter has done an incredible job at Brighton and it can be argued that that the Seagulls played one of the most impressive brands of modern football in the league under Potter. Chelsea fans will hope the 47-year-old can have a similar impact on the team.
Under the previous ownership, the club was heavily criticized for not giving managers time
and sacking them abruptly. The likes of Jose Mourinho, Carlos Ancelotti, and many others
were relieved of their services after the team endured spells of poor form and this approach
from the owner was criticized. Large sections of the media and Chelsea fanbase feel that Tuchel should also have been given more time especially after it felt he had been backed heavily by Boehly in the transfer market.
This will be a huge challenge for Potter as it his first managerial gig at a club with the stature
and enormity of Chelsea. He will face different problems such as dealing with big egos and it
will be intriguing to see how he does. The five-year-deal should give him and Chelsea fans
encouragement as it appears the club are set to give him time.
