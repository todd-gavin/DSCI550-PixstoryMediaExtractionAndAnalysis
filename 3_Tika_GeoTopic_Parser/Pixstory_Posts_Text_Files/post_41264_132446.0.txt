No one can win hearts as well as man's best friend, and National Dog Day is observed to recognise this special relationship between humans and dogs. 

Spend some time appreciating the joy and value that dogs provide to our lives and do your part to help neglected and abandoned dogs throughout the world. Dogs do a lot for us humans, and this is an opportunity to repay them. 

From keeping us safe while working for the emergency services to helping people who are blind, deaf, or disabled, dogs do a lot for us humans

Do you have a dog?
