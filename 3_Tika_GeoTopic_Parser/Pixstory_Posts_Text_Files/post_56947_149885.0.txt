If we speak of the treatment then there are are no “cures” for ASD. Rather, for some autistic people, supportive therapies and other considerations can help them feel better or alleviate certain symptoms.
Many approaches involve therapies such as:
behavioral therapy
play therapy
occupational therapy
physical therapy
speech therapy
Massages, weighted clothing and blankets, and meditation techniques may also help some autistic people manage symptoms. However, results will vary. Some people may respond well to certain approaches, while others may not.
There can be some alternative remedies as well.  Research on alternative remedies is mixed, and some remedies can be dangerous. These alternative remedies include things like: high-dose vitamins
chelation therapy, which involves flushing metals from the body, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, melatonin to address sleep issues.
Before investing in any alternative therapy, parents and caregivers should weigh the research and financial costs against any possible benefits.
When in doubt, it’s always best to talk with a healthcare professional.
