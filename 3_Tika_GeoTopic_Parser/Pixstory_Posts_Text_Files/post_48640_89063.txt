Earl The Pearl Monroe is regarded as one of the best NBA players of all time It s impossible to pronounce his name without also saying his nickname That moniker stayed with him throughout his career and even after he retired So how did Earl Monroe earn the moniker The Pearl Monroe concluded his career with the Knicks where he was a major contributor to the team s success Monroe shared the backcourt with Hall of Famer Walt Frazier They formed one of the best backcourts in NBA history when they teamed together Monroe s numbers began to dip as a result of injuries toward the end of his career In he was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Monroe s nickname was given to him before he entered the NBA Monroe was followed by a black sportswriter from the Winston Salem Journal throughout his senior year of college As a result he began to refer to him as Earl s pearls Earl The Pearl would shortly replace that title That was something he carried with him for the remainder of his career As a result Monroe may thank that sportswriter for his moniker Monroe on the other hand was a player who could score from wherever on the court His nickname was appropriate since watching him play the game was a sight to behold
