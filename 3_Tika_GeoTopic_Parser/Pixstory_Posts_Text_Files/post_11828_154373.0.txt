Have you ever wondered why is that during breastfeeding , you suddenly feel very thirsty ?🤱
This is quite common because breastfeeding takes a lot of energy which burns calories and depletes hydration .💁‍♀️
OXYTOCIN (hormone) which our body releases during breastfeeding is responsible for triggering our thirst . This is our body's natural way of ensuring that we are getting enough water to make breast milk . Over consumption of water is not going to increase milk supply and may actually have the opposite effect . 
If you find breastfeeding makes you thirstier than usual – which many women do – drink a bit more water to stay hydrated !
One way to determine if you are getting enough water is to pay close attention to your urine . If you are drinking enough water , it will be almost clear or a pale yellow color . If it is dark yellow or you notice that you are urinating less often than usual , you could be dehydrated .
If you aren’t getting enough water , you may start to experience symptoms , such as ;
📍Chapped lips
📍Dry , itchy skin
📍Headaches
📍Tiredness
📍Lack of energy
📍Moodiness
If you are significantly dehydrated , your body will slow down its breast milk production and your own health will be significantly impacted . Drinking the right amount of water each day is important for your own (and your little one’s) health ! 
Tips to ensure proper hydration ;
✅️ Always keep a water bottle near you .
✅️ Carry your water bottle whenever you travel .
✅️ Eat fruits rich in water like watermelon , muskmelon etc .
✅️ Avoid caffeinated drinks .
Happy breastfeeding mums ! ✨
