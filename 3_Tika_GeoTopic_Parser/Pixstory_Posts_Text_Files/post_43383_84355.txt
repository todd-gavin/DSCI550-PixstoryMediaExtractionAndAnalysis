Pasoori is one of the beautiful creations of Coke Studio The vocals of Ali Sethi and Shae Gill feels so soothing and I think love is the only thing that comes into my mind while listening to this masterpiece But is it only a love song Or is it a revenge song Maybe a combination of both Maybe a Vengeful Love Song Love the way it goes Agg lavan majboori nu Aan jaan di pasoori nu Zehar bane haan teri Pee jaavan main poori nu It means Set fire to your worries To waiting and to hurries If your love is poison I will drink it in a flurry The link to the song
