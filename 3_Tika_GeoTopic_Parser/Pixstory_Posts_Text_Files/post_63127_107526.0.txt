After Viacom18 outbid Walt Disney's video streaming service Disney+ Hotstar to win the consolidated digital streaming rights for the Indian Premier League (IPL) competition, Disney+ Hotstar's 50 million subscribers may experience a big decline. 

According to Vivek Couto, Executive Director of Media Partners Asia, a Singapore-based research and consultancy company, Disney+ Hotstar could potentially lose 15 million members as a result of failing to win the IPL digital rights.
