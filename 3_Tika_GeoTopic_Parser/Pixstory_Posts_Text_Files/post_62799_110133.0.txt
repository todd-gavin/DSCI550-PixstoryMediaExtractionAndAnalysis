Nobody gets an abortion for fun and giggles. Nobody likes to put that kind of strain on their body just for the heck of it. It is because they understand the importance of life, they know it's better to not bring a child into a world if you can't give them a life that's good.

Not giving birth is much better than raising a child carelessly. Not being a parent is better than being a toxic, absent parent.
