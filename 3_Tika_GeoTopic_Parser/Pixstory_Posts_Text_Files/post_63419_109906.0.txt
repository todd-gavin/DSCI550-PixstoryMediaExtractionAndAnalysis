It is rightly said that if we want to maintain a balance between oneself and environment then yoga is necessary for every human. We can't deny the fact that since ancient times in India yoga is being practiced. The 'yoga' word is derived from the Sanskrit which means 'to join or to unite'. Exercises of yoga have a physical effect and also bring a balance between body, soul and mind. Several years ago, sages analysed nature and cosmos through meditation.

Yoga can be practiced in any age it is suitable for people of all ages and requires no 'stunt' skills. It should be included in our daily life. Path of self-knowledge and self-realisation can be attained via positive thinking, perseverance, discipline, right orientation, prayer as well as humble and kindness.

The importance of life is the health of our body. If health is not good then we will not be able to achieve our goals or will not remain happy.

It is rightly said that "Health is not everything, but without health everything is nothing'.
