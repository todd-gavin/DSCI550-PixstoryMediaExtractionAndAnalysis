Very interesting game organized in our college fest - Word Face OFF 
Thus was really an interesting experience for all those who loves to play with vocabulary. 
We were given, scrambled cards of all A to Z alphabets.
Round 1 was basically a synonym round.
Here, we given a word and on our desk we have to form synonym of the word with scrambled A to Z alphabets. For an extra alphabet 10 points were reduced. For no answer 10 points were reduced. 
And loosing team had to give 3 alphabets to the winning team.
Top 2 teams qualified to round 2 
Round 2. Very interesting, we have to found a meaningful sentence without repeating a alphabet.
One who does it fast was the winner ... 
Tada we won ðŸ’«
