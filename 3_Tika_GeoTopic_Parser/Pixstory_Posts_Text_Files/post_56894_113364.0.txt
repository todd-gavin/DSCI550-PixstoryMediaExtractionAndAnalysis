Luxury giant Burberry has named a new vice-president for corporate responsibility, with Caroline Laurie joining the company from DIY specialist Kingfisher. Her role will take in Burberry's approach to sustainability, including incentives, targets and KPIs.

Burberry had embraced a more sustainable future in the past decade. However, it hasn't always got it right, with the company being stung by criticism of its policies when it was found in 2018 to have been burning millions of pounds worth of unworn clothes and unused beauty products. It vowed it wouldn't do this again and, at the same time, announced that it would stop using real fur.

Since then, the news has been positive coming out of the company as far as its sustainability drive is concerned.

And it will complete its first five-year corporate responsibility plan this year. That includes having cut its market-based emissions by 92% since 2016.
