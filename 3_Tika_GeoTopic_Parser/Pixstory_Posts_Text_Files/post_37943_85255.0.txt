As per Marca, Erling Haaland would prioritize a move to a club where he has a chance of winning the Ballon d'Or. Hence this could be a telling point in the next chapter of his young career. 

The Spanish giants would be licking their lips given that the Ballon d'Or is the priority for Haaland. Real Madrid and Barcelona have dominated the last decade as Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, and Luka Modric secured all the Ballon d'Ors in the last decade. 

Incidentally, Cristiano Ronaldo was the last player from the Premier League to win the Ballon d'Or. The Portuguese won the prestigious award after he led Manchester United to the Champions League and Premier League titles in 2008. 

Hence, this could be a huge setback for Manchester City's chances of securing Erling Haaland. The Sky Blues have never won the Champions League and this could have a direct result on their player's goals of winning individual trophies. 

As per the report, Erling Haaland won't have a problem moving to Real Madrid if Kylian Mbappe joins. The Norwegian reportedly believes that Mbappe could help accelerate his goal of winning the Ballon d'Or. 





Barcelona make contact with the Norwegian 

Barcelona are reportedly desperate to stop Haaland from moving to Real Madrid. The Blaugrana don't want to see both Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe linking up for the Whites next season. 

Owing to this, Barcelona coach Xavi Hernandez has reportedly met Erling Haaland. The Spaniard reportedly travelled to Munich to meet and have a chat with the Borussia Dortmund star before a potential move. 

Barcelona's sources have not confirmed or denied this rumour as per Marca. The Blaugrana president had also expressed his interest in signing Erling Haaland a few days earlier. Hence it has to be seen if Barcelona successfully land the striker in the summer.
