One of cinema s greatest mysteries what is in the briefcase that Jules and Vincent are sent to recover in the genre bending crime film pop fiction which was written and directed by Quentin Tarantino Much like Tarantino s other films which are laced with gratuitous violence nonlinear storylines pop culture references and incredible ensemble casts Pulp Fiction is no different The story follows multiple characters across three main interrelated stories setting up three different protagonists for each of its three acts Vincent is the protagonist of the first story followed by Butch Coolidge before the mantle is handed to Jules in the final act All three protagonists have one character that connects them all Marcellus Wallace a notorious figure in the criminal underbelly of Los Angeles Butch has been requested to throw a fight by Marcellus while Vincent and Jules the most ruthless contract killers have been hired to retrieve a briefcase of special importance So what s in the briefcase It is a plot device that moves the story forward without any real explanation Well Tarantino has himself stated that there was no explanation for the contents of the briefcase and when Samuel Jackson asked him what was inside or what the briefcase was supposed to represent he simply replied whatever you wanted to represent Now does this mean that Tarantino is a lazy writer who put no thought into what was in the briefcase No far from it Quentin puts a lot of thought into every detail that we see to help create some of the most incredible narrative based films of late the reason he left the contents of the briefcase ambiguous was to enable everyone associated with the briefcase to have a different relationship and attachment to it What do I think is in the briefcase
