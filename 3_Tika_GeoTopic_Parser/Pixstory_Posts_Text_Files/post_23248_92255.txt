Two soldier&#39;s hands mending a Ukrainian flag with a needle and thread, a delicate yet strong gesture that street artist Shasha Korban has described in her own way with a mural that has recently appeared on a brick wall in the center of Kiev. Korban himself who was the first to spread the image of his work through Instagram explaining I created this mural a few days ago in Kiev and at that moment nearby they were fighting to free Bucha and Irpin An intense and immediate way of saying the Ukrainians&#39; ability to resist but also of their attachment to the country In the photo posted by Korban you can see behind the wall of the skyscrapers shattered by the war
