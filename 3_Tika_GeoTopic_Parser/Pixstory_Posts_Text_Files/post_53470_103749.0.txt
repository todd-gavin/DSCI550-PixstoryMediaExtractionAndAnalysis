How did people talk in the Stone Age? – Tsubamé, aged eight, London, UK

The Stone Age refers to a time in the distant past. It started around 3 million years ago and lasted until about 40,000 years ago.

It is named the Stone Age because during that time our distant ancestors made their tools from stones. Humans like us – the species Homo sapiens – appeared long after the start of the Stone Age, only about 200,000 years ago.

The Stone Age began when several species of apes started to make simple tools by chipping sharp pieces of stone from larger pieces of rock. These apes stood partly upright when they walked and that meant their hands were free to do things, like make tools. These early upright apes had small brains, not very different from a chimpanzee’s brain, and they did not speak

Other apes who walked upright came later in the Stone Age. They have been given names like Homo habilis (handy man) or Homo erectus (upright man). These species lived in Africa around 1 to 2 million years ago, still long before people like us existed. They had larger brains than the first upright apes, but their brains were still smaller than ours. They were not as intelligent as us and did not speak, even though they would have made sounds.

About 400,000 years ago, three species that had much larger brains than the earlier upright apes all lived at around the same time. These were called Neanderthals, Denisovans, and an early form of the species Homo sapiens – our ancestors.

The Neanderthals and Denisovans lived outside of Africa in the part of the world known as Eurasia, which includes Europe. Little is known about the Denisovans, but by around 100,000 years ago Neanderthals had wooden spears and a few simple tools made from the bones of animals such as deer in addition to their tools made from stone.
