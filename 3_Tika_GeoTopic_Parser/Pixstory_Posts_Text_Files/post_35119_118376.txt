A world championship to forget as soon as possible for the Azzurri of the relay x specialty in which Italy won gold at the Tokyo Olympics only a few months ago In Eugene for a whole other thing starting from the absence of Marcell Jacobs due to injury by Chituru Ali placed in fourth position with Tortu moving to second The good premises turned into a debacle and the Azzurri athletes were not even able to qualify for the final In the heats the Italian quartet finished with the seventh time of due of gross errors in the change of baton And so Italy finished last given that Denmark did not finish the match after Spain and the qualifiers Brazil Jamaica South Africa Canada and France The USA also entered the final Great Britain and Ghana from the other battery Very disappointed for the result Filippo Tortu who in this world championship had already stopped one step away from a final that of meters by just thousandths of a second Truly a huge disappointment We arrived here as Olympic Champions It was not easy to enter the final because the level was very high but we had to do more we could do it I had difficulty in giving the baton and it was one of the reasons why we went slowly we made two changes out of three wrong We go to the Europeans to aim for gold we start again from a beating but what can I say that we all gave our best
