World peace day🕊️☮️🤍
Peace starts with a smile, and ends in harmony. 
Peace is a feeling of acceptance, belongingness and harmony that every individual deserves to have.
When I was young i thought this day was about stopping external wars. Now i realise it's about waking up our own inner peace. The portal to peace isn't external it's internal.
Collectively it's due time to awaken peace within ourselves. Let's pledge to make our society a safe and peaceful place to be in.
Let's join hands to establish world peace on this world peace day so that no person is void of the all the gifts that life has to offer.
A very happy world peace day to all ! 💟🤗
