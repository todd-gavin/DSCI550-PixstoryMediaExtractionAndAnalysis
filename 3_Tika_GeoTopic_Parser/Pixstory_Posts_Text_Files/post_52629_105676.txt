Cohen Taylor has made history for being crowned Perth s first Mr NAIDOC a special moment for the young Noongar Yamatji man Born in Osborne Park Taylor s family frequently moved around until they settled in the small town of Walpole km south of Perth where he was raised for years As an adolescent Taylor was ambivalent about his childhood learning early on people treated him differently because of the colour of his skin It was a concept he said was difficult to grasp as a child who just wanted to have fun and play with his friends Going through high school was no walk in the park either Taylor found it hard to focus on school work and often found himself removed from class for being disruptive Because of this he isolated himself through school which with pressure of not knowing what he wanted to do after school made complicated his emotions At years old Taylor was diagnosed with ADHD which helped answer a lot of his questions on why he had trouble focusing After leaving school Taylor started to wonder what his purpose in life was He found that answer through applying for the police academy However being an Aboriginal police officer has its challenges Taylor said he has had his own people turn their backs on him because of the uniform he chose to represent The relationship between the police and Aboriginal people has been complicated for decades with many Indigenonus people having bad experiences with law enforcement But Taylor wants to change that I would love to see the relationship between munarch police and our mob Taylor said To bridge that gap me myself I m a munarch and I like to educated officers and people from within and tell them what our culture means to us There aren t many Aboriginal people in these roles and I asked myself who could relate to how I feel in these situations as a police officer Because of this Taylor finds himself putting on a happy face and constantly telling himself he is okay
