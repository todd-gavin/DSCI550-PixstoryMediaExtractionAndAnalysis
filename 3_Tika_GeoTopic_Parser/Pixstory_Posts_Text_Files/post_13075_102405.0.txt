Police have reported the death of an Afghan teenager named Rezwan Kohistani, who immigrated with his family last year.

The cause of his death is not yet known, but some locals say he committed suicide as a result of harassment at school.
Some people who know Rezwan's family told the newspaper that there was a possibility of Rezwan committing suicide because he was being harassed at school. Others said the pressure of new life in a new country was on his shoulders.

Refugee aid organizations say many of these refugees experience serious psychological trauma and have very few resources to provide counseling, especially to children and adolescents who are vulnerable to their parents.

The American Mental Association says that a small number of refugees are referred to counselors and psychiatrists. According to a 2021 survey, nearly half of all Afghan refugees in the United States suffer from anxiety and trauma.
