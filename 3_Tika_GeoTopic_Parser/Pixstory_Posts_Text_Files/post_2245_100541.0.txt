The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is set to increase its tally in the Rajya Sabha with two more members from Punjab getting elected to the Upper House of Parliament. 

The party will have 10 members in the Rajya Sabha but none in the Lok Sabha. 

The Election Commission of India (ECI) has issued the schedule for the elections to the 57 Rajya Sabha seats but not yet for the Sangrur Lok Sabha constituency, which was vacated by Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann after getting elected to the state assembly from Dhuri.

Out of these 57 seats, two are from Punjab and going by its strength in the Punjab assembly, the AAP is all set to win both of them. 

That will take the AAP strength to 10 in the 245-member House. At present it has eight members, five from Punjab and three from Delhi. 

In both Punjab and Delhi, the AAP has absolutely majority in the respective assemblies. 

In the Rajya Sabha, ten is a significant number and their stand will prove crucial for the passage of any bill or even to block any proposed legislation. 

In terms of strength, the AAP will be the fifth largest party in the Upper House of Parliament after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with 95 members followed by the Congress with 29, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) with 13 and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) with 10. 

This will be an important milestone for Arvind Kejriwal's party in less than a decade of its formation in 2013.

It will also be interesting to see who the AAP fields from Sangrur Lok Sabha constituency in the by-elections. That will be the first public test of the party's popularity in Punjab after winning a massive mandate of 92 seats in the February 2020 assembly elections. 

A similar test of its popularity will be held from Rajendra Nagar seat in Delhi. The by-election to the seat has been necessitated by the resignation of Raghav Chadha who got elected to the Rajya Sabha from Punjab.
