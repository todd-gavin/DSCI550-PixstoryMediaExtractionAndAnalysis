Cristiano Ronaldo fans heaved a sigh of relief after Portugal beat North Macedonia to book a berth in the Qatar World Cup Sadly the Mohamed Salah fans never got the chance to celebrate Egypt failed to make the cut after losing out to Senegal in penalties To add the Salah fans woes the Liverpool star hit his penalty well over the crossbar But before Salah could be blamed the circumstances under which Salah had to make a sad exit especially when he was about to take the crucial penalty kick He could be accused of taking arguably the worst ever spot kick in his career but while taking it he was peppered with lasers The year old s face was lit up by a series of green projections from supporters It certainly made difficult for Salah to concentrate and focus on the job While there is no denying the credit to Senegal the victory one suspects could be overshadowed by the alarming behaviour of a small number of fans shining laser pens in players faces Besides there have been suggestions from some experts that laser pens can do more than merely distract footballers potentially harming the health of players in extreme circumstances Forget Salah or Egypt the situation was a huge loss for football The fans have done a disservice to the sport The FIFA should immediately come up with some measures such a thing should never be repeated in future Those who pelted Salah with bottles for his failure should also be banished from watching a football game Ronaldo on the other hand said the berth in the World Cup was their rightful place Goal achieved We re at the Qatar World Cup Ronaldo said on social media We re in our rightful place Thank you to all the Portuguese people for the tireless support Let s go Portugal Hope Ronaldo does something memorable in Qatar which could be his last World Cup Ronaldo has played World Cup matches having scored seven goals Four of the seven goals including a hat trick against Spain came in the Russia World Cup
