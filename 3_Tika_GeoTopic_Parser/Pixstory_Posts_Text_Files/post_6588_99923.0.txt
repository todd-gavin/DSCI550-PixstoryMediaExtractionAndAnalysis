A video ascribed to Kavi Pradeep, the lyricist who penned the words to the song ‘Ae Mere Watan Ke Logo’, is circulating widely on social media. The elderly man in the video is criticising Jawaharlal Nehru for the events that unfolded during the independence movement. He says, “We celebrate 15th August. But what did we really get on August 15th? Muslims got two countries, Bangladesh and Pakistan. What did we get? We lost 1/3 of our country… there should not have been a division in the name of religion. Since it happened, the entire Muslim population should have gone there. And all Hindus should stay here… Was it a conspiracy? This was not a good thing… On 15th August, when the water of our five rivers was turning red with blood, Mr Nehru was dancing and exchanging congratulations… Is there anything bigger than the country? Recognize August 15 as a day of mourning, that’s fine. 10 lakh massacred and 53 crores displaced…”

Facebook user Mukesh Sahariya posted the visuals as a video of Kavi Pradeep.
