1. Wild dogs are the only Canidae that inhabit temperate zones.
2. Wild dogs are the most endangered mammalian species on earth, with a population of only around 20,000-25,000 remaining in the wild with the African wild dog remaining only around 6,000.
3. Wild dogs are the main predators of large mammals in North America and Eurasia, such as moose, caribou, and elk.
4. Adult wild dogs weigh between 35 and 60 kg (77-132 lbs), with a length of about 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in).
5. The coat of a wild dog is usually dark brown or black, but can also be variably coloured including yellow, tan, light brown, or white (depending on location).
6. A wild dog's diet consists mostly of meat - mainly muscle and bone - but they will also eat small amounts of vegetation and scavenge leftover food from other animals' kills. 
7. Wild dogs live in packs of anywhere from one to thirty individuals and typically have one breeding female and several offspring at any given time (although pack sizes can vary widely). 
8. Packs hunt cooperatively by coordinating their movements so that each member can exploit its unique hunting skills as best as possible; this is especially important when hunting larger prey where multiple individuals working together can bring down an animal much faster than any single individual could alone.
9. Reproduction in wild dogs occurs primarily during the winter season, when pairs will form monogamous bonds and mate for life. 
10.Â  Wild dogs give birth to litters of anywhere from one to eight puppies, which usually disperse soon after birth into different areas within the pack's territory
