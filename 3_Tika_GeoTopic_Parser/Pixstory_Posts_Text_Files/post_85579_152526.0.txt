High necks are so versatile that I can wear them literally everyday. 😌🤌🏻
I already have them in many colours but yesterday I visited pantaloons and found a high neck in a different shade and ofc it catched my eye🥰💗
They're so easy to pair. But the only thing I hate about them is they can inly be worn in winters.
