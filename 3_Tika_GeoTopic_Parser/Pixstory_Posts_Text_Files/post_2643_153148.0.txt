Miseries followed her throughout her early years, and singing offered her solace from life’s injustices and tragedies. She started receiving singing lessons and gave her first public performance at the age of 15. It was only a matter of time before the world of celluloid discovered her, and she appeared in many Hindi movies in the 1930s, including Ameena (1934), Mumtaz Begum (1934), Jawaani Ka Nasha (1935) and Naseeb Ka Chakkar (1935). Even Mehboob Khan cast her in his film Roti in 1942. Like all other artists of the time, she sang her own songs in these films.But Akhtar wasn't seduced by the glitz and glam of the film world and she decided to step away from the movies to come back to LucknowUstad Amjad Ali Khan in his book 'Master on Masters' wrote about the lives and times of some of the greatest icons of Indian Classical music, where he writes about Begum Akhtar "Being classically trained, she sang with great confidence and ease. Each of her compositions was based on a raga. The speciality of her concerts was that regardless of the number of people in the audience, each person listening felt that she was singing just for them. The beauty of her performance lay in the fact that there were no frills or unnecessary ornamentation."Akhtar delivered her last concert in Ahmedabad at the age of 60.
