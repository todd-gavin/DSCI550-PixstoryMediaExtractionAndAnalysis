I am exhausted I know the course I have chosen is quite struggling Well it s the start of my nd sem The teacher who is teaching me Genetics is the tic and HOD of my Department and she is very strict Today I got my periods started at o clock a m and from that moment everything started getting suck I am a student who usually participates in class discussions but I don t know what happened to me today at Parvinder s Mam class I was not able to answers the questions which she was asking to the class although I knew the answers and concepts That something makes me feel suck a lot as I used to feel underconfident in myself Also that day was supposed to submit a Practical file of Genetics as well but since the CR gets no information from the teacher regarding that so the files were not collected at that time But when I reached my room I then saw a message that the files were being collected As I saw the message late the files had already been collected and submitted to the Shruti Mam I then had to climb upstairs to the rd floor and request her to accept my late submission But she denied it two times and said she will only accept files through CR only at that moment my heart sank thinking no wonder how much struggle I had to do in these three years of my course Then after waiting a lot my CR was able to submit my file Seriously what a tedious day it was
