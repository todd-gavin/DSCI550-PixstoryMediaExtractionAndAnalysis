Marvel Cinematic Universe is now the biggest and richest cinematic universe out there with each film earning over million and having access to top quality resources Yet why is it that even after such an overabundance of resources MCU is not only going stale but is increasingly turning into the equivalent of a platinum laced trash bag Well for starters the plots are as predictable as it gets good guys win bad guys lose and they all lived happily until some new danger is yet again ready to be milked ridiculous amounts of CGI mixed with some of the most bland one dimensional characters ever Hollywood legend Martin Scorsese perfectly summed up MCU when he said I tried you know But that s not cinema Honestly the closest I can think of them as well made as they are with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances is theme parks It isn t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional psychological experiences to another human being At one point an imaginative universe full of excitement MCU has become the dumbest lowest common denominator entertainment available which lacks not only imagination but also a spine as Disney Marvel is more worried about identity politics representation diversity and multiculturalism rather than character depth and storytelling Supporting diversity is great there should indeed be greater representation of all sections in the superhero world but when the sole focus of your work is pushing a political agenda then your movies are going to suck What made Iron Man Captain America The Winter Soldier Guardians of the Galaxy Infinity War No Way Home so good is that their prime focus was on storytelling These movies focused on establishing and defining their characters showing that each had their own personal journey ahead of them and showing that journey was their only motive It is a pity that Disney is a big greedy cash cow that doesn t care about taking risks and creating quality films And now that the Academy is actually falling for the whole identity politics drama it will only get worse from here
