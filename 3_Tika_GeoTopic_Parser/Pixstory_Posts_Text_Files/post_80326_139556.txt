Social Media is one of the biggest modern trends and rightly so An opportunity to share opinions regularly with other lovers of the beautiful game Interacting with new people and gaining more insight often too I ve been lucky enough to interact with some lovely people share my opinions on the daily and have discourse about my passion However Social Media can be toxic rude and ultimately comments which are just designed to put people down There are many perks of social media but the perks get reduced when one s day can be negatively affected by Socials Pixstory collaborates all of the positives of social media while cutting out all the negatives Posting opinions engaging with others and having the content you want on your feed while being rewarded for less anonymity to help the user with a legitimacy score A very good fun to use app with a perfect character limit to be more in depth than other platforms Aside from just fans players are heavily affected too It doesn t matter how much traction you have footballers will often see your comments Why spread negative hateful comments when there s no benefit Just adding to the problem Arsenal collaborating with Pixstory is a fantastic step to stop social media abuse to allow others to voice their opinions and without the fears of nasty comments The future of social media a non toxic free to air opinions bringing all the enjoyments out of social media and leaving the negative sides behind Arsenal x Pistory a great exciting collaboration
