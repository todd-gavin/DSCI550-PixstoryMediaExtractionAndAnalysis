This recipe uses a combination of sugar and honey. Honey is an inert sugar, which prevents the crystallization of sugar. This means your marshmallows stay pillowy soft. 

To make homemade marshmallows, you'll need: 
3 tablespoons of gelatine
1 cup of honey 
1/4 teaspoon salt 
1 teaspoon flavouring, like vanilla extract 
1/2 cup white sugar 
1/2 cup cornflour 

Method: 
1. In a bowl, combine the gelatine with 1/2 a cup of ice cold water. Leave it to bloom for 10 mins. 
2. In a saucepan, combine the sugar, salt, honey, and 1/2 a cup of water. Place the pan on a medium-high heat and stir only until the sugar dissolves. 
3. Once the mixture starts to bubble, remove the spoon. Cook the sugar to 115Â°C. If you don't have a thermometer, drop a bit of sugar syrup into cold water. If a ball forms that is soft when you press it, it's ready. This is called soft ball stage. 
4. Start whisking the bloomed gelatine with an electric beater (trust me, you don't want to use your hand for this) and slowly pour in the hot sugar mixture in a thin stream. Add the flavouring. 
5. Keep whipping until the mixture is fluffy and about 3 times its original volume. The bowl should be cool to touch by now. 
6. Line a pan with parchment paper and dust it with cornflour. Pour the marshmallow mixture into the pan and top it with more cornflour. 
7. Let the marshmallow sit covered overnight in a cool, dry place. 
8. When it's time to cut, coat the chopping board with cornflour and overturn the marshmallow onto the board. 
9. Use a sharp knife to cut the marshmallow and coat the exposed edges with more cornflour. Dust of the excess cornflour. 

And there you have it! These marshmallows are perfect for hot chocolate, smores, or just popping them as is! How do you like your marshmallows? Let me know in the comments below.
