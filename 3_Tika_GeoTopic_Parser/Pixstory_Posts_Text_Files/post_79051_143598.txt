With the sad news of the Queen s passing halting play now feels like a good opportunity to use the break in fixtures to reflect on one or two of the many things that we have learnt so far this seasonWe are better than we were last seasonAs simple and obvious as it may sound from the games we have watched of Arsenal so far this season albeit a small sample size we look to be a far more complete side Whilst underlying stats aren t as significant as actual scorelines Arsenal winning all seven of our games so far in terms of Expected Goals cannot be a bad thing According to xGPhilosophy data we currently stand at an aggregate xG scoreline of for and just That suggests we score more than twice a game and concede less than once Again underlying stats come second to actual tangible results but it s a good sign of things moving in the right direction Our new signings are level raisersTurner is clearly a number two Vieira is yet to have played enough to really judge and Marquinhos looks to be a very tidy player at just But it s our Manchester City boys who have come into our best XI and raised the standards Nketiah is a great outlet and it feels harsh to always see him benched in the league but Gabriel Jesus is simply everything we have been crying out for from Arsenal s number Strong despite his height excellent combining with his teammates and always in the right areas to score goals Zinchenko while he may not be as defensively secure as Tierney is incredible in the build up and makes us a far better side on the ball His technical level is insane There s been many lessons from the season but here s just two things I wanted to say in the limited word count I have One loss doesn t define us and I cannot wait to see us back in action this weekend Come on you Gooners
