Haft-sin or Haft-seen is an arrangement of seven symbolic items whose names start with the letter "س" pronounced as "seen" the 15th letter in the Persian alphabet; haft (هفت) is Persian for seven.

It is traditionally displayed at Nowruz, the Afghanistan New Year, which is celebrated on the day of the vernal equinox, marking the beginning of spring on the Kabul and Marzi-e- Sharif.

The following are the primary items of Haft-sin, whose Persian names begin with the letter sin in the Persian alphabet.

Sabzeh (سبزه) – wheat, barley, mung bean, or lentil sprouts grown in a dish.
Samanu (سمنو) – wheat germ sweet pudding.
Senjed (سنجد) – Oleaster
Serkeh (سرکه) – vinegar.
Seeb (سیب) – apple.
Seer (سیر) – garlic.
Somāq (سماق) – sumac.

Coins (سکه sekke), hyacinth (سنبل sonbol), and clock (ساعت saat) are sometimes included too. Other symbolic items that are typically used to accompany Haft-sin include a mirror, candles, painted eggs, goldfish, and traditional Persian confections.

A "book of wisdom" is also commonly included, which might be the Avesta, the Shahnameh, or the Divān of Hafez.

The Haft-Seen table represents nature. By tradition, Afghan families take great pains to create the most beautiful Haft-Seen table that they can, for not only does it embody values both traditional and spiritual, it is also appreciated by the visitors during Nowruz visiting exchanges as a reflection of the families' aesthetic sense and good taste.
