Grüner See, literally ‘Green Lake’, is a lake in Styria, Austria, near the town of Tragoss, located at the foot of the snow-capped Hochschwab mountains.

During the winter season, the lake is only 1-2m deep and the surrounding area is used as a county park. It is a favourite site for hikers. But as the temperature starts rising during spring, the ice and snow on mountaintops begin to melt and run down into the basin of land below.

The lake swells up to engulf the entire area, including the park. During summers, the lake reaches its maximum depth of around 12m and is claimed to look the most beautiful at this time.

The lake gets its distinctive green colour, and the name, from the grass and foliage beneath, and thanks to the fresh snowmelt, the ice-cold water is crystal clear. The temperature of the lake is rather cold at 4 to 8 °C, yet it’s popular among divers who can observe the green meadows along the edge zone of the lake particularly in June when the water is at its highest. The alpine grasses and flowers of the meadow are visible in full bloom under the water.

What a wonderful place💟
