A Scam Bigger than The Harshad Mehta Story In February the former group operating officer of the National Stock Exchange Mr Anand Subramanian was arrested by the CBI in its probe into something called the Co Location Scam This scam is said to be so huge that the beneficiaries are suspected to have made to crore rupees extra profits EVERY SINGLE DAY for almost two to three years The worst part is that while every single media house has been talking about this Himalayan Yogi Baba but barely anyone is actually telling us How was this scam executed in the first place Let me explain it to you The scam dates back to January when a whistleblower informed SEBI about unfair practices at the NSE where certain brokers were being given early access to the colocation facility at the stock exchange In order to understand the co location scam it is necessary to understand what co location facilities are There are dedicated spaces in the exchange building right next to the exchange servers where high frequency and algo traders can place their systems or programs With the co location facilities being extremely close to stock exchange servers traders here have an advantage over other traders due to the improvement in latency time taken for order execution This preferential access allowed the algo trades of this member to be ahead of others in the order execution The bizarre story though sounds like the plot of a Netflix series underscores the saying that truth is stranger than fiction Why this happened and who actually made money apart from the one scene in the news I don t know but what I know for sure is that SEBI needs to up its game because we are here talking about the biggest Stock Exchange of India Tomorrow if another scam breaks out it might wipe out thousands of crores of investors wealth within no time and normal people like you and I are in no position to act upon this All we could do is stay aware and spread awareness about these mishappenings in the system
