To stop the spread of the fatal illness, the state administration has adopted new measures, such as making masks essential.

Maharashtra is once again becoming a hotbed for Covid-19, with over 1000 cases reported since the beginning of June. The state recorded 1,357 new coronavirus illnesses and one pandemic-related death on Saturday, setting off alarm bells across the country. To stop the spread of the fatal virus, the state administration reintroduced procedures that had previously been abandoned.

Aaditya Thackeray, a Maharashtra minister, stated on Sunday that the state could be facing the fourth wave of Covid-19, but advised residents not to be alarmed because the fatality rate is currently low.

Face masks were made required in public locations by the state administration two days ago. Masking is currently required in all crowded areas, including buses, trains, cinemas, auditoriums, hospitals, colleges, and schools.

On Saturday, Mumbai reported 889 new coronavirus infections, the largest number in over three months.

Shah Rukh Khan, Katrina Kaif, and Kartik Aryan are among the Bollywood celebs who have tested positive for Covid. According to media reports, filmmaker Karan Johar's 50th birthday gala served as a super-spreader event, with over 50 people infected with Covid-19.

In just 24 hours, the active COVID-19 caseload increased by 1,636 cases. According to the ministry, active cases account for 0.06 percent of all infections.
