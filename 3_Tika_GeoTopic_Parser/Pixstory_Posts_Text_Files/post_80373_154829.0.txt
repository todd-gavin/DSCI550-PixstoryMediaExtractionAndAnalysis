Kylian Mbappe is one of the hottest properties in the football world today. He has already achieved a lot at a young age and is only going to get better and better with time. However, it seems like his egoistic attitude is creating trouble for everyone around him.
Reports recently emerged that the French striker wants a move away from PSG, just a couple of months after penning down a new lucrative contract. It has been learnt that the forward is feeling betrayed by the club following unkept promises.
The 23-year-old was also critical of manager Christophe Galtier’s attacking tactics. It’s assumed that Mbappe prefers to play in a two-match setup, alongside a pivot, the same formation that the French national team follows.
However, at the club arena, he plays as a lone striker alongside wingers Lionel Messi and Neymar. Though he has netted 12 goals in all competitions this season, the striker is still unhappy with his current situation.
‘If you boss asks you to do something, you do it’ - Thierry Henry
Franch’s all-time highest goal-scorer Thierry Henry slammed Mbappe for his remarks and attitude.
"Nobody likes to be exposed to what you're not good at," Henry said on CBS Sports.
"But did they make him feel like the club was the most important thing or did they make him feel like he was more important than the club?
"I will use my own stories. I didn't like to play out high and wide for Barcelona. I hated it! But I did it for the team.
"I didn't like it after a hundred caps and I don't know how many goals I scored for France, I had to play on the left. There is only one rule: if the boss asks you to do something, you do it, if it's good for the team! If it's bad for the team, I would get the argument."
Despite controversies, Mbappe continued his form as he converted a goal from the penalty spot in PSG’s 1-1 draw against Benfica in the Champions League on October 11 (Tuesday).
