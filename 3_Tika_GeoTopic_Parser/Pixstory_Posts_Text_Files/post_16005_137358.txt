Summary Although glucagon secretion is perturbed in both T D and T D the pathophysiological changes in individual pancreatic alpha cells are still obscure Using recently curated single cell RNASeq data from T D or T D donors and their controls we identified alpha cell transcriptomic alterations consistent with both common and discrete pathways While alterations in alpha cell identity gene ARX MAFB expression were conserved cytokine regulated genes and genes involved in glucagon biosynthesis and processing were up regulated in T D Conversely mitochondrial genes associated with ROS COX B NQO were dysregulated in T D Additionally T D alpha cells displayed altered expression of autoimmune induced ER stress genes ERLEC HSP whilst those from T D subjects showed modified glycolytic and citrate cycle gene LDHA PDHB PDK expression Thus despite conserved alterations related to loss of function alpha cells display disease specific gene signatures which may be secondary to the main pathogenic events in each disease namely immune or metabolism mediated stress in T D and T D respectively Sources
