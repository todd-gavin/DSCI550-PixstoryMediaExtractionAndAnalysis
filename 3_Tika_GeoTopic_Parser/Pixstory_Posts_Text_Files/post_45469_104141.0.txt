Stephan Lichtsteiner


Stephan Lichsteiner was a stop-gap solution for Arsenal’s leaky defense. The Switzerland veteran joined Arsenal on a free transfer from Juventus. The player left even before Arteta came in. The player featured for Augsburg for a while before hanging his boots from professional football. 


Bernd Leno


After the departure of Petr Cech, Arsenal were looking to sign a shot-stopper. Unai Emery signed Bernd Leno from Bayer Leverkusen. After being a first-choice shot-stopper for the Emirates outfit, the player lost his spot to Aaron Ramsdale in the 2021/22 season. The German player featured only four times in the EPL and might lose out the spot in the World Cup 2022 squad. 


David Luiz


The Chelsea player moved across London to represent Arsenal during his last days in the Premier League. The player moved in 2019 and filled the gap in Arsenal’s defense. He helped the side to win the FA Cup in 2020 against Chelsea. The player featured for a season more at Arsenal before moving to Flamengo. The Brazilian helped Flamengo to reach the Copa Libertadores final in the 2021/22 season. 


Gabriel Martinelli


The talented striker signed for Arsenal during Emery’s reign and has been the best signing so far. After initial hiccups, the player went on to feature for Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal regularly. In 29 games this season, he scored six goals and six assists. The player will remain key for Arsenal’s aspirations in the 2022/23 season. 


Nicolas Pepe


Nicolas Pepe has been by far the worst signing for Arsenal of Unai Emery. The club spent 72 million but the Ivory Coast international has never lived up to the hype. His best season came in 2020/21 with 11 G/A in 29 games. However, Arteta did not prefer the player over Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka in the 2021/22 season. The player is seeking a move away from London in the summer
