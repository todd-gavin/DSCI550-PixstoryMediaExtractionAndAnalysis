This Friday, viewers will have many options to watch either on Cinema Halls or OTT platforms. Today I am writing about the movies and web series which you can start binging from this Friday which are as follows -

1. Deep Water - People love Ben Affleck for two types of movies which are Batman movies and another one is crime thrillers. The next movie of Ben Affleck is Deep Water with new emerging actress ‘Ana De Armas.’ After watching the trailer, I got similar vibes when I watched the movie ‘Gone Girl.’ The movie will start streaming from 18th March and you can watch it either on Hulu or Amazon Prime Video.

2. We Crashed - When a web series got a pairing of Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway then you can only hope for a good story and great performances from the cast. What I understand from the trailer is, this will be a story of a couple who just started a start-up named ‘We Work’, and first they will get famous but the company will face backlash and starts having losses. You can watch We Crashed on Apple TV+ from 18th March.

3. Bachchan Pandey - Bachchan Pandey is a remake of the Kannada movie ‘Jigarthanda’ which is a remake of the Korean movie ‘A Dirty Carnival,’ but I haven’t watched both of the movies. So yeah, Bachchan Pandey will be an original movie for me. After watching the trailer, I can ensure that this movie will be packed with action, comedy, and a little bit of emotional drama. You can watch Bachchan Pandey near your cinema halls from 18th March.

4. Jalsa - Jalsa is a movie that people are not talking about much. Vidya Balan and Shefali Shah starrer Jalsa is a crime thriller. After watching the trailer, I got the least information about the movie which is very good because nowadays the trailer is pretty much like a short movie where viewers got to understand everything about the movie. Jalsa will start streaming from 18th March and you can watch it on Amazon Prime Video.
