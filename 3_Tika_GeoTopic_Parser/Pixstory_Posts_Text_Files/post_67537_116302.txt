I m a complete bookworm My bookshelf is bursting at the seams Every birthday and Christmas my friends and family know to gift me books It s my one true love My absolute favourite book is called Throne of Glass by Sarah J Maas It talks about struggle and sacrifice triumph and failure This book has gotten me through a lot Many people tend to look down on the Fantasy genre they think it s for children On the contrary there are a plethora of authors who write fantasy and fiction for adults I love this book so much I painstakingly crafted this bookmark from hair thin copper wires A labour of love for a labour of love
