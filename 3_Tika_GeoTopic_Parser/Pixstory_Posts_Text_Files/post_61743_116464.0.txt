Imagine, having an important task at hand, that needs immediate attention, and being unable to do it or even get started, because it doesn't give your brain the serotonin boost it needs. And then being anxious and feeling like shit for not being able to complete the task at hand. 

See how weird that is???? Yeah that's ADHD. 

Sometimes it results into crippling anxiety which makes us unable to move, while other times it makes us hyperactive, and we start working at superhuman speed on t completely unrelated projects. 

Believe me, it can be physically and mentally draining at times.
