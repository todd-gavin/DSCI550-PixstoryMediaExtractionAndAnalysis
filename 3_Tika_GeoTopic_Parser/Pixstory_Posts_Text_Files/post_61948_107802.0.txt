WHAT THE DAMN HELL???? 

A lot happened in the latest episode of The Flash, including not one but two versions of Eobard Thawne, but even that didn’t compare to the unexpected scene with John Diggle. David Ramsey’s character bopped around many Arrowverse shows with his mystery box for the past couple of years, so his appearance wasn’t necessarily surprising.

John Diggle appeared and revealed to Thawne that, after consulting some of the Arrowverse’s greatest minds, he realized that he might need the help of someone from centuries beyond. Thawne confirmed to Diggle that his instincts were spot on, and he knew exactly what the former Arrow character had to do to reopen the box.

Essentially, Thawne helped Diggle recreate the emotions he felt on the night that he first found the box, which helped reopen it and revealed that green glow. Diggle basked in the green, which Thawne revealed was Diggle’s key to being powerful. Diggle ultimately rejected the power, and when he threw it, the box dematerialized into a void. 

Of all the stupid endings that character arcs have had in Arrowverse, this might just be the stupidest ever. WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD CHOOSE NOT TO BE GREEN LANTERN??? 

I mean ofc Ryan Reynolds, but that's not the point. 

This was the most unsatisfying arc of Arrowverse, and fans have had a field day making sense of it.
