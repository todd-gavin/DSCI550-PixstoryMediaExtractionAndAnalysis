Lean and tasty, kangaroo is one of the healthiest meats around, as well being a national icon. But you better like your steak blue, or at least rare, as kangaroo is notoriously difficult to cook and can dry out quite easily if left on the barbie too long.

Tastewise, this Australian food is closest to beef. However, kangaroo has more protein and iron than beef, and fewer calories and fat content. It’s also a good source of omega-3.

Skyscanner says to head to the Red Ochre Grill if it’s your first time tasting roo. Their menu currently has it in three styles: as carpaccio, as a fillet and smoked as part of a salad.
