‘Mill on the Floss’ is a beautiful novel by Mary Ann Evans under the pen name George Eliot, one of the leading Victorian era writers. It is a heart wrenching tale which follows Maggie Tulliver, daughter of Mr. Tulliver owner of the mill situated by river Floss. 
We get a deeper look into child psychology and how it can affect them if they feel neglected. Maggie is a lovable character, one readers can relate to and feel her emotions. She is keen to learn and is rather intelligent. But she is treated as black sheep by everyone since she doesn’t like the usual womanly tasks her mother wants her to perform as was the custom in society. 
She yearns for love as she grows up. Soon the family faces various trials and tribulations. It is so heart warming to see the love and support all the family members try to provide in their own way. 
It is said that it is slightly autobiographical. Mary did face similar situations as she was rather similar to Maggie, differentiated because of her intelligence. Tom, Maggie’s brother is based on her brother Isaac 
and she had similar relationship with her father as shown in the novel. 
It is an all absorbing tale, running deep with melancholy, love and boasting of precious gem-like characters. Each of the characters are realistic, humans with flaws and merits. Everybody should read it 
once.
