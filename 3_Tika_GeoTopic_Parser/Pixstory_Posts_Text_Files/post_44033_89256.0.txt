#3. Fabinho

Fabinho is one of the greatest defending mid-fielders in Europe at the moment. The Brazilian has been an unstoppable force for the Liverpool team and contributes in defensive as well as offensive play. The 26-year-old is a tall guy which makes him very useful for Liverpool’s gegenpressing strategy. His height gives him a great advantage to make interceptions and take the game away from the opponents. 

#2. Casemiro

Casemiro deserves a place at number two because of his sheer dominating play in the past decade. Even though the Real Madrid defensive midfielder isn’t one of the most muscular players. But he makes up in intelligence what he lacks in muscles. He is undoubtedly one of the greatest defensive midfielders of the 21st century. His skilful style of play and his aggression when is admirable until it is under the limit. 


#1.Vinicius Jr. 

Another Los Blancos makes it to the top of the list. The world hasn’t been very kind to Vinicius after his dive in El Clasico. But what they fail to consider is his unbelievable form in the past two years. He has been an unstoppable force at the left flank for Real Madrid and has played a crucial role in making Los Blancos remain at the top of the table in La Liga. The 21-year-old has scored 17 goals this season and is only behind his teammate Karim Benzema in La Liga's goalscoring charts His form this season makes him the most important player for Real Madrid and even Seleção Canarinho for that matter.
