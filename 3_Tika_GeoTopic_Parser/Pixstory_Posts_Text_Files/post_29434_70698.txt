I love gardening and this is the hobby I feel very passionate about Well I love to be in touch with nature and feel inspired when I see that a plant I have planted grows and produce flowers or fruits I was inspired to take up this pastime activity from my grandfather who had been a devoted gardener Over time I have realised that gardening is a relaxing activity and gives me immense joy
