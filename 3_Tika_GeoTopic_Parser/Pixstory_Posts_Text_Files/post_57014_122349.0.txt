I think we are here to understand the fine line between tough love and when it deviates from its core points and becomes emotional abuse.
Whatever was being said in the parent post did not insinuate someone advocating the abusive behaviour; instead, it was very clearly spoken about tough love as not a medium to belittle or harm someone physically or mentally.

It is necessary to understand how it could be used to help people.
Firstly, tough love doesn't mean calling a person, be it a child or an adult, stupid just because they couldn't do anything; trying to trivialise issues by saying 'grow up' or 'it's no big deal, publicly scolding someone or making them feel bad about themselves, these behaviours of treating someone with contempt would not let you reach the required outcome, and that's where this fine line is created, where we comprehend the harm and intent instead of worsening it.
Tough love meant to use some constraints or restrictions but in a way that would compel someone to improve themselves, and people who would understand it would not. 

Well, I think it is a necessary evil sometimes.
For people who are engaged in unsafe habits or practices and are close to us, it is often essential to adopt a more serious way to help them grow and come out of it. It is not always harming the person doing on the receiving end but also someone choosing tough love, which could help them in many ways.
