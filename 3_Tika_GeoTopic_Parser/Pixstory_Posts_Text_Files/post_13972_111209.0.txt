On Thursday, the Sathish Dhawan Space Center in Sriharikota saw the successful launch of ISRO's PSLV-C53 carrying the DS-EO satellite and two additional co-passenger spacecraft.
It was a dual mission, and the orbital experimental module would continue to operate after launch.
The PSLV-C53/DS-EO satellites were successfully launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on Thursday from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota. The power-horse rocket precisely placed the satellites in the desired orbit.
This was NewSpace India Limited's (NSIL) second specifically devoted commercial mission, intended to launch the DS-EO satellite into orbit alongside two additional co-passenger spacecraft from ST Electronics, Singapore.
At 6:02 p.m., ISRO's workhorse PSLV launched three satellites—DS-EO, a 365 kg satellite, and NeuSAR, a 155 kg satellite—both of which are owned by Singapore and were constructed by Starec Initiative, Republic of Korea. A 2.8 kilogramme Scoob-1 from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore came in third.
