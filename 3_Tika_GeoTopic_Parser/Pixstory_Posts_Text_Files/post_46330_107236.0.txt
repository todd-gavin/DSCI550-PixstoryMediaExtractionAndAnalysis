It's World Blood Donor Day Today ! But Unfortunately i have Never donated the blood ! Sad but true ! But Everytime i see other people donating Blood , I became Soo excited to know about it's Process ! 💉

One day I went to hospital With one of my Relative , as my relative was donating Blood ! I was very excited to see the whole process !!

Lemme explain What i saw there ! When it’s time to donate , here’s what will happen :

1 You’ll go into a donor room where you’ll lie down on a cot .
2 A Nurse will clean your arm and insert a new , sterile needle into your vein . This takes just a few seconds , and it can feel like a quick pinch .
3 You’ll donate about 1 pint (one unit) of blood . 
4 The process will take less than 10 minutes . But if you’re donating platelets , red cells , or plasma by apheresis , the process can take much longer : like up to 2 hours .
5 When you’re done , they will ask you to raise your donation arm and put a little bit of pressure on it , which helps your blood clot .
6 Then they’ll put an adhesive strip .

After This They will give You some Refreshments to eat which includes some healthy Snacks and water ! But lemme tell you according to me This process of inserting needle is painful ! As the Expressions of my relative Changed When They inserted needle In arm ! 💉😩

I genuinely want to do this process of blood donation ! As the Feeling of satisfaction After Donating blood is Very different . After donating blood , You know that you saved many lives 💪❤️ 

Happy World blood Donors Day 💉❤️💪
