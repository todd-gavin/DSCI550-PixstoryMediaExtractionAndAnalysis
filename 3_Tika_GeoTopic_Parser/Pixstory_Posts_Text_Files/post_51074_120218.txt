The trailer of Akshay Kumar s upcoming film Raksha Bandhan is released The audience is feeling the connection with the trailer and is even appreciating it The film Raksha Bandhan is getting released on August on the occasion of Independence Day and also the Raksha Bandhan festival On the same date Aamir Khan s Laal Singh Chaddha is getting released Now after both the trailers got released the reaction from the audience is out Laal Singh Chaddha vs Raksha Bandhan which film has an edge after the trailer While the stories of both the movies are very much different the current position of both Akshay and Aamir is almost similar Both the superstars are desperately looking for a big hit When it comes to working Akshay and Aamir follow different ideologies While Akshay does o movies every year Aamir mostly does one or two movies in a couple of years Akki s last release was Samrat Prithviraj which tanked at the box office whereas Aamir Khan s last release was Thugs of Hindostan released in which was a big dud at the box office So definitely Akshay kumar will be expecting Raksha Bandhan to do well in the theaters so that at least the tag of superstar stays with him On the other hand the trailer and character of Aamir Khan in Laal Singh Chaddha have been mercilessly trolled on social media with many comparing it with the superstar s earlier character in the movie PK So when Raksha Bandhan and Laal Singh Chaddha fight it out in the theaters it will be a taste of star power for the big superstars Akshay Kumar and Aamir Khan Yet another flop can make big damage to the standing of either of these stars as Bollywood s A listed superstars
