For those out there who are trying to be their best self and break free from their generational toxicity feel you on a deep level I know it s hard when your family says you ve changed with that disapproving look in their eye Or when your mom won t speak to you anymore or you re called arrogant I feel you on the deepest level Just know that it s not by your words but by your example that you ll be able to make huge changes in the world Just know that while they may lash out at you harshly that it s just a representation of the hurt they feel inside You cannot be responsible for them or anyone else in their experience in life Keep pushing on keep growing and know that you are not alone
