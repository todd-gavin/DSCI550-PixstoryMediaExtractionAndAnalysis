Jens Gerhard Lehmann started his senior career at Schalke, where he spent the longest duration and made the most appearances of his career. Aside from numerous goalkeeping exploits, Lehmann became the first keeper to score in the Bundesliga with a penalty against 1860 Munich in 1994-95. He scored another goal in 1997-98, an equalising header in the dying minutes against rivals Borussia Dortmund. In 1997, his heroics in the penalty shootout won Schalke the UEFA Cup against Inter Milan. After an unsuccessful 6 months at Milan, he signed for Dortmund in 1999. He was pivotal in the 2001-02 season as Dortmund won the Bundesliga. 
Lehman joined Arsenal in 2003, with big shoes to fill after the departure of David ‘Safe Hands’ Seaman. Jens Lehmann was Arsenal’s goalkeeper for every game in the ‘Invincibles’ season. He also holds the UEFA Champions League record for most consecutive shutouts after not conceding in eight straight matches for Arsenal. He went 853 minutes without conceding a goal, which is also a record. Lehmann has won UEFA goalkeeper of the year twice: with Schalke in 1996-97 and with Arsenal in 2005-06. In the 2005 FA Cup final against Manchester United, Lehmann showcased an all-time classic performance; he made several exceptional saves to maintain the deadlock after extra time and made the only save in the shootout to win Arsenal the cup. 2007-08 was his last season for Arsenal. Competition with Manuel Almunia and Lukasz Fabianski made it difficult for him to be a regular fixture in the first team that season. He then spent two years at VfB Stuttgart and announced his retirement in 2010. However, in March 2011 Lehmann decided to come out of retirement as Arsenal found themselves with only one fit keeper. A start in April against Blackburn made him the oldest Arsenal player ever in the Premier League. At the end of this season, he retired once again, this time for good. Lehmann also had a stellar career at the national level; he made 61 appearances and was part of the World Cup squads in 1998, 2002, and 2006 as well as the Euro squads in 2000, 2004, and 2008.
