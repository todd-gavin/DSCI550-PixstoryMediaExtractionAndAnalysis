Revolution and love –Both are powerful. Both are slow and steady. Both have physical and emotional damage. Both have to go through tough paths to land the desired output. You may fail or win.. but the journey..matters a lot.

Watch Sai Pallavi, the South Indian movie star in her latest hit Virata Parvam. You would get it better. The actress has taken out all her prowess in enacting Vennela, a naive village girl who falls in love with a Naxalite leader’s poetry first, then himself. It’s been a while since I watched a touching love story. Obviously, we now need epic love tales to get that feel 😊.

Since childhood, Vennela who came out to the world with the help of a Naxalite doctor, was stubborn. She gives her life to protect what she loves and believes in. Utter honesty in her leads to impulsive actions like informing her would-be and parents - she loves a Naxalite who she hasn’t met yet and she would marry only him no matter what.

What makes this story moving is Vennela’s true love and her perseverance to meet the hero in her dreams. The brightness and awe in her eyes in the very first accidental meeting with him make us emotional.  She leaves home and begins a tough journey to be part of his revolution and life. It was just Paulo Coelho’s What is “true” will always endure theory. Her true love is her revolution.

More than Vennela’s hardships across the journey, her innate innocence to hold on to her first, ardent love with no fear of acceptance steals our hearts. It couldn’t be more realistic and sincere. A part of me absorbed her thrust, excitement, anger, and love in the limited time and space she had with Ravanna, her life ambition.

Everybody else takes a back seat in this film. This is what you call a woman-centric role. Rana Daggubati’s looks and acting justify an unemotional Naxalite leader. Nadita Das and Priyamani had mere roles.

Virata Parvam is written and directed by Venu Udugula. Soulful music, intelligent camera. No superhuman action blocks.
