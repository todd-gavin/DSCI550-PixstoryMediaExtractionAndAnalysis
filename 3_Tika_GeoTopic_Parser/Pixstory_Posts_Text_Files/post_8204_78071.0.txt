The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation said that the Islamic Emirate has reached an agreement with Qatari and Turkish joint ventures on the details of aviation security, ground services and airspace of the five airports of the country.

“The details have been discussed, a series of general decisions have been taken, but the talks are still ongoing and we are moving in a positive direction,” said Imamuddin Ahmadi, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation.

Meanwhile, the Qatari Foreign Ministry announced that it has agreed with the Islamic Emirate and Turkey on "several key issues" concerning running Kabul Airport.

A trilateral meeting between Turkey, Qatar, and Islamic Emirate officials on the issue was held in Doha on Thursday, the ministry said.

The Qatari Foreign Ministry said the three-party delegation agreed on “several key issues” on how to manage and operate Kabul Airport.

The Qatari Foreign Ministry did not provide further details.

The former chairman of the Afghanistan Civil Aviation Authority (ACAA) called on the Islamic Emirate to prepare the terms of the agreement in such a way as to provide a fair and equal basis for Qatari and Turkish companies to operate with domestic companies.

“If the contract is to be regulated from the beginning for the operating contract, the liability of the airlines should become a supervisory role over a period of two to three years,” said Mohammad Qasem Wafayeezada, former chairman of the ACAA.

Since the fall of the previous government, regular commercial flights have been suspended in the country. Now with the handover of the Kabul, Herat, Kandahar, Mazar, and Mazar airports to foreign companies, optimism about the resumption of these flights has increased.

“Aviation services at Kabul Airport by international companies will have a positive impact on the resumption of flights,” said Ghulam Masum Masumi, air traffic expert.
