Today its the festival of Karwa Chauth, and women fast for their husband's safety. This festival falls on the fourth day of the dark fortnight in Kartika month every year.
Karwa Chauth means offering 'Argya' to the moon using an earthen pot known as Karwa on the Chaturthi of the Karthika month.
There are many stories in the legends and the epics of Indian mythology which talk about Karwa Chauth but the origin of the ritual is quite unclear. 
The Story of Karwa
According to One story, there was a woman named Karwa who was deeply in Love with her husband and their intense Love gave her spiritual powers. 
Once her husband went to bathe in the river, he was attacked by a crocodile. After the attack, the courageous Karwa bound the crocodile with cotton yarn and remembered Yama, the Lord of death. She asked Lord Yamraj to give life to her husband and death sentence to the crocodile. He said he was afraid he couldn’t do so. In return, Karwa threatened to curse Lord Yama and destroy Yamdev. Yama was seriously afraid of being cursed by such a devoted and doting wife and thus he sent the crocodile to hell and gave life back to her husband.
The story of Karwa is narrated to women even today on Karwa Chauth, and the women pray to Karwa Mata for happiness in their marriage, and long life together.
