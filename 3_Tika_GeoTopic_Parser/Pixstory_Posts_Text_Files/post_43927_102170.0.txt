Juventus are confident of securing Brazilian center back Gabriel Maghalaesâ€™ services from Arsenal this summer.

Having missed out on the Champions League this season, Arsenal might have its stars head turn if teams playing in the UCL come knocking on their door asking for them. The project Mikel Arteta is building seems to be heading in the right direction, but failure to qualify for the UCL will certainly affect incomings and outgoings for the club.

Club legend Giorgio Chiellini will be leaving the club after 18 successful years of service this summer, and The Old Lady have identified Gabriel as their prime transfer target for this summer.

Juventus will be able to offer him the allure of playing in the Champions League.

Gabriel has formed a formidable partnership with new signing Ben White this season, settling in as part of a backline which has kept 12 clean sheets across the Premier League this season, 6 more than last season. Gabriel is instrumental to the way Arsenal play this season, with important defensive and offensive contributions.

What poses an interesting problem to Arsenal in this situation is the returning William Saliba.

With expectations of regular playing time by the Frenchmen, Arsenal could foresee selling Gabriel to make room for Saliba in the first team. However, this would be a move that would leave them incredibly short on both quality and quantity in the defense.
