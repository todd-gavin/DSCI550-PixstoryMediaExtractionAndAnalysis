There's nothing wrong with spending money on weddings as long as it's not for show. Have you ever visited a cafe or a fine dining establishment? You spend a lot of money there even though you could obtain the same food for less money elsewhere, but you enjoy spending time and money there.

People in our society do not spend for their happiness; instead, they spend for 'Samaj me IZZAT,' and they love to boast, despite the fact that riches might make people flatter you but not respect you. 

You will be valued for what you do, not for how much money you have. So it's fine to spend money if it makes you happy, but it's not a good idea to spend money solely to flaunt your wealth.
