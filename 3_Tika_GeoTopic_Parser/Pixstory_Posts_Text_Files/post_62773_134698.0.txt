A HOW-TO ON DISAPPEARING
No one understands the way we break.
Not jagged. Not knife sliding between ribs.
Not the spine, cracking.
That would be too easy.
That would be being able to know that
you're broken. That would be X-rays
showing the gaps, the fissures.
Clean breaks are easier to heal.
We do not break cleanly.
We break without breaking.
Not a crack, but a fog.
We dissipate.
Body here one moment and
not here the next.
Hands working one moment and
a dead weight the next.
We watch ourselves turn
colourless. Watch ourselves
become invisible / invincible.
This way, at least the pain is our own.
That's what I wanted all along, I guess.

I recently came across this poem collection from Darshana Suresh. It's a set of poems about hurting and healing, about surviving and letting go. If you want to start out at poetry, you might wanna have a look at this beautiful collection.
