One of my favourite places to spend time on the campus has got to be the undergraduate library where I can spend hours and lose track of time ( I have about 140+ library hours in attendance).

That may appear to be a bit much but our libraries have a great background that's conducive for both studying and research work. The undergraduate library is sectioned off into study spaces as well as research zones where students and scholars from all streams can look up research papers and books from both online and offline directories. There are several computers and charging ports as well so the study spaces are convenient to use because most of us work quietly on our laptops most of the time anyway.

We do have another postgraduate library which is larger than the undergraduate library. Whenever I do have a lot of time and want to spend time looking out at the window for some pretty views, I visit the PG library (it also has an extensive collection of books on the subjects I'm interested in that the undergraduate library does not, and so that's another motive to visit).

But I do have a soft spot for the undergraduate library because it's a short walk from my block and this sculpture art installation is right at the entrance of it. I like looking at this one (especially the moss covered one) because it gives me a sense of calm (Unfortunately I wasn't allowed to take pictures inside the library but it's big and spacious either way).

The libraries open at 7:30 in the morning and are open till 9:00 in the evening so it's always welcoming and encouraging students to use the library as they please.
