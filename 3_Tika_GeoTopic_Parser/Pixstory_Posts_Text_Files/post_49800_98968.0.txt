We all are unanimous in ending gun violence and let's see what the Washtenaw Country board adopted. They crafted a 14-point plan to end gun violence in Washtenaw County and was approved Wednesday evening by the county’s Board of Commissioners.

The recommendations came from various sources including anti-violence groups, residents who have encountered the consequences of gun violence and local policymakers. The goal of the resolution is to maximum prevent gun violence. 

Some of the recommendations include:

Creation of the Washtenaw County Violence Commission, per the resolution. 

Identifying people and places that drive violence and engaging these people and places with empathy and accountability.

Holding local governments responsible for reducing violence

Developing an anti-violence workforce.

Investing in these violence-affected areas with better policing.

Enhancing trauma-informed healing for individuals affected.

Committing funds to reach new stakeholders to help with anti-violence strategies.

Building a community centre in the eastern part of Washtenaw County, as well as a community mural for safe grieving.

Establish a community response protocol for grief and loss regarding violent deaths.

Establish an alert system to communicate anti-violence efforts with the community.

The commissioners also ratified staff to identify assets to deal with anti-violence efforts, the release states.

“We have seen the devastating impact of gun violence on our community,” said Derrick Jackson, director of community engagement for the Washtenaw County Sheriff’s Office. “For lasting impact, we know it won’t be easy and it will take all of us working together.”

Yes, this is a good step toward preventing gun violence and if this works, all the other steps could work on the same model to end gun violence.
