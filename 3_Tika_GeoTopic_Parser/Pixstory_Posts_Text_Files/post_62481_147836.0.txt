Since snow leopards are apex predators, they at the top of the food chain and do not have any natural predators of their own. All other members of the genus Panthera are also considered apex predators. They are typically large carnivores.
The leopard stalks or ambushes its prey in order to catch it. It makes an effort to approach its aim as closely as feasible in either situation.
When they are 20 to 50 feet (6-15 m) away from their target, they often start their attack. After that, it accelerates quickly (up to 60 km/h), pounces on its target, and bites it in the neck to finish it off.
The snow leopard's large paws serve as snowshoes and provide grip as it runs after its prey on ice, snowy, and stone surfaces.
The snow leopard can easily climb very steep slopes thanks to its muscular physique. The snow leopard can leap six times as far as its body length thanks to its rear legs. Long tails let animals move quickly, balance themselves, and shield the snow leopard from the elements while it is resting.
