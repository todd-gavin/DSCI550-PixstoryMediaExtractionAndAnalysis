Bitter defeat for Blessin&#39;s Genoa who fell at home against Sarri&#39;s Lazio The rossobl coach intervened like this in the post-match press conference Last week we didn&#39;t start the match well and we had to fight to get in Today the team was in the first twenty minutes I&#39;m not sorry We did well we entered the game with concentration We had some problems with Portanova on the left and he swapped with Melegoni It&#39;s clear that there are matches in which even when there are difficult situations where the referee doesn&#39;t blow your whistle or you lose balls you must have a clear head We lost deservedly I think VAR is a good thing because it corrects bad decisions We have had situations in several matches where we were not helped in that situation If the referee in that situation or the VAR intervened and said that it was still a foul it was a red card and theirs would not have happened In the last few games we lacked a bit of luck on this To be clear Lazio won deservedly If we see the facts on the first goal conceded the team is not focused He thought penalty and not penalty Lazio restarted We gave too many gifts
