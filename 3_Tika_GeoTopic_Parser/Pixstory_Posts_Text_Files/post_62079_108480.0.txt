Raheem Sterling is a potential transfer target for Chelsea, according to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano. The Manchester City winger is on the Bluesâ€™ list for a move this summer, as he is admired by the Chelsea Gaffer. 

While Chelsea haven't submitted a bid to City and has not even opened the channels for talks, as the deal hinges on departure of Romelu Lukaku. 

There are also other factors such as arrival of Dembele which will influence the deal. Dembele has been linked with Chelsea for a while now, and he will be arriving as a free agent. Dembele was highly influential in making things happen in the attacking third during the last games of La Liga. 

Pulisic, Werner and Ziyech are the mainstays in the wingers department of Chelsea, but they have all failed to produce impactful performances last season. 

With Werner and Ziyech being eyed for a move away from the club, Sterling and Dembele's chances have skyrocketed. 

The dilemma posed before Tuchel is to either sign a young injury prone Dembele for free Or sign a slightly older Sterling for 60 million. 

It's a tough choice for him, but if it were me, I'd get them both, coz Chelsea needs big guns in their arsenal. We'll have to wait and watch what Chelsea accomplishes in the transfer window under Tuchel's command
