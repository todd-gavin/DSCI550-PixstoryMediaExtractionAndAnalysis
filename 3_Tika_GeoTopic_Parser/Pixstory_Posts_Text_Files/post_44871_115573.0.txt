Erik Ten Hag started off his career with a bang as The Red Devils beat Liverpool 4-0 in their summer tour of Thailand and Australia. 

Ten Hag chose a vastly experienced team compared to Liverpool’s Jurgen Klopp and it paid off with United racing a 3-0 lead at half-time.

Klopp made a raft of substitutions on the 30th and 60th minutes and Ten Hag pulled off 10 changes at half-time. The Dutchman’s second-string increased United’s lead late on through Facundo Pellistri. 

Liverpool, who started with a mix of the first and second-team youngsters, started brightly in front of 50,000 fans at Rajamangala Stadium and David de Gea pulled off two early saves from Issac Mabaya’s cross and then saved a full stretch from Luiz Diaz. 

But, after 12 minutes, Mabaya failed to clear Bruno Fernandes’s cross Sancho whipped off the first-time cross with his right foot. 

Liverpool hit the post twice in quick succession through Fabio Carvalho - making his debut following his move from Fulham and Diaz soon afterwards but the end of the first half was dominated by The Red Devils. 

The Brazilian midfielder, Fred made it 2-0 in 30 minutes with a wonderful clipped-in finish which sailed over Alisson’s head into the goal. Diego Dalot almost made it 4-0 before half-time but struck the underside of the bar. 

Kloop waited for his big names like Virgil Van Dijk, Mohamed Salah, and Thiago to come in and seal the game for him, but it was too late. The newly signed Darwin Nunez was denied by Tom Heaton who came in as Dea Gea’s replacement. Heaton pulled off a good save and it was United who scored again in the 77th minute when Pellistri finished off a slick counter-attack started off by a wonderful run by Eric Bailly. 

Salah almost had pulled one back but saw a curling effort with his left foot come back off the post before Nunez blasted the rebound over the post.
