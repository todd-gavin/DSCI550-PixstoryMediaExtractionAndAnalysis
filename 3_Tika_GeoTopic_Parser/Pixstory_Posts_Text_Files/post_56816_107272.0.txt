Tommy Hilfiger will launch its first-ever dog collection in 2023 after signing a licensing agreement with Kanine Pets World Limited.
The dog collection will be a "comprehensive range" that will include apparel, accessories and home products for dogs, all created in the signature Tommy Hilfiger style and infused with the brand's "distinctive preppy touch".

Kanine will handle the collection's design, production, and global distribution, which promises to offer the signature Tommy Hilfiger style and the brand's distinctive preppy touch. Across the line, the trademark red, white and blue colour palette will be found and complemented by seasonal pops of blush pink and jade green.

Alongside the apparel, the collection will also include essential dog accessories, including a braided leather leash set, a lightweight sport set and a leash set with a collar, harness and leash made from stripe fabric and leather straps. All sets will be designed with Hilfiger's flag logo and can be completed with a nylon or silicone bag holder.
