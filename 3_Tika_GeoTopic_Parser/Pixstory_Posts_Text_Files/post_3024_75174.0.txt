Massive volcanic eruption in Tonga, an island close to New Zealand, in the South Pacific Ocean killed several people there. The tsunami created by its explosive impact drowned people 6,800 miles away in Peru in South America.

But the eruption also disrupted the operations of an oil refinery near the country’s capital city Lima, forcing the government call an environmental emergency. They announced 21 beaches on the Pacific coasts were severely contaminated by an oil spill after the La Pampilla refinery, run by the Spanish company Repsol got disrupted. Apparently, 6,000 barrels of oil leaked after waves following the volcanic eruption hit the refinery.

The beaches were blackened killing dozens of seabirds, including the rare Humboldt penguin in the biodiversity hotspot. Hundreds of fishermen’s families were deeply affected by the accident termed as a colossal “ecological disaster” by the Peruvian government. These people, rendered jobless, will not be able to earn a livelihood in a devastated marine environment for months.  

Peru’s Prime Minister Mirtha Vásquez said the refinery had not planned any contingency plan for an oil spill and the country’s foreign ministry asked the company to immediately compensate for the damages caused by the oil spill. Repsol responded by saying that it’s carrying out an investigation to find out the cause of the spill and promised to clean-up the affected beaches by the end of February.

Clean-up of the oil spill by the company and asking for compensation by the government may control the damage to some extent, but the disaster could have been averted had both the parties been more careful.

There should have been more checks and balances before the company was allowed to operate in such a biodiversity hotspot. Once an oil spill happens it’s usually not very easy to restore the marine ecosystem to its earlier form.
