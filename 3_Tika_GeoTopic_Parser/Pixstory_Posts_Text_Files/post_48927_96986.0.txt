More than 50 million dogs, cats, primates, rabbits, rats, and other animals are expected to be subjected to painful tests in the United States each year. Animals are purposely poisoned or infected with diseases, kept in barren cages, and usually murdered when the experiment is over. Because humans and animals are so dissimilar, old animal trials frequently fail to effectively predict how the human body would react to medications, chemicals, or therapies.

Animal testing will not make it easier for scientists to find the right therapies and treatments for humans. When testing pharmaceuticals and therapies on animals first, because some drugs and treatments are hazardous to animals' lives and can result in their death. Thousands of people die each year as a result of pharmaceuticals that were tested on animals. The reality is that the vast majority of animal studies do not improve human health, and the relevance of animal research in most medical advancements is debatable. According to additional studies, most medications that appear to be safe and effective in animals, causing no harm to the animals, fail in humans, or cause considerable harm, even death. That's because an animal's body is fundamentally different from a human's and cannot be identified in the same way. Animals, they argue, are unreliable subjects because their bodies are not physically comparable to humans. Animal organs, neurological systems, and cellular makeup are so dissimilar that experiments would provide false results. The results of these tests could be harmful to people, as well as a waste of an animal's life.
