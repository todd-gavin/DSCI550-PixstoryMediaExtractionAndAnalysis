A summit between US President Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely said a senior US administration official quoted by CNN The official said that while the Biden administration is open to further engagements between the two leaders if we think that makes sense and could have a beneficial impact on the crisis intelligence reports indicating further Russian military action would preclude any leaders meeting Our strong feeling based on everything we are seeing on the ground in areas around Ukraine north east south and that Russia is continuing to prepare for military action that could take place in the next few hours or days. So the administration certainly cannot engage in a meeting that assumes that Russia will not take military action when it clearly appears that it will. the AGI news agency
