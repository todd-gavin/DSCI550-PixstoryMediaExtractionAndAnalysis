Trump has been repeatedly stating since the start of the Ukraine-Russia conflict that if he was still in office, the war wouldn't have started. According to Trump his personality kept the US out of war during his time as President but John Bolton believes otherwise. Bolton had served as the national security advisor for Trump from 2018 to 2019. According to Bolton, Trump wouldn't have been able to broker peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in the ongoing confli

Bolton told the Palm Beach Post that, "This would require thinking through a policy and considering the pluses and minuses, the risks and costs involved. That's just not what he does." Bolton believes that Trump would have removed the United States from the NATO alliance in the blink of an eye if he was elected for a second term. Trump believed that NATO was a burden on the United States and wanted withdraw the U.S. from NATO. 

Seeing Trump's relationship with Putin, the former President would have given Ukraine to Russia without any resistance. During his presidency Trump had frequently tried to undermine NATO and had also stated the intention of leaving it. He had called its members delinquents. According to the New York Times, Trump told his top national security officials that he did not understand why the military alliance existed, and often described it as a drain on the U.S. Seeing this if the former President wouldn't have put up much of a fight against the Russia in the ongoing conflict. The former President's term may have been one with less wars but that is not a indicator of his skills to deal with situations like the one in Ukraine.
