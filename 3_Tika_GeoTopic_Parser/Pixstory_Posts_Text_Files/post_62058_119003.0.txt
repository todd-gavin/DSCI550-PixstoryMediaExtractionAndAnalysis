Erling Haaland walks with the kind of strut they appreciate in Manchester City

Maybe itâ€™s because his formative years were spent in the city, when his father Alfie was wearing the sky blue shirt that now appears to be a perfect fit

Haland is like a God sent for city fans, as they have always lacked a good striker, but the chosen one, Haland didn't waste too much time and scored a decisive winner for City against Bayern Munich yesterday. 

Of course the big guy was over the moon and the over imposing and slightly arrogant personality was on full display yesterday in the post match press conference. 

Pep did warn him to be humble like his teammate Kevin de Bryune, hopefully he'll heed the word of caution
