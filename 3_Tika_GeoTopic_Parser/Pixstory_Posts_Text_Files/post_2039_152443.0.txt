Yankees, superstar, Aaron, Judge, recently broke a 61 year record held by Roger Maris. This was the home run record for the American League, 61 home runs in one season was broken and now Aaron Judge holds it with 62.This past month saw triumphs and failures by Aaron Judge, seeing him hit enough home runs to bring him to the precipice of the record, but failing at many turns to finally break it. That all changed last night in the Yankees game against the Texas Rangers. Now he can breathe a sigh of relief.Though this record pales in comparison to Mark, McGwire and Barry Bonds who hit 70 and 73 home runs in one season, respectively, in the National League, Aaron Judgeâ€™s record is not tainted by accusations of steroid use.This record comes as no surprise for Aaron Judge, who, in his first at bat in the majors, hit a homerun, and who went on to hold the homerun record for a rookie at the at the time, at 52 home runs.Judges 62nd home run ball was caught by a fan who works as a vice president at a large investment firm. It is expected to go for at least $2 million.
