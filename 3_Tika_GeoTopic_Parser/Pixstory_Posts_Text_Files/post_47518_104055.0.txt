Losses to Tottenham in the league rattled them, but they responded by winning 12 straight 
matches between November and February - laying down their marker for winning the Premier League. In the end were a few hiccups, dropped points to West Ham and trailing by two goals to Villa. But they pulled through, and they won the league - once again.

Standout Performers

1. Kevin De Bruyne

Once again, it was a standout season for KDB. Whatever role you ask him to play, he does it and he does it fantastically. Winning the Premier League Player of the Season award, De Bruyne was at the heart of Manchester City’s title challenge, scoring the crucial goals and setting up the same.

Hailed by Steven Gerrard as an ‘absolute specialist’, the Belgian has scored 15 goals and provided 7 assists for his teammates this season. De Bruyne received the prize also in 2019-20, joining Thierry Henry, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Nemanja Vidic as the only players to win it twice.

2. Joao Cancelo

After a shaky start and possibly leaving the club this summer, there has been no looking back 
for Cancelo. He has transformed himself into one of the worlds best inverted wingbacks, coming towards the middle of the pitch to facilitate and build up play. He has played a crucial role in attack, providing six assists to his teammates, including a sublime pass to Raheem Sterling against Everton at the Goodison Park.

What’s Next For Manchester City?

Improvement never stops at Manchester City.
The arrival of possibly the world’s best young 
striker in Erling Haaland is a warning shot to clubs across Europe, as City will strengthen to 
target the Champions League once again. As for Pep Guardiola, the summer will once again be 
spent in soul searching, as to what he needs to do more to win the elusive Champions League- something he has failed to do ever since leaving Barcelona.
