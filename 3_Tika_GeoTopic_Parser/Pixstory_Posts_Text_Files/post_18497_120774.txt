Despite his birthday Fernando Alonso has no intention of stopping racing Indeed he would like to win again and be more competitive And to do so he has announced that next year he will be a driver of the Aston Martin team with whom he has signed a multi-year contract There will therefore be a farewell to Alpine who failed to give him a competitive car after bringing him back to F after three years of absence Personally I&#39;m still hungry and have the ambition to fight on the front lines I want to be part of an organization that wants to learn, improve and triumph said Alonso The passion the desire performance that I saw in Aston Martin convinced me to continue my commitment to F. I want to win again and I think I have chosen the best opportunity to do it Alonso will in fact take Vettel&#39;s place who will instead say goodbye to racing to devote himself to his family and who knows what else The British team did not have its best season despite the large investments for the development of a new qualitative car With Alonso they will try to make the leap in quality The Aston Martin team is putting great effort and energy into trying to win and one of the most exciting teams in the F today I have seen how they have attracted great professionals with winning pedigrees and at Silverstone there is a great desire to raise resources At the moment no other team is showing the same vision and the same desire to win
