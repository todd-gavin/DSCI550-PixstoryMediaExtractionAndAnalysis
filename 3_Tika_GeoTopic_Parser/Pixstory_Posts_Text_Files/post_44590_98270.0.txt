The Snow Lion and the British Lion continues....

Other than the issue of the proposed boundary lines, the other issues discussed included the recognition by China of Tibet’s independence, and an indemnity demanded by the Tibetans from the Chinese for the damage and destruction caused by Zhao Erfeng’s invasion. The Chinese stand, as explained by Chen I-fan (Ivan Chen), who was officially a Chinese plenipotentiary, was practically the same as the Chinese stand on Tibet today. Chen I-fan claimed that Tibet was a part of China, and that it had become part of the Chinese empire due to the conquest of Chinggis Khan. 

This was further confirmed, as per him, when the Fifth Dalai Lama accepted some titles from the Chinese Emperor. (He did not mention that the Chinese Emperor reciprocally also accepted some titles from the Dalai Lama). Another point made was that the Tibetans had called upon the Manchu court to provide military help many times, and each time it was provided. 

The examples cited were during the invasions of the Dzungar Mongols (in support of one of the warring Tibetan factions) and of the Gorkhas. As regards Zhao Erfeng, it was explained that the Chinese government had only acted in accordance of the Treaty of 1906, and that the troops were sent to protect the Trade Marts. He further claimed that the Amban had the right to have an escort of 2,600 men, and the right to control the internal and foreign affairs of Tibet. 

The Chinese demand was that the status of Tibet had to be restored to that as in the 1906 Agreement, that a thousand Chinese troops be stationed in Lhasa, and the rest of the 2,600 in other places in Tibet, to be decided by the Ambans. The border between China and Tibet was to be at Gyamda, approximately 240 km east of Lhasa.
