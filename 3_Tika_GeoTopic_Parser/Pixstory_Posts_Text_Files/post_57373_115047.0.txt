Burpees
Burpees are an intense HIIT exercise. It requires you to perform a push-up, followed by a leap in the air and return to the floor. Burpees engage most of your muscles and target your calves, chest, triceps, shoulders, biceps and glutes, and lower back.

High Knees
Another effective HIIT exercise that doesn't require any special equipment is high knees. High knees strengthen all the muscles in your legs. Doing so also quickens your heartbeat, which enhances your body's coordination and flexibility.

Lunge Jump
Lunge jumps are a more challenging version of the standard walking lunge exercise. This HIIT workout involves leaping into the air, changing your forward foot and landing. This activity burns a ton of calories and doesn't require any weight lifting equipment. Additionally, it helps raise your heart rate.

Jumping Jacks
Jumping jacks, also known as side-straddle hops, are full-body HIIT workouts that can be performed practically anywhere, as no special equipment is needed.

Mountain Climbers
Mountain Climbers are an excellent exercise for building cardio endurance and agility. The practice involves alternating between lifting and lowering your knees in a crawling motion as if climbing a mountain on the floor. So when you do Mountain Climbers, you'll feel like you are climbing a mountain.
