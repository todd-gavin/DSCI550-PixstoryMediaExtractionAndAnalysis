Marvel’s new superhero movie ‘Morbius’ will release tomorrow in theatres. Morbius is the first movie of this particular character. Before that, we have never seen this character in any of the Marvel Movies. So the audience doesn’t know what to expect from this movie. So let me explain to you something about Morbius that I read in Marvel Comics. 

So, Who is Morbius? 

According to the comics, Morbius is a noble prize-winning Biochemist Dr. Micheal and he creates a cure for his rare blood disease that turns into a curse. 

After this, Dr. Micheal attempted experimental treatment and transforms himself into Morbius- a pseudo- vampire with superhuman powers and overwhelming bloodlust. If he wants to survive, he needs to drink blood and after drinking the victim’s blood, he filled with guilt, remorse, and self-loathing 

When Micheal and his friend Emil Nikos wander in a town, Micheal falls and got seriously injured, and when Micheal and Emil go to college where they study science so that they could figure out a cure for Morbius’ condition. 

Morbius got his powers from Bat and in a vampiric state his face changes to look more bat-like and his bones become partially hollow which helps him to fly like a bat. 

So let’s hope Marvel will not disappoint us and the audience will something new and fresh and after watching they will become a fan of Morbius.
