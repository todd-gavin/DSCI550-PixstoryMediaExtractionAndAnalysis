Defeated at home by Juric&#39;s Turin Davide Nicola analyzed Salernitana&#39;s performance to DAZN. irritated but I accept the defeat knowing that my team didn&#39;t deserve it both for the numbers produced and for the fact that the management of the match doesn&#39;t agree with me We need to improve in concreteness But we were there making a point could give a different taste to this match Those who understand football know that playing against Torino requires immediate verticalization The great pressure they bring to the man forces you to play quickly and that speed often translates into verticalization We prepared the game to maneuver with more patience and we did so in part Even in the first half we created so much that we produced the first chance it&#39;s clear that we need to improve our speed and understand the opponent&#39;s quality but tonight it&#39;s difficult to make a complaint against this team I don&#39;t want to save myself I keep the conviction and the ability to think that things can happen because we want them to happen I can&#39;t tell you a percentage I happened to be on the other side of being able to achieve something even when someone didn&#39;t think it
