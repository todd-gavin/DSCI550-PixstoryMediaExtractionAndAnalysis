Double standards and casual misogyny have made sexism almost obscure yet it s still a barrier for many women and something we all need to confront In a study from Pew Research Centre found a stark difference of opinion between women and men about whether or not sexism still exists Where of women believe that there continue to be major obstacles for women to get ahead only of men feel similarly Which is let s face it part of the problem However it begs the question of why there is a gender divide in the first place It all starts with the normalisation of sexism which has made it so pervasive in our daily lives that we often fail to see it Our culture is so ingrained with double standards that we often don t realise we re supporting it Expecting our daughters to be more self controlled and courteous than our sons after all boys will be boys is an example Or judging women who do not maintain their youthful appearance and shape more harshly than men Or the notion that boys and girls have natural abilities as well as in the business where men are promoted based on potential while women are promoted based on performance Even worse when high achieving women are passed over because of unproven assumptions like she ll probably have babies soon and won t want the strain More people need to wake up and realise that sexism remains a barrier for women and that each of us has a role to play in eliminating it It is not enough to agree that gender equality is ethically right We need an army of men and women actively addressing sexism where it lives if we are to see progress In our talks at the office coffee machine at home at the dinner table or at the bar on a Friday night This isn t about portraying men as villains or presenting women as victims It s about taking personal responsibility for the role we all play in protecting the status quo even if unknowingly and having the guts to do our part to change it
