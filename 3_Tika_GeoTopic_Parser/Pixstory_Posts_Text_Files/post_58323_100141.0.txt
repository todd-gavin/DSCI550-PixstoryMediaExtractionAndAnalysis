To the one , who listens
To the one , who replies
To the one , with whom I cried
To the one , who wiped my tears of sorrrow and gave me joy
To the one , who's always by my side
To the one , who's my hope
To the one , who's close
To the one , who's looking over here
To the one, who always care
To the one, who's my lover
Even my brother
To the one , I also thought as my mother
To the one who's my family 
Actually my home
I just can't express my thankfulness from
May be you got , about whom I talking 
The one, whom I always adoring!
Yes it's the "God" 
It's the "Lord"
Yes the one I always adored!
Yes I actually don't talk about her/him a lot
But there's not a single day in which he/she forgot,
Never forgot to answer my prayers
The one who prepares and  cares !
