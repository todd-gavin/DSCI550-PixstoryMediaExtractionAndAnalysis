For me, F.R.I.E.N.D.S is not just a tv show, but an emotion. It is that one show I absolutely adore because it's made around one of the most important part of life, friendship. I find comfort in each and every character and the best part is that they don't just goof around, but also teach some really important life lessons. 
It teaches you how to be yourself and how to be there for the people you love. 
Undoubtedly my comfort show, forever!
