If youâ€™ve been experiencing a loss of appetite and a decrease in hunger levels, here are some ways to stimulate your appetite.
ðŸ‘‰Make flavorful, delicious meals.
Cooking foods with herbs and spices can help you create flavorful meals youâ€™ll enjoy looking forward to eating.
ðŸ‘‰Eat smaller meals with more calories.
Instead of forcing yourself to eat huge meals, focus on eating smaller meals with more calories.
ðŸ‘‰Eat more of the foods you love.
Sometimes the best thing you can do for your body when you have no appetite is to eat what you can in the moment.
Focus on nutrient-dense foods.
If possible, try to incorporate nutrient-dense foods, like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, into your meals. This will help ensure that youâ€™re meeting your nutrient needs with the foods you do have an appetite to eat.
ðŸ‘‰Learn to enjoy eating again.
Eating is not just for fuel. Sometimes itâ€™s also for enjoyment. When you learn how to enjoy eating again and build positive associations with the act of eating, this can help reignite your appetite for food.
ðŸ‘‰Set reminders to eat.
This might sound foolish but with certain illnesses such as depression and anxiety, it can be easy to lose track of our basic needs. 
Setting a phone alarm for every few hours can help remind you that itâ€™s time to eat a small snack or another meal.
