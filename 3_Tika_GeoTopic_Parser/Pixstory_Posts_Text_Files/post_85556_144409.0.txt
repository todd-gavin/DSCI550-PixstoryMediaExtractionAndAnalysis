Most of the girls, many times, we see something that catches our eyes 👀and without even giving it a thought 🤔that how will we pair it up we just purchase it and the same happened with me.😮‍💨

So, last year, in summers,🌞 I purchased this brown pencil skirt 🤎 from urbanic 🛍 but I was a bit confused how to pair it up and I seriously didn't wear this even for once because it wasn't going on anything. 🥲
After some months, i guess, out of blue, I paired it with a white tube top🤍 and fortunately they were complementing each other as if they're made for each other.😍✨️
According to me, a brown skirt is an essential piece to each and every girl's wardrobe becuase it gives you a sleek and classy look and it can be worn in summers as well as winters too with stockings. With this being said, its important that you mix and matchyour outfits correctly. 😉💗
And if you are unsure about what to wear on top of a brown skirt, the safe choice is always wear something white on top.🤎🤍🤎🤍
Hope it helps. ✨️😉
And let me know how will you pair your brown skirts. 🌈🌼
