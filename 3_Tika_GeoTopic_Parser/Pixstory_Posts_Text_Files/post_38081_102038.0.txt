Kylian Mbappe confirmed that he would be staying at Paris Saint Germain over the weekend. Hence the Frenchman ended all links to Real Madrid. 

The 23 year old striker has since signed a 3-year-deal with PSG that would keep him at the club until the end of the 2024/25 season. 

Real Madrid were the favourites to sign Mbappe coming into the transfer window. Los Blancos were in contact with the striker for the past year. The Frenchman himself reportedly wanted to move to Spain. However, PSG's newest contract was too good to deny for Mbappe and his representatives. 

After making his decision, Kylian Mbappe sent a Whatsapp text to Florentino Perez confirming his decision. The Frenchman wrote the following as per RepublicWorld.com

As per the report, Mbappe stated, "Mr. Florentino, I inform you that have decided to stay at PSG. I want to thank you for the opportunity to play for Real Madrid, the club I've been a fan of since I was little. I hope you are understanding of my decision and I wish you the best of luck in the Champions League final."

Mbappe has since also claimed that he would be Real Madrid's biggest supporter in the UCL final. However, it has to be seen if Florentino Perez ever tries to sign Kylian Mbappe in the future after the striker's sudden U-turn!
