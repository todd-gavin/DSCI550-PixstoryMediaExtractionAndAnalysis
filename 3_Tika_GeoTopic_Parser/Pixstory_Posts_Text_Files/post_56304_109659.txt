Kareem Abdul Jabbar is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players ever The dominance of being a three time NCAA National Champion at UCLA and a six time NBA Champion with the Milwaukee Bucks and the Los Angeles Lakers supports the glorification of Abdul Jabbar With his many accomplishments one record that Abdul Jabbar has held for years and counting is the NBA all time leading scoring record at career points The time NBA All Star was a guest on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Tuesday and gave his thoughts on the emphasis of perimeter shooting in today s NBA and how he achieved his great record by only sinking in only one point shot The swagger Abdul Jabbar brought with that crowd roaring statement speaks to the greatness of that legendary record An offensive game that was shaped around the post and his famous sky hook that could extend out to the mid range Abdul Jabbar s ability to rack up that many points near the rim is truly amazing Current Lakers forward LeBron James is likely to break Abdul Jabbar s all time scoring record next season Standing at total career points James heads into the season projected to only need to play in games at a high level in order to pass the Laker legend While James legacy will be boosted by potentially breaking the all time scoring record how he and Abdul Jabbar both were able to dominate the scoring column in their respective eras with different play styles displays how the NBA is constantly evolving and even the greatest records are meant to be broken
