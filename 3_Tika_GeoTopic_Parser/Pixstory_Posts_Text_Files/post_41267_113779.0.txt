International Kissing Day was established in 2006 to focus on the kissing that takes place between lovers, and to celebrate the place it holds in our society. As per DOY, one of the most surprising things about this holiday is the research that revealed that 5% of people over the age of 45 are locking lips at least 31 times a week! 

Events are organized all over to celebrate International Kissing Day, with events for those who have lovers, and those who are looking for them. Kiss-in’s let you test drive a potential date’s lips before you ever hook up with them for an actual date, and kissing classes help you learn how to become an amazing kisser.

But romantic kissing isn’t the only place that kissing happens in our culture and society. Among high society, it’s not at all unusual to greet with a kiss on each cheek, a tradition that heralds back to the Old World. Young children frequently get kisses from their loving parents, though it’s something that tends to fade as children get older.

Overall, kissing has played an important role in social bonding since time out of mind, and International Kissing Day celebrates them all!

So, who you kissing today?
