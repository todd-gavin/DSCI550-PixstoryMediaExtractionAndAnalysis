It is hard to find good melodic gothic doom metal which does not drag on and on and knows how to do things correctly Been listening to doom metal for a while now and some bands really drag on until the world itself really seems to stand still well sometimes people really know what they are doing No matter how much music you listen to there are always more artists to discover so one day I just searched up for any quality gothic metal and alongside bands like Tribulation Cradle Of Filth Katatonia Paradise Lost etc I found a group I had never heard of called Deathwhite Apparently the band just released a new album on June called Grey Everlasting and I went in completely blind not knowing what to expect Well to my surprise my mind was blown so haunting melodic depressive and structurally concise this was minutes of morose and dark Now some people do not like their music to be dark and depressing but for those who want their daily dose of musical depression well this is just brilliant for it is a splendidly dark affair with a beautifully created melancholic atmosphere which is darkly serene and yet captivating The album is mired in a layer of melancholic dark and melodic guitar riffs accompanied by complex drum fills which really sell the atmosphere Underneath all this lies a layer of haunting pessimism rich in texture and flavour almost like an amalgamation of Agalloch Paradise Lost and Katatonia Deathwhite clearly have elevated their songwriting prowess to another level which is enough to capture the ears of anyone looking to hear in music the bitter and complex strata of human life A very well rounded well thought out and delectably produced and composed piece of work Highly recommended Score
