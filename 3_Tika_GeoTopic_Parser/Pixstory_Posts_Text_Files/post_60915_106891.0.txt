I feel everyone should watch it at least once, teenagers in particular. It’s a beautiful show depicting lives and the way it reflects reality is just amazing by each and every character and their story. It will make you think and ponder about really important stuff. Everyone literally everyone has done such a great job in the series... you cant ask for any more. Though it might be adversely affecting for those who have been through stuff. But truly its the best series I have ever seen and my most favorite. The way it makes you feel connected with the characters, it’s amazing. I have been deeply connected to every character, a little more to Hannah and Justin. Everyone played so well (specifically the two) as if they were born for their roles. Love it always! and Will always be connected to it, taking and learning from it... Would Love to meet them at least once!
