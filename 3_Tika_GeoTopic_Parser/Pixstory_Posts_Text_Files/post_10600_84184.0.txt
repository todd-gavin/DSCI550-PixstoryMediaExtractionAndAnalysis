Nikhat, Nitu clinch gold medals  in style at 73rd Strandja Memorial Boxing Tournament

Indian contingent finish campaign with three medals including one bronze

New Delhi, February 27, 2022: Indian boxers Nikhat Zareen and Nitu clinched gold medals at the 73rd Strandja Memorial Boxing Tournament in Sofia, Bulgaria on Sunday.

Nikhat bagged her second gold medal at the Europe’s oldest international boxing tournament with a 4-1 win in the women’s 52kg final. She had previously won the Strandja Memorial title in 2019.

Nitu outpunched the reigning Youth World Championships bronze medallist Italy’s Erika Prisciandro 5-0 without breaking a sweat in the women’s 48kg final.

With Nandini also finishing on the podium in the +81kg category and signing off with a bronze medal, the Indian contingent concluded their campaign with three medals at the tournament, which was part of India’s first exposure trip this year.

Up against Ukraine’s Tetiana Kob, Nikhat did not have the best of starts to the match as her experienced opponent went aggressive from the word go. The 34-year-old former World Championships bronze medallist Kob used all her experience to push Nikhat on the back foot. But as the bout progressed, the Indian grew in confidence and secured a 4-1 lead in the opening round.

The 25-year-old Telangana boxer Nikhat, who has been in a red-hot form in the tournament and beat Tokyo Olympics silver medallist Turkey’s Buse Naz Cakiroglu in the semi-finals, fought back well and looked in a complete control in the remaining part of the bout as she landed some sharp scoring punches before completing a convincing win.
