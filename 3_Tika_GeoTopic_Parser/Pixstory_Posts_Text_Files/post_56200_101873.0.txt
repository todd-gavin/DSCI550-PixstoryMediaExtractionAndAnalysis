‌Liz Truss is withstanding pressure from Joe Biden not to rewrite the Brexit deal’s Northern Ireland protocol. Earlier Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, has already warned that she could endanger any hopes of a free trade deal with America. Truss was confronted by a delegation led by congressman Richard Neal, a senior Biden ally. Neal brought a delegation from the important congressional ways and means committee to Truss’s country retreat at Chevening in Kent. He had earlier held talks with EU officials in Brussels and had met Keir Starmer, the Labour leader.

However, it is understood that Truss said she was “defending the Good Friday agreement” rather than jeopardizing it. She is understood to have said the protocol was having a serious impact and she could not let the “situation drag on” if the EU did not produce a reasonable solution.

Truss has already declared that she had a plan for reworking parts of the protocol if a negotiated solution with the EU failed. The impasse intensified after the DUP declined to take part in Northern Ireland’s power-sharing administration unless major differences were made to the way the Brexit deal was operating.
