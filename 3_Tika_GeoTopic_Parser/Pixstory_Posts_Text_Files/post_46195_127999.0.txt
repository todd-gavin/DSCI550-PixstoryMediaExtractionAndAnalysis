Bread is my favourite ! It is one of the most favorite breakfast options not just for kids but also for office-goers ! Eating a slice or two when I'm getting late to office and college or packing a sandwich when traveling , it always saves me ! 🍞✨

But guys , bread is not a wholesome food as it lacks the healthy fibre and is loaded with carbohydrates . I have seen people believing that replacing white bread with brown bread is a healthier option as the latter is packed with nutrients . Is it really true ? 🤔🍞

The main difference i know between white bread and brown bread is that the white bread is more processed . 🍞

Let me tell you difference between Brown bread and white bread ;

1 Nutrients in bread ;

White bread has to undergo a lot of processing , it fails to retain the healthy nutrients . On the other hand , brown bread undergo less processing and retain most of the naturally available nutrients ! Hence , brown bread ranks higher in the nutrient profile as compared to white bread .

2 Calories in bread ;

People planning to lose weight tend to prefer brown bread over white bread ! thinking it is low in calories . Well , this is not true ! Yes , the approximate calorific value of 2 slices of bread is 170 calories . 

So yes , brown bread definitely has more nutrients than white bread ! I also love brown bread more ! I take brown bread in breakfast . 🍞✨

But be careful when you buy brown bread . Sometimes sellers add colour in white bread to make it appear like brown ! ✅

Tell me in notes if you love brown bread or white bread ?? 🍞💭
