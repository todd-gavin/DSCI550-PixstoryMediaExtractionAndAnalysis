French footballer Paul Pogba’s elder brother Mathias Pogba is one of the five suspects in a 13m euro extortion case and has been detained by police.
The other four people, aged 27 and 36, who have been charged and detained, are relatives of the Pogba brothers.
Yassine Bouzrou, who is Mathias Pogba's lawyer for the case, said that his client is innocent and they are going to challenge the allegations made by Paul.
"We are going to challenge this decision,” he told French broadcaster BFMTV.
Notably, the 29-year-old footballer had filed a complaint against his brother and four others on July 16 in an extortion case involving 13-million-euro.
As per Paul, the blackmailers are demanding a mammoth sum of money to not defame him by claiming that he asked a holy man to cast a spell on his countryman Kylian Mbappe. However, he has denied such claims already.
Several people including Pogba’s mother have been interviewed by the French police during the investigation of the case.
Paul Pogba gearing up for Qatar World Cup
Paul Pogba had moved to his former club Juventus from Manchester United on a free transfer on a four-year contract this summer after his contract came to an end. However, his homecoming has not been fruitful so far as he was sidelined for two months after injuring his meniscus in July.
With the World Cup being two months away, he will be keen to recover from the injury and get some game time to retain his rhythm back. He is a vital cog in the French national team and was even part of their last World Cup campaign where they ended up being the World Champions.
Didier Deschamps’ side have a big task this year as they look to defend their title. France will kick off their World Cup 2022 campaign against Australia on November 22 at the Al Wakrah Sports Complex.
