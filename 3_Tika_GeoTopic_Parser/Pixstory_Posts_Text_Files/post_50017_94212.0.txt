Hope” is the thing with feathers

BY EMILY DICKENSON

“Hope” is the thing with feathers -
That perches in the soul -
And sings the tune without the words -
And never stops - at all -


And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -
And sore must be the storm -
That could abash the little Bird
That kept so many warm -


I’ve heard it in the chillest land -
And on the strangest Sea -
Yet - never - in Extremity,
It asked a crumb - of me.



What a refreshing poem? HOPE is something that stays within us amidst all the difficulties that we face in life. Even if our whole world seems to crumble we do have a ray of hope. The best thing is that hope doesn't expect anything in return from us. This poem compares hope to a bird that flies high in the chaos, and that keeps many people warm. Dickinson alludes to "Hope" being something that does not vanish when the "Gale" and "storm" get worse and its song still sings on despite the intensity of whatever is attempting to unseat it. The poem is noted for its use of punctuations. This poem made my day and I hope it made yours too.
