Earlier this year, novelist Paulo Coelho tweeted a video from India. The video allegedly shows CCTV footage wherein a physically challenged person is trying to reset a tricycle’s chain on a busy street. He is clearly struggling with it yet no one offers help. However, two school children see his plight and help him. Not only this, they also helped the person hop on his tricycle.

Coelho wrote, “Two boys from India to brighten your complicated day.” This video gained over two million views. A quick glance at the replies reveals many people believe that the video shows true-life events. However, this video is staged and several others have pointed it out as well.

Coelho is not the first influential personality to have posted such a video. We found that there has been a drastic increase in the number of such posts after December 2020.

In the past two years, several verified Facebook accounts have posted staged drama clips. These videos offer a feel-good or a seemingly important public service message on wide-ranging topics such as child kidnapping, mobile usage or being wary of friends at parties. The table below shows the top 19 most viewed staged dramas posted by verified Facebook accounts in India.

What appears to be positive and uplifting content has become a part of a problematic trend. Since people believe these videos are true-life, many of the clips are being shared with distorted context mainly targeting the Indian Muslim community. In October 2021, we published our first fact-check report on this phenomenon. Hariom Rajawat, a supporter of the Vishva Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal, shared such a staged video as genuine and claimed that a Muslim youth was planning to rape his Hindu friend by mixing an intoxicant in her drink. Since then, Alt News has published 10 reports that debunk misinformation around staged ‘CCTV’ videos — half of them targeting Muslims. [View spreadsheet
