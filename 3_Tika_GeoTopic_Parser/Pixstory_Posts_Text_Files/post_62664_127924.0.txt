There are a few reasons you should use cruelty free products.

The first and most important reason is that using cruelty free products is the humane way to do things. Many conventional skincare products are made from ingredients that are tested on animals, which means that they're causing pain and suffering. By using cruelty free products, you're not supporting this kind of behavior in any way. 

Secondly, using vegan products can save you money AND health. Many conventional skincare products contain harsh chemicals that can damage your skin and cause other problems. By using a cruelty free product, you're reducing the risk of these problems occurring in the first place. Trust me, spending a few more bucks making sure you get the right products is less painful than health treatments.

And finally, using plant based products is good for the environment. Conventional skincare products often contain toxic chemicals that end up polluting our environment. By choosing a cruelty free product, you're helping to reduce the amount of harmful waste produced in the world every day.
