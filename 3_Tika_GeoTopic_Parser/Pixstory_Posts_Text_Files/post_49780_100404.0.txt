‌Children must be tamed at an early age so that they choose to be healthy when they grow up. Childhood obesity is a major concern among children as obese children might end up being tormented or bullied at school. More than that it is necessary to be healthy to take part in school activities, especially sports. 
‌
‌It is the responsibility of a parent to monitor a child’s diet, but while a student is away from their parents, the school is the one that looks after the students because of the trust the parents have. In absence of parents, a school should make sure those meals do not include junk food. What is happening today? The school itself is readily distributing and promoting junk food in the cafes for their profit. 
‌
‌Eating lots of sugary food makes students less able to pay attention in class or perform well on tests. In children, obesity can lead to the weakening of bones and teeth.
‌
‌Poor eating habits at an early age lead to a lifetime of real health consequences. Kids need to stay fit so that they can participate in physical education and live in a healthy environment.
‌
‌Schools should set a good example of nutritious eating for students. This would fit in well with the nutrition curriculum in health classes.

Soda and junk food can be replaced with more nutritious alternatives, if not junk food then children can have a healthy habit of eating fruits instead of candies and juice rather than soft drinks. 

We need a healthy generation and hence we need schools to take part in building better citizens through intelligence as well as physical strength.
