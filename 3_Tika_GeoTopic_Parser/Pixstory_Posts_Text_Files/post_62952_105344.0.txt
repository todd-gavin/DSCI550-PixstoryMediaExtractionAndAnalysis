Global warming has had a considerable influence on the Alpine region, similar to what has been observed in the Arctic, according to researchers. Researchers discovered that the tree line has expanded in about 80% of the Alps, while the snow caps are dropping, albeit only marginally, according to satellite data.

In 10% of the Alps, snow cover has decreased dramatically. These results are based on a 38-year study of data. While ten percent may appear insignificant, it has a significant influence. Snow is essential for people as a source of drinking water, in addition to playing an important role in ecosystems. The Alps are the world's highest and most widespread mountain range. This region is responsible for 40% of Europe's drinking water. This is why the Alps are known as Europe's "water towers."

Mountain regions, which are biodiversity hotspots, are warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world. This heat causes greening, and the resulting increase in vegetation accelerates the cycle. In locations where this isn't the norm, taller and denser plant life can endanger alpine plant and animal ecosystems while also releasing more greenhouse gases through permafrost melting.
