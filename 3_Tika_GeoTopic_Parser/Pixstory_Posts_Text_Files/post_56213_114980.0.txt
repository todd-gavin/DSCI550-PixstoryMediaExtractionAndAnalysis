There are growing concerns over Britain’s energy supplies in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. On Monday, Russia is closing Nord Stream 1, its major gas pipeline into Germany. The shutdown has been related to a planned 10-day maintenance period, but there are concerns that the pipeline might not reopen. This will lead Europe’s largest manufacturing nation into an energy crisis.

Although  Britain is not completely reliant on Russian gas when supply drops process will rise further. National Grid has also pledged to set out its winter plans this month. Britain’s existing emergency power supply plans are greatly designed for outages inflicted by huge storms or faults in the system rather than supply shortages.

 But officials are having to meet the possibility of shortages stretching over months. In one “reasonable worst-case scenario”, millions of households could be forced to cut consumption at peak times.

The government will be keen not to overburden taxpayers with the cost of undesirable fossil fuels. Storage sites typically make cash by buying gas on the cheap in summer and selling it at higher prices in winter. However, the unusually high prices this summer have weakened that model. Hence anxieties increases.
