Sri Lanka is struggling through a political crisis and it's quite tragic, how people are struggling to find items of daily Necessisties, but even in such a tragic situation, something funny transpired in Sri Lanka this past weekend. 

Protesters occupied Sri Lankan President and Prime Minister's residences following months of angry protests demanding their resignation amid a severe economic crisis continue to find innovative ways to entertain themselves. 

After videos of them taking a dip in the swimming pool, dining in the kitchen, relaxing in bedrooms, and working out in the gym at the Presidential palace went viral, another video of them mock-playing wrestling apparently on the Prime Minister's bed is entertaining social media.

A video posted by Twitter user "Sri Lanka Tweet" shows a group of young men mock-wrestling on a bed inside the Prime Minister's official residence. In a short clip edited to background commentary from a wrestling match, the protesters can be seen posing as professional wrestlers and attempting stunts on each other.

WWE which is under the radar of some heavy investigation, would truly enjoy this light hearted moment from the sub-continent
