After a funeral that was almost up there with your average Westerosi wedding in terms of drama is left feeling as though she needs to strengthen her position. 
Her relationship with Queen Alicent is worse than ever, and her poor old dad's looking closer and closer to death by the day. Rhaenyra knows that when King Viserys is out of the picture, her claim to the Iron Throne will likely be threatened by Alicent's children.
The answer, of course, is obvious. Marry her uncle! Rhaenyra pitches this to creepy ol' Prince Daemon as they watch Viserys' ship sailing away, and he's clearly keen. But there is a problem: Rhaenyra already has a husband, Laenor Velaryon. In order for them to marry, he needs to be dead.
So they make up a plan to fake Laenor's death so he can live the good life in Essos with his boyfriend. I don't know about you, but that to me sounds like a win for the gays!
