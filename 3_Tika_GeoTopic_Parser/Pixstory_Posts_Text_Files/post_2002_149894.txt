A probe launched by NASA for their DART mission Double Asteroid Redirection Test successfully completed its mission Its mission was to autonomously direct itself into an asteroid and hit it at speeds high enough such that it would cause the asteroid to redirect This mission is part of an ongoing effort to establish a planetary defense system which can use this technology to redirect asteroids in the event they pose a threat to Earth While we are still awaiting the final results one of the most critical aspects of it actually hitting the asteroid was accomplished with exacting precision DART was launched in November and traveled million through space We will know in approximately months time whether the asteroid was redirected and we may get video and pictures of the impact from a second probe sooner If the redirect is successful it will be the first time in human history that we moved a celestial body In any case I applaud the efforts of NASA ESA and the global effort to make this a reality It is a significant step towards the future and an amazing display of unity between nations in furtherance of our shared goal of protecting humanity
