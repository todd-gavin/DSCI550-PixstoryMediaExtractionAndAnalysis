1. Scalp scaler
It is a kind of shampoo, made of salicylate, which doesn't lather but helps to remove dead skin cells and oil build-up. Use it once a week.

2. Shampoo
Choose a mild shampoo that best suits your hair type and doesn't disturb the scalp's pH balance.

3. Scalp massage
Use a scalp massager gently in circular motion for 2-3 minutes to stimulate blood circulation and growth.

Koreans recommend applying a conditioner after drying your hair a bit. It seals the cuticle and provides hydration.

5. Hair mask
Hair masks deliver deep nourishment and conditioning. Choose the ones made with oils like argan, coconut and castor to repair dry damaged hair.

6. Apple cider vinegar rinse
It balances scalp's pH and helps to reduce itchiness and excessive dryness. Use it after shampoo and conditioner.

7. Scalp scrub
It exfoliates all the dirt, grime, and build-up from follicles to give you a fresh and clean scalp. Do this once a week.

8. Scalp and hair toner
It aids in getting rid of dandruff and soothes inflammation while adding hydration to scalp. Spray it on your hair and scalp after towel-drying your tresses.

Unlike a hair serum, this one nourishes hair follicles and encourages growth. It also protects from external aggressors and makes hair lustrous.
