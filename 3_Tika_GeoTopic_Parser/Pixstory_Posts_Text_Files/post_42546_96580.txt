First things first I didn t watch the original movie which was released back in where Nani played the lead role in the movie So my review will be based only on Shahid Kapoor s Jersey Just watched Jersey and one thing I want to say is that after Haider Jersey is the best movie of Shahid Kapoor in terms of acting and how he lived his character throughout the movie Jersey is the story of Arjun Talwar played by Shahid Kapoor who left cricket at the age of because of some insider politics in the Punjab Cricket Board After that he started doing the job but the company sacks him because of fake corruption charges Now he has ten years old son and a wife but no job in hand He only watches T V and does household work but one day Arjun s son requests his dad for a Jersey of the Indian Cricket team on his birthday and this request became a conflict in the movie and from this point the movie changes Initially Arjun asked for money from his friends but he got no help on his birthday Arjun tried to steal money from his wife s purse but Vidya played by Mrunal Thakur caught him red handed After this Cricket was the only option left with Arjun and he knocked on the door of the Punjab Cricket Board again what happened next in his life I ll not tell you because it will be a spoiler from my side The acting of all the actors especially Shahid Kapoor and Pankaj Kapur was outstanding and Mrunal Thakur will leave you in awe because of his acting and expression Jersey is full of emotions and sports and both aspects showed very well by the director After all the mass movies like Pushpa RRR and KGF part Jersey will make you smile and you will feel closer to your family members I will strongly recommend this movie to you all
