The Paralympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 came to a close on Sunday evening at the Beijing National Stadium after a thrilling nine days of sport. More than 560 competitors representing 46 countries competed in five Paralympic sports on the world stage. The 67-member Team USA delegation put in outstanding performances, winning a total of 20 medals (6 gold, 11 silver, 3 bronze). 

The United States finished fourth in the medals table at Beijing, with 27 competitors and one guide contributing to the total. Nine athletes won their first Paralympic medals, and Oksana Masters became the first American woman to win seven medals at a Paralympic Winter Games. Team USA persevered on and off the field of play during a period of global instability.

“Team USA performed exactly how we hoped they would. They delivered world-class performances that embodied grit, strength and unbelievable resilience,” said USOPC CEO Sarah Hirshland. “To the athletes of Team USA, thank you for showing the world what’s possible and for making our nation so incredibly proud.” 

The United States' sled hockey team maintained its domination, claiming a sixth Paralympic title – their fourth in a row – to remain the sport's most decorated team in history. The team's 5-0 shutout of Canada sets a new record for most goals scored in a Paralympic sled hockey final. With a 4-0 record, the United States was the tournament's only unbeaten team. 

Team USA's ladies dominated on the field of play, winning 14 of the team's 20 medals. Oksana Masters made history by becoming the most decorated Paralympian in history, winning a medal in every event she competed in. Masters' seven medals (3 gold, 4 silver) would put her in tenth position overall in the medals tally. Brenna Huckaby and Kendall Gretsch are both returning Paralympic champions. They each added another gold to their collections, while first-time Paralympian Sydney Peterson picked up a trio of Paralympic medals in her debut.
