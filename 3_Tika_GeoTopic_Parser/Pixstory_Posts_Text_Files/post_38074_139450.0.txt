Aston Villa midfielder Douglas Luis could leave on a free transfer at the end of the 2022/23 season. This would be welcome news for Arsenal and Mikel Arteta as the club was looking to sign the Brazilian in the now-gone transfer window. 
The Brazilian midfielder has been a key part of the Aston Villa set up since joining the club in July 2019. Having already made 117 appearances for the club, Luiz is reportedly looking to look at other horizons next season. Owing to this, the midfielder would not extend his contract with the Premier League club. 
Arsenal attempted to sign Douglas Luiz in the 2022 summer transfer window. But Aston Villa reportedly did not want to lose out on one of their key players. Owing to this a move did not materialize for the Brazilian. However, the story could drastically change in the coming months. 
Arsenal are reportedly going to attempt and sign the midfielder once again in January. This time around, Villa could probably be more open to letting the midfielder leave to salvage some transfer fee. However, it would be best if the Gunners wait until next summer to sign Douglas Luis for free. 
The Gunners have been on the lookout for a central midfielder since January 2022. However, the club has failed to sign any world-class players and have chosen to remain with the current crop of players at least for now. 
With Youri Tielemans also being linked, It has to be seen if Arsenal would go ahead and complete the signing of Douglas Luiz next year.
