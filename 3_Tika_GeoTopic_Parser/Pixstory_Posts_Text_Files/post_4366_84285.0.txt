SWADES MOVIE REVIEW:

Mohan Bhargava, a NASA scientist, decides to travel to India in order to track down his childhood nanny, Kaveriamma (Kishori Balal). He intends to bring her back to America so that she can live out her remaining years in luxury. 

In Charanpur, a small village in Uttar Pradesh, he locates her. However, Mohan quickly realises that life in America and Charanpur are vastly different. Poverty, lack of power, the existence of a caste system, and, most importantly, a lack of education for the young are all problems that the villages face.

Mohan also meets Gita (Gayarti Joshi), a hardworking local schoolteacher. She hopes to alter the children's lives for the better by teaching them. She disagrees with Mohan's attitude and criticism, believing that the government should be assisting these individuals. As a result, Gita challenges him to do something good for his homeland. 

Meanwhile, Kaveriamma can't decide whether or not to emigrate to America, despite Gita's best efforts to keep her in the hamlet. So, in order to find a solution, Kaveriamma asks Mohan to help her out by collecting rent from a poor farmer who has leased Gita's land. 

This journey, however, serves as a wake-up call for Mohan. His viewpoint of the village shifts dramatically. He now takes matters into his own hands, showing these individuals how to advance in life by becoming self-sufficient - by generating their own electricity. Mohan falls in love with Gita as the project nears completion. More importantly, he becomes a part of the community. He is now torn between returning to America and remaining in his homeland. 

Shah Rukh Khan gives a heartfelt and true performance. And to elicit such strong reactions from the crowd is a huge accomplishment. Ashutosh Gowarikar deserves all of the credit. The director has done an excellent job of getting the message across: if you have the talent and know-how, go back to your roots and help others improve their lives.
