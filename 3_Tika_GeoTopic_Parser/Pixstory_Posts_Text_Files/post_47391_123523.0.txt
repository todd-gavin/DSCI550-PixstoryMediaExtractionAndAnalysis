Today again I lost few successive matches in the online chess battle, I was so much emotionally overwhelmed by the experience of losing that before the matches were over I resigned in few of them to escape the humiliation which was building up inside of me. I do believe that to lose a game or a competition or an event is not the end of the world but every time I lose out, I have this terrible feeling, even though I don’t show it or it doesn’t surface it out itself to be visible to others yet the sensation of being lost makes me a sore loser. Furthermore, I do know the reasoning behind the successive failure and the actions needed to overcome the failure yet no matter how much I try I am emotionally too weak to alter my habits. 
It took a long time for me to recognize the level of emotion I have and how I am captive to its whims. I always have maintained a façade of being close to stoic which is a lie and now I have no idea what will work on me. This current path of me is certainly bring the doomsday for my future in a gradual manner and I have no clue as what actions or inactions I can take to divert myself to alternate paths. 
I have seen people – my peers, friends and colleagues who are comparatively more resilient than I am and I believe my incorporating more humility within myself I might be able to achieve the same level of resilience which I desperately need yet lack completely. As I mentioned the fear of humiliation made me resign the chess battle, due to the presence of this fear I tend to give up on every endeavor I set for myself even without seeing it to the finish line.
This fear and my accumulating behavior of giving up my efforts in mid-way is also contributing to the fact that I feel inferior and lack the requisite confidence needed to pull-off interviews and conversations with strangers.
