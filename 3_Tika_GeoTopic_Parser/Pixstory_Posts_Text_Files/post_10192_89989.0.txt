The move comes after the Taliban backtracked on its previous commitment to open secondary schools to girls.

The United States has cancelled planned talks with the Taliban in Qatar that were set to address key economic issues after the group that is now ruling Afghanistan reversed a decision to allow girls to return to secondary school.

The cancellation was the first concrete sign that recent Taliban moves on human rights and inclusivity could directly affect the international community’s willingness to help the group, some of whose leaders are under US sanctions.

On  Tuesday, we joined millions of Afghan families in expressing our deep disappointment with the Taliban’s decision to not allow women and girls to return to secondary school,” a State Department spokesperson said on Friday.
“We have cancelled some of our engagements, including planned meetings in Doha [Qatar’s capital] around the Doha Forum, and made clear that we see this decision as a potential turning point in our engagement.
