The great start to the Premier League season has made the Gunners fans go bonkers over the team selection. There were times when Arsenal’s defense was taken for granted. However, thereturn of William Saliba has changed the perceptions at Emirates. The central defender has become pivotal in Mikel Arteta’s setup and is looking forward to making his mark in the league. The player has kept two clean sheets already for Gunners in the Premier League 2022-23.
William Saliba did not have a great start to his English Premier League career. The player had a moderately hefty price tag as he arrived from St. Etienne in a deal worth €30 million in 2019.The French international did not have a great start under Mikel Arteta and was sent out on loandeals to different clubs. He had two successive loan spells with OGC Nice and Marseille in the last two seasons. The player was set to move out of the club at the start of the transfer window but destiny had different plans.
In the ongoing campaign, the player was pivotal from gameweek 1. Against Crystal Palace in the first game, not only he kept the possession and clean sheet but also made three crucial tackles. The fans started to sing his name after his praise worthy performance against Bournemouth. The player also scored a goal against the newly promoted side AFC
Bournemouth in GW 2.
Good performance does not stop here. He assisted for the goal against Fulham when the team failed to break Fulham’s resilience at Craven Cottage. His average pass completion rate in the league has stood at 93.2% which has helped Arsenal to play according to their manager’s
philosophy.
Can he make the top 3 Premier League defenders this season? Yes. But a long way to go! The likes of Lisandro Martinez and Reece James are taking the storm by the league. However, the other stalwarts are struggling in their teams and age is not on their side. This makes William Saliba a great contender to be one of the top 3 Premier League defenders.
