From Friday March CUORE SPARSO Columbia Sony Music will be on the radio the new single by GIUSY FERRERI taken from the album CORTOMETRAGGI the sixth studio album by the artist released years after the previous Girotondo Cuore Sparso a ballad that combines a deep and sensitive text with a powerful that opens completely in the refrain a piece that looks outwards not to remain indifferent to what happens in the world and bears the signature of Giovanni Caccamo Paolo Antonacci and Placido Salamone important that the heart of each of us is present every day in all things that&#39;s why the title Scattered heart says Giusy Ferreri about the song Today more than ever we can&#39;t remain indifferent to what happens in the world My heart scattered among the joys of daily life my family my roots my passions and one compassionate and empathetic gaze towards the world of the Earth and the next Giovanni Caccamo has been able to elegantly enclose this profound thought in my tenth musical short film
