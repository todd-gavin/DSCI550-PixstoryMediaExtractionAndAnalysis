Carrom is a popular indoor game, believed to have originated in India in the 18th century. Widely played across the Indian subcontinent, Carrom requires a good sense of angles and superlative precision and concentration. It was once played − mostly by children and ladies − for amusement, but now it is being played at competitive level in an organized manner.
