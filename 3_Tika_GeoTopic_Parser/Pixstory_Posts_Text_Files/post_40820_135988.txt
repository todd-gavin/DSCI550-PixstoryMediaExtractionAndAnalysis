The pure contralto sings in the organ loft The carpenter dresses his plank the tongue of his foreplane whistles its wild ascending lisp The married and unmarried children ride home to their Thanksgiving dinner The pilot seizes the king pin he heaves down with a strong arm The mate stands braced in the whale boat lance and harpoon are ready The duck shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches The deacons are ordain d with cross d hands at the altar The spinning girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big wheel The farmer stops by the bars as he walks on a First day loafe and looks at the oats and rye The lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirm d case He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his mother s bed room The jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case He turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the manuscript The malform d limbs are tied to the surgeon s table What is removed drops horribly in a pail The quadroon girl is sold at the auction stand the drunkard nods by the bar room stove The machinist rolls up his sleeves the policeman travels his beat the gate keeper marks who pass The young fellow drives the express wagon I love him though I do not know him The half breed straps on his light boots to compete in the race Walt Whitman
