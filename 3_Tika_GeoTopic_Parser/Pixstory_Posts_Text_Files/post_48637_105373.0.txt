While I get where you're coming from and that safaris is a consequence of the colonial influence on the countries that were colonized, I also think some things are okay with that. Not every thing people picked from that time is wrong. Of course, there's a gross repulsiveness to swaths of white guys roving a nation that wasn't theirs, killing their animals while the natives carried their belongings - and that's fair and valid. However, no one is hunting any longer. That is prohibited! Locals now benefit from these operations and have complete authority over their property, unlike in the past. At this stage, it is far from colonisation.

Protecting wildlife, respecting their space, and admiring them in their natural habitat are all important aspects of an ethical safari. Which is being carried out. Nobody exactly hurts anyone. I think it's fair enough to want to have a closer look at the wildlife if you don't intend to hurt them.
