Pilgrims of the ongoing Amarnath Yatra are provided with oxygen support by the troops of Indo Tibetan Border Police near Sheshnag, Jammu & Kashmir. As it is a high point, 12000 feet above sea level, climate conditions are extreme with low oxygen levels. Pilgrims who are trekking to Amarnath often fall victim to the harsh climate. 

In these harsh conditions, ITBP troops are helping the devotees with Oxygen support, even checking their oxygen level to asses whether the pilgrims are fit for the journey ahead.

According to Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board (SASB) that manages the affairs of the Yatra said that so far over 1.28 lakh pilgrims have performed the Yatra, which was suspended for two days because of flash flood near the cave shrine last Friday.

16 people were killed in the flash flood whereas 15000 pilgrims were safely evacuated.

The 43 days long Amarnath Yatra commenced on 30th June and will conlude on 11th of August.
