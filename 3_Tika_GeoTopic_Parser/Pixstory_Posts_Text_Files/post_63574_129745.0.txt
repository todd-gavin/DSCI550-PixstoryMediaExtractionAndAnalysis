Game developer 24 Entertainment’s action adventure mystical martial arts battle royale Naraka: Bladepoint received a bunch of new content with a new update the game received on August 19, including the new map and a new character. The update also celebrates the game's one year anniversary with log in rewards and a free trial. The new map, Holoroth, is the largest map in the game thus far, and will introduce new weather conditions and terrain to Naraka: Bladepoint. The map is set in the midst of snowy mountains. Players will battle around a frozen river and massive temple.
Alongside the new map, the game has also introduced a new character: the healer Ziping Yin."As part of an overall development plan to lower the learning curve in the game, Ziping Yin will be the perfect starting point for players new to NARAKA’s fast-paced action," NetEase and 24 Entertainment said via a press release. "As a healer, she can use her Aromatherapy ability to help restore health and armour to allies, as well as increasing damage reduction."Additionally, she can also restore the health and armour of allies by consuming rage through a still called Saving Grace, as well as negate a fatal strike - a huge advantage that could turn the tides of battle in Naraka at a moment's notice.
Along with this new update, Naraka: Bladepoint is available for a free trial. Furthermore, starting August 19 the game is available for purchase at a 50% discount. The free trial period will end on August 22 and the 50% discount will end on August 29. Additionally, if you log in on August 19, you will receive free skins, namely Dual Blades Legendary, Kurumi, and Viper Ning.
