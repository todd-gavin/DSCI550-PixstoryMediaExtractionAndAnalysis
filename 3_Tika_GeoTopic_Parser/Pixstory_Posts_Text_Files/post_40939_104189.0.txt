It’s sad that it’s always the common folk that suffers most because of war. Because of Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, the majority of big Hollywood studios have pulled out of Russia. 

Mint reported that almost all theatres in Russia may close by the end of the year, according to a Russian cinema owner, as big Hollywood studios discontinue their licences in the nation. 

As per reports, Hollywood blockbusters accounted for about 80% of Russian cinema's earnings, according to Pichugin. In an attempt to salvage the industry, Russian theatres began showing Soviet and old international films instead of new releases, which had already been severely harmed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Bollywood has been suggested as a possible replacement for Hollywood in Russia.

It was difficult to imagine a world without McDonald's, IKEA furniture, or iPhones in Russia. International enterprises supplied the great majority of the country's non-food commodities, supporting nearly two million jobs. 

In March-May, roughly 1,000 international corporations limited or sold off at least some, if not all, of their operations in Russia as a result of the sanctions. As a result of this, up to 600,000 people could lose their jobs.
