With a partisan Nou Camp cheering them on, the reigning champions prevailed 5-2 on the night and 8-3 on aggregate to set up a last-four match against either Arsenal or Wolfsburg.

The previous best attendance for a women's club game was 60,739 at Wanda Metropolitano in 2019, when Barcelona defeated Atletico Madrid 2-0. A game between Lyon and Frankfurt in Munich in 2012 set the previous Champions League attendance record of 50,212.

The audience at Europe's largest stadium also shattered the previous record for spectators in a women's international, which was achieved when 80,203 people watched the US win Olympic gold by defeating Japan 2-1 at Wembley Stadium in London in 2012.

"I don’t have the words to describe it", Ballon dOr winner Alexia Putellas said. "It was super magical. The game ended and the fans didn’t want to leave. It was incredible."

It was the first time the Barcelona women's team played in front of a crowd at the Camp Nou. They had previously performed at the stadium, albeit behind closed doors due to limitations imposed by the coronavirus outbreak.

The team's home games are normally held at the Johan Cruyff Stadium, which has a capacity of over 6,000 people. The Camp Nou has a 99,000-seat capacity and features a stadium-wide mosaic with the slogan 'More than Empowerment' on seats. Following Mapi Leon's early opener, Real threatened to spoil the celebration as Olga Carmona's penalty and a beautiful strike from Claudia Zornoza put them 2-1 up on the night.

On a historic occasion, though, Barcelona were not to be denied the El Clasico bragging rights, and they have now won all seven encounters with their great foe.

Aitana Bonmati, Claudia Pina, Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas, and Caroline Hansen all scored in the second half to send them through. They'll find out who they'll face in the semi-finals on Thursday, when 2007 champions Arsenal travel to Volkswagen Arena to face Wolfsburg, with the tie tied at 1-1 after the first leg last week.
