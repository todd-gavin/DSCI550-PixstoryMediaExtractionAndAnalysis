Sonakshi Sinha has reportedly landed in a legal trouble after a non bailable warrant has been issued against her in a fraud case. The actress has been accused of not attending an event in Delhi, for which she had charged Rs 37 lakh.
Sonakshi recently returned from the 'Da-Bangg' tour with Salman Khan, Disha Patani, Pooja Hegde and others.
Meanwhile, on the work front, Sonakshi will next be seen in 'Double XL' co-starring Huma Qureshi in the lead role. Apart from this, she also has 'Kakuda' with Riteish Deshmukh and Saqib Saleem.
