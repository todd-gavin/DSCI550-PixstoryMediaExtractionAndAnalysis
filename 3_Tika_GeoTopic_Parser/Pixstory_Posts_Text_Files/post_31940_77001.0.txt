Arsenal look to be lining up a late January move for Aston Villa midfielder Douglas Luiz.

The Evening Standard reported on the 27th of January that the Gunners are considering a bid for the former Manchester City man.

They claim that Steven Gerrard's side have already rejected an offer of Â£30million from an unnamed Premier League club.

Therefore, you would think the Gunners would have to offer significantly more to stand a chance of signing the 23-year-old.

Luiz hasn't yet committed his future to Villa, and his current contract expires in 2023.

So, if Arsenal can make a tempting enough offer before the January window closes, they might just be able to make that long-awaited transfer breakthrough.

The Gunners look set to miss out on another one of their midfield targets, with Bruno Guimaraes of Lyon looking likely to join Newcastle United (L'Equipe).

Therefore, a move for Luiz would make a lot of sense and he would probably be a significant upgrade on Granit Xhaka.

If we look at the statistics, we can see that Luiz has picked up three assists in the PL this season, Xhaka only has one. Luiz has also averaged more key passes per game and is much younger than the Swiss international (WhoScored).

So, if Mikel Arteta's side can come up with a significant bid, I could see Luiz making a move to the Emirates to play alongside Thomas Partey.

This is certainly a deal for all Arsenal fans to keep their eyes on, and you have to hope that the Gunners can at least do some business between now and the end of the transfer window.
