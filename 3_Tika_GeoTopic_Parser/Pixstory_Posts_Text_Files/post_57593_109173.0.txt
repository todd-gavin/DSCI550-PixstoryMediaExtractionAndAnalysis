The conflicting relationship can evoke a sense of insecurity in a child's mind.
Someone who has experienced childhood trauma of 'arguing or fighting' parents often tends to lose hope for their future relationships.
Even if they find a person to spend their lives with, they always think of being harmed or cheated by their partners.

The constant fear of infidelity or insecurity can always hinder their relationship with their partners. The research found that being affected by interparental conflict, adult or grown-up children cannot form a secure romantic relationship with their partners.
Most of them either divorced or left their partners as their relationship lacked emotional satisfaction, authenticity and trust.
What remained persistent was the childhood trauma and encounter with interparental conflict. It affects them to the extent that they find it difficult to accept someone with the thought of building a positive bond.
It is always hindered, restricted and abused.

They find it challenging to be open or vulnerable with their partners; the constant picture of unsettled thoughts and unanswered questions never let them make a positive bond with anyone in a romantic relationship.
