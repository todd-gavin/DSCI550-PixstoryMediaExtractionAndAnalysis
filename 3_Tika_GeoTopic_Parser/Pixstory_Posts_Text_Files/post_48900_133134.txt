Have you seen how the big bad wolf or the angry tiger is always shown as the bad guy in movies Well not so much If an apex predator went extinct it would have a significant impact on the balance of the ecosystem Their disappearance would result in mass extinctions as other animals would start to take over their ecological niches This could have dire consequences for global ecosystems and biodiversity as well as human societies that rely on these habitats for food and income In fact estimates suggest that the loss of an apex predator could result in the extinction of up to of all species on earth This is because they play a significant role in regulating populations and stabilizing ecosystems Without them everything would become chaotic and unstable For example lions are important predators that help to keep populations of other animals in check Without them there would be an explosion in the number of scavengers and prey animals which would result in an increase in deforestation soil erosion and flooding In addition lions are keystone predators their elimination could lead to the extinction of other species that they rely on for food Consequently the whole ecosystem would be badly damaged and the environment would become much more difficult to manage So while it might not sound like a big deal to us humans living on Earth today the disappearance of apex predators would actually have a huge impact on our planet and we wouldn t even realize it until it was too late
