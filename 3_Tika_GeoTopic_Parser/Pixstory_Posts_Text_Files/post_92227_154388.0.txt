Hey everyone!! Hope you all are doing great! 
This is me giving you all a little insight about me as I just joined Pixstory and I love love love to make new friends. I'm an artist who expresses herself in almost every form of art such as tattoos, sketches, painting, hair color and many more. I am a die hard feminist and is always up for a debate. I'm really excited to start my journey here!
