K-dramas and K-pop music are certainly responsible for spreading the Hallyu wave across the globe. However, Korean romantic movies are no less influential, as they have built a strong fan base with their sensational storylines, fresh concepts and intense romance.

While movies like My Sassy Girl garnered international popularity and became a major hit throughout Asia, The Handmaiden, from acclaimed director Park Chan-wook, bagged the first ever win for a Korean film at the BAFTA Awards in 2018.

This shows how well-received Korean romantic cinema is among critics and romantic film lovers. And, though Korean cinema excels in all genres, the romance section alone deserves praise for the unique tales, leaving viewers asking for more.

Additionally, within romantic movies there is something for everyone â€” dramatic romance, romantic comedies, atypical romance and more. And some can be called truly exceptional with power-packed emotions and top-notch performances, making them stand out from the list.
