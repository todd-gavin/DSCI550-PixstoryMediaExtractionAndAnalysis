 Variety If I get bored with my section of town I can hop on the subway for to minutes and escape to what feels like another state or country If I get tired of my local pizzeria I can choose from hundreds of other pizza parlors throughout the city If I don t want to ride the subway I can take a bus walk ride CityBike or even take an Uber New York City offers so much variety that you could live here your entire life and not eat in every restaurant see every Broadway show hit every jazz club or live in every neighborhood You never run out of new things to do dishes to eat places to visit or people to meet NYC is an ever evolving city and that s the beauty of living here
