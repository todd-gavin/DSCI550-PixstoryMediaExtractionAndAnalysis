Nature has endowed Kashmir with implausible beauty, and no other words in the entire universe can describe its charm better than this couplet of Amir Khusro. Universally acknowledged as “heaven of earth”, Kashmir is resplendent with Chinar trees that turn the entire valley yellow and red as autumn arrives, silver lakes that turn gold in the light of dawn, and the jewel-blue river that are souls of the ice-cold mountains.
