The Chief Minister of Delhi, Professor Gurmukh Nihal Singh asked me to act as an arbitrator in the dispute with regard to the Salwan Trust. There was some difference of opinion, between the management and the staff. 
The Department of Education of Delhi was also a party in this matter. I spent a number of days in hearing the grievances of the teachers and in hearing the version of the trustees and after spending about a fortnight on these hearings I submitted my decision to the Chief Minister which was accepted by him. Soon after I fell suddenly ill. It was said that it was some kind of a heart attack. The next morning I was walking about in my compound, when to my surprise, my doctor brought in my old friend, Col. Amir Chand, who ordered me to remain in bed for six weeks. Col. Amir Chand is not only one of the best physicians in India but he is a kind friend, as well. He is however a very strict doctor and his commands cannot be easily disobeyed. So I had no alternative but to lie in bed. I was overwhelmed by their affection and kindness.
 I had never imagined that I had such a large number of friends and admirers throughout the territory of Bharat right from Kerala to Himachal. This period of compulsory rest was very distasteful to me and as soon as the doctor’s permission was given, I gradually moved up to my hill resort in Upper Dharmshala and spent the summer there along with my family. 
In October, ’55 I conceived an idea of starting a rehabilitation fund for financial assistance to the D. A. V. Institutions that had been disrupted and had to be rehabilitated. This fund received a fair amount of response from the public and I have been able to collect about Rs. 1,70,000. To collect funds I undertook tours to different places in the Punjab and was very well received by the people of those places, particularly Hissar, Hoshiarpur, Amritsar Pathankot, Kamal and Dehra Dun.
