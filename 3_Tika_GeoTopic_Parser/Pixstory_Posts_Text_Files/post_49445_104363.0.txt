Yet another day, yet another instance of gun violence. SWS shot and killed an 8-year-old black kid in Florence SC. The Suspect shot over 100 rounds at cars passing. Local authorities are hiding the identity of the victims. 3 shot, 1 killed, several vehicles hit — and all of them are black. Another racially motivated act.

So, one question – plain and simple – when will all of this stop? I am appalled how so many people are STILL constantly defending gun ownership as if their life depends on it.

Like, what goes on in that mind of yours? Do you not feel any empathy for innocent children that are killed? Or the families that are destroyed? Does all your empathy show up only when women want abortions? How ironic is that the states with the strictest abortion laws are also the states with the loosest gun laws.

2022 Gun related deaths:

- 17,936 total number of gun related deaths

- 9,966 suicides

- 231 mass shootings

- 11 mass murders

- 681 children killed (0-17 yrs old)

Do not tell me it's a sacrifice we, as a country, are willing to make to protect our right to second ammendment as if our right to life does not matter at all. This is ridiculous!

The Tulsa shooter bought his weapon of mass murder from a gun shop legally just a few short hours before the shooting. Just a few hours! Do you see how easy it is to commit mass murders in our country? Unlike what Ted Cruz believes, we DO NOT have 'enough' laws.
