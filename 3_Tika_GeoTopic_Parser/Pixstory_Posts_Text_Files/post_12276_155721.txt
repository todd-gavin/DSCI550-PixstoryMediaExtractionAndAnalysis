Today while scrolling to my gallery I found this beautiful picture of the front view from the main gate of my campus I just can t stop appreciating the soothing vibes it gives It s a busy road but still very quiet and calm I ve always adore nature for it beauty but I truly adore this view for its aesthetic vibes Kudos to my photography
