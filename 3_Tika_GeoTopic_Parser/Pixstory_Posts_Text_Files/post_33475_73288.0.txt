I have visited several historical sites which are well known to all of us and have also shared the photographs of some of these sites on Facebook earlier. But the beauty in this endeavour is to understand that almost every part of India is rich with its own contributions in the historical timeline. Almost every small district has its own list of heroes who shone like bright stars in some forgotten era. It is very interesting to find a deep historical imprint in the most unsuspected places.


To quote an example of how we live with history and legends, I wish to quote my example when as an undergraduate student of IIT Kanpur, I had once visited Bithoor located on the banks of the Ganga. At the time of our visit we never knew about the history of the place, but had gone for boating in the river Ganga. 

On reaching Bithoor, one could immediately see that the place was revered for its historical importance and that it was identified with ancient Puranic Brahmavarta by the local priests. A priest on the Ghat showed the place where Lord Brahma was supposed to have tied his horse when he had conducted the Ashwamedha Yagya. Nearby a mound is called the Dhruv Tila, which is supposed to have been the place where the prince Dhruva meditated in the name of Vishnu and was eleveated to his position as the Pole Star. Very near to the Dhruv Tila is a Masjid which was said to be built during the reign of Aurangzeb after destruction of an ancient Shiva Temple, as we were informed by the boatman who was ferrying us across.
