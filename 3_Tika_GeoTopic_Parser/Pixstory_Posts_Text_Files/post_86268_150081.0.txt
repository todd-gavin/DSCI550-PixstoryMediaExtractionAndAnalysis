I have lived in multiple cities till now, so which city to call mine is a little vague. I recently shifted from my hometown, Gwalior, to Delhi for college. Gwalior has been shifting to the idea of having separate residential areas in the past decade and I lived in one of those areas. Since these areas are on the outskirts, they have yet to have a lot of necessities and I had to travel at least 5km (Which is a lot for that city) to buy anything. So, one of the shockers after coming to Delhi was that I could get everything within walking distance in a city thatâ€™s 5 times bigger than Gwalior!! 
So, I would really like it if my city, Gwalior, has greater and wider availability of goods and outlets in the outskirt residential areas too.
