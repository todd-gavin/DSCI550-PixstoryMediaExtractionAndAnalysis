In this time of inflation, a windfall tax on big oil and gas companies will possibly tackle the soaring cost of living. 

Current policy is still based on the tax deterring investment in new oil and gas fields and green technologies.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson cautioned last week it could put future UK energy security at risk. This is something that we can always consider because America plans to introduce a Billionaire tax to boost the economy.

The struggle people need to live in the UK might not put the windfall tax off the table. According to BBC, Tesco chairman John Allan told that the case for one was overwhelming in the face of the real hardship he was seeing reflected in stores.

An oil and gas industry executive acknowledged "it's clear this debate is not going away. I don't think the chancellor wants to do it but the political pressure is there"

However, the biggest challenge will be to design a mechanism to impose the tax. Companies like BP and Shell have paid almost zero tax on their North Sea operations over the last few years as prices have been much lower and they are supposed to offset the cost of decommissioning old North Sea facilities against any profits made. 

However, tax experts say that if you made it purely retrospective, then you could argue it is no disincentive to future investment as long as it appears with a reasonable promise it's a one-off occurrence.
