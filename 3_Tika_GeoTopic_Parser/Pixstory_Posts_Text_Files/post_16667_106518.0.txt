Remember Ayushmann Khurrana and Nushrratt Bharuccha’s 2019 release Dream Girl? The movie was a massive hit among the fans and Ayushmann had won hearts with his phenomenal performance. It was indeed a treat to watch him onscreen. Interestingly, there have been reports that makers are planning to come up with Dream Girl 2 which will feature Ayushmann Khurrana in the lead. And now it is reported that Sara Ali Khan is likely to be the female lead of this much talked about project.

 “The makers are looking for a feisty, young star. They think Sara fits the bill, and have begun talks with her. However, it is still in the early stages. The film will go on floors only later in the year,” a source was quoted saying. Although an official confirmation in this regard is yet to be made, if the reports turned out to be true, it will mark Sara’s first collaboration with Ayushmann Khurrana.
