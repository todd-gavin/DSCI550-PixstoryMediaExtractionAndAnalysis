What I wore on my trip to Himachal 🐬
Outfit 2, day 2
This off shoulder sweater which I've owmed for more than 1 year at this point but didn't get a chance to wear but now i finally did. I paired dark blue skinny jeans with it because i wanted to wear boots and i feel boots look the best with skinny jeans even if skinny jeans isn't in trend anymore..
