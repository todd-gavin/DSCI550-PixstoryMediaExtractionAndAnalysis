The political crisis in Maharashtra was initially dubbed to be a repeat of a midnight coup in when Bharatiya Janata Party BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in as the chief minister with the support of the Nationalist Congress Party NCP It so happened that NCP boss Sharad Pawar s nephew Ajit Pawar pledged support to Fadnavis after the Shiv Sena snapped it s decades old ties with the BJP over government formation and especially the chief minister s post The Shiv Sena had proposed a two and a half year rule for both the parties but it was rejected by the BJP arguing that it will hold the chief minister s post for a full five year term as it was the single largest party The Shiv Sena tried to remind the BJP of its promise but the latter was unrelenting On November Fadnavis was sworn in as the chief minister of Maharashtra by Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari early morning along with Ajit Pawar as his deputy in a dramatic twist to political events soon after the Shiv Sena NCP and Congress struck an alliance with Uddhav Thackeray as the chief minister of the coalition which came to be known as Maha Vikas Aghadi MVA It appeared that Ajit Pawar had the blessings of senior Pawar who was spearheading the efforts to form a Shiv Sena NCP Congress alliance However Sharad Pawar was quick to distance himself from Ajit Pawar who later quit as deputy chief minister and returned to the NCP fold Similarly this time it seemed that Shiv Sena rebel Eknath Shinde had chief minister Uddhav Thackeray s nod It was said that the Shiv Sena is ceding its core Hindutva space to the BJP and as a result the party would get wiped out in the state Hence Uddhav Thackeray was looking for an escape route and had delegated the task of exiting the MVA to Shinde However as the day progressed all such conspiracy theories were set at rest when Uddhav Thackeray in a press conference praised Pawar and Congress president Sonia Gandhi for standing by him in this crisis He appealed to party legislators to take his resignation in person
