This might as well be the end for Dexter, his dilemma of the code and following it ended with a contradiction. Does he get caught breaking one rule or kill an innocent and escape, hence breaking the other rule of the code. This is exactly what happened in the last episode, two of his most important rules were put up against each other and those who saw the finale now how it exactly turned out. The limited series was made to bring justice to the ending of the series almost 10 years ago, some fans have said they’ve done a better job and some didn’t like the ending at all. The series was well written, it had all the tropes of the Dexter we knew but it also had a breath of fresh air. Showing Dexter become rusty was a good thing on the part of the creators because that’s what would happen after such a long time. 

Jack Alcott did a wonderful job playing Harrison Morgan and there are strong rumours that Alcott might get a spin off. He rightly deserves so. Jennifer Carpenter as Deb. She has replaced Harry as Dexter’s dark passenger and Jennifer plays her to perfection again. Clancy Brown played the role of  Kurt Caldwell, the main antagonist of the series, he does a tremendous job to make us hate him. Michael C. Hall was at his usual best and it seemed like he never left Dexter behind. He brings life to the show and keeps it steady right till the end. Michael C. Hall himself stated that he’s happy with the ending that his character has finally got and is at peace with it.

The story of Dexter has finally ended it seems, what spin offs come out of it will be interesting to see. As an avid fan of Dexter, I never believed I’d see Michael C. Hall as Dexter again. Its been such an overwhelming experience, no matter how it was to see this character return even when all odds were against it.
