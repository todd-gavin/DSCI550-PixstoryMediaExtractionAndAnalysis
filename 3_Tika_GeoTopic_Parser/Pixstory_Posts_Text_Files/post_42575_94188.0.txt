Just watched the semifinal of the FA Cup between Manchester City and Liverpool and oh my god, what a match it was.

Match ended on a scoreline of 2-3 where Liverpool wins the match and after seeing the scoreline you will say that match was so tense and both teams must give the cutthroat competition to each other but it’s the other way around.

Liverpool finished the game by scoring 3 goals in the first 45 minutes of the match and in the second half Manchester City played decently and scored two goals also but that wasn’t enough to win the match against Liverpool. The city’s first goal came in 47th minutes and the second goal came in 90+1st minutes but by then the game was already over.

Liverpool is in the final of the FA Cup for the very first time under their manager Jurgen Klopp and they will face either Chelsea or Crystal Palace in the final of the FA Cup which will be played on 14th May 2022 at Wembley, London.
