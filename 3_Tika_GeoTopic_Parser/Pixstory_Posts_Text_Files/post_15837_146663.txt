 Abstract Calpain is a ubiquitous calcium dependent cysteine protease and found in cytoplasm as well as mitochondria We have earlier reported that active calpain is translocated from cytosol to mitochondria and activates MMP Calpain activation is detrimental to the heart in several different ways but there is little evidence that it can degrade Purkinje cell protein PCP and impair contractility in diabetes Our hypothesis is that in diabetes PCP is degraded by calpain causing contractile dysfunction that can be mitigated by exercise To test this hypothesis we recruited four groups of mice db control db with exercise db db db db with exercise The mice were exercised on treadmill for weeks as per American Veterinary Research Guidelines Adding calcium to isolated cardiomyocytes caused them to lose shape and die Compared with live myocytes we observed high calpain levels as well as significantly lower levels of PCP and increased levels of calmodulin and calmodulin kinase II CaMKII in dead myocytes We used the CRISPR Cas Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats plasmid to knock down calpain in HL myocytes which restored the levels of PCP along with calmodulin and CaMKII In vivo we found upregulated levels of calpain in db db mice diabetic as compared to db which were mitigated in the exercised mice Conclusively our data strongly suggests that in diabetes there is high induction of calpain with degrades PCP a protein important for contractility and exercise can mitigate this Sources
