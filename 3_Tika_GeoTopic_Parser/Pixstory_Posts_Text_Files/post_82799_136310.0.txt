I had a very exciting growth trajectory during the start of my career. Starting with being the 3-time Mini-National Champion, doing the same with Sub-junior and Junior Nationals to playing in the Asian championship, my self-confidence and self-belief increased a lot. There also used to be a World Junior Camp where 2 kids from every country would get selected. Thankfully, I was one of the two and I went to Bulgaria to attend the camp.
I have had a lot of opportunities in my life to perform amazingly and I've exploited them as much as I could. 
Unfortunately, it all came to a standstill in 2010 when I got a knee injury. I wanted to go really high in this field but if you don't pick yourself up immediately, it gets difficult to come back. Being the only one from Assam, and not in the best condition, I couldn't get the best guidance. The state wasn't very helpful either. Regardless, I do not have time to fret about mistakes I made in the past; I have my club and I am training so many young stars!
I inspire them with different players' experiences and I know that all of them have the potential to perform amazingly in their younger or later lives. It is necessary for young aspirants to understand the importance of consistency and hardwork. They tend to simply practice for a couple of days and then rest. It can never work like that. It takes years of efforts to perform your best in a tournament. Keep on training and working hard, success will come your way!
Along with that, mental health is ofcourse very important. Thankfully, coaches tend to be sympathetic and have open discussions about how to overcome distress. One of the most important things one learns in sports is this! 
You are capable and you know it. Just push through the beginning stages and then your willpower will do the rest!
