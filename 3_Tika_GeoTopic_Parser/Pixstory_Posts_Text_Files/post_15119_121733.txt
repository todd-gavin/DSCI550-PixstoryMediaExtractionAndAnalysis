After the prestigious collection of Massimo Cotto and more than 200 records arriving from all over Italy, Gerry Basso, son of the well-known jazz musician Gianni Basso, has decided to donate his father&#39;s archive to LECATTEDRALI ARTS, a shared museum of works of art and musical memorabilia in continuous evolution which will housed inside the LECATTEDRALI structure which will be inaugurated in Monferrato in the spring of the history and career of the Monferrato jazz musician who has inspired entire generations of artists such as Fabrizio Bosso and Dado Moroni and who over the years has collaborated with Chet Baker Billie Holiday Gerry Mulligan Lee Konitz Mina The Collection of LeCattedrali Arts is also enriched by Gerry&#39;s personal collection Basso which counts over a thousand records purchased around the world The museum in continuous evolution is taking shape and promises to be a true temple of music unique in its kind In this context, the term deliberately chosen is not museum with its connotations of immobility but the most suitable collection to convey the idea of a multi-purpose space for the arts and the history of music in continuous movement and evolution At the moment LeCattedrali Arts can count more than vinyl records and CDs thousands of music books hundreds of relics memorabilia photos and objects autographed by the greatest Italian and international artists, historical exponents of the world of music, cinema and theater An active but above all emotional participation that shows the desire of enthusiasts to contribute to a shared project and to the birth of a place that houses objects that have marked the history of music giving it the right value
