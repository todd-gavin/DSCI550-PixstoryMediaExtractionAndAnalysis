On Saturday, actor Ranveer Singh arrived at the campus to attend the fourth convocation of Bennett University, Greater Noida.After congratulating the students for their graduation he went to the fan pit area that was made for student interaction. The actor got into the stage and literally set it into fire. Be it rap , song or dance- he did it all for the students, that too in just 15 minutes.After interacting with the students for some time, sadly he had to leave but not before performing his famous moves.Yes! He actually performed “Khalibali” on the stage and the entire campus was grooving on his moves.
