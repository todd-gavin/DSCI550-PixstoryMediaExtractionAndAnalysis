Back then my Film making lecturer asked us to write a short review about any film! 

So I'm sharing the draft of my review of this particular movie that I have submitted. 

FIVE FEET APART is a type of movie which could relate to us in our existing life, where because of COVID 19 we were not able to meet our loved ones and feel the touch we wanted. 
The human touch is the first form of communication. The film points out how important is to touch, and hug our loved ones when we are low or sad and tell how a hug or their touch can change or better their mood.
If I talk about the particular scene that I selected, it was a perfect shot scene, with no unwanted clips, performed well, directed and written beautifully. 
 It is an emotional, romantic teenage love story that could move people's hearts and change their perspectives towards things.
