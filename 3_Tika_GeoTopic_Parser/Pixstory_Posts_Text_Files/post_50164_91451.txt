UCLA scientists have discovered a new source of super fast energetic electrons raining down on Earth a phenomenon that contributes to the colorful aurora borealis but also poses hazards to satellites spacecraft and astronauts The researchers observed unexpected rapid electron precipitation from low Earth orbit using the ELFIN mission a pair of tiny satellites built and operated on the UCLA campus by undergraduate and graduate students guided by a small team of staff mentors By combining the ELFIN data with more distant observations from NASA s THEMIS spacecraft the scientists determined that the sudden downpour was caused by whistler waves a type of electromagnetic wave that ripples through plasma in space and affects electrons in the Earth s magnetosphere causing them to spill over into the atmosphere Their findings published March in the journal Nature Communications demonstrate that whistler waves are responsible for far more electron rain than current theories and space weather models predict ELFIN is the first satellite to measure these super fast electrons said Xiaojia Zhang lead author and a researcher in UCLA s department of Earth planetary and space sciences The mission is yielding new insights due to its unique vantage point in the chain of events that produces them Central to that chain of events is the near Earth space environment which is filled with charged particles orbiting in giant rings around the planet called Van Allen radiation belts Electrons in these belts travel in Slinky like spirals that literally bounce between the Earth s north and south poles Under certain conditions whistler waves are generated within the radiation belts energizing and speeding up the electrons This effectively stretches out the electrons travel path so much that they fall out of the belts and precipitate into the atmosphere creating the electron rain One can imagine the Van Allen belts as a large reservoir filled with water or in this case electrons said Vassilis Angelopolous a UCLA professor of space physics and ELFIN s principal investigator As the reservoir fills water periodically spirals down into a relief drain to keep the basin from overflowing But when large waves occur in the reservoir the sloshing water spills over the edge faster and in greater volume than the relief drainage
