🥗🥬🫕Crunchy romaine lettuce, crisp homemade croutons and the creamiest dressing make this a salad worth craving! It’s filling enough on its own but feel free to build on this base recipe to add in other elements of choice. 🍽

🍞Start by making your croutons:
- Slice up a sourdough/ baguette/ bread of choice into cubes. Liberally drizzle with olive oil, sea salt and black pepper. 🫒🍞 🧂

- Spread evenly on a baking tray and bake at 180C until crisp (usually 7-8 minutes, but baking times could vary depending on your oven). ♨️

- A Caesar salad is typically made with a large head of Romaine Lettuce. Chop it into bite-sized pieces, rinsing and thoroughly drying the leaves too. 🥬🥗🍽

- Also prep your Parmesan which can be shaved or sprinkled onto the salad. 🧀🫕

- Optional: slice up some chives too and toast nuts of choice. 🥜

•Make the dressing by vigorously whisking together:
- 4 tbsp olive oil 
- 2-2.5 tbsp mayonnaise 🧀♨️
- 1 tbsp lime juice 🍋🍸
- 1/2 tbsp dijon mustard 🤤
- 2-3 garlic cloves, minced 🧄
- Sea salt and black pepper 🧂🧂

You can use an immersion blender if you have one for a creamier consistency. I usually dip a leaf in the dressing to taste and then further adjust ingredients as required on the day (eg adding more lime juice for a zing/ a dash more mustard for a kick etc). 🥫

Assemble the salad. Serve chilled , with the dressing alongside… 🥗🥬🤤🧂🥶

Enjoy, happy eating. 🍴🥗🥬🫕
