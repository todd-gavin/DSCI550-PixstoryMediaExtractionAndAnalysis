On the occasion of the 90th anniversary of the Indian Air Force (IAF), the Central government has approved the creation of a Weapon Systems Branch. 
This is the first time since Independence that a new operational branch has been created. 
The creation of Weapon System branch would nessesitate unification of all weapon system operators under one entity for operational implementation of all ground-based and specialised airborne weapon systems. 
Moreover, The branch would operate the specialised streams of surface-to-surface missiles (Brahmos missile), surface-to-air-missiles (Trishul and Akash missile systems), remotely piloted aircraft (Heron drones), and weapon system operators in twin/multi-crew aircraft. 
The new branch would certainly help in reducing expenditure on flight training and help saving Rs 3,400 crore, Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari said at the 90th Air Force Day celebrations, on October 8. 
The ceremony was held at Chandigarh's Sukhna Lake complex, Where the unveiling of the IAF's new combat uniform was also witnessed along with a parade and performance by military bands.
