In a rainy Prefontaine Classic on Saturday, Olympic gold medallist Elaine Thompson-Herah of Jamaica beat American Sha'Carri Richardson in the 100 metres. 

US News reported that at the Tokyo Olympics, Thompson-Herah won the 100 and 200 metres, as well as the 400 relay. She successfully defended her Pre championship in 10.79 seconds, finishing ahead of Richardson in 10.92 seconds. 

“I came out here with the mindset of a champion and I delivered,” Thompson-Herah said, revealing that she's been battling a shoulder injury this season.

Richardson made headlines last year after winning the US Olympic trials, but she was denied a seat on the team for Tokyo after testing positive for marijuana. Last year, she competed in the Pre and came last in the 100 metres.

The Prefontaine Classic, named after the late Steve Prefontaine, is the third and only U.S. stop on the Diamond League. Hayward Field, on the University of Oregon campus, also will host the U.S. championships in late June before the world championships in July.
