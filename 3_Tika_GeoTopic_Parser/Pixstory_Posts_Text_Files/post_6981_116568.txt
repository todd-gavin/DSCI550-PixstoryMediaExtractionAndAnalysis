By Sakib Lone Mohammad Ali was sent to Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai after he was charged under a few minor sections of the IPC Indian Penal Code He spent nearly a month and a half in prison as an undertrial and secured bail on May but he continued to languish in jail for a few more weeks as he was financially unsound I got the bail on May but due to lack of money I got released only after a few more weeks I contacted an NGO and they paid the money to secure my bail In the Taloja jail I have seen several prisoners doing their time and spending two to three years in jail despite getting bail because they don t have money or can t find someone who can stand as surety for their release Often money or some person s paying power decides how long they will be in jail It is not dependent on a fair trial or the offence they have committed says Ali Ali s case is not an isolated incident Indian jails are crammed with undertrials whose pleas are rarely heard According to the Prison Statistics India report of the National Crime Records Bureau three out of four prisoners in Indian jails are undertrials As per the latest data out of the Indian prison inmates were undertrials A large majority of the undertrial prisoners belong to the minority community According to the government among undertrials about were Muslims while were Dalits tribals or OBCs Our jails are filled with undertrials who belong to the minority community and are from the society s lower strata Speedy and fair trial is a constitutional guarantee and we as a system have failed in giving that constitutional guarantee to these prisoners People who belong to the minority community or oppressed classes become the victims of this systemic failure SCs OBCs and minorities constitute almost per cent of the undertrials Many of these people are punished before the actual commission of the offences Caste also plays a huge role Read the full story here
