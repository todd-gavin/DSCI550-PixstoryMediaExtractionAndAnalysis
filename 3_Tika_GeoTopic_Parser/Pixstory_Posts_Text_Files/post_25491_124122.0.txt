WWE fans have held high hopes for Bray Wyatt's big return, and there might be favorable reports for those curious for updates.

Bray Wyatt was among the most surprising names on the long list of superstars released by the company in 2021. Despite several rumors of his potential in-ring return, Wyatt has not stepped inside the squared circle since leaving WWE.

The latest reports in Xero News stated a big update on his return. There is reportedly "a belief" backstage that Bray is back in WWE. However, as of this writing, there are no concrete reports on the timeframe of his return. Wyatt recently changed his name to Wyatt 6 on Twitter and has reportedly filed for new trademarks under that label.

The source mentioned above asserted that they were right about Karrion Kross' surprise return on SmackDown and T-Bar potentially being repackaged.

Additionally, Xero News has reported on a potential triple-threat match at Clash at the Castle next month with plans to move the WWE Championship back to RAW.
