What does a nest signify for you Does it evoke a sense of comfort or discomfort Be honest Its contradictory right Comforting yet limiting Its purpose is served when the eggs break into young ones they grow wings and fly away New mates are found nests are built again and new young ones the cycle goes on Why is it that only the homosapien nests remain Why is it that we cling to the nest even if what remains are egg shells and crumbs What solace do we find there Why do we convince ourselves into believing what is not true We continue living in the bubble of self deception We find ways to cope with the stress of non reciprocity We deny ourselves kindness and compassion We fall in line with the unsaid norms and become withered from within Everything has a reason and a season Nests and nesting are for a season not for a lifetime There is only one master Nature
