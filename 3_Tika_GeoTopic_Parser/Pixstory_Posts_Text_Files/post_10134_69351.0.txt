A week after the Taliban announce the reopening of schools for boys across the country, Khatera gets a call asking her to come in. She puts on her school clothes and makes her way to what she calls her "happy place". She misses it - the smell of chalk when she writes on the blackboard and her students cheekily quizzing her on capital cities. She's brimming with excitement.

When she reaches school it's clear her students are happy to see her too. They take out their planners and ask her to sign them, like fans after a celebrity's autograph. But immediately she's called to the head-teacher's office.

All her female colleagues are there. They're told to sign their names on the register and then go straight back home.

"The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan still prevents women from working," says the headteacher.

Why were all the female teachers called in for nothing? Khatera thinks the headteacher may want to curry favour with the Taliban by showing them the signatures of women ready to work.

At the school gate, she stops to look at the classroom she has taught in for 10 years. She wants to tell the boys she will be back one day, but she can't hold back her tears.

Khatera was shaken and fearful on the day the Taliban took Kabul, but this breaks her heart.
