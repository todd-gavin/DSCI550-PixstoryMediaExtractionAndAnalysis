"The pen is mighter than the sword",goes an old saying. We all know the intensity of wrath and power that is contained in a pen. It is a writer's prestige, the medium of eye opener for a civilisation. What the pen can write, constructs the world.  A king can rule only his kingdom, but a poet or writer can rule the whole world through his/her inspirational writing.
