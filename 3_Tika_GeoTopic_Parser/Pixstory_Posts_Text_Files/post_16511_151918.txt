The recent Bollywood release Vikram Vedha saw another moderate boost on Sunday day just like it had on Saturday day both of which were much needed after an underwhelming opening day at the box office where the film merely collected crore nett That being said the Hrithik Roshan and Saif Ali Khan starrer directed by Pushkar Gayahtri who had also helmed the original Vikram Vedha in Tamil ideally should ve had an even bigger jump as it ll now need supremely strong holds from Monday onward if it has any hope of sustaining in the long run It s also worrying that Vikram Vedha box office collection is not picking up at all in mass pockets
