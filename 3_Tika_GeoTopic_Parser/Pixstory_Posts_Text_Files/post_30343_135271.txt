Simone Inzaghi satisfied with Inter&#39;s performance in the home win against Cremonese I&#39;m very happy it wasn&#39;t an easy match against a team that so far hasn&#39;t collected what they deserved The boys were good at interpreting it Even the substitutes did well and gave us a big hand Correa He was tired even after a blow received earlier but there shouldn&#39;t be any problems Looking to the rest of the season, Inzaghi looks with concern at the depth of the squad available I&#39;m worried because I said we lack a central defender we will have matches every two days and mezzo For the moment I only have De Vrij as central defender I told who I have to tell that we need a central defender because for the moment I have a very good boy who needs to grow up but last year he wasn&#39;t a starter in the spring The club knows everything, knows that right now we need to add a defender because we have five and we need six
