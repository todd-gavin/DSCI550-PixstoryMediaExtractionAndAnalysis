De-register, sealing of Kashmir Press Club: Chandigarh journalist body condemns Jammu & Kashmir Administration

The Chandigarh Press Club condemned the Jammu & Kashmir administration move to de-register the Kashmir Press Club and subsequently sealing of the premises of the club. Earlier, in an unfortunate incident, the administration with the help of the security forces, forcefully took over the control of the Kashmir Press Club from the legally elected management. The incident took place on the next day, when the election to form the club’s new executive body was announced.

It’s a blatant attack on the freedom of the press. The Chandigarh Press Club on the behalf of the journalist fraternity is also to give a representation to the J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha, demanding to restore the registration of the Kashmir Press Club and handing over the club building to the journalists.

The nine journalist bodies in Kashmir came under an umbrella and issued a joint statement condemning the administration’s move. Editors Guild of India and other press clubs of the country have also extended their support to the members of the Kashmir Press Club.

How the things were unfolded:

# On January 14 – A group of journalists, reportedly close to the administration, accompanied with armed personnel, barged into the premises of the Kashmir Press Club and forcefully took over the club from the management.

# On January 17, the administration cancelled the lease to the premises occupied by the Kashmir Press Club and handed it back to the estates department.

The Kashmir Press Club got its premises in 2018 and since August 5, 2019 – the abrogation of Article 370, the press club became a pillar of strength for the 300 odd journalist members and it was their main meeting point.  

“The Chandigarh Press Club also stands in solidarity with the members of the Kashmir Press Club and all those Kashmiri journalists, who are surveilled, interrogated and jailed, for just doing their professional duties,” stated Chandigarh Press Club’s secretary general Rajinder Nagarkoti in a press release.
