There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,
       The earth, and every sight,
                          To me did seem
                      Apparelled in celestial light,
            The glory and freshness of a dream.
It is now as it hath been of yore;â€”
                      Turn wheresoe'er I may,
                          By night or day.
The things which I have seen I can see no more.

                      The Rainbow comes,
                      And lovely is  Rose,
                      The Moon doth with delight
       Look round when the heavens are bare,
                      Waters on a starry night
                      Are beautiful and fair;
       The sunshine is a glorious birth;
       But yet I know, where'er I go,
That there hath past away a glory from the earth.

William Wordsworth
