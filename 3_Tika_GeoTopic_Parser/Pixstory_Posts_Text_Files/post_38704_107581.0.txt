Final verdict



The Italian has usually been compared to young Zlatan Ibrahimovic, for possessing physical strength. He can be also compared to young Zlatan for being a pain in the defenders’ nether regions, especially in the final and attacking third.


As per the latest transfer mill, Arsenal are after the Italian. After losing both Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette in the transfer window, he would be looking to beef up his attacking power by bringing the Italian and another attacker(maybe Gabriel Jesus) to the Emirates.


With Sassuolo having signed the 21 year old talented Agustin Alvarez from Penarol, the doors are open for Scamacca to make his move. 

However there is one caveat to the deal, as PSG has entered the battlefield to get the Italian. They will be able to provide him Champions League football, which Arsenal won’t be able to do.


Where there are transfer rumors, expect Manchester United to be linked to him. As per reports Man Utd boss Erik Ten Hag is interested in the 6 ft 5 inches, tattooed up to his neck Italian. As they lost the transfer race to Liverpool to acquire Darwin Nunez, his attention has shifted to bring in an attacker who will share the workload with the 37 year old Portuguese Cristiano Ronaldo. 


He is available at £30-35 million, which won’t be a task for the Manchester club. With the transfer window fully opened and players being bought at a very fast race, expect the two English clubs to make a signing soon enough as they’ve been linked with players. Now its time to take action. Where the Italian ends up, it remains a mystery.
