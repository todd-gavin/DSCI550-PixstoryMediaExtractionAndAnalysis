One of the most difficult aspects of adopting AI is the inability to incorporate ethics and morality both of which are vital human characteristics To make decisions and predictions AI relies solely on data and algorithms As a result bias may be embedded in the data whether conscious or unconscious and may result in discriminating output because it can only focus on logical conclusions As AI progresses the inability to include ethical considerations may become a serious worry necessitating global talks Artificial intelligence AI may end up jeopardising digital physical and political security Its usage has the potential to be fatal Criminals training computers to hack or socially engineer victims at human or superhuman levels of competence non state actors weaponizing consumer drones privacy eroding monitoring profiling and repression or automated and targeted disinformation campaigns are just a few examples Considering only rich people will most likely be able to afford AI it s going to end up in major exploitation of the poor and the working class Authoritarian governments would use it or already using it to torture their public A lot of people will get away with crimes even the heinous ones So I m not sure if AI s pros actually outweighs its con Technology is meant to help humans not take over them It should be in our control not the other way round
