Christian Eriksen had a near-fatal cardiac arrest during the UEFA Euro 2021 as he collapsed on the field against Denmark. But thankfully he has since returned to playing professional football. 

The Danish midfielder is currently playing for Premier League club Brentford. He currently has a contract with the Bees until the end of the season. Hence the DailyStar suggests that Manchester United would attempt to sign Eriksen in the summer. 

After having his contract with Inter Milan mutually terminated due to his medical condition, Christian Eriksen joined Brentford in January this year. Since then, the Danish midfielder has scored 1 goal and provided 2 assists in 7 Premier League games. 

Christian Eriksen has thankfully not had any problems since returning to football. The 30-year-old has become a regular starter for Brentford in the Premier League. To add to this, the Bees are unbeaten in the six games that Eriksen has started. 

Jesse Lingard and Juan Mata are expected to leave in the summer. Hence, Manchester United would have only Bruno Fernandes as the potential attacking midfielder at the club following their departures.

Owing to this, Erik Ten Hag reportedly wants Christian Eriksen at the club. The Dutchman firmly believes that the Danish midfielder would make the squad better. To add to this, he also believes that Eriksen could even dethrone Fernandes as United's attacking midfielder.





Tottenham Hotspur also want the midfielder!

Tottenham Hotspur are also interested in bringing their former midfielder back. Christian Eriksen has played six and a half seasons with the Spurs. In this, the midfielder has scored 69 goals in 305 appearances.

Upon leaving Tottenham Hotspur, Eriksen joined the Antonio Conte-led Inter Milan in January 2020. Conte has since moved to the Spurs and hence he wants the 30-year-old to join him. Hence it has to be seen what Christian Eriksen would decide to do in the coming months.
