First and foremost in learning about Australian culture are the Aboriginal Australian Peoples and Torres Strait Islanders. The fact that the first Australians formed their societies on the Australian continent up to 60,000 years ago is one of the most amazing Australian cultural facts. They have preserved their ways of life for longer than any other present people group on Earth, in many aspects relatively unmodified! 

As globalbasecamps tells us, though the introduction of Europeans, beginning with the Dutch in the late 1600s, had a huge impact, their customs have survived and remain an important part of Australia's culture.

Travelers can get a knowledge of these indigenous cultures by respecting their culture at all times, visiting them with ethical, sustainable tourism operators, and visiting renowned institutions. Purchasing Aboriginal art can help support their livelihoods while also providing a memento of your trip to Australia. 

Interacting with Aboriginal culture on Australia tours can be one of the most fascinating aspects of the trip, motivating a lifetime of learning about this people and their homeland since time immemorial.
