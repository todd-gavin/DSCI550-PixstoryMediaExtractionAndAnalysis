We have to deal with the issue of global climate change as society advances and develops Because this environmental issue is getting worse and is endangering all life on Earth including humans it has come to the attention of the general public in modern society At the same time it is obvious that the rapid expansion of human production and social activities in modern times is the cause of the intensifying effects of climate change We must thus bring up capitalism when discussing humans The rise of capitalism was responsible for the rapid increase in productivity across all sectors of society including industry and agriculture It also increased the use of new technologies human resources and participation in social activities In conclusion it can be said that capitalism and the growth of its capitalist economy are one of the primary indirect causes of climate change However just as we cannot deny ourselves we also cannot say that our existence as humans is wrong Human civilizations can prevent disorderly collapse by a smoother transition and deliberate adaptation as indicated in the theory of the limitations to expansion Humans can no longer avoid the effects of climate change so we should try to grow our economy with as little impact as possible on the environment We also need to fix the damage that has already been done to control the environmental issues that have gotten out of hand Image source Yes Magazine
