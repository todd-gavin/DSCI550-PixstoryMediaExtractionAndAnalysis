A California judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by six police officers who claimed that a Black Lives Matter mural was insulting and racist. 

The suit, which sought damages for discrimination, harassment, and retaliation in relation to 16 murals (spelling out "Black lives matter") created by 16 artists on Hamilton Street in downtown Palo Alto, just outside city hall, was tentatively dismissed earlier this month by Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Socrates Peter Manoukian (and next to the police department). 

The city commissioned the public artwork in June 2021, following the police assassination of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Despite officers Eric Figueroa and Michael Foley's warnings, it was not removed until November.

Art Newspaper reported that the policemen were concerned about the mural's depiction of a picture of Joanne Chesimard (better known as Assata Shakur), who was convicted in 1977 for the murder of New Jersey police officer Werner Foerster, after walking past it on a "regular basis." They also thought the artwork was a reference to the New Black Panthers, an organisation commonly regarded as a hate group that encourages violence, however the artists involved have denied this. 

The city's lawyers maintained that the job would not offend a "reasonable person" and that there was no indication of any retaliation at work (such as being fired or demoted) when the police voiced their concerns with their superiors. The judge agreed that there was insufficient evidence to back the claim, which sought damages of over $25,000 and alleged workplace harassment.
