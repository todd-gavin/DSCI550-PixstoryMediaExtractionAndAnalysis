Mac and cheese is the worst and I hate it. 

But as Bellomo says, life would be so much easier if we liked it. We could join in on the cheapest dish on the menu at every restaurant, we would make it myself when feeling lazy after a long day at work, and I would not be considered any less of an American! 

Heaven sends cheese. And pasta must also have been a gift from the angels, but combining the two and diluting it with butter, cream, and whatever else is a terrible excuse for a meal. 

Everything in the recipe is essentially extremely mild cheese that has been further diluted and melted over simple elbow macaroni. Whatâ€™s to love in it?

Whatever person does the combining and baking, macaroni and cheese will always turn out mealy. The pasta and the cheese, even if they aren't unduly mushy, are very dry. 

In any case, it is not a very appetising meal!
