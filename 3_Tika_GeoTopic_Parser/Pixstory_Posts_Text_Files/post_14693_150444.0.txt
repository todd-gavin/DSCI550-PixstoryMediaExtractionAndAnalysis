You are probably well-aware that smoking leads to asthma, emphysema and lung cancer, but did you also know it is also a contributing factor to heart disease?
When you light up a cigarette or cigar, you are potentially causing a buildup of fatty substances in your arteries, known as atherosclerosis. Yet another reason to kick your smoking habit for good.
Smoking is a major cause of coronary heart disease (CHD), in which the arteries of the heart can’t supply the heart muscle with enough oxygen-rich blood. CHD is the main cause of heart attacks, and it’s the leading cause of death in the United States.
Smoking causes high blood pressure, lowers your ability to exercise, and makes your blood more likely to clot. It also lowers HDL (good) cholesterol levels in the blood. All of these are risk factors for heart attacks and strokes.
Smoking is a major risk factor for peripheral arterial disease (PAD). In PAD, plaque builds up in the arteries that carry blood to the head, organs, and limbs. This increases your risk of heart disease, heart attack, and stroke.
Smoking increases the risk of having an aortic aneurysm. This is a balloon-like bulge in the aorta, the main artery carrying blood from the heart to other organs. It is caused by a weakening of the wall of the aorta. Aortic aneurysms can grow larger over time, and they can be life threatening if they rupture (break open).
Smoking can cause or worsen poor blood flow to the arms and legs, which is called peripheral vascular disease or (PVD). This can lead to pain in the legs when walking, and may lead to open sores that don’t heal.
Because smoking affects blood flow, it can lower the body’s ability to heal from cuts. This is why many doctors won’t do certain operations on patients unless they stop smoking.
