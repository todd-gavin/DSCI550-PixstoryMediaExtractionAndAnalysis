It looks like a morphed house Or it might look like something from a fairytale I don t believe that you can pass this house without making a stop and look at it At least if it s the first time you see it This commercial building is a really popular landmark It was built in by the design team of Szotynscy Zaleski And the funny thing is that the building was inspired by a Polish fairy tale The surreal building design incorporates warped walls sandstone framed windows stone elevation decors and curved architectural stained glass topped with a concave roof that uses blue green enamelled shingles to give the impression of a cartoon dragon It s named Krzywy Domek that translates into the crooked house Polish people joke about it and say that if you are out partying and drinking you shall pass this house If it looks like a regular house go to bed and sleep because that means that you are wasted
