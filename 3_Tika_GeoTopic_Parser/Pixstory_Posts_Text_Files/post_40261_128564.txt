I have always believed that communication is the key to make any couple work When you talk an hard work in a relationship a major part of it is communicating your feelings to each other honestly Couples should be open with each other which entails being willing to receive feedback from each other without becoming defensive or discouraging in order to sustain their connection As per psychalive Dr Lisa Firestone counsels partners to listen for the glimmer of truth in their partner s words That fact can provide a crucial hint as to how we might unknowingly be pushing our partner away Even if we don t always concur giving our partner our full attention makes them feel seen heard and cared for However penalising our spouse for being straightforward and honest with us stifles communication Therefore be open and honest
