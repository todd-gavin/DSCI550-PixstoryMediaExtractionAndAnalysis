The growth of AVOD revenue will come from small and medium enterprise (SME) advertisers in the coming three to four years, as per Nikhil Gandhi, Chief Operating Officer, MX Media. He went on to state that keeping this in mind MX media has introduced a separate platform called MX Advantage for the advertisers.
As cord-cutting shifts the revenue model of media companies, the ad-supported streaming space is poised to take off. MX Advantage, as per the company, is a one-stop solution to help brands across India leverage the power of content across formats, languages, and genres.
Hopeful of a sizeable revenue in the second half of the year on the platform, Gandhi shared that they have already started seeing many SME brands advertising on it.
Moreover, the platform has witnessed a 35% quarter-on-quarter growth in its ad business in H1 '22, led by categories like gaming, media and entertainment, F&B, fintech, and social apps categories, as per Gandhi. He said, “The third season of the big tentpole series ‘Aashram’ in June saw traction for advertising from big clients who came onboard. And the overall programmatic spend, which is the direct spend, did see growth over last year. Shows along with MX Advantage will drive the overall ad volumes on the platform.”
