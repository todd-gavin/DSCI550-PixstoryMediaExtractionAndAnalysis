Amsterdam is one of the world s most distinctive cities It s one of my and I m pretty sure most people s favorite cities A big part of its attraction is that it s so simple to get around on foot The fact that there is essentially no traffic throughout the entire centre contributes to its laid back vibe The canals make it fun to meander around but the coffee shops also offer a unique atmosphere and a good coffee shop can make me run miles There are a lot places you can go to Dam square with the monument and the palace and its beautiful floor Rijksmuseum the national museum Begijnhof the nice inner courtyard in the center of Amsterdam Westerkerk along with the gay monument and the Anne Frank house Now getting back to wandering around the canals provide you tons of cafes boutiques restaurants flower shops and what not Hiring bikes is super easy here and it s an experience meandering around on it watching the beautiful city People are nice and non judgemental for the most part too as long as you don t vendalize their lovely city
