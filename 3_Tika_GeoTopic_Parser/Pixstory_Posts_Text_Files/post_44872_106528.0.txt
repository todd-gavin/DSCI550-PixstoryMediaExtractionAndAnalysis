After a successful season in the Eredivisie, the 20-year-old will make the long-awaited move to
the Bavarian giants. After revealing in an interview that he will join Bayern Munich from Ajax
next season, Ryan Gravenberch has confirmed he has signed with the Bundesliga winners.

Though Bayern is yet to confirm the signing, the 20-year-old has long been linked with a move
to the Allianz Arena and has finally confirmed his decision. The Bavarian club is expected to pay
a set fee of €18 million plus €5.5 million in possible add-ons to recruit the midfielder, with Ajax
also allegedly securing a 7.5 percent sell-on clause.

The 20-year-old midfielder from the Netherlands told Bild:

"Bayern is a big club. I think you have to win big titles here. And that is also what I expect for
myself. I'm happy to be here in Munich now."

This Bayern Munich team might be completely overhauled. Recently, consistency has been key
to their success, but it's time to bring in some new blood. We've seen it work before with players
like Jamal Musiala and Serge Gnabry.

Older statesmen like Manuel Neuer, Robert
Lewandowski, and Thomas Muller, on the other hand, will be difficult to replace.

Musiala has been required to play a variety of midfield positions, which he has done admirably
and passed with flying colours. In Bavaria, though, the park's central area needs to be
revitalised. Ryan Gravenberch is the new kid on the block.

Ryan Gravenberch, 20, is making his first major transfer outside of the Netherlands. Young
footballers are frequently put under far too much pressure to hit the ground running, as if
transferring to a foreign nation isn't challenging enough. He'll be given the time he needs to
acclimate at Bayern, and he'll undoubtedly remain in charge of the midfield for years to come.
