For years, land allotments and real estate deals in Noida have been mired in various controversies. The Performance Audit Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) of India on Land Acquisition and Allotment of Properties in Noida laid on the floor of the Legislative Assembly of UP in December 2021 is the first Audit report of the C&AG since the jurisdiction of the audit of Noida and three other development authorities were entrusted to the C&AG in July 2017.

However, a veil has been drawn over the report, which is the first authoritative report on the functioning of the Noida Authority. In spite of repeated requests, the jurisdiction of the audit of the Noida Authority was not accorded by the previous governments. It was the Yogi 1.0 government that finally decided to entrust the jurisdiction of audit of the Noida Authority to the C&AG as per the constitutional requirement in July 2017. Therefore, in the public interest, the UP government is expected to take corrective measures and prompt action on the exhaustive 461 pages audit report.

The C&AG Audit report has highlighted widespread corruption, undue favouritism to private firms, arbitrariness, collusion between officials and builders in the functioning of the Noida Authority in the allotment of plots during the period 2005-2018, leading to losses to the tune of tens of thousands of crores of rupees to the Noida Authority / Government, besides causing distress and despair to lakhs of homebuyers.

The period of the audit covered 2005-06 to 2017-18, i.e., the regime of four Chief Ministers – Mulayam Singh Yadav (2005-2007), Mayawati (2007-2012), Akhilesh Yadav (2012-2017) and Yogi Adityanath (2017-2018) – shows that the land and real estate mafia has been operating with impunity during the reign of all these different governments in UP.
