School friendships are so precious and lovely truly one of a kind you will experience There is the essence of childhood innocence mingled in even as you change and grow You share everything be it food homework or secrets I ve shared memorable moments with these friends in the last ten years be it jokes shared in breaks or stress before an exam We have always stuck together And now we all are saying our farewells Saying farewells to those people you met everyday is a rather arduous task The fact that you will not come across them everyday stings But it must be accepted as each of us embark on a new journey and traverse different paths leaving the city and going to College So we reunited today for the last time and celebrated the new journeys that awaits all of us
