How did you spend the Fourth of July Most likely it was far superior to Melania Trump s We all have our likes and dislikes when it comes to public figures While it may be okay to criticise them for their actions in a healthy way crossing the line to misbehave with them uninstigated is just a reflection of what kind of person you are The Daily Mail reported that when the former first lady exited Trump Tower on Saturday morning for her holiday weekend she was heckled in New York City Leaving her husband s Fifth Avenue building and returning to the Trumps Bedminster golf resort in New Jersey where the former first family spends their summers Melania was captured on camera Tourists paused to marvel as they observed a flurry of activity outside Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan at the coveted Fifth Avenue address As she boarded one of the waiting SUVs Melania who has maintained a fairly low profile since since her husband left office in January seemed anxious Some people yelled abusive comments towards her as she walked past the crowd to get into her car Then yesterday Melania tweeted a th of July message that said Our American Dream is built on the principles of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness as expressed in the Declaration of Independence Together on this historic day let s salute the brave men women who have fought to establish and preserve our freedom Like her or not but this kind of behaviour is not okay
