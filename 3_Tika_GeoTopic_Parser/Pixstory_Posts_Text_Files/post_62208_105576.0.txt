In the previous articles, I have discussed at length about the fundamentals of Meditation. Now it's time we actually start talking about how to actually meditate. 

First things first, find a comfortable spot where you can sit daily, that has plenty of fresh air and minimum light. Fresh air, so that you don't feel restless, and minimal light so that you don't feel any unnecessary strain on your eyes while meditating. 

If you have any back issues, you may find a spot by the wall, so that you can have proper back support. 

A proper posture is must for meditating, however as you progress through meditation, your body might not hold the posture as it begins to relax, and it is perfectly normal. 

Next up is breathing, the breathing is the anchor that will calm the ship of your connection thoughts in the brain. At the beginning your breaths should be long and deep. As the meditation progresses the breaths will be far and few. 

And the last and the most essential part of meditation is the thoughts that occur during the meditation. People often complain that they have too many thoughts during meditation, and that is acceptable. One should accept these thoughts and move on. Just bear witness to these thoughts and accept them as situations that are independent of you and do not react to it. 

These are the steps of how to meditate that we must observe and follow.
