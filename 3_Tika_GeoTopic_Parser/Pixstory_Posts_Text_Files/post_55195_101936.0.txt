Did you know that Australia is home to the largest eco-system in the world?

The Great Barrier Reef, which is made up of approximately 2,500 distinct reefs and visible from space, is Australia's pride and delight. It stretches halfway down the country's eastern coast, so there are lots of spots to utilise as launching pads for exploring the colourful coral. 

As per TN, Cairns is the most well-known location for starting a trip to the reef, although Townsville, Port Douglas, and Airlie Beach all have beautiful beaches and provide a variety of tours to take you out to see the reef. Snorkeling and diving among the colourful fish and turtles that call the Great Barrier Reef home is a must-do on any vacation to Australia.
