I possess a deep affection for Mumbai a city that never sleeps I ve lived here since childhood I love every part of the city except for its traffic However I would like to see some changes in Mumbai Even the shortest route takes hours due to traffic Puddles damaged roads and faulty traffic control systems are just a few of the possible reasons for traffic slowdowns It may be difficult to eliminate traffic overnight but it may be lessened through consistent effort and smart traffic engineering Every commuter who is not from Mumbai says Too much traffic how do you even drive As they are able to drive much faster and easier on their city town roads nbsp Some even find it challenging to drive on Mumbai streets as they ve never observed such congested roads I think this is the most common complain heard about mumbai as i think it is the only problem nbsp
