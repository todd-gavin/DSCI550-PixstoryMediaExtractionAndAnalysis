In Between Mars and Venus Greta Cominelli goes on a journey of self-discovery by analyzing the contrasts that coexist within each of us. The title of the EP brings together two opposite components that find balance and harmony in their complementarity if Mars represents passion, concreteness and masculinity Venus, on the other hand, is a symbol of empathy, beauty, love and femininity. I let various and conflicting energies, stories, inspirations and emotions traced within me intertwine like threads aimed at composing the plots of song lyrics and become contaminated with soft and light, warm, percussive and incisive exotic sounds from from near and far cultures says Greta Cominelli I wanted to recreate atmospheres with bright and energetic tones but also intimate and dense at the same time talking about female emancipation love social prejudices toxic relationships and the relationship with ourselves Between Mars and Venus which contains passages written by the same Greta enhanced by the guitar and backing vocals of the musician Renato Caruso who is also the composer. The EP was recorded and mixed at the PDT Studio MusicLab in Seregno by the producer, arranger and multi-instrumentalist Paolo Diotti and mastered by Roberto Romano at the Os Mastering Studio in Latina
