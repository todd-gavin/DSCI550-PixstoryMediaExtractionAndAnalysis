Atalanta drop important points at the Mapei Stadium in Reggio Emilia The players from Bergamo evidently weighed down by cup efforts are unable to reverse the negative trend in the league and fall again The Nerazzurri appeared tired, lacking ideas and at the mercy of their opponents Let&#39;s see in this regard the statistics of the match trying to understand what the problems were for Gasperini&#39;s men Sassuolo Ball possession Shots on goal Shots blocked Offside Corner Cross Dribbling Fouls drawn Yellow cards Atalanta Ball possession Shots on goal Shots blocked Offside Corner Cross Dribbling Fouls drawn Yellow cards Atalanta did not manages to get up after Traore&#39;s initial goal and capitulates in the second half Muriel&#39;s goal in the final minutes is useless Few shots on goal by the guests and just as many rejected while the hosts manage to capitalize on the shots directed towards the defense goal from Sportiello The ball possession on the contrary is more or less balanced But even in this case the pointer of the balance leans more towards the black and greens The players from Bergamo try to exploit the outside lanes to undermine the home defense well set up by Dionisi but good crosses do not lead nothing Even the many total dribblings are all smoke and nothing. As far as refereeing is concerned, the doubt remains of the hand touch in the Sassuolo area that Sacchi does not even go to review. If Atalanta wants to continue its path in the European cups, it must give itself a move because this is the worst streak of results for a big name in Italian football
