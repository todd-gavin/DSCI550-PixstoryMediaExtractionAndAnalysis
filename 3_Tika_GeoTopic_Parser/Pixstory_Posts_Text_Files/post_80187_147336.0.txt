1. Indulge in self care- Follow your skin care routine that you have been missing for days.Plan your meals try doing it on a sheet in advance so that when you are in rush and busy you don’t binge on junk food. This way you will be occupied in self pampering and be away from your screens. 

2. Spend time with your loved ones- Caught up in the unrealistic expectations of the series we often forget to spend time with our grandparents and loved ones missing out on real moments. Share your day’s experience with them or talk about childhood memories. The smile on their face after getting your time is just precious.

3. Exercise or spend sometime in nature- Scrolling miles with your thumb but not walking them isn’t good for your well being. Give your body the serotonin. Soak in the sun. Meet your friends, play a game with them.

4. Pursue your hobbies: Do what you actually love whether it’s painting, cooking or dancing. Trust me you won’t remember your laptop or your phone. 

5. Reward yourself: Set goals daily like today’s screen time will be just 3 hours and if you achieve your target treat yourself generously. 

6. Set time limit on your apps 

7. Have no phone zones especially in bedrooms as blue lights from phone interferes with quality sleep. Every time you exceed time limits or enter with phone in zones ; fine yourself with desired amount and collect in jar. You could later use that money for charity or a good deed✨
