Arsenal have announced that 25-year old Ainsley Maitland-Niles will be joining Southampton FC on a season long loan deal. The Englishman agreed to a one year contract extension that expires next summer before leaving on loan. Now the Gunners have the option of not letting him go for free if Southampton wish to acquire his permanent services.
Maitland-Niles had joined the youth academy of Arsenal when he was just six years old. He rose through the ranks before making his professional debut for the club under manager Arsene Wenger. He was just 17 at the time, having just signed his first professional contract. 
He spent a year out on loan in the 2015-16 season to Ipswich Town before returning to the Emirates Stadium. His impressive performances ensured that he went on to represent England on all levels starting from U-17s to the senior side. He has 5 international caps to go with 84 appearances in the Premier League.
The 2017 U-20 World Cup winner was a recipient of major honors with Arsenal. He won the FA Community Shield in 2017 and 2020 and most notably started in the FA Cup Final winning tie against Chelsea in 2020. Incidentally he was also loaned out for the last six months of last season to AS Roma. There he was able to add to his accolades, winning the first ever UEFA Europa Conference League under Jose Mourinho.
Apart from Southampton there was major interest from other clubs like Newcastle United and Crystal Palace. But Maitland-Niles opted to go to St. Mary’s to become the club’s seventh summer signing. Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhüttl said: “Ainsley is at a good point in his career, with a lot of experience already, but he is also still a player with potential, and he is someone who can definitely help us."
He will bring a lot of versatility to the squad as he has transitioned himself from a proper central midfielder to a full back in recent years.
