Alive and kicking, Dead Island 2 is back from the grave and will release next year on February 3 and will be available on PC, PS4, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. A new listing for the Deep Silver-published game has appeared on Amazon, including screenshots and a since-deleted description of the long-awaited sequel to its 2011 zombie killing FPS multiplayer predecessor.
Set in Los Angeles, Dead Island 2 will include six playable characters. Players will be able to customize the abilities of each playable character, using a skill system to create different builds. There'll also be several varieties of zombies to bash through, spanning “dozens of distinct zombie types, each with their own mutations, attacks and hundreds of LA-themed variants''.
The  official description of the game reads: “A deadly virus is spreading across Los Angeles, California, turning its inhabitants into ravenous zombies. The city is in quarantine and the military have retreated. Bitten, infected, but more than just immune, you learn to harness the zombie inside. Only you, and the handful of other swaggering fellows who happen to be resistant to the pathogen, hold the future of LA (and humanity), in the balance. As you uncover the truth behind the outbreak you’ll discover who – or what – you are. Survive, evolve, save the world – just another day in LA! The much-loved zombie saga is back with a unique formula of horror, dark humor and over the top zombie-slaying, spanning an epic pulp adventure. Dead Island 2 is a thrilling First-Person Action RPG that takes players across a brand-new playground. Stylish, vibrant and flooded with zombie infection, explore iconic, gore-drenched Los Angeles. Meet larger-than-life characters. Slay countless foes in exquisitely bloody detail. And evolve to become the ultimate Zombie Slayer. See you in HELL-A!”
