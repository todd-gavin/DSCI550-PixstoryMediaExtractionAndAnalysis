Anacondas are one of the most dangerous snakes in the world, and they're known for their huge size and strength, and well, the movies. Here are six interesting facts about anacondas that you might not have known:
1. Anacondas can grow up to 30 feet long and weigh over 550 pounds! In fact the largest anaconda to have been found was 33 feet long! Maybe not as much as the movies, but these things are MASSIVE!
2. They have a thick skin that helps them survive in cold climates, as well as a non-venomous bite which is however deadly. They seize their victim with their powerful teeth, smother it with their powerful bodies, and then consume it whole. In fact a green anaconda is capable of eating a human, even though it would be unlikely.
3. They live in tropical jungles throughout South America and Africa, where they hunt mammals like deer and capybaras.
4. Baby anacondas, and I mean the new borns, are almost 2 feet long. Sometimes longer. Anacondas are one of those snakes that do not lay eggs but give birth.
5. Their thick skin also makes them very difficult to capture or keep alive, which is why they're considered one of the most dangerous snakes in the world!
6. Anacondas are efficient swimmers and can reach a speed of about 10 mph in water. On land, they can move at about 5 mph.
