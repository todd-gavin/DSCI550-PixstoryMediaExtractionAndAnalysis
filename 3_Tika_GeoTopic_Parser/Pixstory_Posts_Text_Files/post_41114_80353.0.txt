The motive of Black History Month, which is celebrated in February is to raise awareness and draw attention to the history of black people. 

Now, more than ever, in the wake of increasingly racially intolerant attitude, it is crucial that white people play their role in this movement. 

When it comes to racism, it is a well known fact that white people are and always will speaking from a place of privilege. So how can they help without taking the attention away from black voices?

1) Amplify black voices 
Black people do not need white people to be their voice or fight their battles. They already have a voice and they are best suited to talk about their issues and racism in the country because they face it directly. Racism affects them financially, economically, socially and emotionally. 
Amplifying their voices means giving them appropriate platform to voice their concerns and spreading the word for the same. 

2) Supporting Black business owners and creators 
More often than not, due to prevalent racism, black people suffer economically. To counter this, one can make sure to promote the business/content which is run by them. If one is capable, donating to not for profit organisations that support the cause is a good idea. 

3) Calling out racism 
It is not enough to be aware of racism, one has to actively take steps to eradicate it. While some institutional reforms are much needed, small steps made by white people can make a big difference. For example: call out your fellow white people when they are being racist. Raise your voice against any racist policy your workplace may have. 
Talk to your black friends and let them know that you see them and hear them.
