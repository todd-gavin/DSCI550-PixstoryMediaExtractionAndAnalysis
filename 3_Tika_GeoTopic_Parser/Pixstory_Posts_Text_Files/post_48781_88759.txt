Toxic masculinity defined as the belief that there is only one way to be a man strong harsh unfeeling and aggressive is a two edged sword It hurts boys and men who don t live up to gendered expectations of who they should Toxic masculinity is always a losing game because gender standards are a target that no one can strike no matter how hard they try What if that void is filled by a need to demonstrate his dominance What happens if that need is proven by being violent to those they deem inferior Gender expectations and restrictions are put on children at such a young age that they begin to scrutinize and police their behaviour and by extension others according to Dr Finn Mackay Boys coming from these environments are taught to judge other boys who do not conform to not being like a girl and grow up feeling entitled to deciding for women around them And when those women don t listen to it they retaliate with aggression and passive aggression From micro aggressions like casual sexism to violent crimes like murders and rapes Dr Mackay further explains It is important to remember that there is no biological reason why boys should not play with dolls or wear dresses There is no biological reason for boys to like cars diggers or guns In contrast there is a biological reason for boys to cry it s called human expression and development It s time for educators to separate sex from gender and discuss how this distorted form of cultural masculinity rather than biological maleness contributes to violence in our classrooms halls workplaces and sanctuaries We can start working toward answers once we change the conversation away from sex and biology and toward gender and culture Students can be empowered to realise the limits and falsehoods of society gender standards by having honest conversations about the hazards of toxic masculinity Films like Tough Guise and The Mask You Live In can be used as resources to bring these lessons into our classrooms These films are appropriate for most secondary schools and come with educational materials that can really engage students
