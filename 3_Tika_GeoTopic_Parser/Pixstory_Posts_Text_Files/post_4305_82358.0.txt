Did you know of Bessie Coleman? She was an early American civil aviator and the first African-American woman and first Native American to hold a pilot license. Bessie grew up helping her mother pick cotton and wash laundry to earn extra money. She grew up in Atlanta, Texas where at least nine black men were lynched between 1890 and 1920. She grew up in a cruel world of poverty and discrimination. At 23 she moved to Chicago in hopes of making something of her life. Her desire was to fly but but she was not afforded that opportunity in the US because of her race and gender. Luckily there was an opportunity for her in France to pursue her her dream of flying. She then earned her license from the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale on June 15, 1921, and was the first Black person to earn an international pilot's license. Known for performing flying tricks, Coleman’s nicknames were; “Brave Bessie,” “Queen Bess,” and “The Only Race Aviatrix in the World.” She wanted to encourage women and African Americans to reach their dreams. Unfortunately, her career ended with a tragic plane crash, but her life continues to inspire people around the world.
