Senate Republicans are contemplating whether to block or allow the bill to codify the federal protections for same-sex marriage. 
In the midterms, the Democrats plan to portray the Republicans as barbarians and this discussion hence is crucial for the Republicans to show whether they stand with progress or not. 

Some GOP strategists want the party to move past the problem by codifying protections, but that risks concerning the cultural conservatives, which make up a substantial portion of the party's base. A Gallup poll released last month found that most Americans — 71 percent — favor legal same-sex marriage.

“The issue puts Republicans in an awkward spot," said Jack Pitney, a professor of political science at Claremont McKenna College. "Most Americans support same-sex marriage. Even a majority of self-identified Republicans support it. But evangelicals represent a huge share of GOP activists, and they still oppose it.
“More broadly, Republican activists dislike the idea of giving the Democrats a win — even on an issue where there is consensus in the general public,” he said.

When a group of people feels violated without even recognizing their rights; the lawmakers need time to think about it seems. This is the 21st century with lawmakers having no sex education or the basic idea of equality. They are showing patriarchal ideals by limiting freedom and making decisions for women!
