I used to avoid wearing baggy jeans as I am too skinny and I didn't find them that pleasing on my body but once you start wearing them there is no going back.🤭🫶🏻🥹
I once tried to pair it up with a white shirt and it really turned out to be a great fit. 🤩
Baggy jeans are way too comfortable that I can wear them anyday over anything else.🌼😋
