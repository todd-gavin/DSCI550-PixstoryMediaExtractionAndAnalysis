A report titled “I’m a Prisoner Here” released on Thursday by rights advocacy organization Human Rights First, traces how the rights of LGBTQI+ folks in ICE custody have been violated through systemic harassment and violence under the Biden Administration.

The high risk of violence, discrimination and medical neglicence experienced by transgender people has resulted in multiple deaths and LGBTQI+ asylum seekers are 97 times more at risk to be sexually assaulted than the general population, studies find. 

Despite committing to protect LGBTQI+ folks, the Biden administration has continued to detain those seeking protection at the border: “As the Biden administration ends the illegal Title 42 expulsion policy, it should not perpetuate the cruel and unnecessary use of detention against people seeking refuge in this country. The government has legal authority to parole asylum-seekers and other immigrants. Its choice to detain them instead endangers lives, separates families, inflicts trauma, wastes resources and punishes people for exercising their legal right to request asylum,” Rebecca Gendelman, associate attorney for Refugee Protection research at Human Rights First, said in a statement.

Some findings from the report:

- A Honduran transgender asylum seeker was detained for two months despite being granted exemption to the Title 42 policy, and was harrassed by ICE officers, who debated their identity through the medicalization of transness when they asked for gender-affirming care.

- A Mexican transgender man reported that in August 2021, a guard pointed at him and said, “How many of them are there? That’s not a real man.” Guards intentionally called him “ma’am” and “girl” and used incorrect pronouns despite his repeated attempts to correct them. He described his experience in detention to Human Rights First: “It made me feel bad, like I’m not my own person. I’m not an animal. I felt singled out. What’s different about me?”
