Cooking is one of the skills I developed during lockdown in 2020 and after taht there is no going back. I'm obsessed with the food I cook everytime. Not only me but everyone around me is obsessed with the food I cook. 
Started my cooking with Halwa and Chana and now I can cook each and everytime. I cooked halwa chana because my result was declared. And everyone in the family loved it and for many months I only cooked these 2 things and nothing else but then I tried to cook different items and then from simple food to Chola bhatura. ItÂ  felt like I'm a pro.
