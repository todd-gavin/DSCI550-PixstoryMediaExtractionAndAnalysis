Spain will look to continue their fine form as they face Czech Republic at the Sinobo Stadium for their League A Group 2 UEFA Nations League clash. 

While Czech Republic failed to qualify for the World Cup once again, they can celebrate gaining promotion to the highest division of the Nations League and victory against Switzerland last time out. 

Conceding late to Portugal has seen Spain drop points in their last outing. However, La Roja are in flying form and they should have their eyes on the 3 points in their next match. 

Spain have scored in all of their last 15 appearances, and are yet to keep a cleansheet away from home. Consider this match to be an attacking one.

Czech Republic vs Spain: Probable Playing XI

Czech Republic: Tomas Vaclik (GK); Vaclav Jemelka, Jakub Brabec, David Zima; Vladimir Coufal, Tomas Soucek, Michal Sadilek, Jaroslav Zeleny; Jakub Jankto, Adam Hlozek; Jan Kuchta

Spain: Unai Simon (GK); Cesar Azpilicueta, Eric Garcia, Pau Torres, Jordi Alba; Sergio Busquets, Koke, Dani Olmo; Pablo Sarabia, Alvaro Morata, Ferran Torres

Czech Republic vs Spain: Predictions

Czech Republic seem unable to beat Spain no matter what, with being goalless in the four of their last five outings. Czech Republic is yet to win against Spain, and their fortunes do not seem to be changing anytime soon. 

Prediction: Czech Republic 0 - 2 Spain
