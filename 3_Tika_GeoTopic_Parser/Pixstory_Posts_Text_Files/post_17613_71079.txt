Around half an hour after the Lakers were finished getting blown out by the Denver Nuggets on Saturday night Magic Johnson decided he had seen enough and seemingly turned to the woman who follows him around and sends his tweets for him and gave her an instruction That it was time to blast this team for quitting on the job with no warning and leaving Lakers governor Jeanie Buss out to dry Johnson hasn t often criticized the team publicly since he quit his job as Lakers president of basketball operations but it s clear that he s not happy with the way the Lakers are heading or how they did the basketball version of telling the media they were quitting without letting the team owner know first on Saturday And hey he d know better than anyone how messed up that is Russell Westbrook the only player who had a chance to respond to Johnson s tweet after the loss said I do not have a reaction when queried about Johnson s analysis Everybody s entitled in this world to their opinion regardless of what that is You can either take it and run with it or take it and put it in one ear and out the other or you can not respond to it Magic s entitled to his opinion and he s not here every day He s not around us every day He s not aware kind of what s going on internally with us and trying to figure things out Westbrook said Like I said everybody in this world is entitled to their opinion
