Bollywood actor Ajay Devgn and South star Kiccha Sudeep’s recent tweets, wherein the former stated Hindi is the national language of India, after the latter’s speech stating it is not, have blown out of proportions and sparked a language row in the country.

Kangana Ranaut addressed the heating debate, by acknowledging the fact that India is a diverse nation. “We (system and society) are a country of a lot of diversities, languages, and cultures. And it is our birthright to feel proud of our respective culture and language. I am a Pahadi. However, when we consider our nation, in order to make it one unit, we need a thread to connect all of us together. When the constitution was made, Hindi became a national language,” Kangana shares.

She adds, “And now when you say Tamil is actually older than Hindi, it should be noted that Sanskrit is older than that. In my opinion, Sanskrit should be our national language, because Kannada, Tamil, Gujarati, Hindi, all these languages originated from Sanskrit. I do not have the answer if you ask me if so, why Sanskrit wasn’t made our national language instead of Hindi. Those decisions would have been made during a certain time. There are a lot of layers to this issue. And when you are talking about language, you should be aware of all these layers. When you deny Hindi, you are denying the constitution and the government of Delhi.”
