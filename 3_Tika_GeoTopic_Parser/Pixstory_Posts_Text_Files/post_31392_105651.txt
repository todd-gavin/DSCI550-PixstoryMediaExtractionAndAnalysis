If an employment contract is written on the employment contract, we do not have any qualification problems, the parties have declared that the employment contract is of a subordinate nature. But if the parties have written an independent employment contract, we must stop at the declaration of the parties. If we stop from the declaration of the parties we should automatically deduce that the parties are able to qualify the relationship as self-employed and therefore to be able to voluntarily withdraw from the mandatory discipline of the employment contract I write self-employment contract problem solved the discipline of subordinate work does not apply to me But we have said that the discipline of subordinate work is mandatory the parties can therefore qualify the employment relationship as self-employed if they could do so that discipline would no longer be mandatory but could be freely waived by the parties So the first problem we are faced with is the value of the willingness formally declared by the parties In labor law the willingness declared by the parties on the nature of the relationship has a residual residual value, this means that the willingness declared by the parties will only have qualifying effectiveness if it is consistent with the material development of the relationship carried out according to the subordinate employment relationship, the mandatory regulation of subordinate work will apply which, being mandatory, will prevail over the formal declaration of the parties. Returning to our previous example, therefore, if we have signed a self-employment contract but then subordinate form the mandatory discipline of labor law will apply that contract will be qualified as subordinate and therefore will pass the formal declaration of the parties
