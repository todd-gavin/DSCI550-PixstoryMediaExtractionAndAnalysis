Cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, is a common form of talk therapy. Unlike some other therapies, CBT is typically intended as a short-term treatment, taking anywhere from a few weeks to a few months to see results.

Although the past is certainly relevant, CBT focuses on providing you with tools to solve your current problems. And there a lot of ways to get there with this type of therapy.

Here’s a look at some of the techniques used in CBT, what types of issues they address, and what to expect with CBT.

What techniques are used with CBT? 

The key principle behind CBT is that your thought patterns affect your emotions, which, in turn, can affect your behaviors.

For instance, CBT highlights how negative thoughts can lead to negative feelings and actions. But, if you reframe your thoughts in a more positive way, it can lead to more positive feelings and helpful behaviors.

Your therapist will teach you how to make changes you can implement right now. These are skills you can continue to use for the rest of your life.

Depending on the issue you’re dealing with and your goals, there are several ways to approach CBT. Whatever approach your therapist takes, it will include:

identifying specific problems or issues in your daily life
becoming aware of unproductive thought patterns and how they can impact your life
identifying negative thinking and reshaping it in a way that changes how you feel
learning new behaviors and putting them into practice
After speaking with you and learning more about the issue you want help with, your therapist will decide on the best CBT strategies to use.

Some of the techniques that are most often used with CBT include the following 9 strategies:
