If Steven Spielberg s Jurassic Park was an incredible dinner feast you had at a Friday night party then the Jurassic World Dominion is the heated leftovers of the same dinner the morning after Hollywood has realised that nostalgia is a profitable commodity But sequels often succumb to being a generic forgettable clone of the originals That is the biggest problem of Colin Trevorrow s Jurassic World Dominion It feels like the reheated leftovers of Steven Spielberg s Jurassic Park Sure it will satisfy your hunger if you don t have anything else to consume However it just doesn t taste the same Jurassic World Dominion opens with a montage of news reports delving into how the world has changed since the dinosaurs were unleashed Claire Dearing Bryce Dallas Howard has come a long way from managing Jurassic World to being an advocate for dinosaur protection The film also has a corporate thriller story going on parallel to this Here the eccentric Biosyn CEO Lewis Dodgson Campbell Scott presents the necessary antagonistic force orchestrating not only the locust disaster but also the kidnapping of Maisie and the raptor baby The story is ambitious in its intentions but its execution simply delivers a very superficial treatment of all the themes The plotting is weak since the story attempts to cover a lot of things and ends up stretching itself too thin There is no enduring depth to any of the narratives going on in Jurassic World Dominion The film completely ignores the long drawn out terrifying elements of Jurassic Park Instead it bombards the audience with one dinosaur chase fight sequence after another in quick succession As a result none of the dinosaurs feel truly magical or even terrifying That is a huge let down considering that Spielberg managed to evoke a sense of true wonder and dread with his dinosaurs The story of Jurassic World Dominion seems to affect the performances of the actors as well Sam Neil looks confused and embarrassed for the most of the time to be part of this ludicrous band wagon Chris Pratt seems to repeat what he mostly does in almost every movie that he is in
