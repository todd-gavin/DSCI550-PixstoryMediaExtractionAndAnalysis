NASA on Monday issued a statement warning about a large asteroid that is travelling toward planet Earth in yet another threat. But the question is, will the asteroid affect our planet in any manner, or will it simply pass by without causing any problems? As per news reports, asteroid 22 RQ is already travelling toward Earth at an incredible speed of 49,536 miles per hour and will miss the globe on September 13. The asteroid will be 3.7 million kilometres away from Earth when it makes its closest approach, according to NASA. The Planetary Defense Coordination Office of NASA forewarned us that Asteroid 22 RQ, which is 84 feet broad, is about the same size as an aircraft. According to the-sky.org, Asteroid 22 RQ was discovered on September 1, 2022, and belongs to the main Apollo group of asteroids. The asteroids farthest from the sun are around 328 million kilometres and the nearest point to the sun is 110 million kilometres.
