A Democratic group says it filed a complaint Monday with the Federal Election Commission alleging that former President Donald Trump is breaking federal law by raising and spending big sums to promote a likely presidential campaign in without formally declaring his candidacy The group American Bridge cites Trump s statements to argue that he is running for the presidency while skirting federal campaign finance laws that require that those who raise or spend more than to register as a candidate Candidates also are barred from coordinating their activities with super PACs Among the statements highlighted by the Democrat group Trump s comments last month to the Conservative Political Action Conference that appeared to allude to a third presidential bid We did it twice and we ll do it again we re going to do it a third time Trump told attendees the group said in its filings And last fall American Bridge noted Trump said this when asked about his plans I know what I m going to do but we re not supposed to be talking about it yet from the standpoint of campaign finance laws It s not clear that the FEC which often deadlocks along partisan lines will take any action in this case The agency moves at a slow pace often rendering judgment years after a complaint is first lodged Trump s network of political groups started the year with million in cash reserves an unheard of sum for an ex President And American Bridge noted that his leadership PAC Save America has spent heavily pumping as much as a week into Facebook advertising In a statement Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich said the complaint had zero merit Our country is spiraling into disaster because of the Democrats failures and instead of reversing course to provided needed relief to American families they are busy filing frivolous complaints that have zero merit Budowich said in an email The Democrat Party has become a dumpster fire that s void of solutions and substance all they have is cheap gimmicks Adav Noti vice president and legal director of the Campaign Legal Center watchdog group said the FEC should investigate Story credit CNN
