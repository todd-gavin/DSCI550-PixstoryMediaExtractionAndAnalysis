A day in my life starts with practice and ends with practice. I get up at 5 in the morning and have one practice session. After this, I go to work from 10 AM-2 PM. I work as a postal assistant in the Department of Post, Government of India. After work, I go back and train with my coaches. This is the time for working on my skills, be it bowling or batting. I believe this relentless practice has greatly impacted the way I perform. When I started playing, I could barely bowl with spikes. But it is because of this training that I can now perform with spikes. When I entered cricket, I didn’t know anyone from a sports background. I did not have an insider who could give me advice as to what should be done. My coaches, who were the only people with cricket knowledge instilled one lesson in me that I will always carry forever- practice and only practice can make you the best player. So if you ask me what my mantra for performing is, I would say Practice. Practice and Practice.

While I understand that there are certain pressures that come with playing for your country or state, you should never let that get to your head. Your first priority at all times should only be to better your game through practice. Something that is just as important to me practice is rest. Burning out doesn’t get you far. So while practicing, stick to the routine. But the moment practice is done, relax because this gives you the energy needed to keep pushing. I take some much needed breaks from my routine. I play indoor football with my friends during some of my breaks as it helps me enjoy and relax. While I love my routine, the breaks are just as essential.
