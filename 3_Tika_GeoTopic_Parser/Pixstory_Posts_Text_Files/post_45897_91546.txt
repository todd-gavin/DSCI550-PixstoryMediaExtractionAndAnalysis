Religion is a beautiful thing For many it is the guiding light of life It gives people faith which helps them through the struggles of life However in my opinion religion does not give right to dictate or judge anyone s personal preferences Premarital sex is one of them I am not saying weather you should engage in premarital sex or not I am merely saying it is not your place to judge anyone Sex is only wrong when there is lack of consent from either parties What two adults do is not anyone s or even Church s business Moreover the most important message of the Bible is Love One Another Sex is nothing but an express of that love So why do people raise a finger at it If we would be so agitated whenever a woman or a man was raped maybe our country would be a better place Furthermore not all people intend to marry Some do not believe in the institution of marriage altogether and they are free to do so What about them Adults are more than capable of making their own decisions and when and with whom to have sex with is one of them Therefore according to me people should practice the art of tolerance above all Live and let live
