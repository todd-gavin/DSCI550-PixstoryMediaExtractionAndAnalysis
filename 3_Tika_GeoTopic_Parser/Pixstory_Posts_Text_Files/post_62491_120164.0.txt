The first thing is always avoid one. Do not go swimming in shark infested water. Do not swim near fishing boats. Never do that. A swamp of sharks or other predatory fish is likely to be near fishing boats looking for their next meal. However, if you do find yourself in that position, swim vertically towards the shore, never horizontally. Make yourself look small so that the shark is not interested in you. Take some breaks, avoid attention.

If a shark does find you, remember to go still. It's not necessary that the shark is attacking you, they could only be curious. Keep your lower parts as immobile as possible. Outside of the water though, wave your arms and shout for help. Scream something like "Shark attack!"

Now, what if a shark attack actually takes place? Defend yourself! Scratch at their eyes or gills, they're the most sensitive parts of a shark's body. Make sure to keep your hand and head our of it's mouth. Keep hurting it. Once it realizes you're not an easy prey, it'll leave.
