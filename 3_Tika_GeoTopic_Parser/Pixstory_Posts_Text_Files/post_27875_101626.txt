From this point of view too, things seem to have definitely improved and Charles&#39; times but also those of his teammate Carlos Sainz in tenths seems to dispel the clouds that had gathered in FP over the Maranello garage, at least on paper. But apart from Leclerc&#39;s best time, it must be said that great balance reigns this weekend Max Verstappen second by thousandths behind from the rival for the title with the two Mercedes who finally seem able to fight George Russell third with Lewis Hamilton immediately behind him In general the first four of the standings of these PLs are enclosed in just thousandths of a second A trifle Fifth time for Sainz who had to replace the frame overnight as a precaution after a problem with the tank The top is closed Perez Norris Magnussen Bottas and Ocon Instagram photo scuderiaferrari
