As per Hollywood Reporter, Marvel Studios may have once again whipped the fans at Comic-Con’s Hall H into a mind-melting fervor by laying out a timeline of movies and shows until the close of 2025, but there was no time for a victory lap or even a breather. 

Multiverse sagas don’t build themselves, you know? So the day after Comic-Con wrapped, Marvel head Kevin Feige was bound for the sets of projects currently shooting, including season two of multi-Emmy-nominated series Loki and additional photography on The Marvels, both due out in summer 2023.

The company, which is in prep to begin shooting Blade in Atlanta in October and will release Black Panther: Wakanda Forever in November, is now setting up the generals to implement the plans across its giant chessboard. Destin Daniel Cretton, who helmed Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings for the studio, has been enlisted to helm Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, one of two Avengers movies that will help close out Phase 6 in 2025.
