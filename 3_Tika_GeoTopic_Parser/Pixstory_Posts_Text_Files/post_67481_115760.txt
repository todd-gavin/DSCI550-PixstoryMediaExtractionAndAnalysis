As the monsoon season washes upon us I find myself yearning for the summer heat In my family and many other Indian families mangoes are synonymous with summer Today I cut the final mango from my favourite season and used it to make this mango yoghurt parfait as a snack Sweet and sour mango cubes are layered with creamy hung curd A sprinkle of homemade granola adds a delightful crunch A single mint leaf completes this appetizing snack I await the next summer when I can enjoy fresh mangoes
