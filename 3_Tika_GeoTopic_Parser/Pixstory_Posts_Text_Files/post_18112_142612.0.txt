Britney Spears is facing backlash for her recent Instagram comments.
Late Monday, the "...Baby One More Time" singer shared her opinions on body image on Instagram, uploading a photo of a remark from comedian Rodney Dangerfield that read: "I discovered there was only one way to look thin: hang out with fat people."
Spears included fellow pop singer Christina Aguilera in her observations in the photo caption, adding, "I wish I could have selected the nannies for my children... my dancers... I mean if I had Christina Aguilera's dancers I would have looked really small... I mean why not talk about it??
 " Spears exclaimed.Â  "The 40-year-old singer additionally made a point to note that she will use her Instagram for self-expression and "will be here talking bout things people NEVER talked about !! By no means did I even mention Christina, look at my post !!! Body shaming to make yourself feel better is not where it's at," while another fan added, "I agree with your caption but sorry Britney, this post itself is very fatphobic.
