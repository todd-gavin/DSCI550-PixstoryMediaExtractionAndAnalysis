Animal breeding, as in selective breeding, did not exist until about the 1700s. Of course, people married their animals with creatures they liked in the neighbourhood. There was no systematic method for selecting animals for reproduction based on predetermined qualities that did not change from mating to mating but remained consistent throughout time. 

The United Kingdom is where animal breeding began in Europe. Sir Robert Bakewell (1725â€“1795) was the first to introduce keeping exact records of animal performance in order to allow objective selection. 

Groen Kennisnet tells us that he employed inbreeding (mating related animals with similar qualities) to fix specific features in animals, as well as progeny testing, which is the method of evaluating the performance of the initial (small) batch of progeny and using that information to select the best father of future progeny. 

He advocated for 'breeding the finest to the best.' The New Leicester sheep was developed by Bakewell from the old Lincolnshire breed. The New Leicester was known for its high-quality fleece and fatty shoulder, both of which were fashionable at the time. Longhorn cattle also grew better and consumed less grain than other cattle, according to Bakewell. 

As a result, he improved it in order to increase the efficiency of meat production. It's incredible that he did this without knowing anything about genetics.
