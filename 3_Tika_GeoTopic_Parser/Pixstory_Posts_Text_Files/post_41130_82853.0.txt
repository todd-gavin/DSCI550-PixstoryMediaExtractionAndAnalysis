New York Post reported that the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation was removed from Amazon's charity platform for failing to declare where tens of millions of dollars in donations it received nearly two years ago went. 

According to an Amazon spokeswoman, the organisation "had to temporarily halt" AmazonSmile today, which donates a part of qualified sales on the online shopping site to charities.

"Nonprofits in each state have their own set of restrictions, and organisations participating in AmazonSmile must follow those rules," the spokesman explained. "Unfortunately, this group has fallen out of compliance with the guidelines in multiple states, so we've had to remove them from the programme temporarily until they can comply." 

Any monies earned for BLMGNF will be held by Amazon "until they're back in compliance," according to the representative. According to AmazonSmile's website, the programme has raised more than $300 million for charities.

According to documents filed with the California attorney general, BLMGNF received more than $65 million in donations from Thousand Currents, a charity that handles the assets of grassroots groups. 

However, the organisation has yet to reveal what it done with the funds. As a result, the authority to collect donations has been withdrawn in various states. The state's Department of Justice informed BLMGNF's executives earlier this month that they would be "personally accountable" for any delinquent costs and fines in California, where the organisation is based.
