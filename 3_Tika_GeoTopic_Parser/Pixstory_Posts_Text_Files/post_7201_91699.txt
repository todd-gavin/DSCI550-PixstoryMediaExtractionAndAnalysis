Down the Memory Lane Continues I requested my youngest brother who happened to be an automobile engineer to guide me through the job He travelled to Hyderabad and made me realise that the organisation was a mess and I was being misled in the periodic maintenance and repair by subordinates There were no standing operating procedures and every repair job was carried in an adhoc manner He also indicated that there appeared to be a huge discrepancy in the stores of the organisation During my inquiry I found that the store was physically audited by an Inspector General of Police a month ago and it was recorded that the stock was physically checked and found to be correct I informed the DG that the organization was in a mess and same was situation with stores I asked permission to do a physical re verification of the stock to which he agreed On his suggestion technical personnel from outside the police department such as from the road transport corporation EME etc were co opted for carrying out physical verification To my surprise we found a shortage of inventory worth lakhs of out of total inventory of lakhs which was an eye opener considering that the physical audit was done only a month back During my inspection I also found that a number of private vehicles were also being repaired in the workshop Unlike police department the staff though called technical police personnel enjoyed all the benefits and allowances entitled to policemen but worked like a private company There were no regular parades and staff wore all types of clothes Hardly anyone reported in prescribed uniform To my surprise I found that number of personnel including some drivers never reported for duties but were drawing their regular salaries On enquiry I was informed that they were deputed to senior officers and politicians I called for regular parade on each Friday like police department To be continued
