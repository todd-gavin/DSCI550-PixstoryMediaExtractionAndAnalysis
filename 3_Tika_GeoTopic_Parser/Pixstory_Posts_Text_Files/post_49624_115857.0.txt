Oath keepers militia,s former spokesperson has given powerful testimony to the House January 6 committee. He told Americans to “quit mincing words and just talk about truths”, and to recognize that Donald Trump attempted to mount “an armed revolution” to stay in power.

“People died that day,” Jason van Tatenhove said. “Law enforcement officers died, and there was a gallows set up in front of the Capitol. This could have been the spark that started a new civil war, and no one would have won there. That would have been good for no one.”

Van Tatenhove appeared at a Tuesday hearing in Washington alongside Stephen Ayres, a former Trump supporter from Ohio who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge related to infiltrating the Capitol on 6 January 2021.

Both of them discussed former allegiances and lessons learned after Congress was raged by a mob that Trump told to “fight like hell” in service of his lie that his defeat by Joe Biden was the result of electoral fraud.

Ayres said his realization Trump lied was akin to having “horse blinders” removed. He also spoke about what his belief had cost him.
Van Tatenhove described efforts by Stewart Rhodes – the Oath Keepers leader now charged with seditious conspiracy – to sharpen his public image.

Rhodes “was always looking for ways to legitimize what he was doing,” Van Tatenhove said, “wrapping it in the trappings of, ‘It’s not a militia, it’s a community preparedness team … an educational outreach group, it’s a veteran support group.’

“But again, we’ve got to stop with this dishonesty and the mincing of words and just call things for what they are. You know it, he’s a militia leader. He had these grand visions of being a paramilitary leader.”

Members of the Oath Keepers provided security to Trump allies around January 6 and entered the Capitol.
