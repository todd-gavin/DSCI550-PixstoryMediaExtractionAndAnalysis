Kenny Omega hadn’t set foot inside an AEW ring since he lost the World Championship to ‘Hangman’ Adam Page at Full Gear in November 2021.

When ‘The Best Bout Machine’ stepped away, it was said to be to deal with a number injuries which he had been struggling with, but the extent of these only became clear after he was gone. As well as suffering from vertigo since 2018, Omega underwent knee surgery and had been competing with a torn labrum.

On the 18th August 2022 edition of AEW Dynamite, a first round match in the Trios Championship tournament took place with Andrade El Idolo, RUSH and Dragon Lee teaming up to take on The Young Bucks and a mystery partner. As many had predicted the partner was revealed as Kenny Omega, who went on to pick up the win for his team.

With Omega wearing an unfamiliar compression shirt and shoulder brace, the match had some scary moments including when Dragon Lee flew to the outside on to Omega, with the pair crashing over the barrier and in to the crowd.

Returning to the ring, Kenny Omega hit the V-Trigger and One Winged Angel on Dragon Lee for the win, although Lee appeared to go limp before the finisher.

Dave Meltzer spoke on Wrestling Observer Radio about the concern for both wrestlers, and noted that they are both alright after the match.

In that match I know a lot of people were asking if Omega is ok, and if Dragon Lee is ok, and as far as I know, well I know that Omega is ok, and I’m pretty sure that Dragon Lee is ok as well. A lot of that was just selling. A lot was just selling. They’re very good at what they do. That crazy tope, they were ok.

There were plenty of discussion points to come out of the latest AEW Dynamite, including reports that lines in CM Punk’s promo to open the show were off script.
