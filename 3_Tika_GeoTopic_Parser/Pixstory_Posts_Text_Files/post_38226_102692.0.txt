Liverpool vs Real Madrid is set to be an enticing affair in the UEFA Champions League finals. Both clubs have players with huge stature within their ranks. Hence it would surely be a game for the ages. 

Real Madrid have multiple stars in their ranks. But Karim Benzema would be the peak of the picks for Los Blancos. The Frenchman has scored 15 goals in the UEFA Champions League this term. Hence, he would surely be one of the favourites to score in the match. 

Apart from Benzema, Vinicius Jr and Modric would be the other big picks from the Madrid rank. Real Madrid have "outscored" their opponents in most cases in the UCL this season. Hence goals will be the priority for Real Madrid in the game. 

Liverpool on the other hand would be banking on a strong defence. Allison, Virgil Van Dijk, and Alexander-Arnold could be their wildcards in the game. 

However, the Reds would need to outscore Real Madrid. For this, Mohamed Salah would be the biggest threat. The Egyptian was injured when the two clubs clashed in the 2018 UCL finals. Hence, Salah has already been very vocal about "revenge" this time around. 

Hence it has to be seen how the two clubs perform in the biggest spectacle in club football!
