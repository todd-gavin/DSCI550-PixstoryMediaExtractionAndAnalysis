CGI has granted emergency use
permission to Single-dose Sputnik
Light COVID-19 vaccine in India.
This is the 9th #COVID19 vaccine in
the country.

nation's collective fight against the
pandemic.

Health officials in Russia had authorised the one-shot Sputnik Light version of its coronavirus vaccine for use in May last year, however Government of India had refused the permission in June 2021. 
According to vaccine developer Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), a one-shot vaccination regimen of Sputnik Light has been approved in 30 countries already. 
The vaccine developers have claimed that the single shot i
helps to increase the efficacy and duration of other vaccines when used as a booster shot. Sputnik Light can also be used as a standalone vaccine.
