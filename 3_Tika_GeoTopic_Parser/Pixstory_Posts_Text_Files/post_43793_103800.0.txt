Sevilla enjoyed a very successful campaign in La Liga last season, finishing 4th with 70 points
under manager Julen Lopetegui. Lopetegui is responsible for stellar work at Sevilla, winning the
Europa league in 2019 and qualifying for the Champions League this season.

With shrewd
Sporting Director Monchi at the helm, the club has done fantastic business over the past few
years, adding players like Tecatito Corona to the club. Looking to boost their midfield this
summer, Sevilla have turned their attention towards Harry Winks.

Sevilla under Lopetegui prefer employing a 4-3-3 or a 4-2-3-1 with an emphasis on maintaining
possession and making incisive passes. The midfield is very fluid, often shifting from one
formation to another depending on the phase of the game or whether the team is in possession
or not.

When they lose possession, they counter-press looking to win the ball as high up on the
field and catching teams out on the counter. All of this suits Winks playstyle, similar to the
system under manager Pochettino.

Winks would well into La Liga and Spain. Winks has Spanish grandparents and a connection to
Spain.

In a slower league, Winks would have more time on the ball to pick a pass, allowing him
to display his strengths at full power. While Harry Winks isn't gonna be a star player that wows the fans at Sevilla he is very capable of being an important piece in the footballing style  of Lopetegul.
