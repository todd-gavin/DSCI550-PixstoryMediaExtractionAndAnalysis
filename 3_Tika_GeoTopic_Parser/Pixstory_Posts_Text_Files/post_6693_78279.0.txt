Tripathi also made this claim from his Facebook page, which was amplified by the BJP Bihar page.

Fact-check
We performed a keyword search and could not find any news reports corroborating this claim. A few articles from 2017 stated that Dalveer Bhandari was re-elected as a judge in the International Court of Justice. However, none of these claims Bhandari was elected as Chief Justice. On November 22, 2017, The Quint reported that the former Supreme Court judge secured the post after British candidate Christopher Greenwood backed out. The General Assembly was in support of Bhandari, which the UK could not challenge.
