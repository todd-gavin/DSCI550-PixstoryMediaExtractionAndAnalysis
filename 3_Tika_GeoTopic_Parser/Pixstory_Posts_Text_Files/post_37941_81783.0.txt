Manchester City have assembled one of the best teams in recent years. The Sky Blues have won three Premier League titles since Guardiola's arrival. And they look the favourites to win the league in 2022 as well. 

But even though City have been unstoppable in England, the same cannot be said about Europe. Even Though they have been one of the best teams in the last decade, Manchester City are yet to win their first Champions League title. 

Pep Guardiola has had to be content seeing his rival Jurgen Klopp win Liverpool the title in 2019. Things seemed to be going Manchester City's way as they reached the finals of the 2020/21 Champions League. 

Manchester City faced Thomas Tuchel's Chelsea in the finals and were the overwhelming favourites. But Kai Havetz's strike ensured that the Champions League title would be going to the Blues from London and not Manchester. 

Following their finals disappointment last season, Manchester City are gearing up to go deep into the competition once again. Their first hurdle in the knockout stage would be Sporting Lisbon in the round of 16.

Pep Guardiola last won the Champions League with Barcelona in 2011. Since then, the Spaniard has failed to win it with world-class teams at Bayern Munich and Manchester City. Hence it has to be seen if the City manager could prove his worth. 


Joao Cancelo has his say on the Champions League 


Manchester City defender Joao Cancelo is expected to start in the game against Sporting Lisbon. The defender accepted that there is a lot of pressure on the players to get the title. But he added that it is not an obligation. 

Joao Cancelo said "We take it game by game. We have one of the best squads in Europe but winning this isn't an obligation. You have to go up against the best. We are capable of winning it but it is a very tough competition."
