That s a fun chef hat fact I didn t know that I actually never wondered of why they had pleats in the first place until now of course I just thought it s just for the fashion of it However I did once read in a blog that Author Heidemarie Vos refuted the myth that chefs wore hats just to keep their hair out of their faces in her book Passion of a Foodie citing another origin story that dates back to about BCE much before the French acquired the caps When the Byzantine Empire invaded Greece Greek chefs sought refuge in surrounding monasteries and assumed monks clothing which featured a huge stovepipe hat Greek chefs continued to wear the hats as a show of protest and solidarity even after the Byzantines departed It s possible that the hats symbolism and sense of camaraderie prompted other chefs especially the French to adopt them as part of their own uniform
