I didn’t know much about what plastic surgeries men opt for, so I found this from GQ quite fascinating! I can imagine that men are insecure about their height- though, personally, I think that we need to change our biases re: height. It’s been a long time since I was on any dating apps, but I hear that women often have ‘must be 6’ tall’ etc on their bios. I think is quite silly, to be honest. Not only is it superficial, but you are effectively shrinking your dating pool by not dating shorter men. But of course people have a right to their personal preferences- which brings us back to the height issue. These men are willing to pay large sums of money to break their femurs and gain two or three inches- it sounds extremely painful! It also puts you out of commission for a few months. Ah well. At least it’s not as dangerous as the BBL- the Brazilian Butt Lift popularised by Instagram influencers. That one actually poses a risk to the life of the women getting it! I hope it falls out of popularity at some point
