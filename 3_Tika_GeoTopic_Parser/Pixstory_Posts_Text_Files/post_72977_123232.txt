A few films shape the course of cinema influencing generations of filmmakers actors and audiences Not many films receive this honour but Mehboob Khan s film Mother India is one that unquestionably qualifies Mother India starring Nargis Sunil Dutt Rajendra Kumar and Raaj Kumar is one of the films filmed over years ago that is still praised for its topics While many of the themes have been interpreted differently in the underlying story of Mother India remains relevant today The core notion of Mother India is still celebrated The story of Radha Nargis a newlywed bride in the hamlet is told in Mother India She begins labouring in the fields with her husband because the family is burdened by a local moneylender s crippling debt Radha evolves from an active young woman to a fatigued old lady in her attempt to return the loan Even if her husband Raaj Kumar mother in law and two of her children abandon her Radha must keep on and worry about the next meal for her two remaining kids Birju Sunil Dutt and Ramu Rajendra Kumar Radha s children are dying of starvation in one of the film s sequences and she is forced to seek assistance from the evil moneylender Sukhilala wants her to barter her body for food and Radha has an epiphany as she considers her situation Radha refuses to sacrifice her integrity in front of a statue of a god This is a pivotal sequence in the film since she is now linked with being a divinity The title Mother India can be interpreted in many ways Mehboob Khan s choice of title drew in some controversy as a book by the same name had created quite a furore His choice came from the conviction that from now on Mother India would be remembered as a symbol of sacrifice love and devotion
