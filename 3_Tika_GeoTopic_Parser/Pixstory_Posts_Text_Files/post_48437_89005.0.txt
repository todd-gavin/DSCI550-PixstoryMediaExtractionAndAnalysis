Sen. Dianne Feinstein she repeated the question she asked to the last three Supreme Court nominees: Is Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision recognizing women’s right to end unwanted pregnancies before fetal viability, settled law? Jackson replied that that Roe v. Wade was a binding precedent of the Supreme Court that lower court judges must follow.
‌When Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., asked Jackson about the historical significance of adding another woman — and a Black woman — to the court; Jackson answered that diverse members provide role models and she told about the letters she had been receiving from children; reaffirming hope. 
‌
‌Feinstein called her confirmation the "nearest we have ever come to gender equity on the Supreme Court".
‌
‌Jackson further expressed her opinion that judges should not be policymakers and they can only decide only the cases brought to them.
‌
‌When Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas asked questions on same-sex marriage; Jackson answered that she couldn't comment on the issue of same-sex marriage, since trial was going on. She gave a vague opinion on the issue even though senator pressed her for an answer.
