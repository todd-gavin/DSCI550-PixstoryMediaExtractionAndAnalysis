This case is often enumerated when we talk about the #metoo movement. 
R. Kelley represents all those men who were under the shadow of the movement and 
were defamed because of their sexual misconduct and torture.

What remained common amongst these people was an urge to use their fame and influence to torment people.
The extent to which violence, cruelty and control could go was unexplainable.

Kelly was the most prominent figure who was alleged of his sexual misbehaviour during the #MeToo movement. 
During the court session, the accusers told the judge how Kelly promised to mentor them but ended up making the life of those people a nightmare.

He asked the people to perform acts that would harm their minds. This psychopath did not spare even the children.
But with the power and advantage of the most strong movement of all time, people got the chance to speak and address their fears and, in most cases, were men.

In 2006, Tarana Burke coined the #MeToo movement to address and punish the sexual violence that has been consistently occurring in the community, especially for young women of colour.
Since then, the movement has taken many forms and proliferated worldwide, with people expressing their views and stories of pain.
