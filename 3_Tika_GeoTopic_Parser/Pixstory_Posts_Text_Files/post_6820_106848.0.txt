In the last week of May, BJP national spokesperson Nupur Sharma made controversial remarks about Prophet Muhammad on the national news channel Times Now. This sparked outrage in the Muslim world, with several Muslim nations condemning her statement and asking India for a public apology. On June 5, BJP suspended Nupur Sharma.

Five days later, on June 10, protests over Sharma’s remarks took place after the Friday jumma prayers across India. As per reports, two people died in Ranchi. Furthermore, Section 144 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) has been imposed in several parts of the country.

On the same day, AIMIM’s Maharashtra-based MP Imtiaz Jaleel criticised Sharma’s remark. ANI uploaded a 37-second video of Jaleel along with the transcription of his quote – “[sic] Islam is a religion of peace, people are angry…Nupur Sharma should be hanged. If she’s allowed to let go easily, then such things won’t stop. Law should be brought to take action against those who make such remarks against any religion, sect…” This video has gained close to 10 lakh views.

Shortly after, a section of people on Twitter criticised ANI for “misrepresenting” Jaleel’s quote. Journalist Rohini Singh quote-tweeted ANI and wrote, “Imtiaz Jaleel clearly says they aren’t asking for Nupur Sharma to be hanged and the law should take its course. Why has ANI misquoted him so grossly? This false statement attributed to him has the potential to further inflame tensions.”

Similarly, NDTV’s Gargi Rawat and freelance journalist Alishan Jafri made the same claim. Both subsequently took down their tweets.

Twitter account ‘Team Saath’ also claimed ANI misquoted Jaleel.

Did ANI misquote Imtiaz Jaleel?
No.

The following is the transcription of Jaleel’s speech uploaded by ANI – “Islam is a religion of peace. Indeed there is anger amongst people. We also demand that Nupur Sharma should be punished by hanging to death. If she easily goes scot-free, she will never be stopped. We are saying that a law should be brought against people who speak against any caste, religion or any religious head …
