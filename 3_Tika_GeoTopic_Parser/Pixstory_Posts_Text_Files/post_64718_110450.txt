Mexico City sits at a place which is very vulnerable to earthquakes In the city was hit by an earthquake which measured on the Richter scale killing people and damaging buildings Since the government has strengthened the building codes and the emergency system called SASMEX but these measures don t extend beyond the tourist areas Residents build shelter with whatever materials they can find and afford and they continue to struggle to gain access to water and electricity For all the improvements in the last years of the city is made up of these unregulated informal and vulnerable zones These areas are continuously growing due to Mexico City s population growing from million in to million in Four central districts account for of jobs but only of the population which creates Urban Sprawl where people have to travel from outlaying suburbs to places of work One would think that the public transport would help with this but it hasn t been kept pace with the increasing population The subway which was built to accommodate million people is now forced to accommodate million people The government plans to invest billion dollars to provide a cable car system built around the city s outskirts and additional trains for the metro system Many people who drive into the city are registered into other states residents spend around hours stuck in traffic every year which shows how congested the city actually is Mexico is also one of the most unequal countries of the world One could see this nationwide inequality around the country One could also notice the extent of Urban Sprawl
