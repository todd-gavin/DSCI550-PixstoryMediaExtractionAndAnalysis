On the warm summer night or evening in the 1998 era(yeah, that far) I was in the second or third standard. I saw the first time Manchester United play and fell in love with them. Back then I didn’t understand football and football wasn’t big in India. Like thousands of kids at that time, I was engrossed with cricket. It went on for quite some time when in my school other kids were football fanatics and used to play football during PT period. 


My real love for football began during my birthday when I went to the toy store to buy something and my eyes fell on FIFA 2001 with Paul Scholes on the cover. I was intrigued to find more about it so i pestered my dad like any kid to buy me the PC version.

So i chose the first team which the game showed me, it was Manchester United. The more I played I got to know about David Beckham, Gary and Phil Neville and Ryan Giggs and lastly Sir Alex Ferguson. I was so intrigued by Manchester United that I used to play that game 24.7(LOL). I chose to study more about Man Utd. I saw a couple of movies like Bend it Like Beckham, Goal 1-3, etc. Back then there was no Google or Edge so had to rely on good old Internet Explorer to see it through plus information was not readily available like it is today.

I was hooked on Manchester United. Back then we were a top team boasting players like Rudd Van Nistelrooy, Wayne Rooney, golden boy C/ristiano Ronaldo and ever green Ryan Giggs, and forever young Sir Alex Ferguson. I didn’t mention David Beckham because he had already left Old Trafford for Bernabeu(Real Madrid) due to a dressing room squabble between the boss and him.

Back then Manchester United had the strong pull of bringing top players from all over the world just like Real Madrid, Barcelona, AC Milan, and so on.
