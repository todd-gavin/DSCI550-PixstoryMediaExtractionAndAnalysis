Only a week after becoming the world’s No. 1 ODI bowler, Jasprit Bumrah has been surpassed by Trent Boult of New Zealand. Bumrah took eight wickets in the first two games of India’s recent one-day international series against England, but he missed the third.

Jasprit Bumrah now has 703 ODI rating points to his name. On the leaderboard, the right-arm fast bowler is only one point behind Boult Shaheen Afridi, Josh Hazlewood, and Mujeeb Ur Rahman remaining in the top five rankings.

Following the conclusion of the series against England, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma both fell in the ICC ODI Rankings.

Kohli’s dismal run with the willow continued against England, as he lost his wicket cheaply in both ODIs. Rassie van der Dussen, meanwhile, smashed a match-winning century against England on Tuesday, July 19, at Durham’s Riverside Ground.
