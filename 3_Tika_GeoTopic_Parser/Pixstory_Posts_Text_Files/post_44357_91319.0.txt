When will the draw take place? 
We will know 29 of the 32 competitors in the first winter World Cup by the end of March. The intercontinental playoffs, as well as the last European playoff final, which has been postponed owing to the Ukraine-Russia situation, will determine the final three spots in June. 

The tournament draw will take place on Friday, April 1, 2022, at around 5 p.m. BST at the DECC location in Doha, Qatar. 
When and where will the World Cup be held in 2022? 

Due to the heat, the 2022 World Cup will be held in Qatar during the winter months rather than the summer. The tournament begins on Monday, November 21 at the Al Bayt stadium in Al Khor, with a match featuring the host nation. The final will take place a week before Christmas on Sunday, December 18 at Doha's Lusail Stadium. 
What is the draw's structure? 

The 32 countries competing in the 2022 World Cup will be divided into eight four-team groups. Qatar, the host nation, will be in Group A's first position. The remaining countries will be divided 
into four pots based on FIFA rankings, with the top-ranked sides joining Qatar in pot one. Aside from Europe, which can have no more than two nations in any one group, each group will have just one nation from each confederation. 

What is the format and timetable for the World Cup? 

The World Cup in 2022 will feature 32 teams divided into eight four-team groups. During the group stage, four matches will be played each day over the course of 12 days, with the winners and runners-up progressing to the round of 16. 

After the finals draw, matches will only be assigned to specific venues so that organisers may determine the best kick-off times for television audiences in different countries as well as supporters in Qatar. On December 17, unlike Euro 2020, a third-place play-off game will be held. 

Group stage: November 21- December 2
Round of 16: December 3-6 
Quarter-finals: December 9/10
