Grimes blasts off to another dimension with Blackpink's Jennie in the " Shinigani Eyes".

On January 25, Jennie made a surprise cameo in the teaser for “Shinigami Eyes.” The song’s title is a reference to the manga and anime series, Death Note. In the series, Shinigami eyes allow people to see how long other people have left to live.

In the video, Jennie is shown posing next to Grimes on a futuristic spaceship.

Although the video’s sci-fi meets anime meets fantasy aesthetic is markedly different from anything we’ve ever seen from Jennie, she nailed the concept!💅😍
