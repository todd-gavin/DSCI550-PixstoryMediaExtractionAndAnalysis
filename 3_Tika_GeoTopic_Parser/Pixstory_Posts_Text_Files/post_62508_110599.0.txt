Going out of your way to impress someone is not something we don't always see. We give each other flowers and chocolates and dates and presents, and apparently it's not limited to humans. Penguins have their own way to propose. Rocks! Male gentoo penguins, look through piles of pebbles to pick the smoothest, most ideal pebbles to give it to the penguin they want to mate with. It's a courtship ritual. A penguin gives his chosen pebble to his intended partner once he has made his choice. Once she gives her approval, she places the stone in their nest, and the two are well on their road to becoming parents. It's that important that male penguins frequently battle over the most attractive choices because pebbles are highly prized by the species.

But this is not it. There has been challenges to this notion too. Many believe they just help the female to build a nest for mating, others say they do it for courtship but do not search the beach or fight for it.

Turns out, penguins do have individuality too! In fact to the point where they sometimes stay in monogamous relationships with their partners and mate with them for years.
