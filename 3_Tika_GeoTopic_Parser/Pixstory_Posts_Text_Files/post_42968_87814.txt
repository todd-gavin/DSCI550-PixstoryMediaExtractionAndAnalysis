We had to divide our district into zones to conduct the tournament in Nagpur it went on be a huge success for us The journalists that didn t write about at first saying this tournament wouldn t work started to cover our matches daily without fail People from neighbouring districts started to contact me about getting such a tournament done in their districts Representatives of these districts would come to us or sometimes I d go there to talk about starting a tournament there After the tournament in Nagpur the tournaments started to happen in neighbouring districts such as Bhandara Chandrapur Gondia Wardha Gadchiroli Nashik Latur etc This a happened due to the coverage that the press had done of the previous tournament After every match the losing team would be gifted a football One day my wife Ranjana Barse was the chief guest at a match and I told her to reward the a football to the losing team She later asked me why we give this football to the losing team and nothing to the winning team I told her that I ve seen kids play football with a plastic bucket and I want them to play with this football I knew they d play with this ball even if the cover got completely torn out I had seen the passion in their eyes and I wanted to do everything I could to help them I used to think a lot everyday about how I could make their lives better The expenses for the complete first year were paid by my wife and me She was also a sports teacher like me It s not easy to get donations for football here when compared to cricket A person will readily sponsor something related to cricket but not football with time this idea has started to change now for the better The next step was to play an inter district tournament within our state We needed to level up so that the kids could gain exposure and play football at a higher level with all their passion
