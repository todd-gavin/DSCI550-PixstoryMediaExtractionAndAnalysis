“Judicial review of legislative and executive actions is an integral part of the constitutional scheme. I would go as far as to state that it is the heart and soul of the Indian Constitution. In my humble view, in the absence of judicial review, people's faith in our Constitution would have diminished.” 


This is what Chief Justice of India N V Ramana said on 23 July 2022, during one of at least 29 lectures he delivered over the course of his 16-month tenure as India’s top judge.


Yet, during Ramana’s time as Chief Justice, the Supreme Court did not exercise this power of judicial review in 53 cases requiring a constitution bench, which comprises five or more judges and deliberates on cases of constitutional significance; and in several other cases that do not require a constitution bench but are with widespread ramifications and of national importance.


Challenges to these 53 cases saw no progress in Ramana’s Court, much like in his predecessors’ courts. Similarly, little or no progress was apparent in other cases that we analysed. Of these pending cases, we identified six: 


—the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir (pending for 1,115 days)


—a challenge to electoral bonds for being opaque and encouraging murky political funding (1,816 days)


—a Karnataka government ban on the hijab for Muslim students in government educational institutions (159 days)


—a Union government reservation policy based only on economic criteria and not caste factors (1,323 days)


—a challenge to the  Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), 1967, widely criticised as a tool  to quell dissent (1105 days)


—a challenge to the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019, which provides fast track citizenship to only non-Muslims from three neighbouring countries (987 days)


As “master of the roster”, the Chief Justice is empowered to constitute such benches, including constitution benches, decide cases they will hear, and assign cases to specific benches. When cases are not listed for hearing, said experts, the responsibility lies with the Chief Justice.
