It’s safe to say Keegan Murray was the story of the NBA summer league. The #4 pick out-played picks 1-3, looked like a man amongst boys and took home the MVP averaging 23, 7 and 2. 

Coming in to the NBA, most experts thought he would be a stretch 4 since might have a tough time keeping up with quicker 3’s. It’s still only the preseason but Keegan showed an amazing ability to put the ball on the floor and create like a wing and shot 40% from 3. After seeing his smooth shooting stroke over many games, comparisons to Khris Middleton now don’t seem so far fetched. 

Most importantly he showed the patience, poise and leadership that should make him impactful from day one of the regular season. His cool under pressure and even-keeled nature have raised comparisons to Tim Duncan. No one is saying Keegan will be the player Tim was but their temperaments do seem very similar.

It’s early but the comparisons indicate just how impressed experts were and how impactful they think Keegan will be.
