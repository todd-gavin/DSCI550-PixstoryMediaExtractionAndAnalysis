It was in the 2003/04 season that Arsene Wenger's arsenal made history by not only lifting the trophy but also staying unbeaten throughout the entire Premier League season.

In 2018 Wenger finally decided to step down from his coaching duties, but by then he had become the man with the most matches managed in the Premier League during the last 22 years of his managerial career. During this period he had also overtaken Sir Alex Ferguson to become the longest serving manager in the Premier League. 
Wenger also has 7 FA Cup titles to his name, more than any other coach in the competition's history so far. Another major honour to his name is his being voted the Manager of the year thrice throughout his career in 1998,2002 and 2004. It's time now to have a deeper look at his detailed stats as the manager during his time at Arsenal:-
