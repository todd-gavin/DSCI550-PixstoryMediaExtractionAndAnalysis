Well, knowing the correct way to take steam is necessary.
So grab a big fluffy towel and choose your spot. But, again, comfort is critical, so if you're doing this over a sink, you'll want to use a chair or stool that offers the right height. Otherwise, a bowl on a table is your best bet.
And yes, secure your hair so it's off your face and cleanses using a gentle exfoliating cleanser. Don't forget to wash your neck, too!
Bring 4 to 6 cups of water to a boil in a kettle or pot, depending on the size of the sink or bowl.
Add a handful of herbs once the water begins to boil and stir.
Don't forget to reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 2 or 3 minutes. Then, carefully pour into the sink or bowl. If you're using essential oils, this is the time to add a few drops to the water.
Have a seat, drape your towel over your head and the pot, and hold your face 6 inches above the water.
Raise or lower your head for more or less heat and lift a towel corner to cool off if needed.
Steam your face for 5 to 10 minutes.
Please don't do it for more than 10 minutes, as it might create some other health issues.
