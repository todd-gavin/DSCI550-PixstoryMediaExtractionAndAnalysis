While diversity and inclusion have climbed corporate agendas over the past decade, many LGBTQ+ employees continue to face discrimination, discomfort, and even danger in the workplace. Employment discrimination and harassment against LGBT people negatively impact employees’ health and wellbeing and reduce job commitment and satisfaction. 45.5% of LGBT workers have reported experiencing unfair treatment at work, including being fired, not hired, or harassed because of their sexual orientation or gender identity at some point in their lives. When it comes to true inclusion, everyday interactions with peers and leaders matter as much as organizational policies or formal processes. There are small steps that companies can take to make their workplace more inclusive which include being conscious to avoid microaggressions, educating one’s team, creating a good support network and strengthening company policy on promoting comfortable and safe environments for LGBT employees.
