When we think about healthcare access, we will have to think about trans and queer-affirmative healthcare access in every level. It can't be just the private healthcare center, where the doctor is queer or trans-affirmative.

Because I'm growing up, and my parents are growing up with me too. I came out four years ago, right in the middle of law school. You know, going almost every day in a Sari to Delhi University, risking everything, carrying it in my bag, etc. And everyday I used to worry that, 'Oh my god, if my parents fall down today, or if they have anything, what am I going to do?'

Healthcare expenses are so damn high that you don't end up saving anything, and you don't get insurance properly. A lot of workplaces do not have health insurance that covers any form of trans healthcare.

Whenever I speak to law students and faculty, all of them ask me, 'Oh my god, it must be so hard to get your surgery done. It must be so hard.'

Surgery is not my first priority. My first priority is my health.

I've been to about 15 doctors until now in Delhi, including about three sexologists. And some of them told me, 'You know, intersex is fine, but don't transition. You have to take care of your parents.'

And when we think about health, we try to regulate allopathic healthcare, what about alternative health systems?

When we talk about trans-affirmative healthcare, we will have to look not just at the allopathic healthcare system, but also alternative systems and regulating them.
