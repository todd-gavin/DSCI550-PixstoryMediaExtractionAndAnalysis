Despite Pride Park's relegation to the third division of English football, the former England
captain wishes to stay with the club.

After Derby County was demoted from the Championship to League One, Wayne Rooney says
he wants to stay and help "bring the joyful days back."

After losing to Queens Park Rangers and drawing at Swansea City, Reading will be relegated to
the third division of English football next season after failing to avoid a 21-point punishment for
going into administration.

What exactly did Rooney say?

"We've been demoted," Rooney told Sky Sports after the game. "But I've never seen a club get
relegated and get the response from the supporters." "I think the fans' support for the guys
throughout the season was fantastic." Of course, I'm disappointed, unhappy, and angry, but I'm
also proud.

"I'd like to re-establish the club." Every week, you can see how much it means to the fans; this is
a wonderful club, a large club, and we're all pleased to be a part of it. I want to be the one who
brings back the good times."

Rooney confesses to being concerned about a takeover.

Derby appears to be on the verge of welcoming new owners as they prepare for life in the third
tier, but the lengthy process and uncertainty have left the club in limbo-and Rooney confesses
that he is concerned about what would happen if a deal falls through.

"I feel for the players more because we've picked up 52 points and, in normal conditions, we'd
be secure now." We've paid the amount for the damage done by the prior owner.

"No one is to blame." It wasn't mine, my staff, or the players; it was the prior owner. We're
paying the price, and I'm sure it's a sad day for Mel [Morris], who is a Derby supporter. I'm sure
he'll be dissatisfied."
