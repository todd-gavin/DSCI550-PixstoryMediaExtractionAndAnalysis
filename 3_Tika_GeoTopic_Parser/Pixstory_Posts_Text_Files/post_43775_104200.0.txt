The Champions of Europe and the Kings of South America clashed in the inaugural Finalissmo event at Wembley on Wednesday night. The game, seen otherwise as an incoherent friendly was seen rather as a trophy for prestige as the best from two of Football's biggest continents faced off.

Lionel Scaloni's Argentine side were far better, well drilled and more effective in each possible aspect of tonight's game. Roberto Mancini can look back and reflect on a performance that went nowhere. The Italians held through the first half bug went into the break two behind, and were completely dominated by La Albiceleste in the second 45 minutes.

Match Summary:

First Half: Both the sides kicked the game off with fierce intentions. Argentina were instantly on the front foot, attacking down Lionel Messi's right flank with full back Nahuel Molina overlapping. Their pressing game in particular stopped Italy from working through their rhythm. The likes of Angel Di Maria and Lauraro Martinez were particularly proactive in Italy's first phase of possession. Italy on the other hand deployed a high line, using Leonardo Bonucci's ability to play long passes over the top. From set pieces and in final third possession they were often poor.

The 28th minute brought Argentina's initial shot on goal as Lautaro Martinez tucked in from Lionel Messi's Cross. Messi recieved the ball in the left half space and showed off some brilliant hold up play followed by immaculate footwork to race past Di Lorenzo. Italy were unable to sustain the Argentine pressure, constantly falling prey to their press. La Albiceleste continued to overturn possession and play Di Maria through the centre, and that is how Lautaro Martinez picked him out for the second on the cusp of Half time.
