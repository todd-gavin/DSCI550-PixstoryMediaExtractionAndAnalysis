My rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
(spoilers in the slides++)
I wish I had read this 3-4 years ago when I was in my early teens. I've read such mature romances now that it seemed a little kiddish but I could appreciate the book for what it is - a summer tale full of love, laughter and heartbreak.
Belly is such a relatable teen character and even though she can be seen as annoying and insufferable, weren't we all at that age?? look back at my teen years and thought 'I probably would've reacted exactly the same way'. Her internal struggles are what we all went through at that age. It was refreshing to read a fun, teen coming of age summer romance.
Of course I'm team Conrad. Give me a broody, secretive bad boy any time of day!! It was interesting to see Belly and Conrad struggle through their apparent feelings for one another. I liked seeing them work through their attractions in completely different ways whilst also learning to cope with familial conflict and new relationships. I'm definitely reading book two soon!
This book reminds me of warm weather and the smell of the ocean. 
The series on the other hand, i give it a rating of ⭐⭐⭐ because they altered the story a little and also I just don't like the premises of it that much, in series I'm definitely team Jeremiah.
