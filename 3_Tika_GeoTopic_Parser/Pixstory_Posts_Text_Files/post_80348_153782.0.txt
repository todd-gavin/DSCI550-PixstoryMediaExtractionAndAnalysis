Juventus received a serious hammering in the Derby d'Italia as they were handed a 2-0 defeat by their rivals A.C Milan in a crunch encounter. It was the first encounter between these two sides in this season. The game was highly significant for both the teams to boost their position in the Serie A table since neither of the sides have been able to perform as per their standards so far in the league. 
A.C Milan dropped a high quality performance at the Same Siro to edge past Juventus. With this victory Milan took a major step forward as they are now sitting at the third position in the table with 20 points in 9 games. 
After being  close to scoring their opener on two occasions, Milan finally burst open in the 1st minute of added time at the end of the first half with Fikhayo Tomori who turned in Giroud's shot into the goal from close distance to make it 1-0. 
What followed was even more misery for Juventus as Milan scored again barely 9 minutes into the second half. Vlahovic in his attempt to find some team mate of his tried to backpass the ball, which was stolen away by Brahim Diaz. Milan's no.10 went on to make the most of the chance and double his team's lead with more than 30 minutes to play.
Even though Allegri went on to make several substitutional changes hereon to bring in some sort of a turnaround, it was majorly Milan who had the upper hand as they created better chances. 
Stefano Pioli's side went on to win the game 2-0 and register a second victory over Juventus in theast 4 meetings, the remaining two being draws. Juventus despite having majority of the posession, couldn't make much use of it as they barely created chances and have any impact in the game. This loss further exposed their weaknesses and their frail strategies under Massimiliano Allegri.
