Smile O voluptuous cool breath d earth Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees Earth of departed sunset earth of the mountains misty topt Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake Far swooping elbow d earth rich apple blossom d earth Smile for your lover comes Prodigal you have given me love therefore I to you give love O unspeakable passionate love Walt Whitman
