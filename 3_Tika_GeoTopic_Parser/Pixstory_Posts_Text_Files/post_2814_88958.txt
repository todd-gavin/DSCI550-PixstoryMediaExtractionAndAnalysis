Many believe Putin is more sinned against then sinning Other world leaders however accuse him of grave crimes in his invasion of Ukraine President Biden has called him a war criminal Meanwhile two former British prime ministers Gordon Brown and Sir John Major have demanded a special international tribunal to investigate Putin s actions in Ukraine The International Criminal Court has been probing Putin s war crimes but its powers are limited The ICC works through the UN Security Council where Russia could use its veto So a petition has been prepared calling for a more powerful tribunal set up for the Ukraine war like the one the comparison is loaded that held trials of Nazi war criminals after World War II in Nuremberg Brown and Major have signed that petition Petition Brown accuses Putin of replacing the democratic values by the use of force He says Putin has indulged in indiscriminate bombing of civilians which is against international law and breached humanitarian ceasefires Brown writes why a Nuremberg style trial is needed for Putin Whether one agrees with the suggestion or not it is not as easy as signing a petition Firstly setting up a tribunal like that is complicated If it can be done then evidence will have to be gathered for it A children s hospital was bombed in Ukraine and that s a war crime even if Russia would like us to believe that the bombing was carried out by Ukrainian neo Nazis But how can this act be linked to Putin on paper Even after putting together a workable legal case how do you bring the perpetrator to justice as long as Putin remain in power in Russia Extraditing a serving head of state that too of a powerful state and putting him in the dock in a court is unheard of Instead taking specific grievances to specific platforms may not sound as serious as anything involving Nuremberg but that may be a more pragmatic response at least for the time being For example Ukraine has approached the International Court of Justice ICJ under the UN s Genocide Convention
