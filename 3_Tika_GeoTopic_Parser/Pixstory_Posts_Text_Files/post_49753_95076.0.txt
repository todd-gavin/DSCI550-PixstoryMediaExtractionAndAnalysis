‌It would be fair to say that we live online. We share mostly everything online and yeah it had become a space for ourselves. We receive many comments or requests or even some words that offend us from people we know. Know Cyber Sexual Assault and Prevent or know about it so that you can deal with it legally. 
‌
‌Online sexual abuse can be any type of sexual harassment, exploitation, or abuse that takes place through the internet. For example, an unwelcome comment about sex or hate speech about gender, identity or sexuality is abuse. Even to acquaintances or friends sending unwanted requests for nude videos, photos are an offence. Any kind of sexual activity without consent in a meeting or so is also an offence. Revenge Pornography or Non-consensual Pornography, morphing is all sexual crimes, and child pornography is another offence. Even a meme that offends a person's sexuality is an offence. 

‌Many acts of sexual violence online are normalized and not taken seriously. We see many memes pages every day talking about undesirable things and yes children and grownups have access to it! 
‌
‌Moreover, online platforms becoming platforms for the spreading of abuse. Even though the abuse occurs virtually, the impact on the victim, their loved ones, and the community can be just as fatal as sexual violence committed in person. Fake accounts and the inappropriate use of images of an individual are also an offence. It's a person's choice to post online and that doesn't mean anyone can misuse it. The reality is that online sexual abuse is affected by the same attitudes and beliefs that lead to sexual violence committed in person. These shared risk factors include social norms that directly or indirectly support violence; traditional toxic ideas about masculinity; and attitudes that degrade women, LGBTQ people, people of colour, people with disabilities, and other marginalized communities.
