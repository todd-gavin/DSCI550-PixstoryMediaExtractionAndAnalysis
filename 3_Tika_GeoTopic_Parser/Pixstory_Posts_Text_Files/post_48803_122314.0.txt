The scottish comedian, Frankie Boyle, was recently slammed by the internet for making insensitive rape jokes about ITV presenter Holly Willoughby. He described a game about "killing and sh***ing" people at a performance at the Latitude Festival in Suffolk last weekend. The game, he said, included Willoughby.

He said, ‘I’d obviously k*ll her and r*pe her afterwards. I’m joking – I’d r*pe her first.’

When confronted by an audience member at the launch of his novel for it, he refused to apologize and proceeded to defend himself by saying, ‘Can I just say, my routine about raping and f*****g Holly Willoughby was part of a very long routine about whether or not it’s OK to do a joke about that, and I look at it from both sides, there are pluses and minuses,’

I am appalled by how easily not only he said these things but conveniently got away with them with a lot of people defending him too. Apparently, it's a part of his comic career but I have to ask, how something that is a lived reality of millions of women around the world supposed to be a joke? By a man at that? 

A woman was talked about like this, as if she's an object of people's sexual and murderous fantasies. Hell, how is it even okay to say something like this? This is violent and scary. And heartbreakingly enough, a subject of humor for many many men.

Do not come at us for saying we hate men. When we joke about hating men, we talk about our lived experiences. About OUR stories of haunting realities. When men joke about women, they talk about how they want to r*pe and k*ll us. It's not the same.
