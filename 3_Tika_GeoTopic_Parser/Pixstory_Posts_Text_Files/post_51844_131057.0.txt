Malayankunju’ is a good watch but it’s  not a great one. What works is Fahad Fahil’s performance. What doesn’t work is the fact that it looks like a plot of a short story rather than a full-length feature film. You are left wanting more.

Anikuttan is a cantankerous sort of character with strong prejudices. He also has a soft side where he helps others but that is glimpsed only rarely. His mother has a tough time trying to adjust to his every need. She cannot even visit her daughter and grandchild because he will not allow it. His ability to fix all things electronic is why he is useful to the community. No one quite likes him, but they all tolerate him. 

When the neighbours, who are from a lower caste, have a baby who cries all night every night, Anikuttan is incensed. He seems to hate the little baby, Ponni, with an irrational passion. How his feelings towards the baby change after undergoing a harrowing ordeal forms the latter part of the story.

Fahad’s Anikuttan is believable. His disdain for those of a caste lower than his, his hatred for a sister who has run away with one such person on the eve of her wedding, his inability to cope with the devastating consequences of her elopement on his father – all of these are very clearly brought out. His visceral struggle while trapped in the landslide too is captivating.

However, there seemed to be no build up to Anikuttan’s change of heart. We know that his frantic efforts to escape the earth mimic a baby’s efforts to exit the mother’s womb. We also know that it is only the baby’s cries that serve as a beacon. But how his emotions go from hatred to concern and love in a heartbeat (during the struggle) is what feels confusing. Also, the background score during the riveting landslide scenes was unnecessarily overpowering.

Does the movie feel a tad incomplete? Yes. But you must watch it for Fahad's brilliant performance – he’s always worth it.
