U.S., Taiwan to start formal trade talks under new initiative
The United States and Taiwan have agreed to start trade talks under a new initiative to reach agreements with "economically meaningful outcomes", with a Taiwan official saying China's "economic coercion" would also be discussed.
Washington and Taipei unveiled the U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st-Century Trade in June, just days after the Biden administration excludeded the Chinese-claimed island from its Asia-focused economic plan designed to counter China's growing influence.
