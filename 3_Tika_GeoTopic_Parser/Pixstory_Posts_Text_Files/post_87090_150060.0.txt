3 Kerry Dixon
Dixon's time at Chelsea was loaded with goals, as he scored twice on his debut and was part of the club's re-building phase. The player assisted the club in promotion to the first division and was wanted by many clubs, but Chelsea were in disarray and were relegated at the time, and Dixon remained at the club.
Despite the fact that Dixon continued to score goals and the club was promoted to the first division. He finished his Chelsea career with 193 goals in 420 games.


2 Bobby Tambling
Tambling's performance at school provided him with a platform to demonstrate how good he was at football; the player was later sought after by many clubs, and Bobby Tambling was a Blackpool fan as a child. He did, however, join Chelsea at the age of fifteen and made his senior team debut at the age of 17, scoring on his debut.
He never looked back and went on to become a successful player at Chelsea. Tambling scored at least 20 goals in every season for Chelsea, totaling 202 career goals in 370 games.


1 Frank Lampard
Only two players in club history have scored 200 goals: Bobby Tambling, who played as a striker, and Frank Lampard, who played as a midfielder his entire career. Consider yourself a midfielder who has scored 200 goals. Lampard made it look easy and is the only top-ten Premier League player with 150 or more goals.
With 102 assists, he ranks fifth in Premier League history. He was named PFA Team of the Year three times while at Chelsea. He is a decorated Chelsea legend who has scored 211 goals in 648 games in the club's history.
