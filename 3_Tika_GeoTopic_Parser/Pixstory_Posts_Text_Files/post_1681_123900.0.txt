There was a time when popular Hindi cinema was quite popular in countries such as Turkey, Egypt, Tunisia and of course, Soviet Union. 

The first popular Hindi film to become a blockbuster at the Soviet box office was Awaara (1951), directed by Raj Kapoor and written by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas, released in the Soviet Union in 1954.

As per Wikipedia, among the foreign films that sold more than 20 million tickets in the Soviet Union, 50 were Indian films, the highest from any nation, compared to 41 Hollywood films. Indian films were routinely released with hundreds of prints in the Soviet Union, with the most popular Indian films releasing with more than a thousand prints there. 

The highest-grossing Indian film in the Soviet Union was Disco Dancer (1982), starring Mithun Chakraborty.

Indian films were very popular in Russia at the time, routinely opening to packed houses. However, the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, bringing an end to Indian cinema's largest overseas market at the time. 

In the recent times, it seems China has replaced Soviet Union in terms of positive response to popular Hindi cinema. And Aamir Khan rules the roost there. 

By 2013, China grew to become the world's second largest film market (after the United States) for popular Hindi cinema, paving the way for Aamir Khan's Chinese box office success, starting with Dhoom 3 (2013). PK (2014) was the first Indian film to collect ₹2 billion overseas, and Dangal (2016) was the first Indian film to exceed ₹10 billion and $100 million overseas, including ¥1.299 billion from China.

Even as there are fringe calls to boycott "Lal Singh Chadha" in India, the Chinese might be looking forward to it.
