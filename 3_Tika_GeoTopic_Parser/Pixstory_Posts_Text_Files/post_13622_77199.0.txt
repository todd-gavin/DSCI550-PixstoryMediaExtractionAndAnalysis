Will the Taliban keep their promise? Should they be trusted? With the coming to power of the Taliban government in Afghanistan and the occupation of all parts of Afghanistan, the Taliban government had made many promises to the people and the government of Afghanistan, but unfortunately, it has not yet fully complied with these promises.

False promises of Talibani!

1: The Taliban in Doha promised that there would be no restrictions on girls' education and women's rights to work; They said the same thing in Kabul on August 17, and then immediately broke those promises. The promises and words of the Taliban have no value.
2: Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told the Associated Press that he hoped all girls' schools would open in the new school year.
3: Women's rights in the Islamic context
4: I respect international law
5. You all see that Afghanistan will be liberated again after forty years
6: We do not take revenge on anyone
7: The war is over
8: Inclusive government
9: Women will continue to work
Why!
In most areas, girls in the sixth grade have been barred from going to school since the Taliban took office.
Many female employees have also lost their jobs since the Taliban came to power, and strict laws have been enacted on women.
Etc................
But the point is that the people of Afghanistan and even its neighbors have no problem with this promise, the problem is that others have different perceptions of this promise from the Taliban. Who is the source of diagnosis of Islam? The government of Afghanistan is still known by the Islamic suffix and Islam is not something new that it wants to bring to the government of Afghanistan.
No one should dwell on these promises, and if twenty problems are due to a lack of self-understanding, not a promiser.
