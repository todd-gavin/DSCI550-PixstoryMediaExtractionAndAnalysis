AC DC had one of the greatest musical impacts on the music industry They were founded in six years before Metallica and they established the benchmark for that genre of music They weren t like anything else folks had ever seen or heard Angus Young running around on stage in his schoolboy outfit while performing his version of Chuck Berry s Duck Walk and playing the classic Gibson SG in the style of AC DC was just iconic and people loved it In a tribute video to Malcolm Young Angus s late but great older brother Scott Ian the Rhythm Guitarist of the band Anthrax one of the Big in Thrash Metal revealed that Malcolm was his guitar idol and that he learnt how to play a guitar by ear while listening to Malcolm Apparently Alex Webster Cannibal Corpse s bassist mentioned that when he was beginning to play bass he was influenced by AC most DC s prominent bassist Cliff Williams and that he probably learnt a few AC DC songs Kurt Cobain the late but legendary vocalist and guitarist for the famed grunge band Nirvana also drew inspiration from AC DC On the other hand Metallica was one of the first bands to popularize the thrash metal genre Thrash merged elements of punk and heavy metal to create a stronger more aggressive sound with extended pieces While Angus Young undoubtedly encouraged innumerable others to pick up a guitar Metallica has inspired a slew of metal bands to go out and grind grind grind until they land a record deal and a fan base That is just what Metallica has done They cultivated a following Metallica didn t release a music video until its fourth album at a period when MTV was a necessary evil for a band to gain national attention So which one in your opinion has a bigger impact on the music industry
