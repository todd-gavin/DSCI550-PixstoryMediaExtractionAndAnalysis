Team for Humanity, a fundraiser by Give (formerly GiveIndia), has launched an auction of collectibles donated by eminent sports and entertainment personalities to raise funds for low-income families that lost their breadwinner to Covid-19.
Global athletes and celebrities have donated their personal memorabilia such as autographed bat from Virat Kohli, pair of spikes from Sunil Chhetri, Jimmy Choo shoes from Kareena Kapoor Khan, autographed gloves from Lewis Hamilton, and an autographed jersey from Manchester City FC, among many others.
To represent this global effort, a Team for Humanity jersey has been launched, which is also available for purchase on CharityStars.
The jersey captures the spirit of the cause, one where the world sets aside its differences and unites to uplift those in need of help. The jersey incorporates Puma’s dryCELL technology.
The auction is live on Charity Stars till September 15, while the jersey sale will be available till the end of the month. All proceeds from both events will directly contribute to the fundraiser.
