Who doesn't love food 
All those cheesy pizzas , the juicy burgers , the chocolatey milkshakes. The tummy groans too loud and then you do too . Wishing you has these with you. The moment you take the first bite everything feels so right . That amazing smell which makes you drool. We all are a fool for food!!
