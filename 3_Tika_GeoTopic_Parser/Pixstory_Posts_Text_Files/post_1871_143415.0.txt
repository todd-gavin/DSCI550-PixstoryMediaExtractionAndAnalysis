“On a suitable day to be selected by you in the year 2085 AD, would you please open this envelope and convey to the citizens of Sydney my message to them,” Queen Elizabeth II instructed Sydney's Lord Mayor on a secret letter written by her for the residents of Sydney.
The letter is currently stored inside a vault in a restricted dome area located at the top of the Queen Victoria Building.
Back in 1986, a Malaysian company signed a 99-year lease on the building, taking their contract up to 2085 — the same year the queen’s correspondence is to be opened and made public.
The contents of the queen’s letter are unclear, but it will likely thank Sydney residents for saving and refurbishing the historic building, after it was almost demolished to make way for a parking lot.
The secret letter is currently stored inside a vault in a restricted dome area located at the top of the Queen Victoria Building, and it cannot be opened for another 63 years until 2085!
