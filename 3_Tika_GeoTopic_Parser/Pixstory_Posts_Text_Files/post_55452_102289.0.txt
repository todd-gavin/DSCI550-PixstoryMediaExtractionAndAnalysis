Their anger doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong. It's normal for your family to have a strong reaction when you start to challenge patterns (of abuse, neglect, or poor communication skills).

It's normal for them to challenge you - humans are wired against change, even when change is helpful and healthy.

It's especially normal for parents in a broken family system to get upset when you start to change - this might bring up feelings of guilt or shame for them, feelings that they may not know how to deal with without projection (not an excuse, but an explanation).

Don't wait until your family supports your emotional growth
- that may not happen.

You deserve to start building new patterns and ways of
engaging with the world NOW.
