Living a longer, healthier life can start with your diet. You could add up to 13 years to your life if you ate few red and processed meats and more fruits and vegetables, legumes, whole grains and nuts, a recent study revealed.

According to the study, the largest gains in longevity were found from eating more legumes, which include beans, peas and lentils; whole grains, which are the entire seed of a plant; and nuts such as walnuts, almonds, pecans and pistachios.

Plant-based diets are winning top nutritional honours. 

In fact, diet can be as much of a vital sign as blood pressure, temperature and pulse rate, said Dr David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine and nutrition who has published research on how to use food as preventive medicine.

Ready to get healthier? Here are five expert-recommended ways to change your diet for the better.

1. Track your current eating habits

Many of us eat mindlessly, not really understanding all that we put into our mouths. That's why becoming aware of your real eating habits is the first step, said registered dietitian nutritionist Kathleen Zelman.

2. Plan for success

He suggests shifting your food environment — including your home, your work and your car — by planning ahead.

Pack healthy lunches and snacks, and don't forget travel.

3. Remove sugar from breakfast

Start your day with a healthier bang by removing sugar from breakfast, suggests Dina Aronson, lead dietitian with Diet ID, which focuses on dietary assessment and health behaviour change.

4. Make one meal meatless

The simplest way to start eating more plants is to replace one meat-based meal a day with a plant- or grain-based choice, experts say.

5. Eat what you love

We all know eating fruits and veggies are good for us, but they aren't typically our favourite foods. Yet in order for this new habit to stick you need to get enjoyment out of eating delicious, healthy food, Aronson said.
