I get what you re saying Been there done that I think my biggest flaw when I was younger was staying up late every friday night Many times I wouldn t sleep until sunrise and that obviously affected my day ahead I would sleep till noon and then feel lethargic all day long It took me a while but I incorporated discipline in my life Even today I make sure to follow the early to bed early to rise mantra And it has affected me more positively than I can explain In today s world procrastination seems to be an illness that affects everyone Routine however will prevent this from happening Your schedule should be packed with activities till bedtime so that you don t let your thoughts wander and accomplish only pointless things You are not living life properly if your days are empty of activities You could never do even a small portion of the things there are to do in thr world in your entire lifetime So make it your driving force and just take the leap of faith
