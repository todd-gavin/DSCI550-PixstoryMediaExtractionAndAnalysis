How to be happy according to the philosopher Immanuel Kant Before I start I want to say I know that most philosophers are sort of anti happiness Zizek says that happiness is for idiots Nietzsche says that happiness is a slave mentality but honestly I like being happy I think happiness is actually a goal worth pursuing it s just that most people pursue it the wrong way So here s a Immanuel Kant s recommendation his three rules for happiness He says you basically need three things in order to be happy one something to do and two someone to love and three something to hope for I love this formula because in a sense it s so true the first thing is about having a purpose doing something that you find fulfilling the second part having someone to love it s not just having a purpose but it s having someone to share it with And the third one is about having sense of direction having something to live for
