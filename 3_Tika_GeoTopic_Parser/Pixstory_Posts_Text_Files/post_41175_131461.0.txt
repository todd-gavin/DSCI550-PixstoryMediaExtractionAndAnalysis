Kobe Bryant Day, so named in commemoration of the 20-year basketball legend, is observed annually. 

His name needs no introduction, according to me. He was a legend who left us too soon!

Due to the two numbers on Kobe Bryant's LA Lakers jerseys—8 and 24—August 24 was chosen as Kobe Bryant Day. 

In August 2020, the Orange County Board of Supervisors in California unanimously voted to designate August 24 as Kobe Bryant Day. This was another official endorsement of Kobe Bryant Day.
