At the age of 5 I started learning classical music, though I didn't continue with that, but I used to sing very very well. Hence I had all the quintessential Bengali kid qualities. 

Because of the so-called Mishti Awaaz ( sweet voice) I had, I spent my school life participating in various music competitions, and humming into old classical songs, and when it comes to classical there is no one better than Lata Mangeshkar. 

I remember before Independence/Republic Day there was this patriotic song competition happening, and I decided to sing Lata Mangeshkar's popular song "Ae Mere Vatan ke Logon "

This song was composed by C Ramachandra, was written by Kavi Pradeep in honour of Indian soldiers who lost their lives in the 1962 war with China.

Kavi Pradeep persuaded her to sing the song, he wanted her to be the voice of it, however she thought she was not prepared to sing the song at such a short notice. However, Pradeep insisted, saying “main chahta hoon tum he yeh gana gao.”

She was quoted saying “At first I was nervous, thinking I have committed some mistake. But when I met Panditji (Nehru), I saw tears in his eyes.” “Lata, tumne aaj mujhe rula diya,”

The hard hitting lyrics of the song made me choose this one, but I realised how difficult the song is, and how beautifully she sang it, bringing tears to everyone's eyes. Even today when I see the video of her singing it still gives me goosebumps.

Lata Mangeshkar is a living legend, the melody queen of India. Her mellifluous voice has taken so many hearts. Some of my favorites of her are Lag ja Gale, a song which I can't stop humming, to songs like Ek Pyar ka Nagma hai, Piya Tose, Kora Kagaz tha Man Mera, and countless songs she has sung even in the 2000's.

As she's in ICU after suffering from Covid, I hope India's Melody queen gets well soon, otherwise without her the melody of songs will be lost in the country!
