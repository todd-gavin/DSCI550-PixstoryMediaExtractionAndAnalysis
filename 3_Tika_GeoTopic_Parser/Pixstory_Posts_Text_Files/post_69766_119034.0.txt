Hi Everybody ! myself ananya singhal, I am a 20 year old residing in multiple locations hehe. I am a very laid back person which sometimes costs me and makes me regret things. I tend to do important stuff at the last minute by creating a panic situation out of it. I am a tech enthusiast. I have a tendency to feel anxiety or fear for something but sometimes do only 90 percent effort to overcome that. I overall have minimal interest in music dance etc. I Let life go as it goes with the flow.
