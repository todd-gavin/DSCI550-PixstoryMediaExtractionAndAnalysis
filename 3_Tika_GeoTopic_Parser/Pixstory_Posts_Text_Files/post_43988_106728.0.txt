Romania will look to make it two victories in a row in the UEFA Nations League when they host Montenegro on Tuesday night.


Romania began their Group 3 campaign with a 2-0 loss to Montenegro on June 4, followed by a 1-0 loss to Bosnia-Herzegovina three days later, leaving them in last place after two games.

Romania's win over Finland was their first in any tournament since November, and they'll be looking to make it back-to-back victories for the first time since September.


In the meanwhile, Montenegro is coming off a 1-1 draw with Bosnia-Herzegovina on Saturday, with Adam Marusic scoring in the 77th minute to grab a point on home soil.

Miodrag Radulovic's team earned promotion to League B by finishing first in Group 1 of League C in the 2020-21 season, with 13 points from six games.


Montenegro vs Romania: Probable Playing XI


Montenegro: Danijel Petković; Marko Vesovic, Zarko Tomasevic, Igor Vujacic, Risto Radunovic; Adam Marusic, Marko Janković, Sead Hakšabanović, Vladimir Jovović; Stefan Mugoša, Stevan Jovetic


Romania:Florin Nita; Cristian Manea, Vlad Chiriches, Adrian Rus, Nicușor Bancu; Razvan Marin, Alexandru Cicâldău; Valentin Mihăilă, Alexandru Maxim, George Pușcaș; Denis Alibec


Montenegro vs Romania: Prediction

Having lost just one of their last four outings on home soil, Montenegro will not be easy to break down on Saturday - particularly for a Romania side which does not always deliver in the final third.

As both teams will be back in action in midweek, starting out with a point apiece would represent an acceptable result for either nation, and a low-scoring draw could be on the cards.

Prediction: Montenegro 1-1 Romania
