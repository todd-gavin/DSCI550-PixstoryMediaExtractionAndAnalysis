BTS Kim Seok-jin, also known as Jin, has revealed plans to release a solo. Variety reports that Jin made the news on Saturday during BTS' free "Yet to Come" concert in South Korea.
The star mentioned working on a song "with someone that I'd always really liked," however no further information was provided, according to a translation by Soompi by Variety.
Jin's next collaboration will be his first solo album after BTS's seven members announced they would be taking a break earlier this June.
The live-streamed event over the weekend garnered almost 49 million views in support of Busan's quest to host the 2030 World Expo.
“It’s not a huge album or anything, it’s just a single. I’ve filmed a lot different things recently, and there’s still a lot left to film, so I hope you’ll enjoy all of it,” he confirmed.
