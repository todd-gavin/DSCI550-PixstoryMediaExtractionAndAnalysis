Plastic was created by scientists to make lives easier but it actually made the human and the planet ill.Today we are surrounded by plastics in ways unimaginable. 
The toothbrush we use in the morning,the toothpaste bottle,the plates,glasses ,the fans, chairs.The polythene bag which we use to carry things , our storage  boxes are all plastic.
This plastic although it has proved to be beneficial but it is the reason why the environment is facing so much problems.The seas today are submerged with plastic,roads have a great heap of garbage.These are also non biodegradable and leads to Pollution.
The need today is to chose a sustainable and alternative to plastic.Many options are available in the market we just need to make informed choices.
