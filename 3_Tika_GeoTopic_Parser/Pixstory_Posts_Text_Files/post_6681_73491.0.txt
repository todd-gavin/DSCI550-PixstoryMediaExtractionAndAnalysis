Hindi news outlets Amar Ujala and Dainik Bhaskar also published similar reports. While Amar Ujala said that a young woman was travelling with a Muslim man, both of whom were married, Dainik Bhaskar reported that Aatif was taking a Hindu woman to Ajmer to get married to her. As per both reports, the man and woman hailed from Mhow.

Twitter user Saffron_Smoke posted a longer video of the controversy in which we see a Bajrang Dal member assaulting the Muslim man in question inside the train compartment. The video also shows the man and the woman being escorted to a GRPF station on the railway platform. Subsequently, the bite that the Bajrang Dal member gave to Lokmanch Today is played. This video has gained over 50,000 views.
