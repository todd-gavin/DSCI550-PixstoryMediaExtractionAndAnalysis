During the 'Kargil Vijay Diwas' celebration in Jammu on Sunday, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh stated that Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK) was, is, and will will be a fundamental part of India.

"We are firmly committed to the PoK resolution that was approved by the Parliament. PoK was, is, and will always be a fundamental component of India. How is it possible that Maa Sharda Shakti is on the other side of the Line of Control while Baba Amarnath (Lord Shiva's form) is in India? "The minister of defence said.

A strong and self-assured new India is prepared to respond appropriately to anyone who casts an unfavourable glance. A appropriate remembrance of our slain soldiers will be to make India a global superpower.
