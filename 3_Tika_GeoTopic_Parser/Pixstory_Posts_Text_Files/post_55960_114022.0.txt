Boris Johnson has apologized for appointing Chris Pincher to a government role after being told about a misdeed complaint against the MP.

The PM admitted he had been told about the grievance in 2019 - but had made a "bad mistake" by not acting on it. Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary soon after resigned. 

Mr. Pincher was suspended as a Tory MP last week over allegations of sexual misconduct.

The Tamworth MP has said he was pursuing professional medical support and has refuted previous allegations of misconduct. 

In his resignation letter, Mr. Sunak said the "public rightly expects the government to be conducted properly, competently and seriously".

"I recognize this may be my last ministerial job, but I believe these standards are worth fighting for and that is why I am resigning," Mr. Sunak wrote.

In his letter, Mr. Javid said he could "no longer continue in good conscience" under the prime minister, who had lost his confidence.

Speaking to BBC political editor Chris Mason, Mr. Johnson said he was "fed up with people saying things on my behalf" and needed to set the record straight.
