In some K-Dramas, in the absence of a loving and doting mother (or eomma), we're glad to see the lead stars bond with their fathers (or appas) on such a deep, emotional level. It's so fun to watch these dads cook for their daughters or sons, get extra protective of them, go to great lengths just to show their love and support for them, and even sacrifice for them. Other times, you may not get to see them as often in the series, but when they do appear, the lead stars almost always get an important realization or lesson that guides them later on in life.

The K-Dramas we've seen last year showed us great examples of a fatherâ€”someone who won't think twice about sacrificing for his child's happiness.

1. The father of Park Sae-ro-yi (Park Seo-joon) in Itaewon Class who taught his son to fight for what he thinks is right.

2. The father of Captain Ri Jeong-hyeok in Crash Landing on You who, as stern as he was, surprised us all when he protected and saved his son despite dangerous circumstances. 

3. The father of Jung Tae-eul in The King: Eternal Monarch, who was a very present dad in his daughter's life; he's so close to her his passion for taekwondo even rubbed off on her. 

Happy Father's Day!
