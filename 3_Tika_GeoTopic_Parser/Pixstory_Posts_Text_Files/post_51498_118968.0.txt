Edu was asked by sky sports reporter Michael Bridge about any more signings who are set to come in, here's what the former Arsenal player said:

"I think we have to be prepared for every situation. We still feel the transfer window is open and the most important thing is to be prepared for everything, every scenario, because opportunities can happen.

"Clubs can approach us, players probably want to go on loan, so there's still lots to do, but again, being prepared for me is the most important and for sure we are very much prepared for almost everything"

With these words it is certain that despite Arsenal already spending a considerable amount on new signings, they are not looking on the retreating end in the transfer market and are looking for more players to bolster their other positions. Although, we can sense from Edu's words that further signings are not possible unless players go out on loan which seems like a possibility. 

The technical director was next asked about Arsenal's marquee signing Gabriel Jesus from Manchester City and how he played a role in bringing his countryman to the club.

Edu was humble in his approach as he reinstated that the club as a whole helped in bringing Jesus to the club, he said:

"No, it's not me, it's Arsenal. I'm just part of the process of when you go in to sign a player, I'm there in front of the player, in front of the family to explain who you are. I think we as a club have to be proud to have a key player like Gabriel Jesus here."

The Brazilian assured that they have been following Jesus for a long time and was prepared to go all in for him.

"For sure. This process really, I think, takes like seven months in terms of understanding each other and talking to each other, because also he has a lot of other opportunities and then he chooses because he understands who we are."
