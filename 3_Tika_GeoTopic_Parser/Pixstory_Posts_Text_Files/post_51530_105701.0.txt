This is the continuation of Florentino Perez's letter to Madridistas. Follow my previous article to read the first part. 

"Together and united we have once again experienced a spectacular season in which our team has also won the 35th League and the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia. Three titles that motivate us to continue working to keep our club as the greatest benchmark in world football.

Our success is based on our values ​​and it is these values ​​such as sacrifice, permanent improvement, work, camaraderie, solidarity, respect and humility, which will always mark our destiny.

On them we will continue building the present and the future of our Club. And as we always say, now for the Fifteenth.”
