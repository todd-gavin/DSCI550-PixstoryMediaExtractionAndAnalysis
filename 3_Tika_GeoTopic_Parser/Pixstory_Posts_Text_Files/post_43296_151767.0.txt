Don't overthink and procrastinate your work. Overthinking is the art of creating new problems out of the ones that never existed in the first place. 
The two rules for success are- 
1. Donâ€™t sweat over the small stuff.
2. It's all small stuff. 
So, take time to deliberate but when the time for action has arrived, stop thinking and go for it. 
All the best!
