 We talk a lot about self love on this app and how you have to learn to love yourself before you can love someone else But I don t think we talk about the opposite enough which is that by loving other people we learn to love ourselves You can t properly love yourself unless you first love someone else and what this basically means is that by becoming subject to someone else by learning what it means to give love you learn what it means to receive love So you can t be the empty vessel of your own narcissistic attachment that would be self idolization not self love Instead self love is the fruitful result of being able to love someone else which is a miracle of life That love as the author Murakami once said is like a window opening up in your heart and letting in a fresh breeze You must learn to love in order to love yourself
