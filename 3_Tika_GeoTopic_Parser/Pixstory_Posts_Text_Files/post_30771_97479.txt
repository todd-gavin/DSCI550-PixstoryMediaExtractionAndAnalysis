The host of a meeting organized by Red Bull sponsor Matteo Berrettini sheds some light on his plans for the coming months The Italian tennis player stopped by the defeat against Kecmanovic in Indian Wells which was followed by surgery on his right hand weeks Berrettini explained We were thinking of an inflammation and instead it was a lesion of a small particle above the right little finger which serves to hold the tendon in place So every time I played the backhand the tendon moved at that point the operation was necessary Now I&#39;ve resumed playing move his hand, the recovery proceeds at the right pace. Regarding his return, at the moment it is unlikely that he will see him in action on clay and in particular at Roland Garros. I don&#39;t want to force the pace. Wimbledon thus becomes his first real goal before dedicating himself full-time to the American hard-court season preceding the US Open. It will be a different season on grass because I won&#39;t get there with so many matches behind me If everything goes well I would like to have a nice American summer in the Masters in Canada and in Cincinnati to then aim for the US Open And I don&#39;t forget Davis we have a very strong team that can win the Cup
