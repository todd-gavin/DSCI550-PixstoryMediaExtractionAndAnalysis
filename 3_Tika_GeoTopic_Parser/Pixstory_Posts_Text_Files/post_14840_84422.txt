The drought has become the most significant calamity for Italian agriculture with damages estimated on average at one billion euros a year, especially for the quantity and quality of the crops. This is what Coldiretti says in reference to the alarm raised by the UN IPCC climate scientists indicating four key risk categories from heat waves to dangers to agricultural production from water shortages to increased frequency and intensity of flooding A warning confirmed by a crazy winter with temperatures several degrees higher than average along the Peninsula but with peaks three degrees higher in the north-west but scarce rainfall that dried up rivers and lakes In the north the dry Po river at the Becca bridge dropped to meters lower than in August 15th and is representative of the suffering situation in which all the main courses find themselves of water in the north as in summer but anomalies are also seen in the large lakes which have filling percentages ranging from that of Como to that of Maggiore according to the monitoring of Coldiretti In the Po valley the crops sown in autumn such as barley, wheat and ryegrass start now the growth phase that risks being compromised by drought But what is also worrying is the development of meadows intended for animal feed because if the dry conditions continue, farmers will be forced to intervene with emergency irrigation where it will be possible. the sowing of corn will start in the next few days but with the arid and hard soils the operations could be more than problematic In order to save water, increase the irrigation capacity and increase the availability of food for families, a plan was elaborated and proposed together with Anbi concrete project immediately ready for construction in the Pnrr underlines Coldiretti a structural intervention made necessary by climate change characterized by the alternation of violent rainfall and long periods of absence of water throughout the national territory
