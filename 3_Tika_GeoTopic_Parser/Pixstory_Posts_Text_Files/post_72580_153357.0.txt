Chandrayaan-2
which has been hovering around the Moon since 2019, has mapped an abundance of sodium on the moon for the first time.
The new findings from India's second unmanned lunar mission, provide an avenue to study surface-exosphere interaction on the Moon, which would aid the development of similar models for Mercury and other airless bodies in our Solar System and beyond.
According to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the X-ray spectrometer 'CLASS' on the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter mapped an abundance of sodium on the moon for the first time. "Chandrayaan-1 X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (C1XS) detected sodium from its characteristic line in X-rays which opened up the possibility of mapping the amount of sodium on the Moon," the national space agency said in a statement.
Findings from Chandrayaan-2 suggest there are two kinds of sodium atoms on the Moon's surface, those that are loosely bound on the surface and those that are part of the minerals.
