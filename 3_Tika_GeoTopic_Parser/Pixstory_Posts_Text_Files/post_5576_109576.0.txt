A terrible blow to equality, agency over our bodies and minds not just in America but everywhere , the ripples of the overturning of Roe vs Wade will be far reaching and not in a good way. 

The day a semi-decent bipartisan gun legislation is moved, roe vs wade is overturned. Gives us an uneasy feeling of what political bargaining has gone into this. 

For several months now American democracy has shown itself to be transphobic, overturning the legislation which gave us rights over our bodies is 100000 steps further in that regressive direction.
