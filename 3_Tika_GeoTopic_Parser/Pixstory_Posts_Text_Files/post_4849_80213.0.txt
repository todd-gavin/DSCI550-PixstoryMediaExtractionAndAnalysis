Diplomats complain that Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot read the room when it comes to negotiations. He begins negotiations with threats rather than understanding.

NATO nations are alarmed by the dozens of Russian Battalion Tactical Groups, units that consist of about 800 soldiers each, placed along Ukraine’s borders. Is Putin preparing to annex the Donbas region?

Or is it the beginning of a dialogue?

This show of force, which garnered a military presence not seen in Europe since the end of the Cold War, has certainly rattled the West. It’s also distracted Russians from domestic gripes about a fumbling economy, low vaccine trust and an Olympic team that cannot carry its own flag.

Russia’s US$1.71 trillion economy could not handle a war with NATO nations, considering that the United States economy is US$24.8 trillion. Ukrainian resistance against Russian forces would make for a bloody campaign, one neither Russians nor Ukrainians have any real desire to pursue.

Russia has large quantities of armoured vehicles, but Ukraine is home to one of the largest weapons black markets in the world, with somewhere between three to six million illegal firearms circulating in the country.

Now Kyiv just received new anti-tank weapons from the U.K. Will these weapons remain a deterrent? Or will they be sold for crypto currencies?
