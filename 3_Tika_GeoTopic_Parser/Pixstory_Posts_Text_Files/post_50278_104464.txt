At the time of my transfer from Bagaha five more dacoits were willing for surrender and several others were sending their representatives for talks about the modalities and doubts The five surrendered before my successor SP immediately after his joining and some others surrendered later Neighbouring Bettiah district also saw the wave of surrender which had started from Bagaha After a few surrenders the main gang leader Bhagar Yadav who had been a terror for a long time surrendered There was no case of kidnapping reported till August in which clearly demonstrated the change Bagaha today has changed Kidnappings are no longer the type of crime in Bagaha The self styled Bihar Sarkar s are no longer to be seen They remain in the memory of the people Some are in jail while others are now leading peaceful lives by lawful means The Experiments in Rohtas Reliving the Ways of Bagaha Thus with the bubbling inspirations gathered from Bagaha and a flair of movements and operations in the jungles I landed in Rohtas The terrain of Bagaha had been very difficult but there had been no incident of any landmine blast by Maoists so far This afforded confidence to the Police to move freely in the most remote and desolate areas of the district On the contrary Rohtas had proved to be a killing field for the police who ventured out against the Maoists The morale of the forces had shaken terribly after the incidents at Dabua More in Nauhatta PS and recent incidents of loot and murder at Rajpur and Baghela Police Stations With a new leader at the helm the forces were also looking for change They needed leadership and were ready to take risks to control the Maoist Menace Concluded
