The Hobbit is a fantasy novel written by J.R.R. Tolkien, the same author responsible for the well known 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. The story takes place in an alternate world of magic and dragons referred to as 'Middle Earth'. Our Main protagonist is a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins who loves nothing more than peace and quiet, that is unexpectedly drug on an adventure by a wizard named Gandalf with a group of dwarves. The story takes place on this adventure, and the hardships the group enduress. 

The book was incredibly entertaining all the way through, and relatively easy to follow throughout most of it. The only real issue I had with it is the descriptions were sometimes lengthy and hard to follow when it came to landscapes and settings, and that sometimes created confusion soon after. 

Overall, it was enjoyable; and there's no question why this story is a classic.
