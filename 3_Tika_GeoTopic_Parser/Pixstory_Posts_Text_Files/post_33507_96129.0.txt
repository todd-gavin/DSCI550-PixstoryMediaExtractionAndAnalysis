The legend of Harish Chandra, king of the solar race is well known. It is believed that his son Rohitaswa spent his time in exile from the kingdom at Rohtas, and also married a local tribal lady here. The Gazetteer records that “The tradition that Rohtas was once the seat of their race lingers among the Kharwars, Oraons and the Cheros; the Kharwars call themselves suryavanshi and allege that, like Rohitaswa, they are descended from the Sun; while the Cheros claim that they held the plateau till they sallied forth for the conquest of Palamu.

Similarly, the Oraons assert that Rohtasgarh originally belonged to their chiefs and was finally wrested from them by the Hindus who surprised them at night during one of their great national festivals, when the men had fallen senseless from intoxication, and only women were left to fight.”


Rock inscription of Sasankadeva :- About the oldest inscription from Rohtas, Dr. D R Patil has given details in his work “the Antiquarian Remains of Bihar”  as follows “ the exact location of the inscription on the hillis not given by Fleet, who noticed it earliest in his well knownwork on Gupta inscriptions. The inscription is in reverse on the rock and the whole, perhaps, according to Fleet, represents a mould or matrix for casting copper seals in relief. The seal matrixis circular in shape, 4 1/4” inches in diameter, and has, in its upper smaller half a damaged figure of a recumbent bull facing to the right. In the lower bigger half is the inscription in Sanskrit, in two lines, which reads Sri-maha samanta Sasanka-devasya. Fleet’s suggestion that the Sasanka of Bengal who killed Rajyavardhana, the elder brother of King Harsha of Kannauj, is generally accepted. He assigned the inscription palaeographically to 7th century AD.”
