Cracking the whip, Congress president Sonia Gandhi has asked the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) presidents of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur to step down in the wake of resounding defeat in the just-concluded assembly elections in these five states. 

Surprisingly, the in-charges of these states have not been asked to submit their resignations and were spared. 

Why so? Is it because one of the in-charges is Priyanka Gandhi Vadra? 

Priyanka Gandhi is general secretary in-charge of the politically important state of Uttar Pradesh. The Congress contested all the 403 seats on its own but managed to bag just two. 

The other in-charges are Harish Choudhary (Punjab), Devendra Yadav (Uttarakhand), Dinesh Gundi Rao (Goa) and Bhakta Charan Das (Manipur). 

Also, these office bearers were assisted in the election management by senior leaders such as P Chidambaram in Goa, Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel in Uttar Pradesh and Jairam Ramesh in Manipur. 

To avoid any action against Priyanka Gandhi, the in-charges seem to have been spared. 

Taking to Twitter, Congress general secretary in-charge of media department Randeep Singh Surjewala said the decision was taken in order to facilitate reorganisation of the state units.

Those sacked are Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, Ganesh Godiyal (Uttarakhand), Girish Chodankar Goa), Loken Singh (Manipur) and Ajay Kumar Lallu (Uttar Pradesh). 

The move comes just two days after the Congress Working Committee (CWC) held a five-hour meeting where leaders urged Sonia Gandhi to continue to lead the party and initiate changes to strengthen the organisation.
