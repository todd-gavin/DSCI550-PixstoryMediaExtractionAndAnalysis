Manchester City have apologized for 'assaulting' Aston Villa goalkeeper Robin Olsen as he walked off the ground after Sunday's game at the Etihad.

Olsen is "totally OK," according to Villa, who confirms he was hit in the back of the head but claims no one knows if the act was intentional or accidental. Villa stated that the subject is now closed and that they would not file a complaint.

Thousands of Man City fans rushed onto the pitch at the Etihad Stadium after Pep Guardiola's team was named Premier League winners in spectacular fashion.

When asked if the players made it off the field safely, Villa manager Steven Gerrard replied: "No, that is not the case." My goalie came under fire. So I believe such inquiries should be directed to Pep and Manchester City. "

Manchester City issued the following statement: "Manchester City would like to express their deepest regret to Aston Villa goalkeeper Robin Olsen, who was attacked by supporters after the game ended tonight."

"The club has begun an emergency inquiry, and the person responsible will face an indefinite stadium ban once discovered."

The Football Association has announced that the pitch invasion will be investigated. Greater Manchester Police has been approached for comment by Sky Sports News.

Following a number of recent high-profile Premier League and EFL matches, fans have rushed onto the pitch, with a Nottingham Forest supporter serving a 24-week sentence for headbutting Sheffield United's Billy Sharp.

On Thursday, Crystal Palace manager Patrick Vieira was involved in a confrontation after Everton fans flooded the ground, and on Sunday, fans flocked to the field after City's 3-2 comeback win against Aston Villa sealed the Premier League championship.

Late in the game, three goals in five minutes by replacement Ilkay Gundogan flipped the game-and the championship chase-on its head. With Liverpool's late win against Wolves, just a win would have sufficed for City.
