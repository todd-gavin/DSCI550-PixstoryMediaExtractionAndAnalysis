Viral infection is a major contributor to the global cancer burden Recent advances have revealed that six known oncogenic viruses promote tumorigenesis through shared host cell targets and pathways Hepatitis Band C Viruses The hepatitis Band C viruses cause liver cancer in humans SV and Polyomavirus Although neither SV nor polyomavirus causes human cancer they are important models for studying the molecular biology of cell transformation SV T antigen induces transformation by interacting with the cellular Rb and p tumor suppressor proteins Papillomaviruses Papillomaviruses induce tumors in a variety of animals including cervical carcinoma in humans Like SV T antigen the transforming proteins of papilloma viruses interact with Rb and p Adenoviruses The adenoviruses do not cause naturally occurring cancers in either humans or other species but are important models in cancer research Their transforming proteins also interact with Rb and p Herpesviruses The herpesviruses which are among the most complex animal viruses cause cancer in several species including humans Retroviruses Retroviruses cause cancer in humans and a variety of other animals Some retroviruses contain specific genes responsible for inducing cell transformation and studies of these highly oncogenic retroviruses have led to the characterization of both viral and cellular oncogenes
