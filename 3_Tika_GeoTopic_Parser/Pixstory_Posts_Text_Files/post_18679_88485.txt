Terrible accident for Marc Marquez during the warm up of the MotoGP Indonesian Grand Prix A fall at the bend of the Mandalika circuit the Spanish motorcyclist was traveling at kilometers per hour when the highside literally unseated him causing him to fall violently to the ground Marquez hit his head but got up with his legs and reached the pits and from the Mataram hospital I&#39;m fine Marquez himself let it be known on social media As a precaution and not to run any further risks we decided not to take part in the Indonesian Grand Prix I want to thank the MotoGP and Mataram hospital medical staff for the way they have looked after me And thank you all for the messages of support
