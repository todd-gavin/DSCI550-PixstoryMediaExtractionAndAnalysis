Sustainability is now the key word for building the future Attention to the environment is something that is expressed on all fronts of everyday life especially within the home where elements such as heating systems play a crucial role on the environmental impact and also on the wallet The high energy emergency of Altroconsumo in recent months clearly demonstrates this in order to identify what will be the most efficient, green and convenient solution in the future together with the consumer organizations of the Czech Republic dTest Poland Federacja Konsumentow Spain OCU and the European umbrella organization BEUC through the project DECARBONIZE HEATING commissioned a study from the economic analysis company Element Energy regarding the best heating options in the near future The analysis estimated the cost of heating in two common conditions a single family house and an apartment in an apartment building and considered three systems different electric heat pumps air-water systems able to heat the house from the floor or via a radiator hybrid electric hydrogen heat pumps and hydrogen boilers the use of these systems has been simulated from the next few years to taking into account their life cycle habitual years and the new regulations that will be applied in the future Furthermore, it was hypothesized that in both conditions work had been done on the insulation of the homes and on the flexibility of the demand for heat capable of reducing the costs of the electricity grid of Taking into account various factors such as the cost of energy or the cost of installing the appliances, it appears that the most convenient and efficient option is electric heating with a heat pump which, according to the analyses, would be between and less expensive than a hydrogen boiler and less than a hybrid. Furthermore, this system it also allows you to save on costs for cooling the house by having this dual integrated function
