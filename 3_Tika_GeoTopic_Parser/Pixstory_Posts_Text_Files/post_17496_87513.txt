Following the loss to the Raptors head coach Frank Vogel said the Lakers not only failed to capitalize on the good looks they created early on but took too much time to figure out how to counter Toronto s defense in general Like any case you can show them the pressure that they play with all you want on film Vogel explained It takes a little time to actually get it and feel it and get used to it You want to be able to hit the ground running but it s a unique defensive style that you re going against It speed us up some and what they want is they want to pressure they want to speed you up and they want to force you into tough decisions I think we had a few possessions like that and a few possessions where we moved the ball and got great looks and missed Second game in a row we just came out shooting the ball really ice cold and it put us behind the eight ball
