 Kicking off with Season 4, Aliens Fireteam Elite introduces several new features and a variety of new content to bring players back for more. Most importantly however, the game is now introducing crossplay features across PC and consoles, as well as adding a new game mode. Introduced in the updates is “Restock Turrets” mode.

In this game type, players are tasked with having to keep their turrets restocked so they can keep firing on the waves of Xenomorphs coming from all directions. The mode relies on player cooperation to keep things going smoothly.

After clearing out everything that Fireteam Elite has to offer, for those who seek additional challenges look up to the new Prestige system. Once you reach level 20, all experience points earned go towards your Prestige rank, which runs from a scale of 1-100. Every 10 Prestige levels, players are rewarded with new outfits, gun colours, decals, emotes and more.

The new update adds four new toys for your marines, including the double-shot burst M51 Breaching Scattergun, the P.649 HEL, a fully automatic sniper rifle in the SVAT-92 Sokol, and the shotgun-like DKT-59 Misha handgun.

That’s in addition to the new Fabrication Reprocessor, which allows you to take 3 Challenge Cards and re-roll them to create one new card. This all leads up to Aliens: Fireteam Elite‘s first expansion, titled Pathogen, which arrives August 30th.
