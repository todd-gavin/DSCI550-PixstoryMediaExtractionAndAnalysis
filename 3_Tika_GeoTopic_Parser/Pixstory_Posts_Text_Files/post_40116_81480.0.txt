The water cycle is a natural processof converting the water particles from liquids, to solids and gasses and repeating itâ€™s self on an annual basis (association, 2002). These processes may also been known as evaporation and transportation, condensation, precipitation and accumulation. The cycle continues to repeat itself. This process has been happening since the beginning of time, and plays a major part in our eco system, for example, evaporation is wheresunâ€™s heat accelerates the particles in rivers, oceans, lakes ECT changing them from their liquid form to gasses known as vapours. These vapours are raised into the sky to create clouds. Past the point of evaporation they then begin the process of condensation, which is where the clouds begin to cool allowing the particles to regather and form a liquid. Depending on how cluttered the particles are the liquid will then begin to fall as either, rain, hail or snow, this is known as precipitation. Finally the collection, collection is where the rivers, oceans, lakes ECT will collect the water. Once all four stages are complete the cycle will than renew its self and start again. The advantages from the water cycle are that the earthâ€™s population doesnâ€™t have to produce any more water than what we already have because we use the same water. Provides water for our population, animals and plants. Provides fish to eat. Evaporation and infiltration help to remove impurities from water.Plants also help animals to live, but the water cycle helps all. The water cycle produces precipitation to create rivers,lakes, and even oceans. Water is probably the most important component of any ecosystem. All living organisms need water to grow and live.The water cycle is an extremely important process because it enables the availability of water for all living organisms and regulates weather patterns on our planet. If water didnâ€™t naturally recycle itself, we would run out of clean water, which is essential to lifeðŸ’¯
