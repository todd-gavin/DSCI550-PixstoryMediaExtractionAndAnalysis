Football is changing rapidly-from the 1980s, to the 2000s and now it's an all new version of football. Modern football is more of attacking as most clubs and teams prefer to use 4-3-3 and 3-4-3, transitions are faster than earlier. In this modern day football, a particular position stands up with importance- Full Backs. 

End to End

Fullbacks are everywhere now - scoring, defending, possession. They move from one end of the pitch till the opposite end, weaving the attack, giving important assists and in the meantime, they are inevitable in the defence line also. The players at fullback/wingback positions need high endurance and pace now. 

Players of the Season. 

Out of 8 players nominated for Player of the season in Premiere league, 2 were full backs- Jao Cancelo of Manchester City and Alex-arnold of Liverpool. Also, Alex-Arnold is considered to be the most valuable defender in the Premier league not just for his defending skills but also being the assist king of Liverpool. 12 assists in 2021-22 season, 7 in 2020-21 and 13 in 2019-20. Cancelo plays on both wings, giving options for Pep in their 2-3-2-3 system.

The "Fullback"

The terminology came from the past, where it was used 2-3-5 formations, the last 2 defenders always stayed as back. Then, they were pushed to wings/sides and Centre Backs became main defenders in 4-4-2, 4-5-1 systems. In 4-4-2 formations, 20 years ago, we have seen midfielers ruling the game. Controlling the game, making important decisions, runs, assists, and fullbacks like Gary Neville in the 2002 season would stay as defender and sometimes go up for a few crosses. But, inverted fullbacks would be used as playmakers. 


If you look at teams closer, teams with best full backs have better results. Ashraf Hakimi of PSG, Dumfries of Inter Milan, Alphonso Davies of Bayern Munich are a few of those names. We have seen this season, Chelsea struggling when Reece James and Ben Chilwell went out injured and slipped from top spot.
