I just finished watching Rowan Atkinson s web series Man vs Bee on Netflix and after watching the show I just want to say that this show is either for children who watch the web series without finding logic in it and get entertained or for those adults who want to see Rowan Atkinson back in Mr Bean kind of role There is a total of nine episodes in the web series and the length of the longest episode is minutes and the remaining episodes are of around minutes So you can finish the whole show in around one and a half hours The story of the show revolves around Rowan Atkinson s character Trevor and his struggle as a home keeper because one bee entered the house and irritates him every time and this is the whole conflict of the show The battle between Trevor and Bee brings laughter to the show and because of the battle many antiques of the house also get broken each episode brings a new challenge in front of Trevor and how he will tackle the bee will hook you to watch the show But when the owner of the house returned and they saw the condition of the house they sue Trevor and the court announced three years of jail for Trevor Will Trevor serve the three year sentence or any twist will change the things To know all the answers you have to watch the show So if you have nothing to do and nothing to watch on OTT platforms then Man vs Bee should be on your watchlist
