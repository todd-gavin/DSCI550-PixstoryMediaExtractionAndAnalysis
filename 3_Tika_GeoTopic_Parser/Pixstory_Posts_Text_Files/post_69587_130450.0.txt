Bhag Sar is an oval-shaped lake that is 3700 metres above sea level. Among the lakes in the Budhal Mountains, it is the highest. The lake has an area of about 0.73 sqkms, with a length of 1507m and width equal to 659m. Due to the fact that icebergs surround it on all four sides, Bhag Sar is one of the inaccessible lakes. To approach this lake one has to skirt around the Chamar Sar from the left side and then ascend the glacier up to 4000m from where the lake is visible. This lake is one among the dozen of alpine lakes there in vicinity and itâ€™s a thing of beauty.
