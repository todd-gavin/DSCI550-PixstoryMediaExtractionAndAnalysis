You should not expect that you will be getting chances to take free kicks and Penalty kicks after joining a new football club. 
Every club have their own free kick and penalty specialist according to the manager tactics. 
The club authority and the coaches will not trust you as you are a fresh player for them. They are not aware of your weakness and your attributes. 
So stop expecting this that only you will get the penalty kicks and Free kicks and never fight to your team mates regarding to this as it will create a bad image of your character inside the field to the coaches. 
Instead show them that you are worth it. Prove them that there is no one in the squad which can score better penalties or can take better free kicks than you. 
Improve and flex your good traits in the practice ground to make the management believe in you and this newly developed trust will increase the chances of you to get every Penalty and Free kick.
Did you ever felt that why you are not getting chances to take free kicks and penalties in the match day ? 
Let me know in the notes...
