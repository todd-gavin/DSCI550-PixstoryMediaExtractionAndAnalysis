The "Cockney School" refers to a group of poets and essayists writing in England in the second and third decades of the 19th century.

 The term came in the form of hostile reviews in Blackwood's Magazine in 1817. Its primary target was Leigh Hunt, but John Keats and William Hazlitt were also included. Only Keats could properly be regarded as a cockney. Hazlitt was not even born in London. John Scott died after a duel over the controversy.

Leigh Hunt the supposed chief offender of the "Cockney School." Each of the writers was derided for a slightly different quality. Keats, for example, was accused of "low diction" for rhyming "thorns/fawns" in "Sleep and Poetry" and other rhymes which suggested a working-class speech. 

Hunt and Hazlitt were similarly vilified for their diction, but the criticisms were more ideological with them than with Keats.
