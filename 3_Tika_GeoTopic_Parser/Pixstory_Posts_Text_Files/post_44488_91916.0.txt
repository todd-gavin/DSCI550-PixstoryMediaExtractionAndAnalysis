In accordance with league rules, the team has lodged an appeal to reverse their defeat.
Freiburg have filed an appeal against Bayern Munich's 4-1 loss after the Bundesliga champions
used a 12th man in the second half.

A mix-up in Julian Nagelsmann's substitutions resulted in an extra player entering the field late
in the game, causing a lengthy delay in resolving the situation. Bayern went on to win, but their
opponents have announced that they will appeal the result, claiming that they should not have
had to take the case to court themselves.

"We are in a dilemma through no fault of our own," read an official club statement. "Freiburg had
no part or influence on the events surrounding the process. Nevertheless, the legal and
procedural rules of the DFB formally force us to play an active role in order to have the
processes legally checked.

"Ultimately, it burdens the completely uninvolved club - in this case us - with the responsibility
for processing an obvious violation of the rules. Nevertheless, after intensive discussions at
different levels and a legal examination, the board of Freiburg [has] decided to appeal against
the result of the game."

Bayern Munich's win at Europa-Park Stadion was overshadowed by a lengthy delay to deal with
the arrival of Niklas Sule and Kingsley Coman, as well as a brief moment when the visitors had
an extra body on the pitch.

According to DFB rules, if the responsible side is proven to be in violation, the result should be
forfeited, however head referee Christian Dingert later stated that the match officials were to
blame.

It remains to be seen whether Freiburg's appeal to take the points is successful, but with the
club solidly in the top-four fight for the Champions League, they will be hoping that the
regulations are applied as originally recommended.
