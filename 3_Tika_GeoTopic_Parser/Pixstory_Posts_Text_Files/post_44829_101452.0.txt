Arsenal has stated that the Emirates Stadium would host "at least" six women's team matches
during the 2022/23 season, up from four in the current season.

The Gunners usually play at Meadow Park in Borehamwood, but the considerably bigger
Emirates Stadium, at the core of the club's north London identity, has become home.

Three of the club's 11 WSL home games, as well as all three Champions’ League group games,
will be held in the 60,000-seat facility. In addition, we want to play all three UWCL group stage
matches at Emirates Stadium, pending our performance in Round 2 of UEFA Women's
Champions League qualifying.

Arsenal played Chelsea and Tottenham in WSL derbies at the Emirates this season in front of
8,700 and 13,400 spectators, respectively. More than 12,000 people watched the Champions’ League group match versus Barcelona in Europe, with another 5,000 watching the quarter-final
first leg against Wolfsburg.

Barcelona has upped the standard across Europe by packing Camp Nou for back-to-back
Champions League knockout games against Real Madrid and Wolfsburg this season.

"It's fantastic news that we'll be playing more games at Emirates Stadium next year, and we
can't wait to see our supporters there and at Meadow Park very soon," manager Jonas Eidevall
said on the club's official website.

"The support we received [over 2021/22] at both Meadow Park and Emirates Stadium was
incredible." We are all members of one team—one family, whether we are spectators or
participants in the game. That is what distinguishes this club. "

Arsenal Women's season tickets for 2022/23 include admission to all three WSL games at the
Emirates Stadium. Season ticket holders for the men's team will be able to purchase a 'bolt on'
that will allow them to attend all six women's games at the stadium.
