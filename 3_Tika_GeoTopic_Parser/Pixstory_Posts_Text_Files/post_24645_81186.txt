On th February Wolverhampton Wanderers won against Tottenham Hotspur strengthening their chances of a top finish For a side who lost their manager and arguably best player last summer their performances have been remarkable Just how has unfancied Bruno Lage made the difference For all of his good work Nuno Esp rito Santo s last season had been disappointing Injuries and a small squad meant Wolves finished th in The fans were a bit underwhelmed when Bruno Lage a manager who had mostly coached youth teams before was appointed as Santo s successor After consecutive losses to begin the new season some fears seemed justified But with Wolves producing a higher xG than their opponents in each of those matches a rise in fortunes seemed inevitable It did happen with Wolves losing just of their next games conceding just goals in the process What exactly was responsible for the turnaround Lage initially played a fluid at the back system which yielded no goals or points He then decided to stick to the basics a defensively solid man backline which the players were very accustomed to playing The results were instantaneous Wolves currently have the joint nd best defence in Europe The man defensive structure not only suits the regular starters but also players coming through the ranks In the Wolves academy the and systems are used As a result academy players like Max Kilman have been the standout defenders in England this season Then there is the signing of goalkeeper Jos S His predecessor Rui Patricio had quite a mediocre season conceding goals more than xGA S has clearly been an upgrade The Portuguese sweeper keeper has already prevented more goals than xGA and claimed the nd most crosses in the PL His commanding performances has instilled even more confidence among the Wolves defenders With a relative lack of squad depth and a lot of football still to play a top finish seems unlikely But if Wolves manage to maintain performance levels this might go down as one of the best defensive seasons in Premier League history
