I ve known manika marwah for as long as I ve known myself we met in our kindergarten classrooms at the age of Like all my friendships at that age ours was sparked by my mom and Manika s dad deciding we needed to be a part of each other s lives In those days mom sometimes put in an extra effort to protect the loneliness that could come from being among the most reserved kids in class But once I got to know someone I would unleash the unstoppable force of my excitement jumping all over the place Manika and I made full use of our surroundings from spying on my sister through the gaps of our bunk bed to confronting her endless doll collection the stories we created in the boundaries of one room were boundless The eight hours of sitting next to each other in school were followed by an alternating home for an afternoon of soda tang mamma mia marathons limca spurting up our nose and contests to see who could best tolerate spice Manika always won The more I pull at my memory thread the more stories unravel our relationship is as long as our lives Whether it s disconnecting with the world by deleting all apps on my phone or spilling the most overwhelming moments as I grappled to embrace my transness from Delhi to Seoul to Vancouver then Toronto Manika has seen it all unwaveringly by my side Here s another moment of her being unwaveringly by my side
