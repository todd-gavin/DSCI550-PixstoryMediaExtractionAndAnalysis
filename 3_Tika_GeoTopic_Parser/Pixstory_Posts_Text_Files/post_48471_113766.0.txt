I have many times heard people say prayers don't work because they're not being answered by God. But that's far from the truth. Prayers are answered, you just don't know in what ways.

Sometimes we need to be transformed before we can receive what we desire. Sometimes we are unrepentant or disobedient, or we treasure iniquity in our hearts, or we lack confidence, or we ask for things we shouldn't have, or we elevate the object we're asking for above God Himself and make it an idol.

—“And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that, no matter what it is that we ask according to his will, he hears us.” 1 John 5:14 NWT

Our prayers must be "according to his will," according to the text, in order to be heard.
Anyone who genuinely pursues God in prayer is not ignored by God. He does, however, have some demands that must be fulfilled.

—“Jehovah is far from the wicked, But he heareth the prayer of the righteous.” Proverbs 15:29 ASV

Yes isn't always the answer to our prayers. That is something we must comprehend and accept. We should not constantly be asking God for something when we pray. We should pray for our enemies, for one another, and for what we have, among other things.

The only times I'm aware of God ignoring his children is when they have iniquity in their hearts. So, what does that imply? Iniquity is a broad term that encompasses anything from idolatry to mischief and wickedness. So, if you truly believe God is ignoring you, ask Him to cleanse your heart and instruct you to follow on His chosen way. This is a prayer that God will always hear if it comes from a really humble heart. It is, in reality, the prayer that He is listening to.
