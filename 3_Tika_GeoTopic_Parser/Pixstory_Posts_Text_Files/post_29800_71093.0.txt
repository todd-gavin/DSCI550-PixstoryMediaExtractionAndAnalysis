People r making so big wishes and big goals that they forgot sometimes small things can help them to get relief of thier tired day..no no I am not talking about chocolate but indian street food..I know u to got picture of ur fav indian street food..samosa, dosa, jalebi , etc. they are spicy and taste just shows this can be available anywhere other than indian..when ever I travel this little golgapas excites me and I stop and finish them..so if u also feel trapped from indian amazing street food then just go for it..save food . I am happy with my little excitements
