The Black female Duke volleyball player who accused a fan at BYU of calling her the n word and threatening her at every serve she made was found to have no merit after a study was conducted by BYU When I first heard of this story and did research it became evidently clear that this was going to be a hoax Like the Jussie Smollett and Bubba Wallace racism hoaxes this too is turning out to be yet another desperate attempt for a person to gain prominence and fame Just think about it BYU is a Mormon school with a Mormon population of over Mormons particularly ones who attend private Christian schools surrounded by people of the same faith are generally considered to be benevolent people hardly those who throw around racially charged language in public In addition to this security guards people who have absolutely no stake in whether the person who allegedly said the threatening language is punished said they never heard it If this was occurring on multiple occasions they would have heard it Furthermore the volleyball arena is not large at all A person yelling the n word would surely be heard by many and nowadays it is extremely unlikely that someone hurling racial epithets in public like that wouldn t be shamed immediately by the crowd Finally the godmother of the volleyball player is currently a candidate for office This incident gave her the exposure she needs to win The media fell into the same trap again They heard a story about white people being racist and they ran with it They never waited for an investigation BYU is not innocent either they immediately without investigation banned the suspect and subsequently unbanned him after the investigation and issued a statement condemning what he did And to make matters worse the Duke volleyball team put out a statement following the investigation results implying that they still believe their player
