Arsenal began their Premier League campaign in some style winning their opening five games rather convincingly Sure they had conceded against Leicester Fulham and Aston Villa but they were never behind for more than eight minutes in either of those games and even if they were not at their sublime best they were grinding out victories like all top teams do Naturally their perfect start drew comparisons to a certain Arsenal side of years gone by and while rivals were quick to rub salt in the wounds when they succumbed to Manchester United in week six it is simply astounding how anyone can even dream of going unbeaten for an entire season Such a feat should be perpetually out of reach and we only have The Gunners to thank for bringing it into the realm of possibility We are of course referring to The Invincibles the immortal Arsenal side of that stood aloft with their golden trophies Before them the only English side to go unbeaten was Preston North End in but for a side to do this in the modern era was unthinkable The standard and quality had always been assumed to be too strong but even with the odds stacked against them the worst ever result that Arsene Wenger s side faced was a draw This happened times and even though that is nearly a third of a season Arsenal picked up wins racking up points in the process The quality in that side was undoubted with Thierry Henry leading an attack consisting of Dennis Bergkamp Robert Pires and Freddie Ljungberg It is unsurprising that they scored the most goals in the league but with Patrick Vieira and Gilberto Silva sat ahead of the defense consisting of Sol Campbell Kolo Toure Ashely Cole and Lauren and with Jens Lehmann in goal it was no wonder that they conceded the least too Dominant in every sense of the word Few have tried to join them and while that side has made others believe the fact remains that they are the only ones that can lay claim to such an honor in the modern era
