Just another bad day All I can do is just pray I still keep searching for you I wish you could ever knew I m like a bird imprisoned in a cage and not free Losing you completely ruined me I scream and cry Please free me I want to fly I m not able to move on Since the day you ve gone They are making me a target And always carpet I too want to feel The pleasant smell when the pain will heal K You left me in the dark But I again want the life to embark I once wished for the drugs But I knew there were many thugs Now I prefer the silence So to stop the violence Just another bad day All I can do is just pray nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp Toiba
