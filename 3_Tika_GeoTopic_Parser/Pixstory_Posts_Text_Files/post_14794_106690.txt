Speaking today in La Stampa, the Minister of Health Roberto Speranza in reference to Mario&#39;s need to pay around euros for the instrumentation necessary for assisted suicide writes that it is not conceivable that the costs are borne by the patient and that on this aspect the Government, wherever there is it is necessary not to miss a timely clarification and intervention While renewing our gratitude for the direct interest on the part of Minister Speranza, we cannot fail to notice that the Minister seems to confuse the future with the past, Filomena Gallo and Marco Cappato of the Luca Coscioni Association reply, in fact Mario has already had to disburse the covers from the public fundraising launched by the Luca Coscioni Association It is therefore not a question of hypothesizing a Government intervention where needed It is, if anything, a question of implementing compensation and issuing precise directives so that an episode of this kind does not happen again. what we have been asking the Government for months In the absence of a ministerial circular, the Regional Health Services can continue with impunity the boycott of the Cappato Antoniani sentence of the Constitutional Court which has been in force for almost three years without ever being applied Parliamentary inertia cannot and must not work as an alibi for disapplying the rules in force established by the Consulta We ask Minister Roberto Speranza and the Government to take action against the inertia of the Regional Health Authorities through their powers so that no sick person ever has to wait for Fabio di Antonio who has been waiting for months by Mario who waited months to receive the opinions required by the sentence of the Constitutional Court assisted chose to put an end to his suffering through deep and continuous sedation Participate for the Luca Coscioni Association Matteo Mainardi Coordinator of the Legal Euthanasia campaign
