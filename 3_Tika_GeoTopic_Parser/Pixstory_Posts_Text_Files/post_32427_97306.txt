An atrocious joke for the reigning Olympic champion Italian mixed curling team. Victories in the group weren&#39;t enough to qualify for the playoff phase of the world championships. In fact, success with Finland arrived today but the results from the other tracks condemned the Azzurri Stefania Constantini and Sebastiano Arman who replaced the starter Amos Mosaner in these World Cups Switzerland, Sweden and Norway all qualified for the playoffs with seven wins and two defeats, while Scotland, Canada and Germany are in the other group. Italy ends its world championship experience in seventh place
