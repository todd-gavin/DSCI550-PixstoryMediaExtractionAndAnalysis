These days, its just not the price of petrol that has increased, but the queue that we have to make are also increased multiple-folds.

The idea of being in queue has always been there in our traditions.
Past few years, it was queue for Hospital beds, before that queues in front of ATMs, and before that it was something else.
Nothing has changed apart from the reason  for standing in queues.

This has become a trend as well. People stand in long lines for multiple reasons, be it getting tickets for movies, or getting a token at metro station, or standing before water slide and waiting for your turn.

Deapite India being digitally feasible, we are still not able to forget our traditional values and start doing things digitally. I mean following traditions is the "India Culture".
