It s not that everyone who agrees to follow certain conformities forces themselves to do it Maybe for them it s the most carefree way to lead their lives instead of agreeing to do what others are doing could be a choice and is not always related to following the majority blindly Besides it s up to people how they choose to eat or dine but maybe the dining etiquettes are inherently present in them and they feel happy to eat their food perfectly it could be their source of enjoyment I don t think these mere things would put confinements on anyone or stress them It is somewhat personal nature of some people who can even consider these behaviours as adhering to conformities and think they re compelled to do it Not all of us are eccentrics who would choose to do things in a somewhat different or unique way which is apparently odd Moreover I think eccentrics have behaviours that are directly related to their mental state or could be a disorder Furthermore stressing over things is a knack of some people who can think about every situation negatively and would consider such mere behaviours as adhering to the conventions I disagree with your point
