Kabhi-Kabhi

( A translation of Sahir’s original version of the poem)

At times, I do wonder…..

That I could have passed my days  in the shadow of your cascading tresses,

This darkness that is now my irrevocable fate - could it not have been dispersed by the shine of your luminous eyes;

True, I have been naive to the ways of the world- yet could I have not lost myself in the radiance of your beauty,

And when barbs were being aimed at me by all and sundry- could I not have found refuge in the sweetness of your lips,

But that was not to be;

And now it has come to pass
That neither you, nor your grief nor the desire for anyone’s crutches is there,

Caught as I am in this vortex of despair,
Dark shadows leap at me from the thorns of life and death,

No way can I see, nor the end, nor any glimmer of hope,

Lost am I in these dungeons of darkness,
I know all this, my love, yet sometimes I do wonder….

( This is not a literal translation. The original poem is very different from the song in the film version and has far from pathos)
