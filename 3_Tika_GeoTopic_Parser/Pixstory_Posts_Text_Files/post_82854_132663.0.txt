I'm a Senior National Level Weightlifter. I'm from Chungi Laging which is a village in Assam. There was not a platform or an avenue for weightlifting in my village. I started athletics when I was in college. I started weightlifting in 2015 when I was studying in Jorhat College. I could train for one month during that time because I had to travel between districts and during college this wasn't a regular possibility. During that time a college professor told me either to leave weightlifting or leave college. I told her that I'll do both and won't leave anything behind. I also trained in the college gym during that time. I got selected in the junior nationals around that time and I won the gold medal in 2016. In the recent National Tournament I managed to secure the Bronze medal.
The youngsters in my village are very powerful and they can do wonders in weightlifting but they don't get the right exposure or platform to showcase their talent. In weightlifting, here in India there are equal opportunities for both men and women I believe, that's what I have felt. My father is a farmer and due to financial distress, I had to support my own training. During that time I used to work in a shop in the town. I used to give all my monthly income to my coaches. I really believe in myself, I feel that I can go and compete in the International level but I believe need to ger the right support. By that I mean funds for my training and proper diet so that I can focus solely on my training.
