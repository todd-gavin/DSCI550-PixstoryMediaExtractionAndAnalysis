Nitrous oxide is not the biggest or most well-known greenhouse gas—it only accounts for about 6% of total human-caused emissions—but it is dangerously potent. Nitrous oxide emissions remain in the atmosphere for about 100 years before natural processes can break it down, and the compound is 300 times more powerful at driving the greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide.

Since 1980, plant and animal agriculture has been responsible for almost two-thirds of human-caused nitrous oxide emissions. And, once again, animal waste is a huge culprit. Factory farm operations generate so much animal waste that they don’t know what to do with it: some of it goes back to the soil in the form of manure, while some of it sits in cesspools of waste known as “factory farm lagoons.” No matter where it goes, all of this waste results in nitrous oxide emissions, which pollute the atmosphere and accelerate climate change. By eliminating your meat consumption, you can stop the ongoing spread of pollution from factory farms.
