Emergency contraception like other forms of birth control prevents you from becoming pregnant The only distinction is that it is to be taken only after sex Emergency contraception can be effective but it is not a replacement for regular birth control Regular birth control is more effective less expensive and has fewer side effects Emergency contraception as the name implies is only for emergencies and should not be used on a regular basis What are the types of emergency contraception methods The emergency contraceptive pill ECP or the morning after pill The morning after pill is a sort of emergency contraception birth control intended to prevent pregnancy in women who have had unprotected sex or whose birth control method has failed The ECP should only be used as a backup and not as the primary method of birth control because long term or frequent exposure to the amount of levonorgestrel present in the pill can cause irregular or absent periods For the emergency contraceptive pill to be effective you must take the pill within days after unprotected sex the sooner you take it the better The Copper T Intrauterine Device IUD An Copper T IUD is a tiny T shaped device made of copper that is placed in your uterus to prevent pregnancy For the Copper T to be effective as a form of emergency contraception it must be placed within days after unprotected sex The IUD is more effective than the pill at preventing pregnancy Just around of women who use the IUD become pregnant If you re using the IUD as an emergency contraceptive you can keep it in and utilise it as your usual method When the IUD is placed you may experience some discomfort although medications can help Your periods can be longer shorter heavier or lighter if you use the IUD as a regular method of contraception Morning after pills do not prevent an already implanted pregnancy They typically function by suppressing or postponing ovulation Please note that the abortion pill is not the same as the morning after pill Sources
