Leonardo DiCaprio and Camila Morrone are going their separate ways.
The 47-year-old Academy Award-winning actor and the 25-year-old model and actress have ended their relationship after four years .
The couple, who kept their relationship largely private, had been linked since being spotted together in Aspen, Col. in January of 2018, and they made their official debut as a couple at the Oscars in 2020.
The last time they were spotted out together was over the Fourth of July weekend, in Malibu, Calif. Earlier this summer, Leo vacationed around Europe on a yacht where he was spotted hanging out with a fellow Oscar-winning actor.
Camila was recently seen on vacation with her mother in St. Tropez.
A few years ago, she addressed their much-buzzed about age gap: “There’s so many relationships in Hollywood — and in the history of the world — where people have large age gaps. I just think anyone should be able to date who they want to date," she said at the time.
