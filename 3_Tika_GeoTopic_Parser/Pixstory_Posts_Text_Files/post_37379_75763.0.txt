These are some of the famous lines of Quackity aka Alexis (Alex) and this lines have been turned into tiktok audios??

Anyways Quackity is a video creator who streams minecraft and various other games on his channel. He is most famously known for his "Discord Got Talent" videos on youtube.

I started watching Alex around late 2018s when his "Tech Support Scammer" videos went viral. What a time it was! 🛐

I love Alex's humour. His videos are so funny that whenever I feel stressed or low, after watching his videos my mood becomes so much better!!! The energy and vibes he shares in his videos are immaculate. He is a shot of expresso to me. 🥰

I would recommend you to watch his fnaf, minecraft, tech support scammer streams on youtube. I bet you would get addicted to him! 🤞
