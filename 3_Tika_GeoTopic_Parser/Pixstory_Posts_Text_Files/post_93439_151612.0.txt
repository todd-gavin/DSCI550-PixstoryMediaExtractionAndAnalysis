An Instagram profile Bot Hard sparks Artificial vs Human intelligence debate in form of Rap Battle
An Instagram profile of an AI based Bot called Bot Hard has been featured in the ongoing rap show MTV Hustle 2.0  and claims to be taking over the social media as the "World's Best Rapper." 
The profile seems to be a publicity stunt for the show as it is being tagged in multiple stories and posts by the official pages of MTV India, MTV Hustle 2.0, the host Krissann Barretto, Judge Badshah, squad Bosses- EPR, DeeMC, Dino James, and King and the contestants. The name Bot hard is an intended pun which connects the popular phrase "bohot hard" which is used by rappers in appreciation of a good rap to the bot that has been created to write raps. The MTV channel has not directly claimed the bot hard profile but it is a profile that was created in 2018, has changed its username in the past 90 days and has made its first post on 22nd September while the show was in its third week of format and has only made posts related to the show.
The youth oriented show has taken notes from the historical rap battle between Emiway Bantai and Raftaar that divided the hiphop community of India and its followers into two teams and gained a lot of traction back in 2018, especially amongst the youth and sparked a rap battle between the AI based Bot and the popular rappers in hope to popularise hiphop in India even more. 
It intends to interact with the youth over Instagram, wherein users can send words on direct message and the bot will create a rap song and send it to them in video format within seconds. It also shares a disclaimer, "I auto-generate rap songs based on all the content on the internet. So, make sure to screen the video for offensive words before you share this video. You are fully responsible for the content you share and ensure that it doesn’t offend any person or communities," bringing out the functioning and setbacks of the bot.
