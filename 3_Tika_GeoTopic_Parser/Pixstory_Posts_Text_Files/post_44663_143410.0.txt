The Forward Policy and ‘Operation ONKAR’begins...
In September 1959 China had laid formal claim to 80,000 sq kms of 
territory which India believed to be hers, in Ladakh in the west and in 
Arunachal Pradesh in the east. In the east, the Chinese, even though 
they did not accept the McMahon Line, had kept their border posts on 
their own side of their own interpretation of the McMahon Line. The 
Indian interpretation of the line, however, differed from that of the 
Chinese in some areas, notably in the Kameng area. There, at places, 
the Indian interpretation was further ‘forward’ than the Chinese 
interpretation of it.
One of India’s policy responses to the increasing possibility of 
military problems arising with China was to send the 4 Infantry Division, the Western Command Reserve Division, normally based concentrated at Ambala, to NEFA. With its principal fighting 
component, its three integral infantry brigades, 5 Infantry Brigade, 7 
Infantry Brigade, and 11 Infantry Brigade, each of three infantry 
battalions, it was dispatched eastwards to the Brahmaputra River valley 
in Assam in November 1959. This was despite the absence of any 
logistical set-up for deploying the division in NEFA. The entire NEFA 
was at the time a roadless wilderness. 11 Brigade was sent to Sikkim, 7 
Brigade was made responsible for the Kameng Frontier Division of 
NEFA, and 5 Brigade was assigned the responsibility for the rest of 
2 NEFA. 4 Division established its HQ at Tezpur. It was to function under 
33 Corps, whose HQ was at Shillong, and which was responsible for the 
entire North-Eastern region: Sikkim, NEFA, the India-Burma border, 
the India-East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) border, and Nagaland.
