That very feeling you shunned away, is raging to come out. Know The light within will always win; simply because you choose to be more . You’re more than just being average! All the pain and hurt you went through was to show you how big you really are. Continue to be good, be love and be light❤️🌹

You are more, my loves. Continue you to heal and love with pure genuine intentions. I love you❤️
