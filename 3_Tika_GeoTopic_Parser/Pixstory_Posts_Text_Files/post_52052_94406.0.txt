A blonde beauty dubbed the world’s hottest trucker has slammed body shamers who she says want her out of the industry due to her $150,000-a-year OnlyFans side hustle.

With her golden locks, sapphire eyes and feminine physique, Blayze Williams is used to turning heads while sitting behind the wheel of some of the globe’s largest trucks

With a decade of trucking experience, the 29-year-old from Adelaide is no stranger to unsolicited comments about her appearance.

And she wasn’t fazed when she began selling lewd content on subscription site OnlyFans in 2020.

But after finding success with the lucrative career, Blayze says she has been inundated with body shaming comments and discrimination from people in and out of the trucking industry who she claims want her out.

“Before I started OnlyFans, I feel like I was admired a lot more, but now I’m getting lots of hate and body shaming comments from people assuming I’m a prostitute,” Blayze said.

“All I do is sell photographs and video to people who are interested in seeing it.

“I’m not out there actually sleeping with anyone or performing sex acts, but even if I was, why should it matter?

“I’m a great trucker and I’m good at my job, that’s why I’ve been doing it for a decade.

“But I’ve had such negative comments, most of the time from other females, who tell me I shouldn’t be a truck driver and that you can’t be sexy and drive trucks.

“I’ve even had people in the industry tell me they don’t want me to represent them.

“It feels like they’re trying to stop me from trucking, but that will never happen.

“I absolutely love what I do, and I’ll never stop.”

Blayza says the OnlyFans income gives her the freedom to “take a breath” and not overwork herself.

“I’m always getting slut shamed and discriminated against because of how I look,” she said.

“Honestly, most of the hate is coming from women, which is always so disappointing.

“Women need to be supporting each other no matter what, not pulling each other down.
