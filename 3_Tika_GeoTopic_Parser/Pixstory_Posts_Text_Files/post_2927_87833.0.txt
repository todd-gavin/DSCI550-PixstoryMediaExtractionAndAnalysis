Americans spring forward and fall back with their clock-changing twice a year. Meant to save daylight, this biannual adjustment has its pluses, but also drawbacks. This week, the Senate has voted unanimously on a proposal to do away with resetting the clock. 

The Sunshine Protection Act aims to ensure that Americans will never have to set their clocks back an hour and lose an hour of afternoon daylight in the fall and winter. If approved by the House and signed by the President, it will come into effect after November 2023. 

Time-keeping in the US has a long and chequered history. Polymath Benjamin Franklin was among those who had suggested it way back in the 18th century. Clock change was introduced in 1918 to save energy in the aftermath of World War 1, but the measure was soon withdrawn. In 1966, the biannual change resume, with a break during 1974-75. Except for Hawaii and parts of Arizona, the US has been used to this system for long. It adjusts working hours to the availability of daylight which changes from season to season.

However, most citizens have apparently come to loathe it: https://apnews.com/article/in-state-wire-az-state-wire-wa-state-wire-or-state-wire-mo-state-wire-646ec1987f44402da127388f3e287c92

Why? The body clock has to make adjustments twice a year, which increases risks of heart attacks and strokes, according to researchers. Worker productivity has come down and traffic accidents have increased: https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/can-we-fix-daylight-saving-time-for-good 

Senator Marco Rubio (Republican, Florida), the lead sponsor of the bill, mentioned these side effects, when he introduced the bill: https://thehill.com/video/in-the-news/598409-explainer-what-would-a-permanent-daylight-saving-time-look-like

“One has to ask themselves after a while: Why do we keep doing it? The majority of the American people’s preference is just to stop the back-and-forth changing,” he said: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/us/politics/daylight-saving-time-senate.html Permanently switching to the single time-keeping system would reduce seasonal depression, lessen crime, and encourage children to do outdoor activities, he argued.

The bill came up right after the readjustment weekend, and senators – like the rest of the citizens – must have been suffering from effects of having one hour fewer of sleep, prompting a unanimous vote.
