I ve been waiting for this day that when someone asks me to introduce myself they are not expecting to hear about my academic achievements where I completed my education from or where I m from It s refreshing and also an opportunity for a person like me who doesn t talk about herself much to come out of my shell I m not the kind of person who can talk freely about myself to strangers or acquaintances or even friends unless asked To push me out of my comfort zone is the way to make myself better I m a very good listener though I m a therapist to my best friend and sometimes English Coach Relationship Expert and Career Consultant and putting myself in others shoes and understanding them comes naturally to me According to me one s taste in book tells a lot about them so to describe me I ll tell you about my taste that is fiction If there is one thing that can describe me greatly is my love for fiction It s not the love for the book or author but for the world they create and my need to get lost in it There are so many endless possibilities inside fiction and if you have the ability to get lost in a book you can experience all of it There do exists lots of specifics though you can t like every fiction book but if you ever want to discuss about any novel manga or webtoon I ll be always up for it This is it a glimpse of what constitutes me
