Certainly, motherhood is about new life, renewed love, bonding, and affection, but it also brings about so many challenges and difficulties, one of them being the challenges of breastfeeding.

In the early months, it is a very common situation for the mothers to try and establish a proper latching and feeding pattern. And often, it can result in soreness and irritation in the nipples. This may also happen in the later phases when the sucking becomes stronger and teeth start to arrive.When the breasts are engorged, and the nipples are sensitive to touch, even a little bite or a hungry tug at your boobs can make you scream in pain.

Though soreness and pain in nipples is a common occurrence, it should not last too long, otherwise, it can negatively affect the mother-child bonding, and make the feeding sessions painful and stress-ridden.So, how can you minimise the pain and make breastfeeding a delightful affair for you and your baby?

Here we are presenting you with some tips and ways of effectively feeding your baby so that your feeding sessions are full of joy and tender moments, not tender breasts.

Preventing Sore Nipples -

1.When feeding your baby, encourage the baby to take in more of the areola and use your finger to free the suction. This will help the baby's breasts to empty better.

2.Don't keep the baby too hungry before the feeding to avoid strong sucks. Give frequent feeds to avoid excess hunger.

3.Press your breasts gently to get the milk flowing, and feed your baby on the less sore side to avoid sore nipples.
