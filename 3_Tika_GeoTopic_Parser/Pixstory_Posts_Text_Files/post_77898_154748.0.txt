Today I got an opportunity to attend a seminar session on mental health as a part of Mental Health week conducted in our college. So I thought of sharing their details here. In a society where mental health is still a stigma, this NGO is trying to reach out to everybody who is not with their own funds, for youths. You can volunteer in the trust as well as seek their help. And pls do share to needy ones about this trust. Its MIND EMPOWERED.
