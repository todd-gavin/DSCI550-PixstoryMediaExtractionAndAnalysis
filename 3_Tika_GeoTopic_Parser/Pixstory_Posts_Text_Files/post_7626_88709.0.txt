"It rains as I write this. Mad heart be brave."
                                                         ~ Agha Shahid Ali

It has all gone empty,
There is just this blank space,
Crawling for some sanity,
Nothing seems to make sense.

The past seems too heavy,
Future too bleak,lqq
The present outweighed by these burdens,
This existence seems to be fading.

Mornings and nights feel the same,
Time seeps through,
No destination is clear,
It's an endless road.

Who stays along,
And who abandons,
May depend on fate,
Or sometimes just greed.

Perceptions about people, 
Change along situations,
Where there lie temptation,
Even about one's own self.

There is so much to seek,
Yet in our darkness we reside,
Heart has had enough,
Still trying to survive.

Everything gone into dust,
Dreams disappeared as ash,
Nightmares surround these nights,
In search of an unreachable dream.

Eyes look left and right,
Nothing but emptiness in my sight,
At the end of this hollowness,
There's a sunset I see.

This may seem to be the end,
But there's a dawn after every sunset,
Longer the night brighter the morning,
Lets wait all alone.

Listening to music,
Reading old stories of hope,
While staying hopeless,
About almost everything.

There is something about this lonelines,
Which feels serene yet strange,
Its just a facade of this mind,
Trying to play it safe.

The heart will betray its commands,
As it only follows love,
It's as ambiguous as the wind,
So, "Mad heart, be brave."
