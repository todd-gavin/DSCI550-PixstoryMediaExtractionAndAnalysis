With a five-year deal with the Dutch champions, Steven Bergwijn has finalized his move from
Tottenham to Ajax for €31.25 million (£26.5 million).

A deal without add-ons was reached when Spurs gave up their demand for a guaranteed €30
million for a player they had acquired from PSV in January 2020 for an equivalent sum. Also
spoken upon was a charge of €30m plus up to €2.5m in add-ons.

Since January, Bergwijn has been a top target for Ajax, and Alfred Schreuder, who succeeded
Erik ten Hag as manager, said: "It is a sign of Steven's desire that he opted to make the move to
Ajax. The player possesses a wide range of skills. Naturally, I'm pleased that we have been
eligible to sign him since he brings a fresh element to our team.

Bergwijn played for Tottenham for 83 times, scoring eight goals, however under Antonio Conte,
he only started four Premier League games.

Tottenham is about to finalize their loan agreement with Barcelona's Clément Lenglet. The
documents are prepared for signing, subjected to a medical exam.

When Julián Lvarez eventually joins Pep Guardiola's team, he has pledged to follow in the
footsteps of compatriots Argentinians Sergio Agüero, Carlos Tevez, and Pablo Zabaleta by
putting "my imprint" on Manchester City.

The attacker was acquired in January and returned on loan to River Plate, but he will go to the
US with the champions' team on July 16 for a preseason trip.

The 22-year-old remarked, referring to key players on prior City championship teams Sergio
Agüero, Carlos Tevez, and Pablo Zabaleta, "City have a fantastic recent heritage of Argentinian
players - I want to leave my imprint on the team like Sergio Agüero, Carlos Tevez, and Pablo
Zabaleta."

The sporting director, Txiki Begiristain, said: "He scores all different sorts of goals and has a
really varied game.Alvarez, who can play both wide and center, will have a better chance of
succeeding if Raheem Sterling moves to Chelsea as predicted.
