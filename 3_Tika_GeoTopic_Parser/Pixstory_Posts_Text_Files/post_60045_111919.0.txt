On the opening day of the fifth rescheduled Test against England in Birmingham, Rishabh Pant smashed an electrifying 89-ball century.
Rishabh's quickfire century is now the fastest by an Indian wicketkeeper in Test cricket.

In the morning session, India was in serious danger and had received 64 for three in 22 overs when Rishabh entered the batting order at number five. The team's decline continued as India lost Virat Kohli (11) in the 25th over.

Then, Rishabh batted in a counterattacking manner against the England pacers. Jack Leach, an England spinner, was targeted by Pant in particular, who smacked him into the park's corners.

In the 58th over, Rishabh raised his fifth Test tonne with a quick couple of runs, stabilising the Indian innings with a partnership of at least 100 runs with Ravindra Jadeja.
