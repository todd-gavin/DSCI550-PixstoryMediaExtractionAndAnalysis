Sure would have noticed how some men have a habit of repeating what women say then get all the credit That s Hepeating The term was formed by friends of the US physics professor and astronomer Nicole Gugliucci who announced it to the world in a tweet on September original tweet from Prof Gugliucci My friends coined a word Hepeating For when a woman suggests an idea and it s ignored but then a guy says the same thing and everyone loves it When a man does all that a normal individual has to do for a living he is praised even sympathised When a woman does this or at times some women barely manage they are taken for granted or shamed for not being perfect Often in arguments at home or office we see when a woman explains it is difficult for parents or boss to accept When a man explains in his godly voice that makes sense Why is it so Do you often term women as aggressive or asserting or loud when they are trying to prove a point Why is it so It is because when she was calm and said her points she wasn t heard She wasn t heard for years We have a society that likes to silence voices Men have got so many privileges and it takes time to make people realise this isn t a simple aspect but it is why women suffer Please stop discriminating from little things to complex things so that let s not added hepeating to the dictionary So next time be attentive and keep out your sexist behaviour so that we don t feel the need to scream whenever we make a point
