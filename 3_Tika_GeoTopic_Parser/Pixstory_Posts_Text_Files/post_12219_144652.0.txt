Mini Delhi in Mumbai   ... 
Rajdhani express, a restaurant which serves North Indian food at a very reasonable price. Guess what it's unlimited and one can sit for hours and eat. The prize of the veg Thali was just Rs 299 and around 15 items were served including the starters, course meal and the dessert. 
Delhi is undeniably one of the best places in India to enjoy delicious fare, be it local, international or cuisines from other parts of the country. The eating scene reflects the capital's melting pot image with people from all over the country and the world setting up shop to woo palates of citizens and visitors alike. 
So glad, that we can enjoy delhi food in Mumbai, with reasonable rates.
