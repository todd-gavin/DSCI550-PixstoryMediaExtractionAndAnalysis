She said in an interview, “I am a proud Bajan who also feels a close connection to Africa and its people. I've had the pleasure, and the privilege, to spend time on the continent, and those experiences never leave you."
She also added how she wishes to expand her brand,
“Now, being able to bring Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin to eight African countries and then hopefully more in the future – means so much to me.”
Rihanna, whose real name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty, was inspired to create Fenty Beauty in 2017 after trying to find products that worked across all skin types and tones.

The pop star had a mandate of inclusivity. As a result, Fenty Beauty offers a wide range of products for traditionally hard-to-match skin tones, creating formulas that work for all skin types and pinpointing universal shades.
