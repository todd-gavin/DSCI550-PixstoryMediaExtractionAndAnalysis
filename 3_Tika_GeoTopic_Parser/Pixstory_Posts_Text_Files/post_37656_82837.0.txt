Top batting performance in Ranji 
In the middle of a high-scoring draw between Delhi and Tamil Nadu, Yash Dhull became only the third batsman to make a century in each innings (113 & 113*) on Ranji Trophy debut after Nari Contractor (152 & 102*) for Gujarat in 1952-53 & Virag Awate (126 & 112) for Maharashtra in 2012-13. Dhruv Shorey scored 107 alongside Dhull as Delhi finished Day 4 on 228/0 dec., forcing a high-scoring draw with Tamil Nadu although the latter picked points on the basis of a first-innings lead.

Dropped from the Test team, Cheteshwar Pujara responded with a fine innings of 91 off only 83 balls as Saurashtra, nine down by stumps, held Mumbai to a thrilling draw in Ahmedabad. The latter push came from the final batting pair of captain Jaydev Unadkat (32*) and Chetan Sakariya (10*) as Shams Mulani's 7-wicket haul fell short of getting Mumbai over the line.
