Do tears of joy look the same as ones of woe? or ones from chopping onions? 

Inspired by her own work of magnifying a bee's microscopic structure, photographer Rose-Lynn Fisher started a project in 2008 where she took dried human tears and looked at them through a microscope.

The situations under which a tear dries also defines the shape and formation of the tear as seen under a microscope; thus, two psychic tears with the exact same chemical composition can look very different up close.

"Tears are the medium of our most primal language in moments as unrelenting as death, as basic as hunger and as complex as a rite of passage.'

The more Fisher looked upon tears up close, the more she saw a resemblance to large-scale landscapes, or as she called them, "aerial views of emotion terrain"
