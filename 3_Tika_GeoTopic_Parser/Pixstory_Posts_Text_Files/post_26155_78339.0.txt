There is beauty in the ordinary, a novelty in monotony. On  some days we need nature’s beauty to survive and we all try to create it four ourselves by clicking pictures of pink skies, sunlight and shadows. The Pandemic has made us realise more than ever before that we need to live a life beyond our achievements. A walk in the park, a favourite book, some good music, these have become are comfort areas in the past two years. While many people might call these an escape, They also bring out the human propensity to find beauty under every circumstance. It’s fascinating to think that we all always tend to capture, skies, sunsets, flowers….. They serve as a reminder that even though we are lonely we are never really alone. We are always and we always will be connected through nature.
