 Forget love I d rather fall in chocolate someone had once said and so rightly Seldom is any love greater than the love of chocolate a love that never fails to make you happy anytime anywhere Chocolates are reminiscent of your fondest childhood memories If you belong to a generation that grew up on Cadbury s and Amul chocolates you know how special you felt about them back then A box of Amul chocolates was truly meant to be a gift for someone you love Savouring a bar of chocolate or sipping a cup of hot cocoa once back from school used to be sheer love warmth and comfort Curling up in your room with a story book and a Fruit n Nut chocolate sharing secrets and a Dairy Milk with your best friend relishing your favourite Cadbury s Nutties during those midnight cravings were simple pleasures of life your asli swaad zindagi ka And who could ever forget the iconic Dairy Milk chocolate Ad of the s wherein the adorable girl does a dances a jig in the cricket field to the song Kuchh khaas hai hum sabhi mein as the boy drives a sixer to a century Over the years the likes of Ferrero Rochers Lindts Godivas Toblerones have found their place in your life alongside the Cadburys and Amuls With age your tastes for chocolate have also evolved somewhat The bitter taste of dark chocolates appeals to you more now than the sweeter smoother varieties you loved back then You now love to death your dark chocolate paired with red wine A mocaccino makes for your perfect mood on a rainy day as does a steaming cup of hot chocolate on a chilly winter evening Your happiest occasions call for your favourite chocolate dessert and so do your nights of sadness But no matter how your chocolate taste buds and experiences have transformed with time your affairs with chocolate have always left you with nothing but cherishable moments Chocolate is pure love and as long as there is chocolate in the world and in your life there will always be sunshine and happiness Happy World Chocolate Day
