More than 25,000 tickets have been sold for the visit of Bayern Munich in the quarter-final second leg of the UEFA Womens Champions League, which will be played at the Parc des Princes this Wednesday, 30 March at 21:00. The Parisian fans, including many Ultras and season-ticket holders, have stepped up to support the Parisians in their quest to qualify for the semis of this competition for a sixth time!

Nicolas Arndt, Director of Ticketing and Hospitality, said: "On Wednesday, we will experience a great European evening at the Parc and break the attendance record for a Paris Saint-Germain women's match. This is a great satisfaction for the club. Thanks to the rise of the team and a winning ticketing strategy, we are building loyalty among an ever larger audience around the women's team. The Parisian women's matches are now part of Les Rouge et Bleu fans' calendar. They bring the Parc des Princes to life!"

Tickets at 6, 12 and 25 euros. With 24 hours to go before the match, it is still possible to buy tickets for the match on the club's official ticketing website.

After their 2-1 win in the first leg at the Allianz Arena, Les Rouge et Bleu can once again earn a place in the semi-finals of Europe's top club competition. Didier Ollé-Nicolle's players play host to the Bavarian team at the Parc des Princes, where they have already played eight games in their history.

The Parisians' last match in the capital city's famous stadium, against Real Madrid CF (4-0) on 9 November, gathered nearly 19,000 spectators, a record in the history of the group stage of the competition.

For the capital club, the previous attendance record dates from the 2016-2017 season with 19,192 spectators, on the occasion of the UEFA Women's Champions League semi-final against Barcelona (2-0).

Led by coach Didier Ollé-Nicolle, the women qualified by finishing top of their group, boasting an perfect record (six wins), the best attack (25 goals scored) and the best defence (no goals conceded).
