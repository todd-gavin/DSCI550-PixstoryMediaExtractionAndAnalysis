 You are eager to please others and give more than you take You get attached easily and form connections early on You feel unworthy of love You have a habit of settling for less than you deserve When someone treats you well it feels alien so you self sabotage You find it difficult to trust people You re sensitive to criticism and overanalyze your mistakes I have experienced these signs many times before and it is a dark place to be in I am also learning to love myself more and I know it will take time but this time I am kind to myself and I hope you will be kind to yourself too
