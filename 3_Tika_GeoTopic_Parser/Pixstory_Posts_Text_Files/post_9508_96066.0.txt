External Actors in the Afghan Problem
continues...

During this period (1991-96), the conflict failed to receive international attention. The seven Peshawar-based Mujahideen groups 
were unsuccessful to restore a credible national government. The international community hardly took notice of the gradually increasing involvement of the newly independent Central Asian states and Iran in the 1990s. It was only after the emergence of the Taleban in the political scene of Afghanistan that western concerns again aroused. When the Taleban captured Kabul in a surprise attack in September 1996, which had obviously been masterminded by external  strategists that international observers realized that the almost forgotten conflict in Afghanistan had been covertly transformed into a civil war having significant external implications. Comparing the decade of the 1980s with that of the late 1990s, Maass observes that a greater number of external actors were involved in the later phase where neighbouring states were involved directly and international players in an indirect manner. 

And it is also fair to assume that the external actors had taken full advantage of the internal power struggle for ulterior motives. 

There was a high degree of external involvement during the Taleban era and these external forces had a tactical approach that had been facilitated by the nature of the civil war in Afghanistan.
