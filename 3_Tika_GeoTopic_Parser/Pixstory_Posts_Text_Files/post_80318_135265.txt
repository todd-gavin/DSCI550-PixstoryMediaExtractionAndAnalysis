Every games tough in the Premier League until they face Arsenal Arsenal have had a flawless start to the season points goals scored with an goal difference Arsenal couldn t have started any better The Premier League is heavily branded as the best league in the world and that narrative isn t unjustified for the unanimous quality among the top but more uniquely the vast quality in the table throughout Teams like Brentford Palace Wolves Brighton Fulham Leeds among more But the narrative seems to change when Arsenal beat them The celebration police being out in full force after Arsenal came back from behind to beat an incredibly resilient Fulham team claiming it s only a promoted team I d feel insulted with these comments as a Fulham fan with how impressive they look Granted Arsenal haven t played any of the big but they ve played one of the hardest fixtures around in Palace away keeping a clean sheet scoring but most importantly looking convincing After a comfortable away win vs Bournemouth a dominant home display vs Leicester Arsenal showed another side which they ve lacked in the past a strong mental one To dominate a game but not allow their heads to drop after a small blip to concede The bigger picture being the narrative is boring the celebration reaction was outrageous the narrative will keep changing with who Arsenal plays As a fan of any team the most important thing is the team looking convincing dominating games looking organised fluid creating chances most importantly being sustainable Arsenal have looked all of those things and more and should be allowed to celebrate and enjoy their flawless start to the season knowing a setback will occur at some stage without needing extreme back lash for that either
