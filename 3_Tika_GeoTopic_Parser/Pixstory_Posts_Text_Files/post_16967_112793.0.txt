On Saturday, Alia Bhatt Dropped some cute pictures in pink outfit that she wore on the episode of Koffee with Karan which is yet to telecast.
Alia's long sleeve mini dress comes in a blush pink shade adorned with a bright pink petal pattern, adding a hint of romanticism. It features a ruched mini skirt, removable shoulder pads, cut-outs at the midriff, twisted detailing at the bust and waist, a detachable 3D flower brooch at the shoulder, gathered pleats on the round neckline, and a bodycon silhouette.
Meanwhile, Alia styled the attire with minimal accessories and glam. She opted for velvety red pumps with high heels, subtle eye shadow, glowing skin, a hint of mascara on the lashes, beaming highlighter and blushed cheeks to round it all off. Centre-parted open tresses completed the star's hairdo.
