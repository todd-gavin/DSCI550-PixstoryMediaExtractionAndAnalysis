When Cristiano Ronaldo and the Portugal National team will step on the pitch today to play against Turkey, they will be thinking of only three words which are “Now or Never.”

When Portugal National Team got Serbia, Ireland, Luxembourg, and Azerbaijan in the group to qualify for the FIFA World Cup then everybody thought that Portugal will clearly top the group and will qualify but destiny wrote something else and Portugal came second in the group and have to play playoffs to qualify for the World Cup. 

When the draw happened for the playoffs, fans got to know that Portugal will play against Turkey and Italy will play against North Macedonia and the winner of both the matches will play against each other and whoever will emerge as the winner of that match will get the ticket to FIFA World Cup 2022 which will take place in Qatar. 

But as a fan of Cristiano Ronaldo, I am a bit worried when I see Portugal National Team because their main five-player will miss the playoffs due to injury and those players are Pepe, Ruben Dias, Ruben Neves, Cancelo and Renato Sanches. 

And even if Portugal will win the match against Turkey then most probably they will face Italy in the final and if you don’t know then I’ll tell you that, Italy is the current European champion and they will be a very tough nut to crack for Ronaldo and company. 

But what if Ronaldo didn’t win the match against Turkey, can I say that this will be his last match in Portugal Shirt because, after the World Cup, the next tournament for the Portugal team will be Euro 2024 where Ronaldo’s age will be 39 and I think he will hang up his boots till then. 

Let’s hope that Ronaldo and Portugal National Team will qualify for the World Cup and we can see Cristiano Ronaldo playing his last Tournament in Portugal Shirt. 

You can watch the match on the Sony liv app from 1.15 am.
