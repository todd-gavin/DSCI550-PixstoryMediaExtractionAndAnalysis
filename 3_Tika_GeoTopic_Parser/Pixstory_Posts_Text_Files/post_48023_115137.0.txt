New Delhi: The central leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party has apparently given another opportunity to the former Chief Minister and senior leader Vasundhara Raje to lead the party into battle ahead of the 2023 state Assembly polls.

Sources stated that Vasundhara has been asked by BJP’s top leadership to get her act together and go on the offensive against the Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan. With Assembly polls scheduled for next year, the party hopes to regain control of the important state ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.

The sentiment of the top leadership was apparently conveyed to Vasundhara at the recently concluded BJP’s National Executive meet held in Hyderabad, sources said.

The party feels that the Gehlot government, which is already on the back foot over the deteriorating law and order situation and its alleged minority appeasement stance, could be pushed into a corner through strong and relentless pressure on these issues. Interestingly, Rajasthan is the last big state that is governed by Congress.  

Though the love-hate relationship between the top leadership of the party and Vasundhara has been far too apparent over the past several years, she is being backed as the saffron unit wants to regain control of the crucial border state ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.      

Earlier, the BJP leadership was uphappy with the performance of Vasundhara after the saffron unit was only able to secure 75 seats in the 200 members in the 2018 Assembly polls. Despite losing the state polls, the very next year the BJP-RLP alliance had secured all 25 Lok Sabha seats in Rajasthan, completely reversing the Assembly polls outcome.

However, over the past several years Vasundhara has been working behind the scenes to continue to maintain her hold over the state organisation of the BJP.
