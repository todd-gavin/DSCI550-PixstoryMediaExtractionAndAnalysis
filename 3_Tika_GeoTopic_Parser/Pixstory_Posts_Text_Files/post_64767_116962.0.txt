Our story takes place on a more palatable, human-free version of Earth. Now the planet is run by super-smart apes, and the smartest ape of them all just happens to be the one from the last movie, Caesar. But surprise! There actually are some humans left, hiding in the last place you’d ever look: right next door. The humans do what humans do best, stand their ground, and Caesar is not a big fan of the second amendment. But the humans are desperate to go back to Apeland so they can get power from the dam -- or darn if you don’t like swearing. You fucking saint, you. The resident age-appropriate
white male, Malcolm, strikes up a deal with Caesar. Caesar will allow Malcolm and his crew to work there as long as they hand over their guns and don’t try to unionise. Working together, the humans and apes fix the darn, allowing the humans to finally charge their Kindle Fires. But an ape lieutenant named Koba hates when storylines progress harmoniously without obstacle, so he shoots Caesar and blames it on the humans. He leads all the apes to that weird tower the humans live in for some reason, and before you know it, they’re waged in all-out war horse. Malcolm’s wife Felicity finds Caesar alive and they take him to a charming fixer-upper in a hip neighbourhood. Caesar is worried it’s out of his price range, so they decide to show him some apartments in the human tower instead. Unfortunately, Commissioner Gordon sets off a big bomb to try to blow up the tower. But the bombs don’t really do much, other than make everything shake a little. Caesar and Koba have a fight over whose name should be on the lease, and Caesar lets Koba die because, come on dude, all of this would have been fine if you had just cooled your jets. Malcolm warns Caesar that the military is on its way. They become best friends for five seconds, then Malcolm runs away like a little scaredy-catherine. And wouldn’t you know it, here comes a beautiful sunrise.
