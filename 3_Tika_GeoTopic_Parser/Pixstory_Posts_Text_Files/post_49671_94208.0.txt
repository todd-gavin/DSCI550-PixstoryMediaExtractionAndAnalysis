‌In a committee vote, a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in Connecticut to request medication to help them die was suddenly derailed.
‌
‌A committee vote made the difference, with the expected optimism of the Democrats that this would finally be the year where legislation would be voted on by the full House of Representatives and Senate and signed into law by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont. 
‌
Committees in Connecticut,  are encompassed both House and Senate members. Ultimately, the senators defeated the bill on a 5-4 vote. Democratic Sen. Mae Flexer of Windham voted with the four Republicans in opposing the measure. 
‌
In my opinion. ‌It has to do a lot with the emotions of patients. Patients should have the right to decide when they want to die because at times it's easy to die rather than to suffer. Patients deserve to die with dignity when they choose it. It is often difficult for many people to die with severe pain or live with severe issues in the body. In situations of extreme suffering, this is often the most compassionate option when the decision originates from the patient. Everyone doesn't have the strength to bear whatever comes to them especially when it comes to physical health. So respect their decision. 
‌
I couldn't agree more with‌ Sen. Gary Winfield, who acknowledged he would have opposed the legislation years ago. However, the painful suffering that his late mother had to endure nearly a decade ago changed his mind.“Even if you’ve experienced death before,” he said, “one horrible death can change all that.”
