At home you can have bushy plants small table plants climbing plants scented plants large plants and tufty plants Plants often resemble sculptures Sometimes to rediscover the flavor of a bygone era it is enough to place a medium-sized plant in an elegant vase holder placed on a nice pedestal Among the plants recommended for indoor environments, the ones I want to tell you about are Dieffenbachia and Alocasia with an exotic and luxuriant appearance, very simple to manage. Dieffenbachia, for example, does not require particular thermal conditions, as long as the temperature does not drop below degrees For the rest, it will be perfect to position it in a point of the apartment with good lighting, avoiding direct contact with the sun&#39;s rays or direct air currents. The stems are very fleshy therefore they tend to retain a lot of water for watering. a minimum dosage of water For better maintenance it would be excellent to dust the leaves with a nebulizer of HOL alocasia just like the dieffenbachia needs a bright place but in any case far from direct sunlight Its gigantic leaves are very pleasing to the eye and need to be cleaned every days with a damp sponge Watering should always be dosed if like me you have a black thumb instead of a green one you can throw yourself on the cacti that need much less maintenance
