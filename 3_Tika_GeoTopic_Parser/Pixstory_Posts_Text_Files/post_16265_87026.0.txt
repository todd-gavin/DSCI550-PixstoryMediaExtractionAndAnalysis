Hall of Fame Awards 2022 took place last night and bollywood celebs graced the event. Sidharth Malhotra, Kriti Sanon, and Taapsee Pannu were papped as they arrived at the red-carpet event. 
Sidharth Malhotra looked absolutely suave in his shimmery black suit. Kriti Sanon donned an off-shoulder dress with a jaw-droppingly beautiful lavender trail, which had a puffy cloud-like element.Taapsee Pannu on the other hand was quite the red-alert in her noodle-strapped gown.
