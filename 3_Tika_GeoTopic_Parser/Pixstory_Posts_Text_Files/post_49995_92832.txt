Sylvia Plath and the Bi Polar depression that killed her are topics of discussion today But what about the time she needed help Poems to many critics are a reflection of life Lady Lazarus I believe was a cry for the help of Sylvia Plath Lady Lazarus is a poem of vigour life and anger why is it so The poem reflects the mood swings Plath goes through and shows the severity of her illness In the first line itself she confesses her attempts to suicide She refers to her skin as bright as a Nazi lampshade referring to the allegation that the Nazis uses the skin of Jews for lampshades Throughout the lines there is imagery and metaphors of death From her sarcastic tone to a rather outrageous one she shifts to an image of her smiling Her lines Dying is an art I do exceptionally well is the range of her depression She says death feels real to her Yet her self confidence is par excellence to make a social commentary She brings in images of the Holocaust and her rage towards it and all the men who made her life hard through the words Out of ash I rise with my red hair And I eat men like air I felt her cry for help when I first read the poem We lost a gem Happy Reading
