Doja Cat slid into Noah Schnapp s instagram direct messages and asked him for Joseph Quinn s contact It went like DC Noah can u tell joseph to hmu hit me up wait no does he gave a gf Noah LMAOO slide into his dms DC idk his ig or twitter he doesn t have a dm to slide in Following this Schnapp made this conversation public Doja reacted to it on her Instagram live Pop Base reported that she said That s like borderline snake shit He shared information that I didn t feel comfortable with him sharing It feels like a weird power play I already said some shit to him My personal opinion on this is that well play stupid games win stupid prizes You should definitely not as a year old slide into a year old s messages and ask him to set you up with another adult
