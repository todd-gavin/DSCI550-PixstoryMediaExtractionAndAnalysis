If you have lived through 90s, chances are you will recognise these lines immediately. After all, who hasn’t seen the iconic Ponds’ advertisement that splashed on television screens in those days? How the ad came to be is an interesting story, and more fascinating is the story of the man who coined that iconic TV commercial. 

I remember seeing this advertisement during winters, my mom personally used to make me use this creme on my face because i always wanted soft skin 😬☺️

The ad brings a-lot of creative sides, they used emotional appeal , love appeal to it.
The brand used to feature all the age groups to their ads to promote the creme to keep the skin soft and moisturise. 

The ponds jingle which is famous till date ‘Googly Woogly Wooksh’ used to be everybody’s favourite and is still producing ads with the same jingle. 

•Piyush Pandey is one of the most illustrious names in Indian advertising and his story shows that creativity truly has no boundaries.

•Most of his ads are inspired from various cultures, observations, friends and his family members out of which Ponds’ advertisement campaign has been inspired from his wife, Nita. Her imagination has been an inspiration for his ideas.

•The famous campaign for Ponds’ Cold Cream was an idea which was ignited in Piyush’s mind for what Nita did.

•One day, in a romantic moment, Nita grabbed hold of Piyush’s cheeks and said “googly woogly wooksh”.

•This is how he framed a beautiful song tuned around these words. The campaign ran for ten long years.

Ponds’ has decided to revive the same campaign but with new lyrics featuring Armaan Malik and Monali Thakur. 😬🤍

Enjoy the advertisement ☺️
