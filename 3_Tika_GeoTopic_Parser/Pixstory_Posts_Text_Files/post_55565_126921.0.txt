A genuine story called Rabbit-Proof Fence explores the terrifying lives of the Stolen Generation. In an effort to be reunited with their family, three youngsters make a long journey back home, which is chronicled in the movie. As manofmany points out, although it serves as a reminder of our horrible cultural past, the film is still moving and timeless.

It is partially based on the true story of Molly Craig, the author's mother, and Daisy Kadibil and Gracie, two other Aboriginal girls who escaped from the Moore River Native Settlement, north of Perth, Western Australia, after being sent there in 1931, in order to go back to their family. 

In the movie, white law enforcement officers and an Aboriginal tracker pursue the Aboriginal girls as they trek for nine weeks along 1,500 miles (2,400 km) of the Australian rabbit-proof fence to get back to their town at Jigalong. 

The movie depicts Australia's official child removal policy, which was in place from roughly 1905 to 1967. Its victims now are termed the "Stolen Generations".
