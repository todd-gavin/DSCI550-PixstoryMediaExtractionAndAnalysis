ABSTRACT Understanding the risk factors of colorectal cancer CRC is crucial to the development of effective strategies for its prevention Type diabetes mellitus DM is associated with increased CRC risk and epidemiological studies identified a correlation between these diseases Aim To evaluate prevalence of CRC in a cohort of Caucasian patients with type DM and the association with other variables previously known to be related with increased CRC Methods We retrospectively evaluated DM patients followed in our institution of southern Italy between for the incidence of CRC Patients were stratified based on gender age body mass index BMI alcohol and FANS assumption family history for cancer blood glycated hemoglobin levels hypertension hypertriglyceridemia age at diabetes onset and disease duration treatment with insulin metformin sulphonylureas glinides or other hypoglycemics Results In our cohort mean age was years women and mean BMI Hypertension was present in of patients and hypertriglyceridemia in Mean age at DM onset was years median disease duration months range and mean blood glycated hemoglobin was Patients were treated with insulin in cases metformin in sulphonylureas in glinides in while received other hypoglycemics At a median follow up of months range cases of cancer prevalence occurred among these were CRC prevalence Median duration of DM to CRC diagnosis was months range At the univariate analysis older age p and diabetes duration p were related to higher risk of cancer while metformin seemed to be protective p In CRC patients older age p and diabetes duration p were related to higher risk of CRC such as sulphonylureas therapy p Conclusions Prevalence of CRC in our cohort of type DM patients was higher compared to that from National Tumor Register for southern Italy in Furthermore we hypothesize that sulphonylureas may play a role in CRC carcinogenesis altering the physiological insulin secretion Read more
