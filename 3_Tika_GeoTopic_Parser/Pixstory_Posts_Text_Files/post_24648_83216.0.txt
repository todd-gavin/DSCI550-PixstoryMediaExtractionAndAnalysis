RB Salzburg have dominated the Austrian Bundesliga in recent years- winning 9 out of the last 10 league titles. They have also made it a habit of scouting young unproven talent and developing them into world stars before selling them on for big profits.
Erling Håland and Patson Daka were the 2 latest striker exports from Die Roten Bullen who have been revelations at their respective new destinations. The next in line seems to be Karim Adeyemi.
Born in Munich, Adeyemi was released from the Bayern Munich academy when he was 10. At 18, he was picked up by RB Salzburg. After playing a bit-part role for 3 years, he has now established himself as a star player for the Red Bulls.
A quick and energetic centre forward having game intelligence far beyond his tender years, the 20-year old has caught the eye of Europe's elite with some electric displays. Having scored 18 goals in 28 league and UCL games at the time of writing, the likes of Chelsea and Liverpool (before they signed Luis Díaz) had been heavily linked with the signature of the 3-capped German international.
The current frontrunners seem to be Borussia Dortmund. With Erling Håland's exit possibly looming, Die Schwarzgelben plan to replace ex-Salzburg striker with a current one.
Goal.com has reported that BVB Sporting director Michael Zorc has already spoken to RB Salzburg and Adeyemi's representatives about signing the €40 million rated star.
The player himself is said to be calm about his future and focused on completing the season strongly with RB Salzburg. 
Dortmund have an excellent track record of maximizing the potential of young attackers. And with first team opportunities likely to be abundant if Håland is sold, the conditions look perfect for Adeyemi to continue with his footballing development at the Westfalenstadion.
