For Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis, the Cabinet development exercise today proved to be an exercise in managing expectations as the number of aspirants far outnumbered the 18 ministers sworn in. Nine of the ministers are from the Shinde camp while the rest are from the BJP.

Maharashtra can induct a maximum of 43 ministers, including the CM. Following this round of inductions, the strength of the Council of Ministers will be 20, leaving 23 vacant posts to be filled in the next expansion.

Highly placed sources said, “Chief Minister Eknath Shinde held meetings with MLAs well past midnight. A lot of effort was undertaken to pacify the angry members who insisted on a Cabinet berth in the first expansion.”
