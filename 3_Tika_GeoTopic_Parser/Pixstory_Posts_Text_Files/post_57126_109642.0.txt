Being a man myself, I would completely agree with the idea that men should equally be a part of the movement.
As every responsible man should hear and adhere to this, we are equally associated with an unwanted pregnancy foisted upon a woman.
If they could rally or rant about their rights, then the least someone could do is to support them and instead become a part of it. 

It would not become this treacherous if the both of them joined the hands in the fight.
Moreover, if we speak of political change, it could only be brought if we have more people talking and fighting for it.

American women in politics don't hold much power; they are 51% of the population in the U.S. but makeup only: "27% of Congress at large, 24% of the U.S. Senate, 27% of the U.S. House of Representatives, 0% of presidents of the United States, 30% of statewide elected executives of any kind, 31% of state legislators, 31% of the largest cities' mayors, 25% of mayors in cities with populations over 30,000."

While the men make most of it, nevertheless keeping political numbers aside, we still get another point how every men's voice would transform or change the mind of all the other lawmakers and political decision-makers who are men.
So, the involvement of men in the movement and the fight for abortion rights could have improved the situation.
