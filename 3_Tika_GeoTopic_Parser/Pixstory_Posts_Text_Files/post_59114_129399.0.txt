Women are consistently objectified. But I thought as we are a developing country now there would be some change in people's mindset. But I was wrong about it. 

"I cite respecting women cannot be a rule but surely it can be a responsibility"

BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya sparked controversy after he compared Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to “foreign women who change boyfriends any time”.
His exact words were “When I was abroad for a few days, someone said women here change their boyfriends any time. Bihar’s Chief Minister is similar. We never know whose hand he may hold or leave,” said Kailash Vijayvargiya.

This was a ridiculous argument he made, in my belief, there are no foreign women or Indian women. It's just disrespecting women who live in a different culture and tradition.

Having a lot of guy friends. This does not make women characterless. Dressing up according to our choice. It’s our bodies and we should be allowed to do as we please. Being unmarried. Life is much more than marriage. Stop forcing women to believe that their existence without a partner is meaningless.

I believe that a society where women do not feel secure and respected is not worth calling a society. If you call yourself a leader then be one. This is how you respect women? A piece of advice; Stop judging! and it's not funny.
