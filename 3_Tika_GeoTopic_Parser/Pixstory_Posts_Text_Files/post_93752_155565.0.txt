Harry Potter actor Robbie Coltrane has died aged 72.
Rubeus Hagrid is one of his most adored characters, as his personality perfectly resonates with the values of the character.
Coltrane was born Anthony Robert McMillan on March 30, 1950, in Rutherglen, Scotland. He took the stage name Coltrane in his early 20s in tribute to jazz saxophonist John Coltrane and broke through in Byrneâ€™s theatre production of The Slab Boys. Early film roles included Flash Gordon and Mona Lisa before he appeared on the small screen in Tutti Frutti and then Blackadder the Third. He also memorably played the Pope in the 1991 comedy The Pope Must Die.
His agency confirmed his death.
Jk Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, tweeted remembering. Robbie Coltrane,
"I'll never know anyone remotely like Robbie again. He was an incredible talent, a complete one-off, and I was beyond fortunate to know him, work with him and laugh my head off with him. I send my love and deepest condolences to his family, above all, his children."
