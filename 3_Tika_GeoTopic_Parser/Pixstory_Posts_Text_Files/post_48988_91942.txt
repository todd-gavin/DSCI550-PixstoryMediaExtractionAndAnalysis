You re providing a second shot at life to a dog cat cow or other animal Some may have been abused abandoned or forced to fend for themselves on the streets in the past You are providing the dog with a safe and loving home where it can learn to be a happy and healthy dog again by adopting it Many dogs are forced to breed as frequently as possible and are kept in puppy farms in deplorable conditions Adopting a pet allows you to avoid these organisations while also supporting animal welfare You are caring for a dog who already needs support rather than bringing another puppy into the world by choosing to adopt rather than go to a shop or breeder for a specific sort of pet It s one of the most effective strategies to ensure that all animals receive the care they crave and deserve With thousands of shelters and so many pets looking for a home there s a strong chance you ll find the perfect match for your family You may also discover that the pet you fall in love with is nothing like the one you thought you wanted after spending time at a shelter It s always nice to support and assist a local organisation and these shelters provide a valuable service to the dogs in their care so adopting one helps to ensure that the animals left at the shelter are cared for Breeders euthanize or trap all the puppies they don t need in cruel conditions in puppy mills You re like any other animal farm the byproduct of this industry also is neglected tortured and killed
