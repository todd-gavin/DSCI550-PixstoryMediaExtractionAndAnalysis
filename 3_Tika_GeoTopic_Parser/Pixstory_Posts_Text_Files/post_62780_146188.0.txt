To find out what niche you want to write on your book blog, you first need to figure out what interests you. This can be difficult, but there are a few things you can do to start brainstorming.
- Get a list of your favorite books and read them cover to cover. This will help you get an idea of the genre and style of writing that you like.
- Go online and search for similar blogs that focus on the same topic as yours. Look at what other bloggers are writing about and try to identify similarities and gaps in their content. This will give you a better idea of the kind of content that is popular on book blogs and what format it usually takes. 
- Take a look at some successful book bloggers and study their content closely. What format do they use? How do they market their blogs? Do they have any unique selling points? Figure out which topic areas are getting the most traffic, and then focus your blog on those.
- Finally, pay attention to trends - whether it's popular genres or specific topics that are being discussed frequently online. All of these methods will help you find the right niche for your book blog.
