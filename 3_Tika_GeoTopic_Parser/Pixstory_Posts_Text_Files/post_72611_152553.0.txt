All the four syrups - Promethazine Oral Solution, Kofexmalin Baby Cough Syrup, Makoff Baby Cough Syrup and Magrip N Cold Syrup - are made by Haryana-based Maiden Pharmaceuticals.
'Laboratory analysis of samples of each of the four products confirms that they contain unacceptable amounts of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol as contaminants. To date, these four products have been identified in Gambia, but may have been distributed, through informal markets, to other countries or regions, the WHO said in the alert.
All batches of the products 'should be considered unsafe' till they are analysed by the respective national regulatory authorities, it said.
According to sources, India's apex drug regulatory authority - the Central Drugs - Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) - has already launched an investigation into the matter after it was informed about the issue on September 29.
