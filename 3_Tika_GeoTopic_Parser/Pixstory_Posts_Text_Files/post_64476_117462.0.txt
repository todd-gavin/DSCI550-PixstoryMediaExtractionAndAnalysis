Salgaocar FC is set to hold a grand reunion of its players since inception, along with the management on 20th July ’22 in Panjim. number of celebrated legends are expected to be part of the event. 

The day will commemorate 25 glorious years of Salgaocar’s epic Federation Cup victory over East Bengal at Culcutta’s Salt Lake Stadium on 20th July 1997. Watched by a record 1,20,000 spectators, Bruno Coutinho silenced the stadium with his golden goal to give Salgoacars a 2-1 historic win.

The teams were locked 1-1 at the end of regulation time. Second half of extra time, Jules Alberto took a shot at the goal after playing a wall pass with Gasper Crasto. East Bengal’s Kenyan goalkeeper Azanade palmed it away, but only as far as Savio Medeira some 30 yards away.

𝗔𝗺𝗮𝗿 𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗯𝗮, 𝘁𝘂𝗺𝗶 𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗮𝗯𝗲 (We will beat you; you will lose).

The roar in the stadium was deafening. Everybody expected one result: East Bengal win.

But a solid team performance along with individual brilliance of Bruno Coutinho saw Salgaocar lift the Federation Cup.

History was made. Final Score: 2-1
