Fearless women like they say we all know one raised one or are one I really feel a certain energy when i walks into the room or somewhere fearlessly There is something so powerful and mysterious about a Fearless woman A fearless woman draws people towards her without even intending to do so I you and we all Should be like this only fearless So to all the Fearless woman s just wanna say Think Highly Of Yourself because the world takes you at your own estimate You are what you do not what you say you will do This Journey Has Purpose Even If you don t see it yet Don t Be Pushed Around by the fears in your mind Be lead by the Dreams in your heart Don t Stop Shining Just because Someone is Intimidated by your light You deserve To be Happy And Healed And Content and open so keep going Go realise the life you deserve Don t Be afraid Of the Solitude that comes with raising your standards No one is you and that is your power Challenges make you discover things about Yourself That you never really knew Take the risk or lose the chance Tell me in notes are you a fearless woman too
