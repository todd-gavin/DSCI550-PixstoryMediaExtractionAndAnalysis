I have been meaning to see Bullet Train as I always thought it would be a good movie and it seems like everyone agrees with me!

Brad Pitt plays a hell-bent assassin in David Leitch's action-packed Bullet Train, which is now dominating a slow weekend at the North American box office. 

Hollywood Reporter said that in the past, August would have seen event films released by Hollywood studios. As the entertainment industry recovers from the pandemic and struggles with production and post-production delays, this year is different. 

The final significant Hollywood studio film of summer 2022 is regarded as Bullet Train. The movie is doing alright at the box office and should bring in $13 million this weekend from 4,357 locations for a domestic 10-day total of $54.2 million. One drawback: Despite having no competition, Bullet Train appears to lose more than 57 percent of its first-weekend business, although that is typical for an action movie with a male slant. The film brought about $3.9 million.

Have you seen the movie? Do you plan to watch it?
