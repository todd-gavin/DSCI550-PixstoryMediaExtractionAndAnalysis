Trust is necessary for society to function. It can play a large role in happiness. Trust issues often come from early life experiences and interactions. These experiences often take place in childhood.

“Trust is the belief that someone can be relied on to do or say something that was agreed upon. Trust issues are the inability to believe that one can rely on another person (friend, romantic, family, etc). Without trust, no relationship is sustainable.”
