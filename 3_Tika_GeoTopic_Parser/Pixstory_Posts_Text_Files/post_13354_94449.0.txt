The pol-e- Sorkh Cultural Center announced on its Facebook page that it would auction the center with "its dreams and aspirations."

The center has been a hangout for a number of Kabul educators and artists in recent years.

A collection of cultural products such as libraries, music classes, paintings and handicrafts was available at this address.

Zar Cafe was also part of this cultural complex, which was considered as a gathering place for the people of literature, art and culture of Kabul.

"We wanted to go to the trenches of war and give books to the people instead of telephone poles," said a statement from the Pol-e- Sorkh Cultural Center.

However, the Pol-e- Sorkh Cultural Center has gone bankrupt in recent months due to economic problems, the statement said.

"We are ashamed that this is happening, but we are auctioning off the Pol-e- Sorkh Cultural Center with its dreams and aspirations," said officials at the Pol-e- Sorkh Cultural Center in a statement to its audience.

After the Taliban entered Kabul on August 15, 2021, a large number of human rights organizations, free media and civil society organizations were forced to cease their activities in Afghanistan.
