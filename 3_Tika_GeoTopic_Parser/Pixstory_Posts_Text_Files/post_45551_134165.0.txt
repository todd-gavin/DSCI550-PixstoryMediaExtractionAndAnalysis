Instead of fake heroes on Tv, we need to talk about real life heroes and what better way to learn about them if not movies?

Here is a list of movies (compiled by DOY) you can watch to see what real heroes are:

Schindler’s List(1993): The life-saving actions of Oskar Schindler during World War II are shown in a historical drama. 

Erin Brockovich (2000): The lady who played a key role in developing a case to demonstrate groundwater contamination in California in 1993 is the subject of this movie, which demonstrates how an ordinary law clerk can stand up for a group of people's rights and succeed. 

Just Mercy (2019). This film, which stars Jamie Foxx, tells the tale of a Harvard Law alumnus who aids in the acquittal of a death row inmate who was unfairly convicted. 

Captain Phillips (2013). In this Tom Hanks-starring movie, Richard Phillips uses his abilities to save his crew on their stolen yacht.

You are feee to add to this list! I would love to discover more movies like this!
