Both Janhvi and Sara loves exploring new places. Adding on to their travel stories, Janhvi said how she was impressed with Sara during a trip to Disneyland. Sara helped Janhvi jump the queue wherever possible at the theme park. “She broke every line. I kept thinking ‘she is so cool’! I would never have been able to do that. Because of her, I did not even have to wait. It was the best trip ever!” said Janhvi.💞💕
