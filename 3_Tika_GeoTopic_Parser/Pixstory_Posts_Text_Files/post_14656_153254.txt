Babies are considered high risk if they have moderate to severe eczema or egg allergy Other children who may be at risk include children with food allergies other than egg allergy and those with siblings with peanut allergy But these lower risk babies were not included in the recent studies If your child is at high risk for peanut allergy talk with your child s healthcare provider before giving them peanuts A blood test or skin test for peanut may be advised first If your child does not have eczema or other food allergies you can introduce peanuts at a time that you think is appropriate There is no evidence that breastfeeding or formula feeding gives more protection against food allergies If you are breastfeeding you don t need to stay away from any certain foods unless your healthcare provider tells you to Give your baby only infant formula or breastmilk until age Don t give your baby whole milk until after age Giving your baby eggs early may help prevent egg allergy Giving other foods early isn t helpful to prevent allergies But adding foods to a baby s diet within the first year of life is important Sources urmc rochester edu
