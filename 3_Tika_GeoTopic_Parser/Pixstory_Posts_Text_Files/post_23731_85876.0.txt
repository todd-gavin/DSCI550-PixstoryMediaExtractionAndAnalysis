After several studies have suggested that the next COVID variant might be transmitted from animals, the World Health Organisation pointed out that steps need to be taken to ensure that coronavirus does not transmit from animals to humans. This comes at a time when coronavirus has infected minks, hamsters. In North America, it has infected wild whitetail deer. Now researchers are wondering whether it might infiltrate even more species than it is known to and then move back to humans again, potentially bringing new and dangerous COVID variants.
Sounding a warning regarding the same, WHO's Maria Van Kerkhove said, We must all take steps to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the risk of transmission between animals and humans.
The WHO in a statement said, Although the COVID-19 pandemic is driven by human-to-human transmission, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is also known to infect animal species. Current knowledge indicates that wildlife does not play a significant role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, but spread in animal populations can affect the health of these populations and may facilitate the emergence of new virus variants.
