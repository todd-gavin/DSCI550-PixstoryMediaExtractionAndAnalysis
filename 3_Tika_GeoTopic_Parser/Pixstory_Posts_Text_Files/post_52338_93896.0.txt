The City of Sydney's proposed changes to the precinct's planning controls will create new opportunities for rooftop venues, entertainment spaces, maker spaces, basement clubs, cinemas, and activated laneways, as well as greater protection for local heritage buildings and those celebrating indigenous and LGBTIQA+ culture.

Lord Mayor Clover Moore stated that the new planning controls will aid in the restoration of Oxford Street as a vibrant cultural destination for businesses, residents, artists, and visitors.

"Oxford Street is our favourite street." "It's one of our greatest and most-loved streets, and we're committed to enhancing its reputation as an iconic gay, lesbian, and creative precinct, buzzing with activity day and night," Lord Mayor Clover Moore said.
