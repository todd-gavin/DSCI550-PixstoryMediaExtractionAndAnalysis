I was happy with the outfit for the day But not my mom with that stare Stares of those eyes on roads also justified her But compliments made my day Insecurities over my body faded away I loved my thighs that were indeed filled with joy I loved my arms filled with love to hug I loved my flattened belly when I stood and the two folds of sheer love of food while I sat down This doubt of oh will I put on weight again is still there but I still want to eat those cravings with guilt free I still desire to get the body I like But I don t dislike the body I have I love you the way you are And I will still love you how you were
