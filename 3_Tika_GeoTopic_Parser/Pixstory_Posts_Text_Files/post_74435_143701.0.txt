Actors Rubina Dilaik and her husband Abhinav Shukla got married on June 21, 2018, but in Bigg Boss 14, it was revealed the couple was actually heading for divorce. Fortunately, during the BB14 course, they reconciled their marriage. But did you know there are paid trolls and haters who were trying to break off the marriage of Rubina and Abhinav? Rubina Dilaik recently took to her Instagram account and dropped a screenshot of her husband Abhinav’s interview while talking about the paid trolls. ✅✅✅✅The Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa contestant captioned, “I often don’t pay attention to the trollers and haters! But after a year of constant harassment and threat, we recently figured (with the help of Police) that “these (PAID) trollers “are a mere pawn to someone who hates us SO MUCH that he/she is constantly living in a Hell-State wanting us @ashukla09 to break apart. I can’t Imagine What kind of destiny YOU are calling upon yourself, I just pray YOU LIVE IN PEACE” 😱😱😱😱😱Abhinav told us, “I wasn’t prepared to say it in front of my family. I haven’t even informed my parents. I just discussed it with my friend, and he knew it. Till the time I was very certain that this is going ahead, I’m not going to speak to my mom and dad. 😱🙏You tell things to your parents when you’re final. Jab tum khudhi sure nahi ho, they will be worried about it. I discussed this at length with my brother and in fact, her mother. Then things actually mended their own.” ✅The Shakti actor added, “So many people have asked me why did you bring it on national TV? and I have said it mindfully and I will again rephrase it, we are public figures. Agar 6 months pehele god forbid seperate huye hote, aisa toh nahi hai ki kisiko pata nahi hota. Sabko pata chalta, people still would have put in 2×2 together.”✅✅✅
