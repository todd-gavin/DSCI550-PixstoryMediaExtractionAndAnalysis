Is it really white,
'Cause all around I see black,
The setting is so strange,
Just as the mid is deranged,
Lonliness talks to this canvas.

Paint brush roughed uo,
What's left to paint?
While I parade a facade,
Of all the happiness,
Whilst flames erupt around me.

Hands drowned in the colour red,
Handprints don't leave a mark,
Already full of thoughts,
Over flooded by desires,
That couldn't be reached.

The triumph of grey,
Always looms over,
Like doubts in my heart,
Signs of trust still exist,
Just like the storke of red,
On every murder that has occured.

Blank it used to be,
Then it used to be scribbled upon,
Didn't it deserve a masterpiece?
Of course it did,
But the painters changed too often.

A rose once drawn,
Shouldn't be crumpled,
Signifies a turn of fate,
From love to betrayal,
It just takes a thought.

Every brush stroke one makes,
Every colour chosen,
Everyone has reaction they hide,
Time brings forth all,
Most of them are shocking.

We try to paint pictures,
In front of different people,
Every story is a mix up,
Trying to satisfy every hue,
When everything is black and white.

The portrait that you made,
Was a well kept lie,
In the end it was revealed,
The applause was a faux,
Just to please your heart.

Heart has changed its course,
Colours everlasting,
The paint brush fresh,
Time to paint a new canvas,
That may last forever.
