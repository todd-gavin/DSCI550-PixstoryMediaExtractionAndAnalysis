[an attempt to complete my impromptu speech from my brother’s wedding]

The first memory I have of my brothers is of starting at a small plastic alarm clock, centered at the box tv in the living room. 

The minute hand stubbornly departed 4:00 pm, on its way to 4:20 pm — the time they were expected to come. 

My mom told me to watch the clock so that I wouldn’t repeatedly ask her how much longer they’d be, while she put all her delicate breakable things away from reach. 

No matter how hard she tried to preserve her breakables, fun has a way to crack smiles into everything — and the pieces left behind became proof of my brothers’ visit. 

Once they moved to DC, time between summer breaks went as slowly as the minute hand does when it is being watched on the clock. 

Every time they came to visit, the way I navigated the world completely transformed: I would dress like them, talk like them, walk like them, eat like them (or more like a fraction of what they ate — I’ve never encountered anyone who can beat their appetite). 

The summer was full of McDonald’s happy meals, missed aims at basketball hoops, my wardrobe updating itself with football jerseys sprayed with Axe deodorant, WWE fights, ‘learning’ driving through the car in Grand Theft Auto.

Their love created a space that affirmed my gender long before I learned the language to understand myself. The internalized transphobia that coursed through my veins for so many years has become easier to drain every time I look back at my younger self and find that they’d always known who they were.

It’s hard to process how we’ve only been meeting once every few years now. But every time that we do, it’s like coming back home to myself.
