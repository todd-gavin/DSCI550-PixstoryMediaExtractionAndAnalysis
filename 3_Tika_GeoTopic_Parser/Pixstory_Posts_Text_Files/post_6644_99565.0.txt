A video of Aam Aadmi Party leader and Delhi Deputy Chief Minister, Manish Sisodia, has gone viral on social media. He can be heard saying in the video that AAP conducted a survey two weeks ago in which three questions were asked to the public. The first question was, which party causes “hooliganism and riots” in the country, to which 91% of the people answered “Aam Aadmi Party”. The second question was, which party has the most “goons, loafers, and illiterate people”, to which 89% of the people said “Aam Aadmi Party”. The third question asked to the public was which party has the “most decent, educated and honest” people, to which 73% of the people responded by saying “Bhartiya Janata Party”.

Twitter user Shwetank tweeted the video and wrote, “What was this? Such a big mistake?”. BJP Delhi spokesperson Nighat Abbas retweeted Shwetank’s tweet, writing, “Sisodia Ji spoke the truth for the first time”.

Bhartiya Janata Yuva Morcha Delhi spokesperson Gaurav Verma tweeted the video, writing that Manish Sisodia has spoken the truth for the first time.

Rashtriya Yogi Sena state minister Jitendra Singh mocked Sisodia and wrote that he was “inebriated”.

Another user tweeted the video, writing that Manish Sisodia is stating facts that Kejriwal doesn’t allow him to state otherwise.

This video has become viral on Facebook and Twitter with the same claim.
