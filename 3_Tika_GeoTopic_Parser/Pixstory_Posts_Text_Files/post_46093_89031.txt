The appointment of Jackson to Supreme Court is nothing but an act of tokenism by Biden government I get the need to support black women but this appointment directly challenges the sanctity of Supreme Court by the very fact that legal philosophy of Jackson is questionable Will such crucial decisions be taken on the basis of skin colour and not credibility This appointment is nothing but a pick of radical left as pointed out by Graham Evelyn Cooper says that Unlike her confirmation last year where she said she doesn t have a particular philosophy other than applying the same method of thorough analysis to every case regardless of the parties she gave a very methodological answer She said she turns to law text for adherence she said she would turn into the original meaning of the legal provisions when it was first adopted This is a good argument except that every word of this is untrue Jackson has has repeatedly embraced champions of Critical Race Theory CRT and dailywire has already unearthed proof of this There are lectures and speeches which nod to the progressive idea with the use of terms such as microaggression A review of a few of Jackson s recent lectures and speeches reveals that the nominee has a strong admiration for leading proponents of CRT a progressive idea that holds in part because racism is endemic to rather than a deviation from American norms Jackson is being nothing but diplomatic now when the truth cannot be suppressed While Jackson has avoided openly championing CRT she has complimented its advocates and suggested that the progressive theory informs her legal analysis It is time we acknowledge that some lessons about race go too far and I agree with CRT Sen Ted Cruz when he pointed out that action needs to be taken pain some states to restrict the teaching of CRT It like the legal philosophy of Jackson has concepts have infiltrated our education system
