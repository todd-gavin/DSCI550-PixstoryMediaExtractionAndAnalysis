I don't know because of the crime of picking which red apple.......
Am I kicked out of your paradise?
And my body, although have heard only one name from you...
But the fragrance of your body is mixed with the rope of my body.......
My homeland, one day I will come to you.....
With a bag full of pain and suffering...
With the sore wounds left on my half-souled body by sojourn.......
Yes, I will come back one day.
until the pain of my longing will end forever.......
So open your arms, my country...
And hug me like a mother separated from her child...
And be a salve on the naked wounds of my body and soul...
Yes, I will come back one day.
And I will circumambulate around the Kaaba of your existence a hundred times...
And on the high, boundless morning full of mercy...
I paint the majesty of the sun.
To be a salve of honesty and smile...
On the old wounds of your oppressed body.......
Yes, I will come back one day.
And I will remove the darkness from your being......
And instead, I will write...
Light, love, hope...
Yes, I will come back one day.
And we will kiss the sun together...
And we will write on it......
We have come to divide you among the children of Adam...
As dark as it is, it's bright...
Whatever is bitter is sweet...
Whatever is separation, is connected...
And all the colors become colorless.
Until our children regardless of any color...
Taste the sweet taste of life in paradise...
And then I will be born again...
And this time life is beautiful...
Yes, one day I will come to you, my homeland...
