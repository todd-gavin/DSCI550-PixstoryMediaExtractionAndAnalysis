Deandre Ayton is one of the most talented players in the NBA. The Phoenix Suns drafted him with the first overall pick back in the 2018 NBA Draft.

The big man is a double-double machine, and he is quite reliable on both ends. However, his most recent performance in the playoffs might be the reason why the Suns could trade him to another team.

Ayton is a restricted free agent this summer, and it will be interesting to see if the Suns can keep him on the roster. There are some rumors, however, that he could end up in Detroit.

Deandre Ayton playing for the Detroit Pistons? Not impossible!

After making the 2021 NBA Finals and losing to the Milwaukee Bucks, the Phoenix Suns tried to run it back. Unfortunately for them, Luka Doncic and his Dallas Mavericks beat them in seven games in the conference semifinals.

Even though the Suns had a 3-2 lead in the series, they couldn't finish the job. Deandre Ayton had some horrible games in the series, including his five-point performance in Game 7.

Monty Williams, the Suns coach, ended up benching Ayton in the final game of the series.

Now, the Phoenix Suns have a chance to get rid of the 23-year-old big man. One of the teams that could acquire him is Detroit. The Pistons have a great guard in Cade Cunningham and a lot of cap space.

The highest-paid player on the team next season will be Jerami Grant with less than $21 million. Considering how well he's played lately, the Pistons could use this contract to trade him for another great player.

There is no doubt that Deandre Ayton would fit well with the young Pistons roster. Furthermore, the Pistons won only 23 games this season, which means that there would also be less pressure on him.

The Athletic’s John Hollinger, who was previously an NBA executive, believes that the center would fit well with the Pistons. The team also has the fifth pick in the 2022 NBA Draft that they could use to further improve the roster.
