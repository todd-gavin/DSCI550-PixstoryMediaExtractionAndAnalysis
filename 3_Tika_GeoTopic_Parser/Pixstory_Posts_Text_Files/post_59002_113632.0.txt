The Trinamool Congress (TMC) denounced Mahua Moitra, a party member, for referring to Goddess Kaali as a "meat-eating, alcohol-accepting goddess."

The statements MahuaMoitra said at the #IndiaTodayConclaveEast2022 and her opinions on Goddess Kali were made in her individual capacity and in in NO WAY OR FORM ENDORSED BY THE PARTY. The All India Trinamool Congress vehemently rejects such remarks.

Tuesday, Mahua Moitra addressed the debate over a movie trailer depicting Goddess Kaali smoking a cigarette at the India Today Conclave East 2022.

"Kaali is a meat-eating, wine-drinking goddess in my eyes. You are allowed to create the deity of your choosing. Speaking on day 2 of India Today Conclave East 2022, Moitra remarked, "There are some locations where whiskey is offered to gods, and there are some places where it would be blasphemy.

BJP REQUIRES JURISDICTION

Suvendu Adhikari, a leader in the BJP, responded to Mahua Moitra's comments on Goddess Kaali by saying that TMC always "insults the Hindu religion" and that they will pursue legal action.

Adhikari added that they anticipate that TMC leader and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee will respond against Mahua Moitra in a similar way to how the BJP acted against former party spokeswoman Nupur Sharma. Recently, Nupur Sharma courted controversy for allegedly making statements about the Prophet Muhammad.
