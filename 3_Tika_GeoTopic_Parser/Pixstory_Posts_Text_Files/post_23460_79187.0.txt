When I got married around 16 years ago, I had two destinations set in my mind - one the backwaters of Kerala and the other Venice. Yes, Venice was a bit much considering we were both broke with expenses of marriage and setting up of the house.

Circumstances took a different turn and we (I and my husband) did go to all kind of places but Kerala happened only in the 14th year of our marriage. And what a trip it was. We had actually planned a trip to Dubai and at the last moment we realised my son's passport had only two months to expire. So the trip had to be domestic. 

My kids are water babies and since we are from Kashmir and no mountains seem to match up, we decided beaches it had to be. 

And man were we disappointed? no ways. Kerala lived up to everything we had heard. We landed in Kochi because the places we had planned were closer.  We stayed at a beautiful beach house in Eranukulam. 

The city was still reeling in the Christmas fervor which had just passed. The celebrations, however, were yet to get over as New year was coming. 

Amidst light and music an evening on the beach was highlight of our first day. The sound of the high tides lashing against each other in the vast darkness of the sea was an experience. 

Next day started with waking up to chirping of birds in the warm December Sun. 

The open breakfast area on the backwaters was another experience. The only problem was big crows who would expect you to feed them, as long as they kept a distance I didn’t mind sharing a meal. 

Our first stop was Athirappilly Waterfalls in Thrissur district. Called the Niagra falls of India, the Waterfalls originates from the Western Ghats and is located at the beginning of Sholayar Ranges. 

Falling from a height of 80 feet, it is situated on the Chalakudy River, in the Sholayar Reserve Forest of Thrissur district in Kerala.
