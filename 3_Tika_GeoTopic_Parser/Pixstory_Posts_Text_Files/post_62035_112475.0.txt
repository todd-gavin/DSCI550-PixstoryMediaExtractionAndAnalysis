Alize Cornet defeated Iga Swiatek 6-4, 6-2 in the third round of Wimbledon, ending the World No.1's win streak at 37 matches. The victory puts the 32-year-old Frenchwoman into the Round of 16 at Wimbledon for the first time since 2014.

Cornet's victory over Swiatek is her first complete match-win over a reigning World No.1 since notching a similar result in the third round of Wimbledon eight years ago. Then, Cornet stunned No.1 Serena Williams 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 to advance to her first Round of 16 at The Championships.

History has a knack for repeating itself, and that's exactly what happened in Cornet's case. 

The streak-breaker has qualified for the Round of 16, hopefully the luck favours her all the way through the tournament
