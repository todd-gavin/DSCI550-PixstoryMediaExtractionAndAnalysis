One of the biggest live events in Valorant esports history is now taking place in Japan. On May 7 and 8, the Tokyo Dome stadium in Japan will host the RAGE 2022 Spring LAN, a two-day exhibition competition. 

To make a remarkable experience for the Japanese audience of Valorant, RAGE teamed up with Riot Games. Although Japan took a while to establish itself in VCT history, Zeta Division's outstanding performance at the Masters: Reykjavik brought attention to their efforts.
