Too much toying with the ball causes loss to Manchester City as they lose 3-2 in the semi final at Wembley. 


City lacked intent and coordination in the field as they faced Liverpool for the second time in a week's time. They were playing without Kevin De Bryune, Kyle Walker, Ruben Diaz, Gundogen but they did literally nothing in the first half to stop Liverpool or win the game. On the other hand, Liverpool players kept on pressing high, showing energy and intensity in the field, which resulted in a 3-0 lead in the first half. City goalkeeper Steffen made things worse as he too delayed a back pass and Mane was quickly on to the ball and tackled it into the net. First goal came from Konate from a corner with just 9 minutes on the clock. Mane scored a second goal to win the player of the match award just before half time, which came as a result of a beautiful attack started by Alexander Arnold. After playing a 1-2-1 through the centre, Thiago Alcantara played the ball to free positioned Mane at right, which he hit as a volley and placed into net. 


Liverpool with the final entry are looking for a quadruple in the season. They are playing in the semi final against Villarreal on 28th April, second and going strong in the Premier league, and have already won the League cup. 


Manchester City totally lost in the midfield in the match, as they dragged one player down to build up always, sometimes Bernardo Silva or Fernandinho. They were also giving away the ball cheaply at wings and midfield in the first half. There were any penetration passes behind Liverpool's defense, any crosses, or shots from City in the first half. 


It looked like they were back in the game, when they scored just 71 seconds after restart. But, the second came in the 90+1' st minute, after which there was hardly any time to equalize the match. It was City's 5th FA cup semi final in 6 years.
