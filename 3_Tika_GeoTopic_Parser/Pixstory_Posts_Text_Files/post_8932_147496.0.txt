I don’t know about you but I feel it isn’t iconic that women in Iran are fighting not to wear the hijab, while the women in India are fighting hard to wear their hijab.

I see no difference, they both are fighting for the SAME thing: their right to choose and how they want to represent themselves. Period!!
