I had no idea that a movie could be made on me, this notion had never crossed my mind. When the makers of the movie came to me about this idea, first I asked them how they came to know about me because we had major publicity. They said that they came to know about me from Google and they had read a feature story about me and Slum Soccer. I also asked them why they wanted to make this movie. Their answer was that they wanted to spread the work and message of Slum Soccer to the audience so that more people can come to know about us and the medium of cinema is best for this in India. 

This happened around 2017, that’s when I got to know that Amitabh Bachchan will play my role in the movie. Although I got to meet Nagraj Manjule, the director of the movie a lot of times and we had lengthy discussions. I met Amitabh Bachchan when he came to Nagpur in December during the shooting of the movie. For me a movie being made on me isn’t an a big achievement for me, these things don’t have an influence on me. I do my work because I enjoy doing it and as I had said before helping people has been taught to me from a young age. I don’t like to publicize my work unnecessarily. 

The only reason that I agreed to the movie is because through it out our message and work will reach out to people and we’ll get the opportunity to help even more kids. This also increases our chances of getting even more volunteers. There isn’t a bigger medium than cinema and also attaching to it the name of Amitabh Bachchan will help us to reach out to audience all over the world.
