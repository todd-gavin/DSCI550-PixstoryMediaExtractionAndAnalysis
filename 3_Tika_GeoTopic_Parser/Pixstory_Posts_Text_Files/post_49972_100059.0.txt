‌For a long time, we have been discussing global warming and ozone air depletion. It is even dealt with clarity in schools still the climate change and rising temperature have only gotten worse. Humans are ignoring the red flags to an ultimate doom! 
‌
‌The scientific field has been talking for years now that humans are responsible for this climate change! Is there a decrease in vehicles? Environmental friendly methods are so expensive that no one wants to implement them. Many gases are produced by humans by burning fossil fuels which create a greenhouse effect that traps heat and causes global warming. Due to the increase in temperature people depend on air conditioners again creating a cycle of emitting toxic gases! 
‌
‌Methane is heightening in the atmosphere due to agriculture and fossil fuel production, traps 84 times as much heat as CO2 for the first 20 years it is in the atmosphere and is responsible for about one-fifth of global warming since 1750. Nitrous oxide, primarily discharged through agricultural practices, traps 300 times as much heat as CO2. Over the 20th century, as the concentrations of CO2, CH4, and NO2 increased in the atmosphere due to human activity, the earth warmed by approximately 1.4°F. We cannot stop the agricultural industry instead we need to find safer alternatives or balance the level of gases in the atmosphere. 
‌
‌the extreme increase in the levels of Co2 is the act of humans. Scripps Institution of Oceanology explained that the “extreme speed at which carbon dioxide concentrations are increasing is unusual. An increase of 10 parts per million might have needed 1,000 years or more to come to pass during ancient climate change events. 
‌
‌Does this point out how damaging humans are to the environment? When are we going to stop harming the environment and start to think about a sustainable future?
