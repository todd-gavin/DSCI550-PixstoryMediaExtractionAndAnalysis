Watford started the 2021-22 season with enthusiasm after returning to the Premier League at the first time of asking.

All of the Hornets' pre-season confidence and belief, however, rapidly faded as they had a 
dreadful season that ended in their relegation to the Championship after finishing in 19th place.

Review of the Season:

Watford's promotion-winning season was a resounding success, with the Hornets racking up 91 points, averaging over two points per game compared to 0.61 this season, while their previous Premier League campaign delivered 11 more points despite ending in 19th position.

The Hornets also scored two fewer goals than in the previous season, but their defense allowed 
13 more goals, illustrating the flaws that led to their collapse this season.

They had the greatest defensive record in the Championship last season, surrendering 30 goals in 46 league games, but they have surrendered 77 goals in 38 Premier League games this season.

Watford supporters saw their team average 1.84 points per game at home on their route to second place in the Championship, but their experience in the Premier League was considerably less joyful, as the Hornets only managed 0.42 points per game.

Watford made no progress in cup competitions, exiting the FA Cup in the third round for the 
second season in a row, while their League Cup campaign ended at the same level as the 
previous season, with the Hornets departing the tournament in the third round.

Best Player: Emmanuel Dennis

Despite joining the club in the January transfer window from Nice, Hassane Kamara was a 
strong contender for player of the season after impressing in 19 games.

In the Premier League, the left-back has led Watford in tackles and interceptions made per 
game, demonstrating the good influence the 28-year-old has had at Vicarage Road since his 
arrival.Dennis, who completed the season as Watford's top scorer after scoring 10 of the club's 34 league goals, was pipped to the accolade by Kamara.
