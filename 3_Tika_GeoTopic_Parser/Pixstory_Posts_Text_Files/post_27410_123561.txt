First the great fear for the highside during the FP on Saturday at Silverstone then the relief at seeing Aleix Espargaro still able to participate, albeit in pain and bruised, in qualifying and the British MotoGP race at Silverstone Now the new exams that don&#39;t bring good results news the Spanish Aprilia centaur second in the riders&#39; standings behind Fabio Quartararo has in fact suffered a fractured heel on his right foot The Spaniard, however, will not have to undergo surgery for the moment, the goal is to rest completely for a full week before returning riding hopefully with less pain on the occasion of the MotoGP of Austria on the weekend of August Instagram photo aleixespargaro
