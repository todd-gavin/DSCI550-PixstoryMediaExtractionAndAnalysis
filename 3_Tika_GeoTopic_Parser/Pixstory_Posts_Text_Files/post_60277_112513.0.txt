We are quite excited about the first-ever World Biryani Day, which will be celebrated on July 3rd. We don't mind commemorating this special occasion every day because it was thought up by popular rice brand Daawat Basmati Rice for Biryani lovers everywhere.

The brand has chosen to dedicate this day to our favorite food because they recognise that biryani as a dish symbolises the joy of being together and happiness in general. The flavours of this event will be much more delectable and belly-filling when you reside in a foodie's paradise like Delhi.

The most searched dish of 2019 is Biryani thanks to India's fondness for this meal. Not just any Biryani, but specifically Chicken Biryani has become the most looked-for Indian dish on the internet in 2019. Chicken biryani received an average of 4.56 lakh searches each month, according to a SEMrush analysis. Butter Chicken came in second on the list, after Samosa, Chicken Tikka Masala, Dosa, and Tandoori Chicken, according to the survey.

History of Briyani.
The most well-known tale—which we come down on the side of believing—involves Mumtaz Begum. Many women in her period looked up to Mumtaz Begum as an example. Begum visited an army camp and observed that the soldiers' daily diets were deficient in nutrition. She then gave the cooks instructions to prepare a lavish meal that was also nutrient-dense for the battalion. It makes sense that Shahajan would honour Mumtaz Begum by dedicating a stunning Taj Mahal mansion to her.

Food educator and chef Suvir Saran, who said that the biryani made in Hyderabad, Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu differed in scent, texture, and flavour. In the Southern region of India, Biryani is prepared with a weight and depth of spices that are unsurpassed. He thinks that the Southern region of India is where Biryani originated since the Biryani cooked there is more substantial and has a sense of belonging.
