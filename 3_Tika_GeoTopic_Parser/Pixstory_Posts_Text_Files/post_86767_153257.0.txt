International Hayya Card holders coming to Qatar for FIFA World Cup 2022, can now invite three non-ticketed fans to join them.
The ‘Hayya with Me (1+3)’ feature is applicable only to approved Hayya Card holders aged 18 and above, who applied using a FIFA World Cup ticket number.
“The non-ticketed fans applying through a Hayya with Me (1+3) voucher can be any age,” the host country’s website said adding that these non-ticketed fans must hold a valid passport and cannot be Qatar ID holders.
“They must also confirm their accommodation in Qatar during the tournament. Each Hayya with Me (1+3) applicant will need to pay a non-refundable QAR 500 fee. The charge will not apply to children under 12,” the website said.
FIFA World Cup 2022 Qatar kicks off on November 20 and will run until December 18.
International visitors with approved Hayya Card applications will receive an entry permit to the country via email.
