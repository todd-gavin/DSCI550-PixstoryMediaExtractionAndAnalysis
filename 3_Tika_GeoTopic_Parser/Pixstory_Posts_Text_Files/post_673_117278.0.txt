Anecdotes from schools, teachers checking for vapes in classes for the same might be a common happening in school.
In a recent article in leading health journal  British Medical Journal , Andrea Jonas, clinical assistant professor, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA wrote about need to have clear public policy guidelines on Vaping. The doctor writes how 2019 cases of Lung injury due to vaping were reported causing concern.
Here is the abstract of the paper published .
Widespread uptake of vaping has signaled a sea change in the future of nicotine consumption. Vaping has grown in popularity over the past decade, in part propelled by innovations in vape pen design and nicotine flavoring. Teens and young adults have seen the biggest uptake in use of vape pens, which have superseded conventional cigarettes as the preferred modality of nicotine consumption. Relatively little is known, however, about the potential effects of chronic vaping on the respiratory system. Further, the role of vaping as a tool of smoking cessation and tobacco harm reduction remains controversial. The 2019 E-cigarette or Vaping Use-Associated Lung Injury (EVALI) outbreak highlighted the potential harms of vaping, and the consequences of long term use remain unknown. Here, we review the growing body of literature investigating the impacts of vaping on respiratory health. We review the clinical manifestations of vaping related lung injury, including the EVALI outbreak, as well as the effects of chronic vaping on respiratory health and covid-19 outcomes. We conclude that vaping is not without risk, and that further investigation is required to establish clear public policy guidance and regulation.
