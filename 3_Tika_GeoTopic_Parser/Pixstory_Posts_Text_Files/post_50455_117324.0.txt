On 25th June, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI) organized a One Day Symposium on Metabolic Associated Fatty Liver Disease
(MAFLD).

The event started with a welcome note by Prof. Pramod Kumar Garg (ED, THSTI).
The event was organised in three sessions.The first session talks about Disease prevalence, risk factors and pathophysiology

The second session was all about Clinical management and ongoing clinical trials.
 Dr. Ajay K. Duseja from PGIMER, Chandigarh lucidly presented on the need of pharmacotherapy and phase 2 and 3 trials on future Pharmacotherapy in NASH.

The third session was focused on the current efforts for the newer therapeutics for NAFLD. Dr. Mukul Jain from Zydus Research Center, Gandhi Nagar spoke about Current Treatment Armamentarium and Saroglitazar and showed how Saroglitazar is different from TZDs/glitazones in structure and attributes.

Overall it was a learning experience and a great chance of exposure to know about these things. It was worth going there!
