Manchester United are interested in signing Christian Eriksen on a free transfer as Erik ten Hag looks to reshape his midfield.

Eriksen is on United's radar after the departure of creative midfielders Paul Pogba, Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard this month left a void in the squad Ten Hag will inherit. The 30-year-old is available on a free transfer after his short-term deal with Brentford came to an end.

Eriksen has impressed on his return to the Premier League and while Brentford are keen to retain his services, competition from United is likely to prove problematic. The Danish international made his return to competitive football with the Bees in January, after suffering a cardiac arrest during last summer's European Championship, and his performances in the Premier League have caught the eye in the second half of this season.
