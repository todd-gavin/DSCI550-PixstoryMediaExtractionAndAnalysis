There was a lot of excitement among Barcelona fans when Ilaix Moriba burst onto the scene last year under Ronald Koeman.

The La Masia graduate quickly integrated into the first-team setup and appeared frequently in the second half of the 2020/21 season, even getting more game time than experienced midfielders like Miralem Pjanic.

However, the teenager's time at Barça was cut short when he was sold by the club last summer due to his refusal to lower his wage demands. With his contract set to expire in 2022, the Catalans decided to cash in rather than risk losing him for free a year later.

Moriba was eventually signed by RB Leipzig in a €16 million deal. However, according to Mundo Deportivo, the Bundesliga club is already considering selling the midfield prospect during the upcoming summer transfer window.

Moriba didn't get much of a chance at Leipzig under former manager Jesse Marsch. And things didn't get any better under his successor, Domenico Tedesco, who questioned the youngster's attitude and application, leading to a loan move to Valencia in January.

Back in La Liga, the 19-year-old has put in some good performances, and Leipzig are now looking to capitalise by selling him on a permanent basis. If that happens, Barcelona will benefit financially.

Indeed, the Blaugrana included a 10% sell-on clause in their agreement with the German club at the time of Moriba's sale, and they may now reap the benefits of it as the Saxony-based club considers offloading the teenager.

Moriba's contract with Leipzig expires in 2026. And his wages may be a stumbling block in the club's attempt to get him off the books by the summer. However, if they are successful, Barcelona will profit a few million dollars from the operation.
