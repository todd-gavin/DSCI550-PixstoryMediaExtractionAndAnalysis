Music has always played a significant role in my life much before Vecna made an appearance I am not a particularly expressive individual I do not have the gift of eloquence or extravagant vocabulary to express my feelings Thankfully music presents a glamorous escape It permits me to listen to hundreds of songs and choose what resonates with me the most I outsource my desire for expression to an artist in a remote corner of the world Another happy thing money needn t buy I find comfort in Bollywood songs since I am a native Hindi speaker Bollywood might have given some disastrous films but the songs are always masterpieces Lata Mangeshkar Kishore Kumar Shreya Ghoshal KK Arijit Singh Rahat Fateh Ali Khan Sonu Nigam innumerable incredible artists have contributed immensely to Bollywood and we ll always be indebted to them These veterans have not only produced soul touching music but also managed to create a special place in every listener s heart Be it a long day of non stop work or the messy bun not looking perfect music can make anyone feel the way they want Need big hoop energy Listen to Me too by Meghan Trainor Want to cry Try Thodi der by Palak Mucchal Guests not leaving Put on Atithi Tum Kab Jaoge by Amit Trivedi Need to relax Try any instrumental by Yiruma All you need is your earphones and you can dive into the most interesting conversation or the deepest monologue accompanied by an amalgamation of instruments creating a remarkable melody
