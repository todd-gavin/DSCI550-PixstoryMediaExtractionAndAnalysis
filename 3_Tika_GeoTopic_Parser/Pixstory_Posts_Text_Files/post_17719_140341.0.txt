As Great Britain mourns the death of Queen Elizabeth II, the country’s longest-ruling monarch who died on Thursday at the age of 96, Variety is taking a look back at the beloved ruler through photos.
The Queen died at Balmoral, her palace in the Scottish Highlands, surrounded by her children and grandchildren. Earlier this year, she celebrated her Platinum Jubilee, marking a record-breaking 70 years on Great Britain’s throne.
Queen Elizabeth II ascended to the throne in 1952, and reigned through 15 British prime ministers and 14 U.S. presidents, meeting with all of them except Lyndon Johnson. As a cultural icon, the Queen also met with many major celebrities, including the Beatles, Elton John and Spice Girls.
