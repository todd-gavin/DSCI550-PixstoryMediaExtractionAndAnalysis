I wish everyone one trusted their actions more than their anticipations .

I wish everyone trusted their unlimited potential more than the limits conned to us by the world.

I wish everyone was a warrior for their dreams and hater for their fears.

I wish you were that person. Yes, you ,the one reading this. You are that person:)

Do make a thread of what you wish ðŸ˜Š
