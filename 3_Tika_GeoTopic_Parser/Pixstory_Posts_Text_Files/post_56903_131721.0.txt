You know what makes our history more interesting, the mythologies make some unsettling arguments, and there are some unsettling views on doppelgangers as well.
Although we never truly accept a myth without accepting it as reality and same is with these unsettled thoughts on lookalike.
Uncanny folklores tell that doppelgangers were considered ill omens; if you saw one, then it would hint at impending illness or bad luck. However, it isn't a death omen until you see your doppelganger.
The other one is that they cast no shadows and have no reflections in a mirror or river, most likely a ghost, as folklore suggests.
The another one is that doppelgangers are our evil twin; they act in a contrary, nefarious or insidious manner; they're like a physical copy of one's self but with an altered morality.
Most importantly, they make some great anecdotes. After all, we all want to believe and remind ourselves of the thought that there exists someone exactly like us.
Whether scientifically or in stories, we want to hear more of it, so yes, they create some great tales worth believing at.
