Matthijs De Ligt has completed his move from Juventus to Bayern Munich. Italian journalist Fabrizio Romano broke the news on his social media sites confirming the transfer publicly. 

The Dutch defender started off his career at Ajax before making a name for himself at Juventus in the last three seasons. De Ligt made 117 appearances for Juventus, also winning a Serie A title in his stint. 

As per the report, Bayern Munich have made a bid of â‚¬80m + add-ons for the Dutch defender. Juventus have verbally accepted the bid however the paperwork is yet to be completed between the two clubs. 

Matthijs De Ligt has reportedly agreed to personal terms with Bayern Munich and is expected to sign a 5-year contract at the club. This would keep the Netherlands star employed at Bayern until June 2027. 

Chelsea were also reportedly interested in De Ligt and had also made an official bid for the player as per reports. However, their offer was deemed too low by Juventus and Bayern Munich made full use of this as they cashed in on the opportunity to sign the star defender. 

It has to be seen if De Ligt could help Bayern Munich regain their European crown next season.
