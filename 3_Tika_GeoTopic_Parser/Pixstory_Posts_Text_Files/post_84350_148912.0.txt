The biggest ever YouTube event took place on the 24th September, 2022 as the Sidemen FC took on the YouTube All-stars and won 8-7 in a charity match. 
The event manged to collect over 1 million pounds (£) and all of the money was split to 4 charities:
~ Teenage Cancer Trust
~ Living Miserably
~ Rays of Sunshine
~ M7E
Overall, 15 goals were scored in total with over 27,000 fans in attendance and  2.4 million live viewers watching as well. 
I'd say that this was a good warmup match for all football fans, as the world cup isn't too far away.
