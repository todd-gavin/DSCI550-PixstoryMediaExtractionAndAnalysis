Tottenham Hotspur FC took on La Liga side Sevilla in their second pre-season friendly today at the South Korea’s Suwon World Cup stadium. Spurs have so far made the most out of their pre-season tour in South Korea. They took on K-League XI in their three days ago, kicking off their campaign with an emphatic 6-3 win. Their match against Sevilla, on the other hand, was not equally eventful and it ended in a 1-1 draw. 

Tottenham Hotspur started with a much stronger playing XI compared to Sevilla from the very beginning with hopes of getting a positive result. To everyone’s surprise, however, it was Sevilla who dominated the entirety of the match. Juan Lopetegui’s men had complete control of the game with 56% possession. They attempted 12 shots but unfortunately had only 2 shots on target which proves that Sevilla need to work on their offense ahead of next season. They missed a couple of easy chances and were also unlucky on several occassions. 

Spurs opened scoring with Harry Kane’s 50th minute goal. Heung-min Son dribbled past the Sevilla defense but lost the ball inside the box and fron there it was a poacher’s finish for the English captain. Sevilla’s Croatian midfielder Ivan Rakitic scored the equializer in the 67th minute with a screamer right from the edge of the box. 

One thing that was evident from today’s match was that Sevilla have lots to work on ahead of the upcoming season. They are set to lose one of their best defenders Jules Kounde to FC Barcelona in this transfer window which is a major loss. Lopetegui will have to transform Sevilla’s defense from the scratch now. 

Sevilla will next face Arsenal in the Emirates Cup final followed by Leicester City in a friendly. Tottenham Hotspur on the other hand will take on Rangers and Roma in their next two matches.
