I clicked this picture a few days back when i went to this cafe with my frnds to hang out and omg it was such a wonderful day.
 Me and my frnds first went to this old book shop where we purchased few of our novels , which we luckily found. 

Then our stomach demanded food coz we big foodies so yeah ...we went to this cool cafe and had a whole full meal and then we went to this garden where we ended our day with a choclate ice cream 💜 

HAD A LOT OF FUN🤌🏻
