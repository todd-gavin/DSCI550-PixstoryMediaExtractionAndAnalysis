As a cisgendered man, I have no issue calling folks what they want to be called. I don't mind being corrected when I use the incorrect pronouns either. I think it's such a man-baby thing to be crying about why people want to choose for themselves.
Trans people are not the only ones who choose to use certain pronouns, all cis people do too. I definitely prefer to be addressed as he/him because it feels the most natural for me on a personal level. For example, being referred to as she/her feels unusual and unpleasant to me because it simply isn't who I am. If I expect that respect from others, it becomes my foremost duty to offer the same courtesy and consideration to others. Why would I want to make someone feel uncomfortable when I can just not? Pronouns are absolutely harmless and if someone wants to be called a certain way, why can't we just do that? I see no reason why someone's personal choice should need your approval.
For the basic reason called humanity, you should be respecting the choices people made for themselves. All you folks seem to be very particular about manners and etiquette unless you have to show it to someone who don't fit your mold? What a pity!
