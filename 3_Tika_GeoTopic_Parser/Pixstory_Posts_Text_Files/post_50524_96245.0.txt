The simple easy to understand yet hard to embrace fact is that without us the environment is mostly fine.Itâ€™s because of us that there is environmental destruction. This happened because of us, not lack of our help.

If we can't take any initiative to protect it , let's just atleast not try to harm it further. We are just somehow unknowingly being victimized of causing harm to the planet.
This is because we get accustomed to this sedentary, customised life . We do not care that how much litre of water we have just wasted or how much plastics we have used

Let's just take pledge to let go of this ignorant behaviour and try to become more sensitive towards this environmental behaviour.
