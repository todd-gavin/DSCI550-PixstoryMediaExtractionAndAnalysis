Neymar Jr is on absolute fire right now for PSG in Ligue 1.Since his big money move from Barcelona to PSG in August 2017, Neymar has had mixed fortunes throughout his time - primarily down to fitness issues. PSG came close to winning the Champions League in the 2019/20 season but he couldn’t help steer PSG over the line alongside Mbappé. Over the last three seasons (excluding 22/23), Neymar has missed between 14-22 games per season so it is fair to say he hasn’t ever felt fully fit and 100% on top of his game.So far this season, he’s in the form of his life - producing Ballon D’or-like numbers. 10 goals and 7 assists at this time of writing will be the headlines, but it’s everything else that will catch your eye. 3.1 key passes per game.1.1 for possession won (final third) per game.75.1 touches per game.Neymar is maxing out other metrics such as take-ons attempted, fast-breaks and fouls won in the league - check out Squawka’s platform to see these. Though these are just numbers on paper, I’d argue the eye test backs up the types of performance he’s producing. That Brazilian flair is kicking.For Neymar to really cement himself for the club - alongside Mbappé and Messi - they must push the club into deeper territory such as winning the Champions League, which is the endgame scenario for the club. This is what they are working towards, so it will remain to be seen how far they go. Anything less, then Neymar will have an ‘ordinary’ season. The elite players don’t have ordinary seasons.What are your thoughts?
