Make a decision as to where you wish to go first Just use internet to look into some intriguing locations National park websites local tourism websites and even Wikipedia are reliable resources Make sure your passport visas and other documentation are up to date if you want to travel abroad Since it sometimes takes many months to resolve this needs to be done as soon as possible Additionally this is an excellent time to obtain any shots you might require You must choose your travel dates after deciding where you want to go My departure time is typically quite clear to me planning it ahead helps in cheap flights Packing for a trip is my least favorite part so I start two weeks before the trip This way I have plenty of time to decide and it doesn t feel stressful Print out all your documents a day or two before your flights and keep them handy When I travel I like to move around a lot If I m only travelling in the US I prefer to rent a car unless I m in a city with good public transit like New York They are less expensive than some places for example Europe car rentals in the US are usually the most cost effective way to travel around In Europe getting from place to place by bus or train is rather simple I avoid renting cars in Europe Japan or Australia cause budget Always spend less than you got I can never say this enough do not spend all your money You can need it for anything A lot of people find getting medical assistance in foreign countries difficult always keep extra money with you If you re on budget don t go to places that are expensive or it ll be a waste trip If you are time bound don t go too far away Flights consume a lot of our travel time so I d suggest pick a destination near you Happy traveling
