Amazon on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against the administrators of more than 10,000 Facebook groups who allegedly worked as fake review brokers.

The lawsuit filed in King County Superior Court in Seattle accuses the group admins of pleading for reviews for items in exchange for money or free products. 

One of the groups, “Amazon Product Review,” had more than 43,000 members, and allegedly proposed refunds or other payments to buyers willing to leave bogus reviews on products like camera tripods and car stereos.

Another group, called “Amazon Varified Buyer & Seller,” had more than 2,500 members, the complaint said. Administrators allegedly sought out fake reviews, and gave them to Amazon sellers, charging $10 per review, according to screenshots of Facebook messages contained in the complaint.

Facebook parent company Meta has taken down half of the more than 10,000 groups reported by Amazon, and proceeds to investigate others, Amazon said.
