This festive season to me is a celebration, which includes spending time with my family, decorating the entire house, inside and out, and shopping, for the people I love. Doing this with the people I love is what means the most to me. Celebrating with my family is very important to me.
This festival has one teaching or we can say that this festival is all about the ‘victory of good over evil’.
Large Pendals with elaborate decorations, dazzling illumination are erected at several places in cities and also in rural areas. The use of precious metals like gold and silver in huge quantities on the image of Goddess Durga makes this festival grand and golden.
The festival lights in the streets bring in a glory, the sounds of  'Dandiya' sticks these nine days of Navratri dither me. 
Happy Dusshera to all of you!!
