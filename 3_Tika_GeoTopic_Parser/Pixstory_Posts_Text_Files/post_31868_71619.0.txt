Virat Kohli's sudden decision to step down as India's Test captain took social media by storm on Saturday. The prolific right-handed batter, who has been leading India in Test cricket as full-time captain since January 2015, took to Twitter to make the announcement. "Everything has to come to a halt at some stage and for me as Test captain of India, it's now. There have been many ups and also some downs along the journey but there has never been lack of effort or lack of belief," Kohli said in his statement.
