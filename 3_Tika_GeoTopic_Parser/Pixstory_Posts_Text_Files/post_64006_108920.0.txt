Draupadi Murmu, the former governor of Jharkhand is going to be the next president of India. It is said to be a historic decision since Draupadi Murmu would also be the first president coming from a tribal community. She would also be the second female president after Smt. Pratibha Patil. The story of this woman is itself very inspiring. Coming from a family with no political history, she has made it this far with her hard work and commitment. We hope that her experience and diligence would take India to greater heights.
