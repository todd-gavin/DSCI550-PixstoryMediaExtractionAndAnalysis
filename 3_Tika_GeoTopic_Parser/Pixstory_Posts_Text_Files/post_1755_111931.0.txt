For the first time, the Palace Street or popularly called as the ‘Bada Danda’ in Paralakhemundi, the district headquarter of Gajapati district has been painted and decorated on the eve of Rath Yatra like a beautiful carpet.

It took four days for four artists and 15 lady painters to paint beautiful drawings on an area of 30 X 100 feet on the road that ended June 28. Thanks to the concept by the Collector Gajapati Lingaraj Panda and the Paralakhemundi Municipality who sponsored the decoration with an estimated cost of Rs 2 lakh.

"Four artists were brought from Bhubaneswar to draw the sketch of the drawing on the road and 15 ladies who mostly belong to the local area put colour on these sketches with their magical hand. The locals have welcomed and appreciated such initiative", said Rajendra Behera, an active member of the Rath Yatra Committee.

"The decoration of the chariots this year would be more attractive. We have borrowed the service of 30 artisans from Sitapur village nearby Paralakhemundi who are now giving final touches to the chariots", he said.

"Another new feature of this year’s Rath Yatra would be rendering devotional songs on make-shift stage by local artists about 200 meters away from the Jagannath temple on the Palace Street during pulling of chariots. The makeshift stage would be packed up as and when the chariots come nearer to the spot. Such a programme  would definitely create a devotional atmosphere and help to tackle traffic congestion", said Rajendra.

The Jagannath temple in Paralakhemundi, which was built 277 years ago in 1745 AD, was demolished on December 2, 2014, by Maharaja Gopinath Gajapati to replace it with a new temple. The construction of the new temple is going on. But history proves how old the tradition of Rath Yatra in Paralakhemundi is.
