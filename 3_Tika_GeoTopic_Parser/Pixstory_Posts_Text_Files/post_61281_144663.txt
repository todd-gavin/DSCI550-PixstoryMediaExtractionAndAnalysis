Day of hitting the box office and Brahmastra continues to receive both positive and negative reviews While some can t seem to get enough of the extraordinary Vfx there are some who regret watching the movie because of the lack of a meaningful storyline It is rightly said that Negative publicity is still publicity The more the movie is receiving backlash the more it is selling A large chunk of the curious public are still willing to watch the film just to figure out what went wrong with the story line The movie crossed the cr mark in the first week itself and as a result National Cinema Day had to be postponed from th September to rd September so that the movie sells big The film itself is one of the most expensive movie produced in India of all times with a budget of crores And thus at the end of the day no matter how much hate the film keeps receiving it doesn t matter much as long it continues to sell While the social media won t stop creating memes to ridicule the movie there still are some viewers who loved the movie because of its visually enthralling effects and are eagerly waiting for the second part With its spine rising Vfx it s just the beginning of a new face of Bollywood There s always a first time for everything and Bramhastra proved that Bollywood is capable of producing such game changing movies as well In my opinion people should watch it at least for once as a lot of efforts and money has been put on creating this wonder No matter how good or bad the movie reviews are go and see for yourself you can t trust the critics always as these days it has become a trend to boycott Bollywood movies And if someone isn t willing to shell out money for watching it just wait for rd and watch it for Rs only wink wink
