I really admire Ed Sheeran as a musician. The quality of work he does, the amount of time and efforts he put into his work and just how much he cares about his creations is pretty easily spoken or heard through the music he makes. He's an incredible artist. It's hard to dislike, let alone hate, anything that comes from him.

My personal favourite from his is, like many other, 'Perfect'. The lyrics depict a basic but beautiful and understandable love story of a couple. This song boasts some of the best, most streamlined, free-flowing, and fascinating lyrics ever written by a songwriter. The innocent purity underlying the friendship is depicted in the manner Sheeran composed and arranged this song within a stunning scenery, and it beckons nostalgia at its peak.

The story of young love draped in nostalgia and dreamy perfections. The eyes through which one sees his lover and the perfect life he imagines with her is stunningly touching. It's amazing to say the least.
