In Trump s bid to change and restructure the Republican party the state of Georgia is key Trump has been endorsing the candidates that he favors and has been involved in trying to influence different electoral races Georgia Georgia had been a Republican stronghold from through However the state has become increasingly competitive and in Democrat Joe Biden won by over Donald Trump It was the narrowest margin of victory in the country that year Trump has been obsessed over the state of Georgia ever since he became the first Republican presidential nominee to lose the state in over years This once Republican stronghold and a so called Red State has in recent elections become a swing state Georgia isn t just going to be a must watch state in the elections but it ll also be in the center of the US politics in the presidential elections and the one as well Trump has appointed former Senator David Perdue to run against Brian Kemp in his attempts to influence the governer elections taking place in the state Kemp had not backed the former President in his claims of the election being stolen and analysts are seeing it as Trump s vengeance for that particular event If the candidates being backed up by Trump win it ll be a strong indicator of the state s choices and will certainly help Trump become a favorite in the upcoming presidential elections and show the grip he possesses on the Republican Party The slim margin of by which the the Democrats were victorous in shows that Georgia is a state which could decide the outcome of the whole election Even when Trump won in he only did so by a margin of showing the competitiveness in the state Georgia s has sixteen electors more than all but seven other states That s why Trump is trying his level best to mobilise the voters behind the politicians of his choice who could play crucial roles in the future elections in which he will be a candidate
