Antibiotics are interesting molecules for several reasons. One is that they are made at all. Why would a microbe expend materials and energy to make an antibiotic? What selective advantage do they provide? How do they contribute to the ecology of the microbe? Do they serve a purpose other than killing other microbes?

These questions are still not fully answered. Another reason these molecules are interesting is that they are structurally complex. Despite this, they are built using the same precursor metabolites and many of the same biochemical processes used in the anabolic pathways that sustain life.

The story of Alexander Fleming’s rediscovery of penicillin in 1929 is well known. However, Fleming had little to do with developing penicillin as a treatment for infectious disease because after some initial experiments, he abandoned the study of its activity.

Fortunately, Ernst Chain developed an interest in the chemical and eventually purified it. In 1940, as many nations battled in World War II, Howard Florey and his assistants began clinical trials with penicillin. By that time, Selman Waksman had discovered several other antibacterial agents and had coined the term antibiotic to mean an antibacterial agent produced by a microbe.

The penicillin trials were successful, and the need for antibiotics during World War II to treat wound infections was the impetus for finding and developing more antibiotics for clinical use. A few years later a ready supply was available. Antimicrobial chemotherapy evolved from antisepsis efforts
