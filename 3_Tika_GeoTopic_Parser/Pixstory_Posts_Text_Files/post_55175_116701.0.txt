Let me tell you that some ice creams are healthier than others but ice cream isn't as bad as we all think!

The health benefits of ice cream are that it provides more energy than whole milk at 137 Calories of energy according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and is great for someone who is trying to gain weight.

It also contains vitamins and minerals such as calcium and phosphorus. Calcium and phosphorus work together to build strong teeth and bones and help prevent osteoporosis.

Moreover, Ice cream contains some important nutrients, like calcium, vitamin D and vitamin A, among others. 

Therefore, Ice cream is neither good for you nor bad for you. Components can be beneficial or unhealthy, and some goods have more or different ingredients than others. Ice cream is not your enemy, despite the fact that it contains both beneficial and toxic elements. 

Additionally, it has health advantages, therefore it is preferable to have it in moderation, just like any other dessert. So on these sweltering summer days, relax and indulge in a few scoops of your favourite ice cream.
