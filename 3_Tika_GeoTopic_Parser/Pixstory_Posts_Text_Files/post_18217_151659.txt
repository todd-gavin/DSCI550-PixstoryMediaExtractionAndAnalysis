Earlier this week the Met Gala was revealed to be Karl Lagerfeld themed an announcement that s already garnered controversy If you re unfamiliar with Karl s work he was the creative director of Chanel Fendi and his own label The Met Gala will coincide with the Met s exhibition Karl Lagerfeld A Line of Beauty which will see around pieces paired with Lagerfeld s original sketches Every one of his designs began as a sketch Andrew Bolton the Costume Institute s curator explained He said I draw just as I breathe However the designer has been the subject of criticism throughout his career In particular his anti fat language surrounding women s bodies has been called cruel even explicitly saying no one wants to see round women when the magazine Brigitte announced that it would use ordinary realistic women over models in Other comments include calling Adele a little too fat Heidi Klum too heavy saying Pippa Middleton should only show her back and adding that Coco Chanel wasn t a feminist because she was never ugly enough for that Then there s Lagerfeld s murky history with sexual assault He sent flowers to accused rapist Dominique Strauss Kahn He defended stylist Karl Templer after he was accused of sexual assault and said If you don t want your pants pulled about don t become a model Join a nunnery there ll always be a place for you in the convent and said he was fed up with the Me Too movement He had Claudia Schiffer appear in blackface and yellowface in He called Muslims the worst enemies of Jewish people in while criticizing the acceptance of refugees in France Indeed much of this was reexamined following his death in Subsequently following the Met s announcement many took to social media to criticize the theme This included Jameela Jamil who has been a vocal critic of Lagerfeld for years Why is THIS who we celebrate when there are so many AMAZING designers out who aren t bigoted white men she added We didn t fight all this shit just to throw it all away because some white guy made some pretty clothes for people s skinny faves come on now
