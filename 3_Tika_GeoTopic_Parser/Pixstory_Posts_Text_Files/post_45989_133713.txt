We all must have read the news about student debts getting cancelled by now I have had the chance to talk about people around me and now I can finally form a well informed opinion Now a major reason for people choosing Biden for President was his promise to forgive student debt Now it hasn t happened completely but yes people are happy with Biden Some are saying this was to boost his image but who cares Earlier criticisers of Biden are saying that he is just trying to evade the issue by saying that the Biden administration is looking into whether this could be done without Congress s approval They were constantly pressuring Biden to use executive authority to forgive for every borrower But is forgiving the student debt really the way to go According to me yes Firstly we have to keep in mind that education should not be a privilege but a right Unfortunately in our country many students are unable to afford to go to college because of financial reasons This creates a ripple effect wherein because of lack of good education they are unable to get a good job unemployed rates rise and ultimately the economy of the country is affected Even people who are able to somehow make it through student loans spend the majority of their youth trying to pay back the loans and are unable to afford a comfortable life despite working so hard They are unable to acquire wealth buy a house afford insurance and save for their retirement
