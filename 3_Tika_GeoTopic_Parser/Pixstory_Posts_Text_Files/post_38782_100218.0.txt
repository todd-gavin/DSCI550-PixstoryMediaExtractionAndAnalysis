From the clusters, we can see that in the first cluster he has made 892 passes and crosses into the attacking third and in the six yards box. However in the second cluster we can see that he has distributed passes to his defenders, having made 751 passes to them. Sosa’s ability to switch up the play has seen him spraying 95 passes from the right wing.

Sosa and Stuttgart center forward Sasa Kalajdzic share a great chemistry. Kalajdzic standing at a towering height of 6 ft 7 inches, is always there in the six yards box to receive the Croatian’s looping cross in the air. Kalajdzic, being the tallest player in the Bundesliga has been recipient of Sosa’s creative production(passes and crosses from aerial play, open play and from dead balls and free kicks). 



Ball Creation


Sosa has made a total of 99 shots creating actions and 13 goal creating chances, having made 3.70 and 0.49 per match. His linkup play with Kalajdzic is excellent, If we compare him to Man United’s Shaw and Telles we can see that both of them made 64, 6 and 43 and 5 shots and goal creating chances. Taking their tallies per match to 3.60 and 0.34 per 90 for Shaw and 2.46 and 0.29 per 90. That’s very poor compared to Sosa. It goes to show how badly Man United need a left back.

Touches and Carries


Looking at his touches, Sosa has made most of the touches and carried the ball into the final third with him having made whooping 746 touches while drifting down the attacking third and he has carried the ball 60 times in the opponents attacking third. He ranks 94 and 81 percentile in touches and carrying the ball. If we compare Luke Shaw and Alex Telles, as both are attacking fullbacks,have made 473 touches and 51 times he has carried the ball down the left flank. Coming over to Alex Telles has made 439 touches and has carried the ball on his feet 40 times
