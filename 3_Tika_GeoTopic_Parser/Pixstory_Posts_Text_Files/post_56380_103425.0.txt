Letting go is an art. We often give up on things but refuse to let go of them. It stays in our minds and at times disturbs us deeply and affects us everything we do similar things. 

Letting go of anything from any object to a person can be difficult for some people. This is because of the affection you had, grown into possessiveness and sometimes toxic nature that was inculcated in you. Even if you let go of it physically. Memories stay in your mind and might haunt you down-give your sleepless nights. So what isn't in your capability should be removed from your mind too. It might not be easy but it can be done. 

Letting go mindfully gives you peace. Makes scope for new adventures on your way. Memories are good when they are motivated to live but some memories keep you in a loop of trauma, expectations and pain. These need to leave your mind. You can let go buy distracting yourself when the memory hits. Thinking about the positive aspects of letting go, Understanding the negativity that caused you-or the need for you to give up-all these factors help you to let go of memories.
