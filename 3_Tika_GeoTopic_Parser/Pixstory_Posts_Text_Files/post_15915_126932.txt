ABSTRACT BACKGROUND The incidence of esophageal cancer has increased faster than most cancers Evidence from other malignancies suggests that diabetic patients have a worse response to multi modality therapy We hypothesize that diabetic patients with esophageal cancer will have a decreased response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation compared to non diabetic patients METHODS A retrospective study of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons General Thoracic Surgery Database identified all patients who had an esophagectomy following neoadjuvant therapy for esophageal cancer between and Patients were compared based on the presence of diabetes A complete pathologic response pCR was defined as ypT N Chi Square and Wilcoxon Rank sum test were used to compare patients demographic and clinical characteristics between those with and without diabetes Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the predictors of response to neoadjuvant therapy RESULTS patients met inclusion criteria with DM and without DM Patients with DM were older more likely to be males and were more likely to have all comorbidities Univariate analysis revealed diabetic patients were less likely to have pCR vs p Although multivariable analysis showed a trend toward diabetic patients having lower odds of achieving pCR diabetes was not independently associated with pCR OR CI p CONCLUSIONS Diabetic patients may be less likely to achieve pCR compared to non diabetics after neoadjuvant treatment of esophageal cancer This suggests the need for further exploration as diabetic patients with esophageal cancer can potentially benefit from different treatment paradigms compared to their non diabetic counterparts Sources
