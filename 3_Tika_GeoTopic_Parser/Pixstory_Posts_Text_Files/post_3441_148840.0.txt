The concept and understanding of how causes and conditions govern every action of ours was absent in me then, hence that book may have a more reactive tone to it. .In 'Not Just Cricket', I have tried my best to write and explore the entire narrative with a gentle gaze.

I, however, have voiced my opinion in a way that it is the reader who decides whether a given situation is wrong or right, based on his cognition and understanding.. It's a story, where there are characters, a plot and dialogues.
