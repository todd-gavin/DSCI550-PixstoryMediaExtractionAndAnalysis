Canadian becomes youngest-ever winner of world’s toughest downhill race.

Rising Canadian downhill star Jackson Goldstone became the youngest-ever winner of Red Bull Hardline as the 18-year-old dominated the world’s toughest downhill course to win the race in Wales by more than six seconds over local riders Joe Smith and Taylor Vernon. Here is all you need to know:

- Goldstone might only be 18, but the teenager already has an impressive haul of accolades. The 2021 Junior World Champion and 2022 Junior World Cup overall winner also showed he’s already more than a match for the the world’s most demanding downhill course during a brilliant finals run.

- After qualifying in third place behind three-time event winner Bernard Kerr and Adam Brayton, he left the start hut with only those two riders left to go.

- Ahead on the timing from the first split, his lead simply grew as he flew down the track. A slight dab in the technical section at the mid-way point was the only fault of note in an amazing run and he was completely unfazed by any of the course's monster features.

- Crossing the line with a margin of more than six seconds over Joe Smith’s previously best time, it would take something special to beat Goldstone’s time of 2m 20.525s.

- Slips from both Brayton and Kerr left Goldstone head and shoulders above the rest and he became the youngest-ever winner in the process of claiming his first win in the event.

“I had a really good run and I linked everything I wanted to, with just one tiny mistake," said Goldstone. "I'm so stoked, but it’s not the way I wanted to win. I'm really gutted for all the boys who went down.”

- Both Smith and Taylor Vernon put in solid, fault-free runs to secure second and third places respectively.

- Vernon qualified 13th but held on to the hot seat until the final six riders and the Welsh rider held on for third, recording his best performance at Red Bull Hardline.
