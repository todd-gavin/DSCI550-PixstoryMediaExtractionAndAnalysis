Arjun Kapoor and Malaika Arora have been dating each other for over three years now. The two made it Instagram official in 2019 and since then, they are quite open about their relationship and do not shy away from posting about each other. ❤️Malaika told Masala magazine, “I think the constitution of marriage is beautiful. At the same time, I don’t think you should rush into getting married because it is a social requirement or pressure. Do it for the right reasons. ✔️There are times when parents Force you and people say that your ‘biological clock is ticking’. It is a beautiful institution if you are with the right person. When it comes to my marriage, I think I am not ready to answer it just yet.” ✔️👍Malaika Arora even spoke about her bond with her boyfriend Arjun Kapoor and called him her biggest cheerleader. ❤️“He is that not only that I bond with him, but he is also my best friend. It’s very important to love your best friend and fall in love with him. Arjun gets me, he understands me, he says it the way things are. ❤️I think we both are each other’s biggest cheerleaders as well. I can talk to him about anything and everything under the sun. That’s the most important bit about being in a relationship – you should be able to just be your true self and I can just be myself around Arjun.”👍✅
