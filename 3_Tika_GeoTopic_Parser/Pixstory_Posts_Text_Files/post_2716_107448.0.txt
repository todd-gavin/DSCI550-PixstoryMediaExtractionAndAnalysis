Today is Birth anniversary of Suraiya.
No formal training in singing. No certified acting classes. Yet she ruled the silver screen for over two decades. One of the most sensational actresses during the golden eras, Suraiya is remembered for her drop-dead beautiful looks and melodious voice. A career that began from hosting a children's program on All India Radio rose dramatically as she conquered the world of Indian cinema for both singing and acting. Such was the impact of this classic almond-eyed beauty that caught hold of the attention of every onlooker that crossed her. Interestingly, there were times when the Mumbai roads were jammed up not due to a long line of cars, but because people were trying to catch a glimpse of the charismatic actress named Suraiya. Though she chose to keep a low profile following her retirement from singing and acting, her effervescent charm  kept the flame alive.
Suraiya was a superstar of 40s before Madhubala and Nargis entered the scene. She started acting at the age of 6 and singing at the age of 12. At her peak, she did 12 films in 1949. She was madly in love with Dev Anand. They planned a temple wedding with help of Durga Khote but her grandmother came to know and threatened Surayia with Dev Anandâ€™s murder. She remained single all her life.
