On the th of the Bundesliga advance yesterday evening Bochum were losing against Borussia MÃ¼nchengladbach A little more than minutes from the end, the triple whistle came from the referee because one of the two linesmen was hit by a glass of beer thrown by a fan of the home team disappointed with the result After a quick consultation with his assistant who in the meantime had collapsed the referee decided to suspend the match It is very probable that what happened at the Vonovia Ruhrstadion will have consequences first of all the defeat by forfeit for Bochum really a shame not being able to finish this match considering it was the first time we returned in front of a thousand spectators commented Bochum sporting director Sebastian Schindzielorz Not acceptable we have to apologize in all forms for what happened Harsh words also from the deputy Bochum coach Markus Gellhaus First of all we have to apologize embarrassing and unacceptable sad that a game has to be stopped like this because something like this happened I wish the linesman to be fit again as soon as possible
