PSG captain and Chelsea target Marquinhos recently revealed that everything is going in the right direction amid contract negotiation rumors with the French club. Speaking to RMC Sport, the Brazilian revealed that the club and sporting director Leonardo is aware of his demands and added that his future is PSG.

The Brazilian's current contract with PSG will expire in 2024 and the club have started discussions with Marquinhos to extend his contract. Marquinhos recently revealed that he is calm about the negotiations.

The 27-year-old added that the club are well aware of his needs and confirmed that everything is going in the right direction. Marquinhos said:

"My future is PSG. Leonardo knows my desire, as do the club – they know what I want. I have it calmly in my head that my place is here. The club has shown the faith and respect it has for me. Everything is going in the right direction."

Chelsea have been monitoring Maequinhos's contract situation over the past few weeks as they are interested in signing him. The Blues want to reunite the Brazilian with his former manager at PSG, Thomas Tuchel.

However, it looks like Marquinhos' future is in Paris and, therefore, a move to Stamford Bridge seems unlikely.
