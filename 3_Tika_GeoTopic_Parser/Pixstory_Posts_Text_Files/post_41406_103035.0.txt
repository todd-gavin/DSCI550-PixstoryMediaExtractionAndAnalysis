Omar Khan didn't take long to realise he wanted to be around football. He knew his life's objective was to be involved with the NFL as a child growing up in New Orleans as an ardent Saints fan in the 1980s and 1990s. 

As per US News, even as he grew older and realised, like nearly any kid who fantasises about playing football on Sundays in the fall, that he probably didn't have the talent to really pull a helmet over his head and sprint out of the tunnel, the ambition remained the same. 

Khan would repeatedly tell his father A.R. and mother Carmen that he wanted to play in the league. Somehow. 

“All I wanted to do was work in the NFL, become a general manager and win a bunch of Super Bowls,” Khan said.

Khan, 45, has already won two Super Bowls as a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers after joining the team more than two decades ago. 

After the Steelers promoted him to general manager to replace Kevin Colbert, he'll get a chance to do it as the man in charge.

“I’m confident time will show this was the right decision for this franchise,” Khan said shortly after being formally introduced. "I don’t take anything for granted. I understand the expectations that come with this job.”
