Surprisingly, the economic system of capitalism has continued to be criticized in 2022. Many individuals who dislike capitalism embrace socialist and communist economic systems. Since it is far too easy to just reject socialism and communism, we should investigate why anti-capitalism sentiment has gained traction.
 
In general, it seems that mostly younger individualsloath capitalism. This is likely due to their extensive use of social media, where they are privy to the private lives of others and are algorithmically presented content with which they are inclined to agree in order for the platform to maintain their interest.

 Without a doubt, there is more wealth in the world today than there was a century ago, and this is due to the fact that people in the United States are free to engage in voluntary transactions with others and are motivated to achieve a better future with more opportunity and comfort, rather than maintaining their current lifestyle as opposed to having their efforts be directly, rather than indirectly, shared with those who put in no effort.

Due to social media, younger individuals are often receptive to socialist and communist extremists who hate capitalism and use analogies and anecdotes to demonstrate why capitalism is terrible. They often point out vulnerabilities in our healthcare system and other companies that can legally exploit individuals. While they continue to criticize capitalism based on these instances, it is virtually always the case that capitalism can handle the issue more effectively than the government. For instance, while medicine prices are exceedingly expensive, there are websites like as Mark Cuban's "costdrugsplus.com" who provide drugs with a 15% markup.
