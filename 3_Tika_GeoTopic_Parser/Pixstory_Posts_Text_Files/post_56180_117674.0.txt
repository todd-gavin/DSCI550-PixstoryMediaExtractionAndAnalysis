In the latest tory leadership ballot, Penny Mordaunt was eliminated and now Rishi Sunak will face Liz Truss in the race to be the next Prime Minister.

In the final vote among the Tory MPs, Truss overturned Ms. Mordaunt's slim lead conserving a place in the run-off by 113 votes to 105.

Rishi Sunak who topped the final ballot with 137 votes and Liz truss will now have the face-off for the final round. Now the decision is in the hands of MPs of the Conservative party members.

Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, a Truss supporter, said her campaign had "come with momentum at the end".
He added that her stance on post-Brexit regulatory reforms and plans to help those on low incomes had persuaded colleagues to back her.

The campaign for Mr. Sunak, the former chancellor, said his 137 votes were a "really strong result with a clear mandate from MPs".
