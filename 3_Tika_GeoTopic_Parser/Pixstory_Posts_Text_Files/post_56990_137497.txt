The actual process could be a little intimidating but again interesting The practice of acupuncture aims at inserting needles into any of hundreds of points that are located in our body as meridians Needles do not include the ones that can harm the body instead the needle used is quite arrowheaded and has done points The correct measurement of insertion is around to mm in depth while some other procedures use insertions up to inches deep in the skin Another startling factor is that once the needle is inserted into the skin it is moved twisted twirled and connected to a low voltage altering current for the duration of its use This unexpected method makes the therapy scarier but the results are very positive The physician often inserts needles at a considerable distance from where they re to act Like a needle inserted into the pad of the thumb is expected to produce analgesia in the abdomen
