The renowned screenwriter and filmmaker was prodded to reflect on his 50-year career in cinema before the global premiere of his most recent film, Master Gardener, on Saturday at the Venice Film Festival. The auteur will be awarded an honorary Golden Lion for his services to cinema in Venice the following week. 

Hollywood Reporter said that early on in the press conference, Schrader was questioned about which of his own films best reflected who he is as a director. 

“You know, directors like and dislike their children for different reasons,” he replied. “Probably my favorite is Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters, just because it’s the damnedest thing. I still can’t believe I ever made that film. The most personal for me is First Reformed or Affliction. The best stylistically, I think, is Comfort of Strangers. Cat People is kind of special. You know, others, for other reasons. So, I’ve been very lucky. But I’ve made some zeros, too, like we all do.”
