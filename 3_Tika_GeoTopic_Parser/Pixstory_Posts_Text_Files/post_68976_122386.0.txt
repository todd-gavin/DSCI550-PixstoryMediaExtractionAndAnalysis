The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the schedule for the upcoming Australia and South Africa’s tour of India.

India’s international home season 2022-23 will commence with a three-match T-20 series against Australia in September and will be followed by a three-match T-20 and ODI series against South Africa.

The BCCI press release on Wednesday confirmed Barsapara stadium in Guwahati as one of the hosts for the much-awaited T-20 series which will be played just ahead of the T-20 World Cup in Australia.

The home series against South Africa will begin in Thiruvananthapuram. The second T-20 will be played on October 2nd at Guwahati, followed by the last T-20 at Indore.

The action will then shift to Lucknow on 6th October where the ODI series will get underway. Ranchi and Delhi will host the second and third ODI respectively.

Earlier in January 2020, India was scheduled to play at Barsapara stadium against Sri Lanka in a T-20 match which was abandoned due to rain and poor playing conditions.
