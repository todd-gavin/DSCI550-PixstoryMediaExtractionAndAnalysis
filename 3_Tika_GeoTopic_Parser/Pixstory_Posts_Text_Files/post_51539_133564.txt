ON MARCO ASENSIO S UNSETTLED SITUATION Asensio is assessing his position we re waiting on him Everything will be cleared up by September nd If Asensio says he ll be an important member of the squad If he goes we ll have to accept it we ll weigh up if there are good offers for him and the club He contributed a lot last year and that will be the same again if he stays We re prepared for all options If he stays I ll be thrilled and if he wants to go we ll respect his decision ON CASEMIRO S FAREWELL It s not just a technical issue it s about our relationships We had such a good time last year and he helped us so much When you say goodbye to Casemiro it s tough and you re sad He s starting out on a new chapter today and I wish him all the best ON DANI CEBALLOS Ceballos will stay he has no doubts He hasn t played too much so far because we ve only had one game per week and I haven t rotated much After the Betis game we ve got a game every three days He ll get more game time because he deserves it ON FEDE VALVERDE S ROLE THIS SEASON He s a complete player and he s shown he can play out wide I don t know if he has the quality to play out wide but he interprets the position brilliantly He really helps us out because he brings such energy and that allows us to have more intensity in the games ON THE UPCOMING FIXTURE LIST When you play every three days there s not much you can do We have more intense work for the guys who haven t played but the rest have to rest up and try to recover We re going to use videos more often We re used to this kind of thing the less work you do the less damage you re likely to cause
