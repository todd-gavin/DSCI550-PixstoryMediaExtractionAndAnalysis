In Sunday's El Clasico at the Bernabeu, Barcelona extended their extraordinary comeback under Xavi, snapping a five-game losing run against Real Madrid with a 4-0 triumph over their fierce rivals.
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, one of the team's main architects, scored twice, once in each half, sandwiching goals from Ronald Araujo and Ferran Torres. Barcelona ran riot against a Madrid team without injured Karim Benzema and Ferland Mendy. Ousmane Dembele, another player rejuvenated since the start of the year, assisted both first-half goals as Barcelona ran riot.

The win, Barcelona's first over Madrid since 2019, lifts them back into third place in LaLiga, three points behind second-placed Sevilla with a game in hand. Despite a dreadful night in Madrid, Real Madrid maintains a comfortable nine-point lead in the standings after Sevilla drew with Real Sociedad earlier in the day.

With Carlo Ancelotti's team appearing disjointed without a recognisable striker, Barcelona were in control practically from the start and should have taken the lead before Aubameyang's 29th-minute goal.
Dembele scorched Nacho down the right flank in place of the injured Mendy, whipping in a superb cross that Aubameyang met between desperate Madrid centre-backs Eder Militao and David Alaba to flick a header inside the far post. Aubameyang now has five goals in five games versus Real Madrid, including four goals in four games with Borussia Dortmund.

Barcelona extended their lead nine minutes later, thanks to another assist from Dembele. This time his pass came from a corner, with Araujo the one to take advantage of some weak Madrid marking to head past Thibaut Courtois. Dembele has seven assists in 2022, more than any other player in Europe's top five divisions.
