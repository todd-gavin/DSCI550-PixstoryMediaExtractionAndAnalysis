The first and foremost thing we are taught about universe in school is that it is vast. Very very vast. I still remember how flabbergasted I was when I discovered that Milky Way is not the only galaxy and thousands of galaxies exist. 

Thanks to the hard work of our scientists, we have discovered so much about space but I always thought that no matter how much we explore we will never be able to unravel all the mysteries of this universe. However, it is possible that I spoke too soon. 

Scientists will be able to capture the infrared sky in unprecedented detail with the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). SciTech reported that it will enable us to observe warm planets nestled close to their star, as well as distant galaxies whose strong visible light has redshifted to weak infrared. It will alter our perception of the early cosmos and may uncover evidence of extraterrestrial life. 

However, there is one component of the JWST that is extremely restrictive. It's made to take high-resolution pictures of small patches of sky. This is true for most telescopes since creating an image that is both wide and detailed is difficult. 

The next SPHEREx mission will play a role in this. SPHEREx, which is set to debut in April 2025, will capture 99 percent of the sky every six months. This comes at a cost in terms of resolution. The SPHEREx photos will be much less detailed than the JWST images. However, because they will both be observing infrared light, they will be able to collaborate to view more of our cosmos. SPHERE will look for water and complex organic molecules hidden within the gas and dust of stellar nurseries, focusing on the deep universe's background heat.

Letâ€™s see what fruits will this project bear!
