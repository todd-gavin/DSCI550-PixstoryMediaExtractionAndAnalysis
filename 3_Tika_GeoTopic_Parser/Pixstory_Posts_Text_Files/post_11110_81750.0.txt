Menstrual education in India is, sadly but unsurprisingly, beyond abysmal. The inherent stigmatization and shame that comes from talking, and thus teaching about menstruation, lead to poor imparting of crucial information and, in turn, incomplete knowledge. According to a survey on Menstrual Hygiene in India, while 97.3% of the people surveyed considered menstruation to be a biological process, 11% had no idea about this concept until they had their first period, and almost 19% were confused about it. This translates to almost one in five girls.

 Is it alarming  ???
