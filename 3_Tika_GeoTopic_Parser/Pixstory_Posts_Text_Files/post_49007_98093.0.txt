It's kind of messed up that people think these two things are mutually exclusive. It is simple: you love someone, you protect them. At the very least you don't hurt them. If you love animals and still go ahead to kill them then well, that isn't exactly love. You just like to live a lie. I said what I said. 🤷‍♀️
