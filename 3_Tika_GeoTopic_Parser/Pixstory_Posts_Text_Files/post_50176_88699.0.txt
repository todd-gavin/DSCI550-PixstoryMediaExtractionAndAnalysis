No matter how many times Tom fails to catch Jerry, he never quits. He tries again with bigger and more unique ideas to catch him. Jerry is also an inspiration. He doesn’t  surrender and plays smartly. Never stop trying after one or two failure. Life is a never ending learning platform. Learn something every day and move forward towards your goal. Progress is what matters, not the amount of progress.
