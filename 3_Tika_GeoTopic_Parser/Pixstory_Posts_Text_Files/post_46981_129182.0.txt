Despite the rapid and ongoing expansion of T20 leagues around the world, there is an increase in the amount of bilateral international cricket scheduled in the new ICC men's Future Tours Programme (FTP) for the next four years. This includes two Border-Gavaskar series - Test cricket's headline rivalry of the last decade or so - between Australia and India that will, for the first time in over 30 years, be contested over five Tests.

The ICC released the 2023-27 FTP on Wednesday, in which the 12 Full Members play a total of 777 international matches - 173 Tests, 281 ODIs and 323 T20Is - compared to the 694 games in the current cycle.

The first five-Test Border-Gavaskar series will take place during the 2023-25 World Test Championship (WTC) cycle, when India tour Australia in the Australian summer of 2024-25. Australia then tour India during the 2025-2027 World Test Championship cycle for five Tests in January-February 2027. India also play two five-Test series against England - at home in early 2024 and away in 2025. As has been the case for the last few FTPs, there is no bilateral series between India and Pakistan.
