Today when I was about to take a photo My eyes gaze was drawn to my cousin When I saw her reading book I was reminded of the children in my homeland how their heart are filled with the desire to learn but their eyes are filled with despair I wish that my homeland would be liberated again one day and all of my homelands children would live together with beautiful smiles on their lips and hearts full of love For many years we have shared the same pain and sorrow one far from home and the other far from Freedom When I think of the word freedom I think of mother who have lost their children And the children who are far from happiness and aliveness Afghanistan smells the blood of defenseless children
