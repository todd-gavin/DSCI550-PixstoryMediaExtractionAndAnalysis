He quoted a comment from a US general in a paper on China's border infrastructure construction in his tweet. "The [Chinese] activity level is eye-opening," General Charles A Flynn, Commanding General, United States Army Pacific, remarked on Wednesday about the Line of Actual Control. The PLA's Western Theatre Command is constructing some worrisome infrastructure. One must inquire "why" and receive an answer as to what their aims are." 
During his four-day tour to India, the US general met with India's army leader, General Manoj Pande. The LAC serves as India's de facto border with China. 
Opponents, though, reacted angrily to the remarks. "We need the US General to warn us that the situation in Syria is deteriorating."
