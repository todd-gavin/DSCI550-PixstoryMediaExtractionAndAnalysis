First JWST and now this! This is definitely the new era of space exploring for us!

The American space agency is counting down the minutes until the Space Launch System, a massive new Moon rocket, takes launch. 

BBC reported that the Artemis project, which intends to return people to the lunar surface after a 50-year hiatus, will be built on SLS, the most potent spacecraft ever created by NASA. 

The launch of the rocket is scheduled on Monday at 08:33 local time (12:33 GMT; 13:33 BST). Its task will be to launch the Orion test capsule far from Earth. 

In six weeks, this spacecraft will make a large arc-shaped circle around the Moon before returning to Earth and splashing down in the Pacific. For this demonstration, Orion is uncrewed, but assuming all the hardware works as it should, astronauts will climb aboard for a future series of ever more complex missions, starting in 2024.
