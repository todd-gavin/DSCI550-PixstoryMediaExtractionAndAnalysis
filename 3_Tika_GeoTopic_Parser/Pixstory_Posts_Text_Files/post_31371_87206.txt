The pandemic has exacerbated the ever greater need for outdoor activities it has made people rediscover the pleasure of contact with nature In a region that counts the mountainous area, the Lombards have rediscovered the mountains and alpine sports by focusing on slow and respectful tourism which if enhanced by targeted policies can become a competitive factor for the area especially in the light of the crisis that the ski sector is experiencing also due to the increasingly scarce snowfall by enhancing the landscapes the cultural naturalistic gastronomic resources that make every Alpine resort inimitable a picture certainly to be taken into consideration when speaking of the state of the art of winter tourism which includes the Nevediversa dossier drawn up by Legambiente which annually aims to illustrate the conditions of decommissioned or abandoned ski facilities and analyze the huge environmental and economic costs for support the ski sector with artificial snow where the effects of climate change are tangible in the absence of snowfall In Lombardy it is the lifts that are abandoned due to the chronic absence of snow failures economic crisis end of technical life of the structures then not renewed and temporarily closed but from the future uncertain These installations often leave the ruins of the departure and arrival stations in the area abandoned reinforced concrete pylons steel cables not removed as in the case, for example, of the ski lift on Mount Poieto in the Municipality of Selvino Aviatico BG which has even been abandoned over the years Abandoned ski lifts now old and obsolete or winter sports facilities temporarily closed due to lack of snow due to economic problems or end of technical life. These are flanked by stories of reconversion and good practices of a soft and more sustainable tourism that bodes well for the double face of the mountain linked to alpine skiing and winter tourism that Legambiente Lombardia wanted to tell in a documentary journey Nevediversa through the provinces of Sondrio Bergamo and Brescia Emblematic examples of land exploitation and abandonment a condition of the provinces of Lecco Como and Varese The video available on the channel YouTube of the association
