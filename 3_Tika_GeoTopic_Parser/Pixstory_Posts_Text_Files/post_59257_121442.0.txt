It is a damning stain on our society that the majority of teenagers would rather watch a film adaptation than pick up a book. If a novel has been turned into a film you should always read the novel first because it enchants your imagination more

When you read a book, you can interpret the plot and the story to your liking. Books allow your mind to be creative. Furthermore, books are much more detailed than films. Usually a film lasts approximately two hours while in a book there can be hundreds (maybe thousands) of pages of description. Books also develop their characters much more and add multiple dimensions to them; such as detailing their emotions and thoughts. Books also improve your vocabulary. You may not notice it but while your reading a brilliant novel you are improving your spelling, punctuation and grammar. It is proven that people who read more get better jobs and therefore better pay

In conclusion, I think books are better than films. Books develop your imagination, are much more detailed than films, improve your English writing and are proven to help you get better jobs.
