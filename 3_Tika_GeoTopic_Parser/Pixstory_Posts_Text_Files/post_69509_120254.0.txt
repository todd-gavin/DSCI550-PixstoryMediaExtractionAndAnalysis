In Jammu and Kashmir's Ganderbal district, on the route to Kargil, Naranag is situated around 50 kilometres from Srinagar. It's a beautiful place, one that should be in your fantasies. It is the kind of location that photographers are constantly searching for, nestled snugly in the mountains and surrounded by thick forests. The Naranag Temple, which was built in the eighth century which is one of the city's most well-known tourist attractions despite being largely in ruins now, is a terrific place to take in the scenery. This town serves as the starting point for hikes up Mount Harmukh, Gangabal, and Satsar. The settlement is traversed by the River Wangath, a branch of the River Sindh, and a glacier is situated immediately next to it.
