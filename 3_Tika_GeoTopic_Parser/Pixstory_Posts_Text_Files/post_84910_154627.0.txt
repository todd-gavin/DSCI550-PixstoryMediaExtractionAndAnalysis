Dribbling is a skill that every player should have because it helps you beat defenders on 1v1 and create space for your teammates. If you can dribble as many defenders as possible, you're a key player for your team. During games, many players like to dribble and show off their skills.
And, like many great players with excellent dribbling skills, he can dribble in tight spaces or anywhere to relieve pressure and make room for teammates. Let's take a look at the top ten dribblers of all time in this list.
 
10 Eden Hazard
Hazard was a delight to watch at Chelsea because he made dribbling look effortless and left defenders on the floor. His small stature and quick footwork gave him an advantage over defenders, and he was compared to Lionel Messi as a result. The player would take the game to his head and try to get past as many defenders as possible.
However, since joining Real Madrid, we haven't seen the best of Hazard, who has been plagued by injuries.
 
9 Kaka
Kaka's speed allowed him to glide across the field and beat many defenders, and his great ball control combined with his speed enabled him to excel in space. He was the most dangerous player on the field when given space, as he could break defences with vision or take defenders with ease.
The Brazilian may not be one of the best dribblers, but he certainly makes it look easy. His solo goal against Argentina was testament to his dribbling skills and use of body, which makes the ball stick to his leg as he easily takes defenders.
8 Andres Iniesta
Only a few players can outrun defenders in tight spaces, and Iniesta is one of them. The player's ball control and quick feet keep him ahead of defenders, and he is also known for his breaking the defence passes. There have been occasions when the player has gotten past 2-3 defenders.
He is a flawless dribbler, and his game intelligence complements his dribbling, allowing him to read and move around the defence.
