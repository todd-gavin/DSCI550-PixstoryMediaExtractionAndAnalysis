One of my favorite things about human physiology is
the way our eyes change when we look at someone
we love. 

Our pupils dilate automatically like they do
when it's dark outside and they're trying to let more
light in. 

Except, now it's the light of your favorite
person. the edges of our eyes soften a little and they
sometimes even get watery which we also can't
control. tears of joy. we tend to raise our eyebrows as
if we're trying to make our eyes bigger. trying to get a
better vision and seeing all the details. we tend to
blink less than usual just to make the moment last a
bit longer. 

Even if it's just a second. or when you smile at someone with your entire face involved and
your eyes just crinkle and create a sparkle in them.
and it all happens so effortlessly and universally.
