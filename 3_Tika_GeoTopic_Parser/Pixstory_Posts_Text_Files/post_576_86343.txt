I just read this very interesting article in BMJ This is really worth sharing Please do read Indiscriminate prescriptions during the pandemic are accelerating the crisis of antimicrobial resistance in a country that already had the world s largest consumption of antibiotics reports Kamala Thiagarajan There s a stark difference in how high and middle to low income countries have been dealing with antibiotic use during the pandemic says Sumanth Gandra infectious disease specialist and associate professor at Washington University School of Medicine in the United States In the initial month after the pandemic began in January healthcare workers in high income countries were growing increasingly concerned about the cases of pneumonia they were seeing among patients with covid and the high risk of secondary bacterial infection Antibiotics were given to everyone who was hospitalized in the US at this time Gandra says But medical practitioners soon realised that these secondary infections weren t quite as common as previously assumed and so the practice swiftly ended There was an uptick in the first month and then a huge drop in antibiotic sales especially over the lockdown phases says Gandra In India researchers noted a similarly significant increase in antibiotic sales to adults in India s private sector which accounts for of antibiotic prescriptions in the country during the peak of its dire second wave Gandra who was involved in the study says that when India s initial strict lockdown was lifted in May there was a huge surge in sales of azithromycin which is used to treat bacterial infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia Unlike the US however this surge has not abated in India Before the pandemic studies showed that incorrect use of antibiotics for colds and coughs was common in India owing to a combination of cheap prices doctors overprescribing and easy non prescription availability over the counter with the highest number being taken by children in the age group years That trend combined with confusion over covid fuelled even more prescriptions in the outpatient setting says Kamini Walia microbiologist overseeing antimicrobial resistance at the Indian Council of Medical Research in New Delhi
