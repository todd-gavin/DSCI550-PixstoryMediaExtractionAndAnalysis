Gareth Bale is reportedly moving to Major League Soccer! The Welsh international is supposedly set to join Los Angeles FC as per Fabrizio Romano and ESPN football.

The former Real Madrid star was recently rumoured to be in the books of Spanish side Getafe CF and English first division side Cardiff City. However, reports are now suggesting that Bale has agreed on a contract with the American side Los Angeles FC. 

The five-time UEFA Champions League winner has reportedly signed a one-year deal with LAFC. Bale does have an option to extend his stay for another year if he wishes to do so after the 2021/22 season. 

Gareth Bale had a successful career with Real Madrid. The Welshman scored 107 goals in 258 appearances for the Spanish giants since joining them for a world record fee in 2013. 

As per MLSsoccer.com, the official website of MLS, Gareth Bale will join LAFC on a one-year contract using targeted allocation money. That deal would expire next June, midway through the 2023 season.

Bale's signing would boost an LAFC team who already lead the Supporters' Shield race and have also secured Giorgio Chiellini ahead of the transfer window in MLS opening next month. 

It has to be seen if Gareth Bale could rediscover his touch before the 2022 World Cup in Qatar later this year!
