The book threads known but less analysed events into a unique meaningful whole. Indeed, Ananth Krishnan and Stanley Jhonny provide a perspective on Afghanistan and China along with West and Asian geopolitics. It provides a deeper insight into how the scheme of things works in global politics.
This book requires ingenuity to create analogies with a greater understanding of things which may even work beyond the regions discussed. Further, the book provides valuable policy lessons to statesmen across the world.
