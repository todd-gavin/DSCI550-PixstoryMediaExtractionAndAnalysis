Chick-fil-A’s legacy of anti-LGBTQI+ targeted hate has received a much needed schooling from Dallas gay neighborhood’s Alexandre's Bar – a space for local live music, classic cocktails, and most recently, a scrumptious Chick-fil-gAy sandwich.“Sunday for Pride In Dallas the Alexandre's kitchen under the direction of Chef Sharina Hassell will be debuting our pickle-brined chicken sandwich. It's only available on Sunday, comes with no religious bigotry, and no hate. And don't worry, our pickles touch. Let's call this the Chick-fil-gAy. 🏳️‍🌈🍗 Bless.” Alexandre's Bar posted on Instagram.From endorsing the harmful practice of so-called ‘conversion’ therapy to misconstructing religion as a means to validate homophobia – Chick-fil-A is notorious for its impact on promoting hate.
