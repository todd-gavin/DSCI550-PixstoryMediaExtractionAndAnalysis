Football clubs selling the naming rights to companies in exchange for large sums of money is a common practise in modern football.

While fans may not always agree with the idea of renaming their favourite stadiums, with the amount of sponsorship money involved in the modern game, clubs in most cases have no choice but to hand over the naming rights of the stadium to their sponsors.

Several top clubs' stadiums, including Arsenal, Juventus, Atletico Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, and Manchester City, have recently had their names changed due to sponsorship deals.
