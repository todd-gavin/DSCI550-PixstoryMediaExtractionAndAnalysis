Barcelona has shifted away from their prior transfer model in the recent year or so. It appears that the days of paying hundreds of millions of dollars for a celebrity name are over. They're now concentrating on completing the job with the help of free agents and lower-league transfers.

This second strategy is quite intriguing. They scout young players with a lot of promise from the lower levels and sign them for a pittance. They frequently register them with their subsidiary team, Barca B, rather than having them in the squad.

Pablo Torre is an 18-year-old Spanish 3rd division player who currently plays for Racing Santander. He is from Cantabria, Spain, and is largely regarded as the best talent to emerge from Racing Santander's academy since Sergio Canales of Real Betis.

Torre has been a member of Racing's academy since 2015, and for the 2020/21 season, he was called into pre-season training with the first squad. He made a strong impression and was named to the first-team squad.

Pablo Torre scored four goals and added five assists in his rookie season. He has 7 goals and 8 assists this season, averaging a goal contribution every 115 minutes. He has played for Spain at the U17, U18, and U19 levels in recent years.

We've seen players like Pedri and Demir, who were signed for Barca B but then impressed so much in pre-season that they were promoted right away.

Pablo Torre could wind himself in the similar situation, especially if Riqui Puig is scheduled to move on loan next season. When asked about it, Sergi Barjuan, the manager of Barca B, stated that Torre was indeed a first-team signing.

It will be interesting to see what occurs. If you're good enough, you're old enough at FC Barcelona these days. Could Pablo Torre, like Pedri, have an early impact in the first team? Even if he doesn't, this appears to be a positive step forward.
