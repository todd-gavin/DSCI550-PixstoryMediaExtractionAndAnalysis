I have always known and seen my mother to be and have an exemplary strength of character and mind Her love compassion kindness humility passion and dedication in all that she does has always inspired and motivated me She has been my rock my cloak problems of the World She s fierce and strong never backing down when things get tough She keeps on working doing what has to be done giving so much energy to do things even when things seem rocky I hope and pray she stays as strong and lively forever I look upto her in hopes of being the kind of person that she is Her moral fibre and character are her best assets in this demanding and dampening world My dear mother with a smile on her face withstands and I hope will continue to withstand any trials and tribulations with grace remaining sturdy and stoic Happy Mother s Day Images Source Pinterest
