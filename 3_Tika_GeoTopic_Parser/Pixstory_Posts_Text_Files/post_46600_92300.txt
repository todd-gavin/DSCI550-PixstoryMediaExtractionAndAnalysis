Talking about writers specifically their art is not a viewpoint an expression of their talent and creativity Not all art pieces or fictional novels in this case are propaganda pieces used to express viewpoint Secondly there is no donation that needs to be done to artists or writers It s a proper job wherein writers get justly paid for their talent and hardwork Thirdly yes reading Rowling s books promote her career and her ability to writer more and she deserves every bit of it She is making money from HER TALENT Advocating that someone should not get their due for their talent or people should stop appreciating their talent just because of their opinions is peak entitlement behaviour These are the same people that advocate for free speech but as soon as someone expresses an opinion that is problematic they are cancelled I am not saying that she is transphobic or not All I am saying is that if you do not agree with her opinions debate about it create healthy discussions Don t be the judge jury and executioner of a writer Buying her books is not supporting her You pay for a fictional novel and that is exactly what you get in return It s a fair transaction Lastly comparing it to the Amazon corporation is a baseless argument in my opinion One is a multimillion dollar corporations with fundamental issues in the worker policies and framework and the other is a woman writer who has exploited no one but expressed her opinions albeit problematic JK Rowling continues to be transphobic and is getting away with it because people have the notion that she should profit despite her hate speeches No Rowling is profiting because she has spend years working hard on her and creating the cult of Harry Potter Yes separating art and artist is a personal decision and one is free to never read Harry Potter again but to even imply that a writer does not deserve or should not get credit or money for her talent and craft is simply a preposterous take
