Cooking and reheating food can improve digestibility, increase the availability of certain antioxidants and kill potentially harmful bacteria.
However, the downside is that nutrient loss is a part of every reheating method.
Methods that expose foods to liquid and/or high levels of heat for long periods tend to result in a greater loss of nutrients.
Because microwaving usually involves less liquid and shorter cooking times, meaning less exposure to heat, it is considered the best reheating method for retaining nutrients.
For example, oven cooking’s lengthy duration may result in a greater loss of nutrients than microwaving.
Microwaving still depletes some nutrients, especially certain vitamins such as B and C. In fact, around 20–30% of vitamin C from green vegetables is lost during microwaving.
However, this is much less than other cooking methods, such as boiling — which can result in up to a 95% loss of vitamin C depending on the cooking time and type of vegetable.
In addition, microwaving is the best method for retaining antioxidant activity in several different foods.
