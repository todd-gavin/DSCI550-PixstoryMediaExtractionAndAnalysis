It shouldn’t be down to society to tell you not to speak or control what you share or what you do not share . No topic should be a taboo topic and we shouldn’t feel like we cannot talk about it . 

It's you Right to Speak and nobody can stop you ! ❤️ It’s not down to everyone else to decide what is and is not shared ! 

Speak as much as You can and as much as you want ❤️
