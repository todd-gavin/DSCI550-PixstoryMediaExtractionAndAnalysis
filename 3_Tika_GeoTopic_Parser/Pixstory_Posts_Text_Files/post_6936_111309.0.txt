Assam’s unending tryst with floods could just get worse after the completion of a controversial hydel dam along the state’s border with Arunachal Pradesh despite repeated warnings from experts on the project’s design.

The project is the 2,000 MW Lower Subansiri Hydroelectric Power Project (LSHEP) at Gerukamukh on the Subansiri river, which is being constructed by the state-owned National Hydro Power Corporation (NHPC). The hydel dam is being developed as part of India’s 50,000 MW hydropower programme launched in 2003, out of which a total of 5,600 MW was planned on the Subansiri river that has been envisioned with three components.

The LSHEP will be the single largest hydroelectric plant in India when completed. It consists of a concrete gravity dam, which will be 116 metres high from the river bed level and 130 metres from the foundation. The length of the dam will be 284 metres, and the gross storage capacity of the reservoir will be 1.37km3.

The powerhouse will be equipped with eight 250 MW Francis turbines on the left bank of the river, eight horseshoe-shaped headrace tunnels (diameter 9.5m and length varying from 608m to 1,168m), eight horseshoe-shaped surge tunnels (diameter 9.5m and length ranging from 400m to 485m) and eight circular penstocks (diameter varying between 400m and 485m and length between 7m and 9.5m). A tailrace channel (35m-long and 206m-wide) will take the water discharged by the turbines back to the river.

In early 2013, the project was more than 50% complete when the construction was halted for an indefinite period owing to a fierce agitation in Assam. Several rounds of protests have been held since then, with the latest being organised only last year at several districts in eastern Assam on the north bank of the Brahmaputra river following comments by Union Minister of Power R K Singh that the dam would start generating 500 MW from next year.
