For any person who watches comic book movies or has a deep sense of love for them must have watched the Dark Knight trilogy. A great plot and storyline combined with a stellar cast and direction by Chris Nolan makes it one of the best trilogies of all time. But it is Christian Bale’s Portrayal of Batman that steals the show in each and every movie. 

Bale has to be considered as the greatest On screen batman for his incredible performance. We know Bale to be hard working dedicated and a great method actor, but when it comes to play a comic book character, especially like Batman who is a fan favourite, the pressure to deliver is unbelievable and Bale exceeded all the expectations. 

His Bruce Wayne has to be the best yet, while there can definitely be a debate over who is the best Batman, it is safe to say that Bale’s Bruce Wayne is unmatched and his storyline and the portrayal of Batman is nothing short of magical. 

Bale’s performance is something we see once in a lifetime and he has graced our eyes with that. My batman, Christian Bale.
