Anyone can feel sad or depressed at times. However, mood disorders are more intense and more challenging to manage than normal feelings of sadness. Children, teens, or adults who have a parent with a mood disorder have a greater chance of also having a mood disorder.
 However research has shown thatÂ  life events and stress can expose or worsen feelings of sadness or depression. This makes the feelings harder to manage for people.
Sometimes, life's problems can trigger certain emotions and can even lead to depression. "Being fired from a job, getting divorced, losing a loved one, death in the family, and financial trouble, to name a few, all can be difficult and coping with the pressure may be troublesome. These life events and stress can bring on feelings of sadness or depression or make a mood disorder harder to manage."
