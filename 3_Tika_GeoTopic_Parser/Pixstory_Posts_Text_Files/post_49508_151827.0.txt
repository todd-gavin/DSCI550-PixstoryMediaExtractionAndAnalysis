Marina Ovsyannikova, a Russian TV journalist who made headlines by using a public broadcast to criticize the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, has been added to Moscow's wanted list, after she allegedly escaped house arrest.
The case relates to a protest in July, where she stood on a river embankment opposite the Kremlin and held up a poster calling President Vladimir Putin a murderer and his soldiers fascists.
State-run news site Russia Today quoted Ovsyannikova's ex-husband as stating, "Last night, my ex-wife left the place that the court assigned her for house arrest and, together with my 11-year-old daughter, fled in an unknown direction.‚Äù 
Reportedly, Ovsyannikova was awaiting a trial and had been put under a two months house arrest in August. She faces up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of spreading fake news about Moscow's armed forces.
