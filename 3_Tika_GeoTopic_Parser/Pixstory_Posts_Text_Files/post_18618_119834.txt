There couldn&#39;t have been a worse return to Juventus for Pogba The injury in the tour and in the United States is worse than feared and the French player who has already returned to Europe will be forced to have an operation and in the worst case scenario to return to the pitch for the black and whites before January but above all he would risk missing the World Cup Based on the severity of the meniscus injury, an operation that has shorter recovery times or one that will keep Pogba in the pits even for months will have to be performed If it will be possible to remove the meniscus it will be possible to intervene in a less invasive way with a meniscectomy, the French midfielder will have to recover for a couple of months at most. That&#39;s a lot, but less than the second hypothesis in which the injured meniscus will have to be stitched together, guaranteeing a better seal. In the next few days, Pogba will be examined again and then a decision will be made on what to do.
