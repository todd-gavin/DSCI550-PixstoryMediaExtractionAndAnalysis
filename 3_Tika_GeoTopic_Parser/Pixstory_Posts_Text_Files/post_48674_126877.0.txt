Yeah, you're right. I should have thought that through too. The victim matters the most in this situation.

However, I did mention that I'm talking about simpler crimes. Talking about more serious crimes would take a much longer debate that would consist of points more than just morals. However, I am referring strictly to simpler crimes, like Mr Campbell, mentioned such as stealing.

Kids engaging in immoral behavior like bullying and stuff and leaving victims behind would need rehab more than punishment. Unfortunately, it's a complicated situation and we can't exactly make a this or that judgement on this.

I also think our society is so much concerned on controlling children than we often fail to instill values in them. Most of these happenings are due to the environment they're brought up in or absent parents. We need to dig deep if we really want to hold a conversation on this subject than just "right and wrong."

For crimes that are more serious. Like murders, rapes or mass shooting, I believe they should be treated more strictly it not like adults. But, what most juveniles need is help in being better people.
