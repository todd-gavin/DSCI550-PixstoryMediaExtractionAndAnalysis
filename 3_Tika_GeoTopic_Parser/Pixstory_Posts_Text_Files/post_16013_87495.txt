M Resl M Clodi Abstract Background Based on the complex pathophysiology of type diabetes and atherosclerosis we hypothesized a dynamic change in prognostic value of cardiovascular biomarkers over time Methods In this prospective study patients with type diabetes mellitus being followed up for months were analysed The primary endpoint was defined as unplanned hospitalization for cardiovascular disease or death Beside others especially the prognostic performance of the biomarkers of interest GDF NT proBNP hs TnT was evaluated in relation to quartiles of diabetes duration Results In patients having a diabetes duration below years lnGDF HR p and lnhs TnT HR p were significant predictors of the primary endpoint LnAge HR p and lnNT proBNP HR p were significant predictors in patients with a diabetes duration between and years In the third quartile diabetes duration years lnurinary albumin to creatinine ratio HR p and lnNT proBNP HR p predicted the endpoint In patients with a diabetes duration above years lnAge HR p and lnNT proBNP HR p were the only significant predictors of the endpoint Conclusion Prognostic power of cardiovascular biomarkers changes dynamically in relation to duration of type diabetes mellitus In patients with shorter duration of the disease markers of subclinical cardiovascular dysfunction and inflammation perform better than markers of systemic advanced organ dysfunction and cardiovascular disease Sources
