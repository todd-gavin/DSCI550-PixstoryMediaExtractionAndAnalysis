Everyone loves free books Who wouldn t wanna read some really well written novel without having to spend a fortune And let s be honest we read fast That many bucks and we finish a book in a day or two it becomes impossible to keep buying new books and that kind of puts us many times in a reader s block There are some websites that ll let you have free books to read Thank me later Project Gutenberg The Online Books Page Kindle Store Smashwords BookBub Robin Reads eReader News Today FreeBooksy Wattpad FreeBooksy But a reminder One thing we don t do is illegally get books for free that are not free Authors do not make a lot of money but spend a lot of energy and time into writing those fantastic stories Most of the time we re better paid than an author for a book Please don t take their earnings away from them
