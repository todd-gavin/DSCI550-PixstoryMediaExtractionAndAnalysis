The game time has reduced for the Ivory Coast international over the last three seasons In his first season the player featured in games and had G A to his name whereas in his second the player improved his numbers as he had G A in games Cometh third season he has featured only in games and has only three G A This is the worst ever season for Nicolas Pepe in his football career In his first ever season with Angers in he had four G A from starts What concerns me more is the number of starts for Nicolas Pepe in this season He has had only five starts in the Premier League and eight across all competitions For a player of stature like Pepe it would completely affect his future international prospects as well The rise of Bukayo Saka Martin Odegaard and the potential new signings will make the future more miserable for the Ivory Coast international With multiple clubs looking to sign a winger Nicolas Pepe should start to search for green pastures Stats via fbref
