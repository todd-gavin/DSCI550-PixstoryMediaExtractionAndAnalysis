Something I forgot to mention in the last post is this. This is a mistake a lot of people make. And I'm very serious when I say do not do this. I have a first hand experience of it and believe me when I say, protein overload is not a joke. It messes your hair a lot!

I used fermented rice water on my hair a few times and it got worse. My hair was rougher, brittle and would break twice more. I thought maybe the treatment is just not for me. Turns out, I was just doing it wrong. You can use rice water as a hair mask, hair conditioner and as a rinse but do not leave it in your hair for more than a few hours. For every head, the hours differ but I would suggest to not leave it on for more than a night. Also, don't overdo it. Wash your hair twice, or at most thrice, a month with rice water. Rinse it with warm water later on. Not too hot! Warm water is great for your hair.

Leaving rice water in your hair could not only lead to protein overload but also bacteria build up, bad odor and a dry scalp. Otherwise, you're good to go!
