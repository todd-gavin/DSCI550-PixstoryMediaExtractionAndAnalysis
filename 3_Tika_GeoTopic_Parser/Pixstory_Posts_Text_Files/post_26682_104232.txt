Ita Airways, the company that has risen from the ashes of Alitalia has redesigned its look by asking for help from the great Brunello Cucinelli, the king of cashmere and high-end Italian luxury clothing, has in fact created the new uniforms for the staff. The men&#39;s uniform consists of a suit of jacket and trousers on shades of dark blue with the tricolor on the breast pocket, while for women both a jacket and trousers match set and the usual combination with a skirt were chosen. The idea of this stylistic consultancy with Ita Airways certainly stems from a common vocation, that of transferring through the uniforms of the crew the style of fine Italian dress so as to represent an Italy recognized internationally as the cradle of a culture inspired by beauty, art and traditions
