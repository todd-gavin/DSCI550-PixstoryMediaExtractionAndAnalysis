Today on twitter , a person I admire wrote a quote which caught my attention-she wrote “how anticipating pain can be more painful”. 
This was after someone recently told me “more pain is remedy for pain”. 
Both these lines got me thinking. We humans are so afraid of “this pain”, we are just so afraid of getting hurt that we willingly let go something or someone that has potential of making us happy. 
Pain is an emotion no one can escape. You experienced pain once, you are likely to experience it again. No matter how much you try to keep your self in protective shields. If not “this “ emotion, some other emotion will cause pain. 
Everyone gets hurt in life but anticipating pain and continuously working towards avoiding it, saps you out your energy. The quest to protect your self, can run you down . And how much can you actually protect your self “if there is pain around u it will surely touch your skin”. It’s an emotion no one can escape.
Emotional pain is pain is generally caused by other peoples actions. It might be the result of regret, grief, or loss. Or may be your anxiety to avoid this hurt is causing you pain. I believe accepting your grief, your loss and even owning up your regrets can lessen your pain. 
Grief will cause you sadness but it’s fine to express grief, accept that you are mourning a loss. Accept that pain, that’s the only way to lessen it. 
I understand psychological pain can be intense and can significantly affect many areas in your life but sometimes in your anxiety you keep at bay something that may actually have the capacity of lessening your pain. Something that might just heal you.
Cutting off someone/something special just because you may get hurt simply means you lack courage/the spirit to fight. Maybe the person/situation is not important enough actually. 
When in pain you need to actually have fellow human being around, you need to share and express pain. You need to acknowledge it and accept it . Infact celebrate it .
