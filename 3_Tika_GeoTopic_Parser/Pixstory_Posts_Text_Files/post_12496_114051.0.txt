Most of us are familiar with the term obsessive-compulsive disorder which is generalized with the symptoms of cleanliness and perfection, but it's not just those two and these are not done on purpose but rather it's the intrusive and obsessive thoughts that makes a person do these actions. 

Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a mental condition where the person comes across repeated unwanted thoughts which are obsessions or to do something over and over again which are compulsions. Some people may habe both compulsions and obsessions. 

It is an urge to perform an action where one is powerless over their thoughts on doing such an action. 

Most of the people may have habits or thoughts where they repeat some actions but people with OCD will have actions which will: 

• Take up at least an hour a day 

• Are beyond one's control 

• Aren’t enjoyable 

• Interfere with work, your social life, or another part of life
