An exceptional performance against newly promoted Bournemouth saw us extend our perfect record over the first three games Two goals from degaard and a Saliba wonderstrike with a clean sheet completed a perfect evening for Mikel Arteta s Gooners Here s a look at my player ratings from the game GK Aaron Ramsdale He ll be happy to get clean sheets in games A solid performance LB Oleksandr Zinchenko So technically secure he s settled into the side perfectly CB Gabriel Maghalaes A solid performance at the back can t complain when you get a clean sheet CB William Saliba Commanding performance and a brilliant goal What a hit RB Ben White He plays so well for someone who isn t a right back Very good DM Thomas Partey A solid display helped dominate the midfield Left Granit Xhaka Another assist for Granit in another great performance just very solid Right Martin Odegaard Had his shooting boots on today Wanted him to be selfish and he did that today LW Gabriel Martinelli So energetic got an assist and was a threat all game ST Gabriel Jesus Unlucky to not get a goal but another excellent performance RW Bukayo Saka Another solid performance but not as good as we know he can be points for the first time in years We couldn t have started any better Let me know your thoughts on my ratings
