After the clear home success against Monza Jos Mourinho spoke about the Roma market and the lack of a defender in the squad I don&#39;t have the courage to press the director for a defender I don&#39;t take a picture with my feet on the table on Instagram to say I want the defender With all the limitations we have for Fair play which apparently exists for us and not for the others we are achieving an extraordinary result If Wijanldum hadn&#39;t broken the defender would have arrived They know we need a defender but they know they pay me for find solutions And I have to do it We are a team with that difficulty there but I don&#39;t think we will do anything Maybe we put Vina or Karsdorp in central positions and let&#39;s see The Portuguese coach consoles himself with Paulo Dybala&#39;s first yellow and red goals In his case, the talent available to the team not isolated from the rest of his team mates Even in the defensive phase he does an extraordinary job He doesn&#39;t come from an easy history in terms of injuries but Paulo is growing Maybe even Scaloni coach of Argentina ed owes us a bottle of wine to celebrate one more top player for him in view of Qatar
