With the beginning of the era of modernity and democracy, some rights, including the sovereignty of nation-states and at the same time the right of the individual to his own body, a series of rights and freedoms, became a pillar of natural human rights. From that time on, equality between men and women was and is the real criterion for the realization of these rights, and any coercion in individual freedoms was rejected.

Hijab in the position of compulsion is the result of the patriarchal society being placed in front of individual freedoms. It is the need of men who do not advocate for women's freedom and equality. Sometimes they justify their desirable ideas with fabricated and hand-picked narratives, and disguise their beliefs as sacred. In any case, the goal is not to accept a woman as a good man, who has the right and authority in all areas, including the type of clothing and the amount of clothing.

In the ruling tradition, the role given to a man in a patriarchal family is that of a superior, owner and overseer of the "good and bad" of the family. In the patriarchal family structure, men are expected to internalize beliefs such as "zeal" as a moral value. In contrast, "shame and modesty" and its examples, that is, speaking in secret, obedience, obedience and silence, are known as the norms of female behavior.
