Sloane Hargreeves exact fate following the global reset of The Umbrella Academy is still up in the air Perhaps Allison killing Sir Reginald is what went wrong Given that she and Spaceboy once had a nauseating thing Allison s arrangement with Reginald may have involved getting rid of Luther s new wife Or did Reginald send his daughter to a faraway place because he understood that she had a deep seated longing to travel Nobody can be certain until The Umbrella Academy season Or My Chemical Romance perhaps My Chemical Romance vocalist Gerard Way created the Umbrella Academy comic books and the Netflix version is filled with songs Easter eggs and references to the freshly reunited rock band Sloane is reading the travel book Jetset Life when she first appears in The Umbrella Academy season episode Sloane keeps this book with her until the end of time The phrase The Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You from My Chemical Romance s album Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge must be referenced in the title of the book Sloane s travel journal may have been merely a passing reference but it may have hinted at her demise even before the Sparrows made their debut As a result by the time The Umbrella Academy season comes to a close Sloane will have passed away Sloane s journey may not end even if she passes away when The Umbrella Academy season starts Luther will be desperate to bring his wife back from the afterlife if that s where she ended up because Ben Klaus and Luther have all come back from the dead in one manner or another Of course the Umbrella Academy crew must first deal with the annoying problem of losing their powers but Luther rushing off to find Sloane in the final seconds of Oblivion definitely suggests that her whereabouts will be a major plot point for The Umbrella Academy season
