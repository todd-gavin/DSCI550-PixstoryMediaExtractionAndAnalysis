One of the quotes that wake me up in the morning is what happens if you die and stand in front of God He shows you what you could have become and what you could have achieved and then asks you what happened I don t want that regret in life I know I can be something great in life and God has written down that for me I won t let him and myself down and work hard every day striving to become what I can be to my potential The lesson is to give your full presence and to whatever you do
