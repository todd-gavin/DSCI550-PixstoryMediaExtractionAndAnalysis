Hello people ,
So this is whiskeyyyy a Shih Tzu breed dog ❤️ our tiny family member . 
He is only 6 months old 🥹
And he has my whole hearttttt🫶

So talking about Shih Tzu they aree actually a little lion but there’s nothing fierce about this dog breed.
Shih Tzus are affectionate, happy, outgoing house dogs who love nothing more than to follow their people from room to room. Since ancient times, they’ve made themselves comfortable on the laps of people from all walks of life, even emperors!❤️❤️
Whiskeyyyy is a smallest and cutest member of out family ❤️
