#3.  Juan Sebastian Veron

Juan Sebastian Veron, a new Chelsea acquisition, has been branded the "next big thing" in world football. However, he was never able to realise his enormous potential.
Prior to joining the Blues, the Argentine was unable to secure a starting berth in Sir Alex Ferguson's squad. It was primarily due to his inability to deal with the roughness of Premier League play. Chelsea, on the other hand, chose to take a £14 million risk on Veron and signed him in the summer of 2003.

Jose Mourinho's tactics at Chelsea at the time stressed a strong and muscular presence in the middle of the pitch to dominate and dictate play. Veron failed to meet any of his demands and was hampered by a number of injuries.


#2.  Adrian Mutu

Adrian Mutu's signing in the summer of 2003 signalled the start of the Roman Abramovich era.

The Russian businessman bought Chelsea in 2003 and spent more than £110 million in his first transfer window as the club's owner. Mutu was one of a quartet of superstars brought in to rebuild Claudio Ranieri's squad, which also included Claude Makelele, Hernan Crespo, and Damien Duff.

Mutu lost out with Jose Mourinho just a year after joining Chelsea, while others went on to establish themselves in English football and help Chelsea win trophies. Mourinho only gave the former Romanian international two games before dropping him owing to fitness concerns.


#1.  Alexandre Pato

Alexandre Pato was tipped to be the next great thing in Brazilian football when he was at his best, drawing similarities to Brazilian legend Kaka.

Chelsea, on the other hand, elected to sign Pato in the twilight of his career, when he was only a shell of the player he once was. The Blues signed the Brazilian at a time when he was struggling to find a starting berth at Corinthians. Unlike the other players on our list, Pato was signed on a loan by Chelsea, but he failed to make an impact during his time there.
