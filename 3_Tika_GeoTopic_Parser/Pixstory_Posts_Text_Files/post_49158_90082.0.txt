Anarchists are harsh critics of large-scale industrial firms and the prevailing economic system. However, it is sad that they did not recognise the economic development tendency. Following the Industrial Revolution, a large industrial system arose spontaneously.

Even tiny businesses merged to form a larger industrial conglomerate. This was primarily due to financial constraints. As a result, anarchist arguments against big businesses are completely disconnected from economic necessity and reality.

From this perspective, we can argue that the anarchists were emotional and lacked foresight to some extent. The picture of future civilization and human nature by anarchists is nothing but romanticized.

Anarchism as a doctrine appeals to people of all social backgrounds. Its appeal to intellectuals, in particular, is more articulate. Educated people, intellectuals, and people who value freedom have had negative experiences with state-sanctioned tyranny. However, even if it is powerful, its attractiveness to people as a practical movement is fleeting. It is simple to destabilise the state, but it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to construct a viable alternative.

Modern challenges are more complex, and man-to-man and man-to-society connections have taken on new forms. The simple lives and personalities of primitive men cannot be compared to the complicated lives and personalities of modern men.
