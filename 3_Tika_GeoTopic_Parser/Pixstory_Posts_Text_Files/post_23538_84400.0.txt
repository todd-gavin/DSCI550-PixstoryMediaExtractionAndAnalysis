After the news about their contract expiration, the NU’EST members shared handwritten letters about their decision to each go their separate ways.

Earlier on February 28th, Pledis Entertainment announced that their contracts with NU’EST would expire on March 14. JR, Aron, and Ren will be leaving the agency, while Baekho and Minhyun have decided to renew their contracts.

NU’EST will release one last album together in March before their disbandment.
