Personally I believe walking is the most effective and the most underestimated exercise Got troubles Take a long walk Feeling under the weather Plug in your headphones and go on a long walk Want to get away from something or someone even for a moment Take a walk through your local park Scientifically it has been proven time and time again that walking benefits your mental and physical health So what are you waiting for Buckle your shoes grab your phone and airpods and go on walk
