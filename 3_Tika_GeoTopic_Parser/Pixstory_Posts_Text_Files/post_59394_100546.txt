To introduce oneself might just be the hardest thing to do but here we go I m Vidhi which means the Goddess of Destiny Talking about my most favourite thing to do no matter how day goes good or bad it is to binge watch sitcoms I ve watched almost every sitcom but my most favourite one that I ve rewatched times would be How I Met Your Mother Not to self brag but I m always the funny one at least that s what I think I like to keep people around me happy and entertained I m a people person and I love dogs and I m also scared of them I dont know if that makes sense Bit of an introvert too but post getting comfortable I can t stop talking I love clicking the sky and trying out bad food at fancy restaurants My room is my happy place and decorating it with anything and everything brings me joy A new thing that I ve recently done is going out on solo dates It s the most beautiful thing ever It s a day for you with you and by you My hobbies are baking desserts and going for long walks along with some good music I believe everything we do we do it for us There is no such thing as selflessness If you think there s a selfless act that you or someone you know has done leave a note below
