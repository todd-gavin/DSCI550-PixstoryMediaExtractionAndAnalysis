The midfielder has joined a growing list of high-profile footballers who have spoken out about their mental health issues.

Paul Pogba has admitted that he has battled depression throughout his career, claiming that it has caused him to want to isolate himself at times.

Since joining Manchester United, the midfielder has been the subject of relentless criticism, with some experts even questioning his character.

He has joined a rising number of players in speaking out about mental health difficulties, including Neymar and Marcus Rashford.

What's been said so far?

"I've had depression in my career, but we don't talk about it," Pogba told Le Figaro.

"Sometimes you don't know you are, you just want to isolate yourself, be alone, these are unmistakable signs."

Pogba was recently burgled while his children were at home, in addition to coping with constant media scrutiny.

His health has also suffered as a result of the tragedy.

"I discover my home burglarized after the intrusion of three people who stole my safe," he said. "There were jewels from my mother, my world champion medal.

"What scared me the most was that my two children were at home with the nanny during this incident. She overheard everything, called my wife and security, then locked herself in with the boys into a room. For several days, she was shocked. The main thing is that my children are well."

The broad picture: 

Pogba is well-known for his large personality and his use of social media to express himself.
Behind the scenes, though, his mental health has deteriorated, making it impossible to maintain that contagious enthusiasm.

Fortunately for the Frenchman, he appears to be looking forward to returning to international action this week.
