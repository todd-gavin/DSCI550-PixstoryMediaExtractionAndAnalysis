Veganism conserves water

We all need access to clean, drinkable water to survive as a species. When we consume fresh water at a faster rate than its supply can naturally replenish, we risk disrupting the water cycle, which could lead to long periods of drought and global water shortages. If we don’t change our water consumption habits and reduce our water footprint, the UN estimates that 700 million people could face "intense water scarcity" by 2030—less than a decade from now.

Agriculture consumes more water than any other major global industry, accounting for 70% of global water use. A study published in Water Resources Research estimates that 41% of the water used for agriculture goes toward growing livestock feed for the meat industry. It takes about 460 gallons of water to make one quarter-pound beef patty—that’s the equivalent of taking 23 showers.

We can save a significant amount of water by ditching meat products and making the switch to plant-based foods. In fact, switching to a vegan diet reduces your individual water footprint up to 55%. Going vegan could prove essential to conserving our global freshwater supply for generations to come.
