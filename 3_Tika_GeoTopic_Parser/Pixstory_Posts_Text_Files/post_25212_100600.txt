Hey everyone I m Shreya Jindal I guess name is a good place to begin with So I ll just share whatever I ve been feeling lately I ve started reading a lot more and I m really loving it but I ve started dancing a lot less ever since I moved to Delhi for graduation I m also missing swimming I m sure that s just the course of life but its very sudden I m always broke but I m still happy Crazy stuff that I ve been wrapping my head around these days Happy Buddha Purnima tho And I ll just stop blabbering otherwise I m the kind of writer who always exceeds the word limit
