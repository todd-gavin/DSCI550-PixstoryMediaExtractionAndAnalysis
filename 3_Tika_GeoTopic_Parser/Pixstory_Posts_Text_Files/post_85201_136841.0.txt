#3 West Ham €164m 
West Ham had an incredible season last year, reaching the Europa League semi-finals and having the best run in the Premier League. There may have been flaws in some areas, but the Hammers did inspect and sign a few great players this season.
Thanks to their prudent spending, West Ham had the busiest summer transfer window. PSG made Alphonse's loan move to West Ham permanent for £8 million. On the deadline day, they secured the services of Gianluca Scamacca for an initial £32 million, Theo Kehrer for £10 million, and Lucas Paqueta for £38 million.
#2 Manchester United €226.5m 
Amidst their massive spending, many fans were discontented with how their owner handled the club, and many took to the streets to protest against the Glazers. The irony is that United was the second-highest spender on transfers.
Tyrell Malacia was their first notable signing, followed by Christian Eriksen for free. Then they spent big money on Lisandro Martinez and Casemiro before closing their transfer window with the long-awaited signing of Antony for €100 million.
#1 Chelsea €227.2m 
Chelsea is the frontrunner in terms of player investment this window. Todd Boehly, the club's new owner, has made sure that his new club has no weaknesses in any department. They have primarily focused on defense following the departures of Christensen and Rudiger.
Chelsea's acquisitions of Raheem Sterling, Marc Cucurella, Wesley Fofana, and Kalidou Koulibaly have proven to be very profitable. And on the final day, the Blues added Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Denis Zakaria to their ranks.
