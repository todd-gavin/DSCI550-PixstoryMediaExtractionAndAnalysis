Real Madrid right back Dani Carvajal met the press on Tuesday ahead of his side's UEFA Champions League fixture against Ukrainian outfit Shakhtar Donetsk. 
Here is what he said:
Dani Carvajal: "We have the best footballers for the next generation, combine that with the veterans and we have the perfect squad." 
"I feel very lucky to have won 5 Champions League titles with Real Madrid."
"Ukraine's situation is a tragedy. Shakhtar can't play at home, and they've lost many important foreign players - they're doing incredible in the competition so far and I hope they'll bring happiness to their fans."
"We've been the best team in the Champions League in the last few years."
"My fitness? I'm really good, I'm playing a lot of minutes."
"Fullbacks are expected to go forward, but you have to make sure your main job which is to defend - that's a priority." 
"Benzema's penalty against Osasuna? I don't think Karim is that upset about it anymore, he is irreplaceable, there's not one like him up front."
 "We all know how football works, it's very demanding, a couple of bad games and you're crucified. Karim can turn the situation around tomorrow."
"We want to be at the top of the league table when players leave for the World Cup."
