The Roma captain Lorenzo Pellegrini in an interview with SportWeek spoke about his moment in yellow and red and the national team that risks not going to the World Cup We have to go there Unfortunately for our demerits we have taken a difficult road We talk about it among ourselves from the national team in the WhatsApp group We thought we had the situation in hand and instead Italy has not only lived for a month but for a year and a half the experiences of a new group For me the playoffs are a stimulus March can be an opportunity to recover what I have lost even if I feel part of the European champion group All the difficulties overcome during the qualification are part of the process Then it is normal that the teammates had an exceptional month and I only cheered for them Then the playmaker started talking about your Roma A we like the simplicity in which we live but for me things have changed The armband is a responsibility on and off the pitch Mine also lies in making the new players understand that this is not just any shirt and Roma is not a passing place I lived the locker room with Daniele and I had an incredible relationship with Francesco even though he quit They were great examples I identify a lot with what Mourinho says His story speaks for him He came to Rome to convey his mentality to us but now the facts count We have to work better every day However, he gets angry over a ball not given for a run-up not made Never heard of him getting angry over a technical error Mourinho sends you something that if you don&#39;t have it comes out Mancini gives you serenity so you risk a play that otherwise you wouldn&#39;t risk Mourinho asks for a lot of verticality Mancini looks for more ball possession to have the game in control Once, for example, we were doing a drill in Coverciano and he called us all into the middle of the pitch I thought Now he&#39;s scolding us Instead he told us Guys but you are very good You have to believe in yourself more Mancini communicate peace of mind Photo credits AS Roma
