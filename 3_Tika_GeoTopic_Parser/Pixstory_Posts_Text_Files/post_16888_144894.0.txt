Hrithik Roshan and the entire star cast of the film "Vikram Vedha" had come together to launch the song "Alcoholic". Radhika Apte, Yogita Bihani, Rohit Saraf, and the director duo of the film Pushkar and Gayatri were all present. In his inimitable style, Hrithik took the lead off-screen, getting everyone in the mood to shake a leg with him. Everyone just loved the energy he exuded, and his dance moves were a treat to watch. The first song, 'Alcoholic', is from the album titled Vikram Vedha, which features Hrithik in a rugged look shaking a leg with his gang members. The film is set to release on September 30th, and Hrithik and the Vikram Vedha team are going all out to promote it.
