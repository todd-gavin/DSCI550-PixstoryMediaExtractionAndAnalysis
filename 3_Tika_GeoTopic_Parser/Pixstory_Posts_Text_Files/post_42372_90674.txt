 Go Big or Go Home I think this will be the motivation for both the teams who will play today s match to seal their spot in FIFA World Cup On one hand there is mighty Portugal and on the hand there is underdog North Macedonia In the last match Portugal played against Turkey and won the match by a scoreline and get the ticket to the playoffs final on the other hand Italy suffered a heartbreaking loss against North Macedonia and didn t make it to World Cup once again So now the situation is whoever wins the match between Portugal and North Macedonia will play in the FIFA World Cup If we look at the teams Portugal is the clear winner but North Macedonia is high on spirit because they win the match against the European Champions Italy with the help of their defenders and goalkeeper The good news for Portugal is that one of the star defender Joao Cancelo returns and did training with the team but will he start the match against North Macedonia is a doubt because in the last match against Turkey Raphael Guerreiro did a decent job in the left back position On the other hand the game plan of North Macedonia is simple they sit back and play their game on the counterattack Even in the last match against Italy North Macedonia had possession and shots So it s clear that they don t work on individual brilliance So let s see who will emerge as the winner of the match Either Portugal will seal the spot in FIFA World Cup or North Macedonia will continue to break the hearts If Portugal didn t win today s match I think we will see the last match of Cristiano Ronaldo in Portugal s shirt
