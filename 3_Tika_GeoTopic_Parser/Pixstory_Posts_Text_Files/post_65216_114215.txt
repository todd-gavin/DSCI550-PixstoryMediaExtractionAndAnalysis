We are here today to discuss how we can move forward together to achieve the Agenda objective of zero hunger under immense and growing challenges I want to congratulate FAO and co authors for this flagship report that provides basis for this meeting and what we need to do to meet the SDGs There is no doubt that over the past years significant progress has been made in reducing hunger and malnutrition The proportion of undernourished people in the world had declined from percent in to percent in The rate of stunting fell from percent of children under age five in to percent in Sadly more recently we have seen global hunger on the rise reversing decades of progress The first time I attended the launch of The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report in hunger was already on the rise In that year the report introduced a second indicator for monitoring the Prevalence of Moderate or Severe Food Insecurity It found that more than billion people lacked regular access to safe nutritious and sufficient food and the pace of progress was too slow to meet global nutrition targets by Since the SOFI reports have identified the main drivers of food insecurity and malnutrition conflict climate variability and extremes and economic slowdowns and downturns These drivers are increasing in intensity and frequency often in combination and their negative impacts are exacerbated by and contributing to worsening high and persistent levels of inequality and poverty The past two years the food security and nutrition of billions of people has been further undermined by the COVID pandemic and its ripple effects are still felt across the globe The measures to contain the pandemic and the scars it has left on global food supply chains have resulted in severe worldwide economic contractions
