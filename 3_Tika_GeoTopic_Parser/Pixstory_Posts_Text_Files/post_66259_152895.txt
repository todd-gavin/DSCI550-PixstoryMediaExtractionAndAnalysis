I absolutely loved this movie By the time it came out in cinemas early I had already seen The Maze Runner and The Scorch Trials so many times before so I was able to truly experience all of the emotions I remember entering the cinema the very first day it arrived in the U K not knowing what to expect I must admit there are some moments throughout the film which viewers may find a bit uncomfortable but they honestly don t last long Just the feeling of leaving the cinema in an emotional wreck because of how well they did everything as well as certain deaths The Maze Runner Series got me into dystopian and I m glad I was introduced to the series Whether they make another film or what I m glad they left it how it was The ending reminded me of Harry Potter a tiny bit The audience watching were left reassured the characters would lead on to a better life in free of any pain It opens a lot of imagination to wondering what happened next after the film ended However the very last scene of Thomas looking off into the distance does make me think there may be another film If not they could ve finished it a little bit better by maybe having all the characters from the first film watching the sunset together as it does feel a little bit rushed It would make sense if there was another film as there are still more books than films relating to the series Either way would recommend this film any day I m glad the series is finally getting the recognition it deserves after years
