Salli Boti, like the well-known Dhansak, is a popular Parsi dish. Sali is a Gujarati word meaning “straw” or “sticks”, Boti is usually referred as Mutton or red meat like goat and sheep. Enjoyed best when fresh with salt and pepper. Mutton is a mainstay in any Parsi's diet, therefore you'll find it everywhere — whether it's a joyous or sad occasion. From a meal planning standpoint, the Salli Boti is incredibly adaptable, serving as both a side accompaniment to a Dhandar or a Berry Pulao as well as a stand-alone dish with plenty of salli (potato sticks).
While Salli Boti is pretty common for individuals who live in Mumbai and are fortunate enough to be invited to hundreds of Parsi occasions each season, it is more of a specialty for those who live elsewhere. This isn't because the dish is difficult to prepare. However, because to a significant scarcity of the ideal Salli (potato sticks). The thick potato wafers are available in most Indian stores overseas, but to truly appreciate this dish, it must be served with the excellent Salli that can only be obtained in India's kirana stores.
