We are almost halfway through pride month so let's refresh our minds with the importance of this month. Pride is a time to raise awareness about LGBTIQ problems and celebrate LGBTIQ people's lives and contributions. Because the gay and trans community is one of the world's most disenfranchised, it experiences persecution, discrimination, and violence worldwide. Your support during Pride Month is critical. The worldwide LGBTIQ movement, on the other hand, has had enormous success in recent decades, and organizations are campaigning for LGBTIQ rights in most countries.
