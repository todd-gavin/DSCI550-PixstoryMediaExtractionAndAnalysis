This is so annoying I mean come on Have some courtesy We live in a civilised manner It s especially irritating if the teacher usually grates on you for not answering properly or it s a subject you re not very good at and then finally you know the answer and you what to answer and just as you ve raised your hand someone blurts it out That s just not cool
