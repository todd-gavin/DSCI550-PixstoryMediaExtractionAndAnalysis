This little cutie is the African Masked Lovebird It banged into my balcony one gloomy morning I fed it some seeds and gave it some water It was quite loud and it loved running across my balcony I tried to pet it but it nipped my finger It turns out this baby had fallen from my upstairs neighbour s balcony and the wind knocked it into mine Luckily we found out who it belonged to and returned it home safely
