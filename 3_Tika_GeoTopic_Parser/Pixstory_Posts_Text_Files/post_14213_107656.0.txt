The story continues. Mattia De Sciglio and Juventus will remain together for another three years, until 30 June 2025.

At the Bianconeri since 2017, Mattia has renewed his contract in a season that has seen him return as a first team regular after a year on loan in France. 20 appearances in Serie A led to a total of 29 matches in all competitions, his highest ever for the Bianconeri, and a first international cap for Italy in three years.

Not only did he supply crosses that set up goals at home and abroad throughout the season, he also found the net, for the second time in his career, with the goal that capped off the spectacular comeback at the Olympic Stadium against Roma in January.

With that goal and celebration in our mindâ€™s eye, we are delighted to announce Mattia's contract renewal.
