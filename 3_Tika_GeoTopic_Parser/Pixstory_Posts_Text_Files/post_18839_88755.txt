Our goal is to win the World Cup to win the World Cup we must win these two games We want to go to the World Cup to win it Roberto Mancini&#39;s thoughts on the playoffs that Italy will play from Thursday evening to get to the World Cup in Qatar could be summarized as follows He doesn&#39;t want to hear talk about plans B the national coach is positive and thinks that his team can and should do well He wants to win the world event and to do so the Azzurri must start from the next two games, the first against North Macedonia and the second by winning the first against one between Turkey and Portugal The squad list has names I tried to bring in who could be more useful said Mancini in the conference that anticipates the match in March We have half a training session tomorrow afternoon then training on Sunday We don&#39;t have much space for being able to try new things The basis was that of the players who came to the European Championship except for Bernardeschi who for example was not very well or someone else who was left out but I could not bring any So I am already enough Thought as a positive saying We can attach ourselves to solid foundations we are positive and we think it can everything goes well It won&#39;t be two simple races but maybe we weren&#39;t even supposed to be there but it can happen that we go into a little more difficulty It&#39;s okay
