👉Wheat flour
Unlike cornstarch, wheat flour contains protein and fiber, as well as starch. This means it’s possible to swap your cornstarch for flour, but you will need more of it to get the same effect.
👉Arrowroot
Arrowroot flour is a gluten-free substitute for cornstarch. You should use twice as much arrowroot as you would cornstarch.
👉Potato starch
Potato starch is a great replacement for cornstarch because it tastes bland and is gluten-free.
👉Rice flour
Rice flour is colorless when added to a recipe, so it can be useful for thickening clear liquids. Use double the amount of rice flour to get the same result.
👉Ground flaxseeds
Combine ground flaxseeds with water and substitute the mixture for cornstarch. However, it can have a gritty texture and won’t provide the same smooth finish.
