Here are some snack ideas that are nutrient dense + have protein and fat in them to counter carbs in order to keep blood sugar stable and happy.

Cherries & beet smoothie: high in antioxidants, great for the liver (which means your hormones too!), and the addition of collagen powder + hemp seeds brings in fats and proteins to counter the carbs

Guacamole & plantain chips: avocados are a great source of magnesium and healthy fats (which our hormones love) paired with some plantain chips to make a well rounded snack! Bonus points for adding some fresh garlic, onions, cilantro, tomatoes, and spices to the guac to further bump up the nutritional value!

Dark chocolate, pumpkin seeds, berries: an antioxidant
powerhouse snack with pumpkin seeds thrown in to bring in more magnesium & zinc

Orange wedges, kiwis, and cashes: this snack is packed with vitamin c and zinc (thanks cashews!) which are nutrients supportive of progesterone

Carrots, celery, hummus: carrots contain an indigestible fiber which can help with with phase 3 of estrogen detox and chickpeas (hummus) help increase production of short chain fatty acids in the gut which is important for gut health! a healthy gut = healthy hormones!
