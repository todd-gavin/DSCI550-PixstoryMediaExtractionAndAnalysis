This is my story when I development a kiddish crush on my dietician So a few years back I had a severe stomach infection and the dietician I was assigned was very sweet both personality wise and looks wise I loved his smile and he was good at his work He also allowed me to have lots of paneer and he allowed me a samosa and noodles once too that is something I ll always remember I remember being in bed with no energy and my mumma coming to tell me we re gonna see the dietitian today and I d get up overflowing with energy just to meet him
