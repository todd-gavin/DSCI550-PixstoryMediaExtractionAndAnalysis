One of the biggest gainer was South African pacer Kagiso Rabada who fetched more than a million dollar with Punjab Kings successfully buying him for Rs 9.25 crore. As it was known, senior India players had some great bids going their way with Shikhar Dhawan getting Rs 8.25 crore from Punjab Kings.

India wicket-keeper batter Ishan Kishan became the most expensive player in the IPL 2022 auction after Mumbai Indians secured his service for Rs 15.25 crore. Earlier, it was Shreyas Iyer, who also predictably, became one of the highest-paid player among the marquee set with Kolkata Knight Riders making a whopping bid of Rs 12.25 crore after an intense price war at the auctions.
