Hamed Sabouri, aged 22 years, from Kabul has been shot dead for being queer. 
This is just one of the instances of atrocities of Taliban over the community that have come to the light. Since, their takeover Afghanistan in August 2021, they have been continuously harassing, sexually assaulting and murdering gay folks. They even used monkeypox outbreak to detain LGBTQI+ people.
Murder of Sabouri has disturbed every other queer person, and many have resorted to delete their social media profiles for safety purposes and others have crossed the border to Pakistan. 
Nemat Sadat, an Afghan activist who is fighting to have LGBTQ+ people evacuated from the country is also highlighting inadequacy of western government.
