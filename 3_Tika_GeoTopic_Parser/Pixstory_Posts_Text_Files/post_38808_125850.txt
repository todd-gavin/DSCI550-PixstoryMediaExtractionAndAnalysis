Man United s search for a forward is well known The forwards in their ranks in the form of Cristiano Ronaldo Anthony Martial Jadon Sancho Marcus Rashford and Anthony Elanga have been misfiring Barring Ronaldo everyone has been hit with a misfiring bug Since the arrival of Erik Ten Hag he was after Antony of his former club Ajax but United balked by the asking price of Ajax However it looks like Man Utd s search for a forward could be coming to a conclusion with Cody Gakpo who plays for PSV Eindhoven and is recently keen to move to Premier League to join up with Manchester United The loss to Brighton forced the upper hierarchy to jump in pursuit of forwards Ex West Ham striker Marko Arnautovic was linked but the idea was dropped after resistance from United fans Their attention turned on Cody Gakpo who is currently managed by ex United legend Rudd Van Nistelrooy Arsenal were interested in the Dutchman but nothing came of it But this time around PSV might be forced to sell him if an offer comes in the region of million Cody who primarily plays in the left wing position and is right footed might face competition from Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sanch who currently own that berth Cody s goals and assists forced teams from far to look out for the youngster Cody primarily being a left winger can also play on the left of a front three and also up front It ll be a relief for Ronaldo who can take turns with him to start for the club Seasonal review Looking at his seasonal map we can see that even though he covered the left side of the pitch it was focused mainly in the attacking third of the pitch We will see more of his actions as we uncover why United went after him
