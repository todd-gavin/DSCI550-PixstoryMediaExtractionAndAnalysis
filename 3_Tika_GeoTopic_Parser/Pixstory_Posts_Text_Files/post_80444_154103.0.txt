7 Robin Van Persie
When Cesc Fabregas left for Barcelona, Arsene Wenger handed the armband to Van Persei, one of the best strikers in Arsenal history. In his first season as captain, he scored 30 goals in 38 games in 2011-2012. However, he was the victim of another force move as a result of Arsenal's barren run in all competitions.
He moved to Arsenal's archrival Manchester United and became the most despised person in Arsenal history.
6 Thierry Henry
When Patrick Viera left Arsenal in 2004, Wenger was confident that he would hand the captaincy to Henry, and the French player broke every possible record the following season. The player accomplished various feats and inspired the club to the Champions League final in 2005.
However, due to injuries, Henry was incapable of play many games and left Arsenal for Barcelona as a protagonist.
 
 
5 Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang
After being promoted from Xhaka, Aubameyang drove the club to the FA Cup final, where he scored in both the semi-final and final. He finished the season with 29 goals and an FA Cup trophy. However, the player was barely able to replicate his performance the following season and fell in rank.
Arteta warned him that he would lose his armband if he did not improve his attitude and discipline. However, the player did not follow the rules and returned late from a trip, which proved to be the straw that broke the camels, as he was stripped of captaincy and became mundane, before leaving the club in January.
 
 
4 Per Mertesacker
When Mikel Arteta left the club, Mertesacker was the only player who was convinced with the captain's armband. The player was aware that he would miss a large number of games due to a knee injury, but he assumed responsibility and served as a cornerstone for the club as a leader. He only made one start in the FA Cup final against Chelsea, but he delivered a world-class performance that vaulted him to the top of the list.
