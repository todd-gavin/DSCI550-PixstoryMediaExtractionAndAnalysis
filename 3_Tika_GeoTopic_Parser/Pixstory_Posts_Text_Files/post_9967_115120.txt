When we lived in Afghanistan Maman my mom prepared for the Eid holiday by purchasing sweets cleaning the house and having new clothes made for us The immigrant life has made the Eid celebration less festive but Maman still makes a feast on the first day of Eid Prior to the first day of Eid Muslims give alms to less fortunate families so they too can celebrate the holiday with their families The alms consist of practical things such as money rice sugar oil dates rice etc
