However, when it comes to applying pressure on players to commit mistakes, she is not great as she only ranks 31 percentile. Katie had the most pressures which she had applied in the middle third. Katie needs to work on her other aspects of defending.

In the recently concluded match against Everton, Zelem was influential as she scored from the spot-kick and had an assist to her name, as she sent an inswinging corner kick for Russo to score a thudding header to take the score 3-1. Man Utd now face Brighton and Katie will play an influential role from the midfield and maybe notch a goal or header.

She ranks almost high for long passes, key passes, and ball creations. However, she needs to work on keeping possession as she ranks very less in carrying the ball on her feet. 


She should also focus on her defensive abilities. She should have more goals to her name as well. Zelem had her fortunes overturned when she made the move from Turin to Old Trafford. If Katie can work and overcome her weaknesses, she can turn out to be one of the most feared midfielders in the Women’s Super League.
