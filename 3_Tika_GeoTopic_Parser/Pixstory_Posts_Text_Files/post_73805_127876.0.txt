Once known for it's beautiful songs ,the Bollywood music industry has now turned into a factory that produces remakes and terrible party songs . They try to milk out money by 'remaking' and 'modernizing' an already existing song ,which was beautiful on its own .

Well in its absence Ott series have indeed given hope to music lovers. Fans loved the background scores and songs that were featured in these series. From Bandish Bandits to yeh kali kali aankhein and made in heaven , all have beautiful soundtracks that add to the narrative of the series.

Bandish Bandits was especially acclaimed by the critics for complex storyline, fusion  songs which combined hindustani classical and electronic music . Plus the song Virah which described the pain of heartbreak was very well received by the audience.
