Last night things got heated at the Le Parc des Princes, as fans booed the star attacking duo of Neymar and Messi during their matcg against Bordeaux. Mbappe was cheered for. This comes in response to PSG's loss against Real Madrid in the Round of 16 of Champions League. The fans believe that Neymar and Messi don't do enough work for the team and have let them down this season. Even when Neymar scored yesterday he was whistled against by the fans.
This comes at a time when fans around the world are wondering whether the time of Ronaldo and Messi is coming to an end. Messi fans over the world quickly came to the defence of their idol saying that PSG don't even deserve him. What the future holds for PSG's front three is really ambigious. Mbappe might be set to leave for Real Madrid. It's being rumoured that Neymar might be let go off.
