What hormones exactly and what do they do ?🤔
Well, hormones are chemical messengers that helps regulate multiple body functions like sleep, Hunger, Nourishment, digestion, growth, sexual drive, metabolism and even mental and emotional health.🫁🫀🧠🩸
This complete system is called as Endocrine system.
And thus,
Endocrine system becomes the second most important part of human body regulation after CNS (centeral nervous system)🧠
If we look at the fun part, 
Hormones are always on the go,
Your brain senses the need at some place and release hormone, it mixes with the blood stream and does it's work going at the place it's needed at.🩸🦶✋💪
Although,
This is a pretty vast topic, i guess you enjoyed the gist.
Our body is largely dependent on our endocrine system to function in a healthy optimum way, but sometimes it's happened due to multiple known or unknown reasons like - Malabsorption, over nutrition, toxic overload, poor mental health, genes, poor diet and lifestyle etc. ☹️
