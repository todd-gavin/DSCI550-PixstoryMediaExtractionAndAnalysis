Rereading is never a bad idea; visiting the chapters and characters you adored again makes you feel the story and narration.

These are some reasons why people like rereading a book several times.

It is like visiting a place or face you are acquainted with; it fills you with the feeling of comfort and a sense of familiarity that gives ease. But, more than this, rereading your favourite book will help you relax and reconnect.

Rereading could be a cure when you're lonely or homesick. People try to find the comfort of missing home in different ways, and surprisingly rereading an ordinary book can give you that comfort. When you reach your favourite part in the book, things will not feel lonely anymore.

Another reason why people reread is to have an entirely new perspective on a book that they read many years back; reading it as a grown-up would give a unique perspective on the story.
Moreover, you can also pick what you missed from the book when you read it as a teen.

It could be that the next book of the series is coming out, so to understand the new perfectly, one likes to revisit the old one.
This is a habit of true fans. 

Rereading a book can help you escape a reading slump, a period where you can't get into any new book no matter how hard you try. It could be overwhelming, but rereading comes to the rescue. You can delve into your favourite book once again to avoid the reading slump.
