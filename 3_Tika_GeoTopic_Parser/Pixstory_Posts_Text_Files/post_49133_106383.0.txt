Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said in her opening remarks Thursday night that then-President Donald Trump "did not condemn the attack," yet he did in a video that Twitter promptly deleted, as well as an Oval Office address a week later.

Also, as the House Jan. 6 Select Committee showed protesters breaching the U.S. Capitol Building on Jan. 6, 2021, Cheney used Trump's words of "love in the air," but those words were taken out of context because they were made about the Stop the Steal rally, not those breaching the Capitol during the joint session of Congress.

"'I know your pain. I know you're hurt,' Trump said to begin a 62-second video on Twitter from what appeared to be the Rose Garden at the White House. 'We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election … But you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order. We have to respect our great people in law and order. We don't want anybody hurt.'

"Trump added: 'I am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence! Remember, WE are the party of law & order – respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue. Thank you!'"

What happened was not only a disrespect to President Trump, but it was also a slap in the face of America! At worst, the 6th of January was a riot. But how many riots have BLM, ANTIFA, NAACP, and street mobs caused in courthouses, police stations, and other public places?

I actually don't understand what did President Trump ever do to all of you for you to hate him so mindlessly. It is absurd. It's all about fragility. President Trump said things that made you uncomfortable and you are used to be molly coddled by their politicians, even though these same politicians say one thing and do another.  We were safer, independent, able to feed our babies and fill our tanks & no new war.
