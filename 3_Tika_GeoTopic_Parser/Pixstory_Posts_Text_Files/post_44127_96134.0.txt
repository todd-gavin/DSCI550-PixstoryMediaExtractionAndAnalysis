Stephen Ireland

Ireland won City's Player of the Year award in 2008-09, beating out the likes of Kompany, 
Robinho, and Elano. He was that talented.

Despite the fact that he is still only 33 years old, the midfielder was released by Bolton Wanderers in December 2018 after failing to play a single minute for the club.

Michael Johnson

Johnson appeared to have the world at his feet when he broke into the scene at City, but he was released in 2012 at the age of 24 after struggling with his fitness and mental health for nearly two years following his last appearance for the club.

He founded an estate agency in 2015, one of a handful of businesses he's started since leaving 
the game.

Martin Petrov

Petrov played for Sven Goran Eriksson, Mark Hughes, and Roberto Mancini during his three 
years at City, witnessing the club's transition firsthand.

After a season with CSKA Sofia in his native Bulgaria, the winger retired in 2014, yet his career highlight occurred a year earlier, when he played in the Manchester Saturday Morning League, where our gaffer was also competing.

The gaffer, unlike Petrov, is still on the job. Longevity.

Elano

Elano, a mercurial talent who could be absolutely spectacular on any given day, retired in 2016 after returning to Santos, where he has since served as temporary manager twice.

Daniel Sturridge

The only player on this list who has won a Champions League trophy, which is odd.
