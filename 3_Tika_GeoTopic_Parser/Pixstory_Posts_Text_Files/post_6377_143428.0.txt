Dear Audience,We cordially invite you to Mike Cloud's artist talk on Works on Paper, his current exhibition, starting at 3pm on Saturday, September 17.The presentation will be followed by a reception for the artist (until 6pm).Cloud’s practice has undergone a significant material shift over the past 20 years: The set of symbols, canvas shapes, color and surface have expanded, switched positions and evolved a great deal. His work on paper has also evolved, but what connects these projects – some separated by a decade or more – is the artist’s desire to reconcile himself to the world, as it is, through his artmaking process. Cloud's collages are both cultural quilts that interweave disparate ways of depicting, and social nets that suspend artist and viewer within a shared, contested visual reality.We are looking forward to welcoming you!
