Tom Cruise rules the stage again as the trailer for Dead Reckoning is out, and Ethan Hunt is back. Director Christopher McQuarrie brings the penultimate movie in spy thriller franchise back to in July 2023.

The trailer is full of action as expected from the franchise and Tom is doing all kinds of stunts like always. The trailer had leaked over the weekend on twitter but was quickly taken down and now finally Paramount have released the trailer officially.

We're going back to ground one on this one as the antagonist from the first movie returns to face Ethan Hunt. Eugene Kittridge is back played by Henry Czerny.

Mission Impossible is definitely one of the best action movie franchises of all time and it'll definitely not disappoint us next year.
