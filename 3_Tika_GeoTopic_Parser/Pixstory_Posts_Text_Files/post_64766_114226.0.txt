Chelsea Football Club is an English professional football club based in Fulham, in the western parts of London. Founded in 1905, they play their home games at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea had a really good start to last season after winning the Champions league. They had won the UEFA Super Cup in august and had signed their old gem Romelu Lukaku from inter for a fee of 97.5 million euros. He had a good start to the season as well, scoring on his return debut against city rivals Arsenal. They were tipped to win the premier league with Thomas Tuchel over Kloop’s Liverpool and Guardiola’s City.  And for a time everyone thought they might do it after 6 years. They were top of the table from game week 7 to 14 with only one loss till December, they then proceeded to lose to their other City rivals West Ham which was one of the most entertaining matches of the season. Everything seemed to be going well till Russia invaded Ukraine.

Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, which made the EU and other parts of the world blacklist a number of Russian Oligarchs, one of them being the Ex Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich since he had close ties to the Russian president Vladimir Putin. Chelsea weren’t allowed to sell shirts, tickets and were forced to fire a lot of their staff due to their budget cuts until the club was under the new ownership. 
Roman Abramovich went as far as to drop all of the 1.4 billion euros of interest fee debt the club owed to him. He also said that he will donate all net proceeds to the victims of Russia’s war in Ukraine.
The club would’ve went to administration if it had failed to find a new owner by 31st of May.

So, how does all this affect the club’s performances?
