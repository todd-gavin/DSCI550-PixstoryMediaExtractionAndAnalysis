The Ministry of Education of the Taliban group called a published announcement about the holding of a meeting on the reopening of girls' schools as fake.
Yesterday, an announcement was published on the Twitter page attributed to the Ministry of Education of the Taliban, in which it is stated that the officials of this group will hold a press conference in Kabul regarding the reopening of girls' schools.

In this announcement attributed to the Ministry of Education, the media is invited to this meeting and it is stated that the topic of the meeting is "the opening of schools based on the order of Mullah Hebatullah Akhundzadeh", the leader of the Taliban.

After the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan, they did not allow girls above the sixth grade to go to school.

Girls' schools were supposed to reopen after months of closure on the first of this solar year; However, the Taliban's Ministry of Education announced on the same day that girls' secondary and high schools will remain closed until further notice.

This decision has resulted in widespread national and international negative reactions and condemnations, and Taliban officials are under pressure to close girls' schools.
