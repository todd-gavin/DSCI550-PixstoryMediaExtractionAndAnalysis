Thanks to the Give Water Sustain Women campaign which brought together Oxfam, the humanitarian organization dedicated to the fight against inequality through development projects and humanitarian aid, and LVRSustainable, the section of LuisaViaRoma that promotes the best sustainable brands, safe water was guaranteed for three months to at least women to drink, wash and cook In fact, for each LVRSustainable item purchased from November to January, LuisaViaRoma supported the work of Oxfam, guaranteeing enough liters of water to meet the needs of a woman and her family to drink, wash and cook for a week Safe drinking water clean Water synonymous with life for future growth Water which, through this campaign, has become a symbol of rebirth and emancipation for women around the world who every day spend precious time researching and managing water, time which they take away from education, paid work and opportunities for training A little data to think about Today, one person out of billions of people in the world lacks drinking water Approximately liters of water per person per day are needed to ensure basic needs and keep public health risks low millions of people spend minutes going and back to fetch water from a source Women and girls are responsible for collecting water in households where water is not available nearby which means that reducing the population who have limited access to water will have a major impact similarly billions of people do not have access to safe sources of drinking water
