I believe that hard work is the only way to success. And it's hard work that's made me who I am. But I would be wrong if I said that it is ONLY hard work that got me here. It's relentless hard work amplified by the support of friends, family, and my community. I'm from Silchar, a district in Assam that's not mainly known for sports or cricket. But that didn't stop my father or friends from encouraging me to pursue my dreams. I was a gully cricketer, playing cricket for fun with my friends. But it was the same friends who identified my knack for bowling. I joined a coaching academy for cricket when I was around 10, merely because of this support. Despite only being there for a year, I learned a lot about how to finesse my bowling skills. Following this, I joined my school cricket team in ninth grade. This was the stepping stone for my Ranji debut in 2007. 

For this, I will always be thankful to my father, who encouraged me to pursue cricket when he saw me being good at it. It wasn't always easy for him to be a vegetable merchant with three sons. But his support is one of the main reasons why I am where I am. I will always be indebted to my friends who helped me grow throughout this process. When I got selected for state camp, I did not own a cricket bat. My friends and community pitched in and procured me a new cricket bat.

Similarly, I owe it to all my coaches who saw my potential and encouraged me to do my best at all times. They say it takes a village to raise a child. I think the same goes for cricketers. Behind every Indian cricketer is a team of its own. From family to friends to coaches, the power of community helps people keep motivated. It is this power that helps them stay true to their cause. And I will forever be grateful to all these people for playing such a pivotal role in my journey.
