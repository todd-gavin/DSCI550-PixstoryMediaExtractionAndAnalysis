You have all seen how people welcome this to me more than a dream This is how Pogba presents himself in the press room on the day of his official return to black and white He is happy to be back at Juventus the team that launched him and believed in him when he was still young and unknown After the years in Manchester the French midfielder wants to win again just like his Juventus We need to grow compared to the last two years especially at European level We all dream of winning the Champions League I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a goal but to certainly our dream The first goal is to win the Scudetto after zero titles last year The hunger to win here is then if there is to win the cup at European level it will be a dream for everyone He arrives in Turin with the same desire to win and with one more thing compared to years ago a family I&#39;m a Pogba who wants to win I don&#39;t like losing and Juventus too like this Now I&#39;m a man and I&#39;m a dad after training we rest and play with the children But then I&#39;m always the same same same goals only now I&#39;m back with a family Then the same Pogba with the same number and the same hunger for victories One of the problems in Manchester was the continuous shifting of position which didn&#39;t help him or the team At Juventus where he will play Almost play more than three in midfield on the left or right I feel at ease there I can also play in front of the defense But I will be happy only by taking the field and starting to play Di Maria has also arrived with Pogba in black and white The Frenchman also spoke about this We all know that Angel a world class player He will help the team has experience and has won a lot Gi from the first days it can be seen that a champion we all need this He is hungry he wants to do well and wants to win we are all on the same level
