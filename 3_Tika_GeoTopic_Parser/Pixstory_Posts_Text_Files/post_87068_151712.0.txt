As you know now, my name is Harini,
My interest lies in mathematics, and later, I found myself interested in economics and accountancy as well, making this discipline the perfect choice for me.
If I had to describe myself in one word, it would be dynamic as I accept challenges with a positive spirit, and I am always eager to learn.
My strength is my willingness to take on new challenges and strive for perfection. This is because I believe that learning from our successes and failures is the most effective way to shape ourselves in order to achieve our objectives.
â€œI am ambitious and driven." I thrive on challenge and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive towards. I am not comfortable with settling, and I am always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness.
I am a people person. I love meeting new people and learning about their lives and their backgrounds. I can almost always find common ground with strangers, and I like making people feel comfortable in my presence.
Iâ€™m excited to learn more about this opportunity and would be happy to answer any additional questions.
 thank you!ðŸ¦‹
