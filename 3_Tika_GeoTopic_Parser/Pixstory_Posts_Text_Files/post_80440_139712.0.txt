The Gunners do, however, have a team with depth, which will help them on long road trips, but do they have quality? The Europa League is something that Arsenal has a deep relationship with because it requires poise and mental toughness. They are unquestionably a strong favorite early on, and I think this is their best chance to win some silverware.
2 Basically, they exceed the majority of their competitors.
 
Because of the increasing difficulties of qualifying for the Champions League via domestic leagues, as well as the incentive of automatic entry by winning the Europa League, the era of Shakhtar Donetsk and Zenit St. Petersburg's victories in the Europa League is almost over.

The Europa League is considered to be the second-tier club tournament in Europe for a reason, and a quick glance at the 64 teams on display would show that the majority of them are rather minor players on the continent.

Despite their recent troubles, in preseason, Arsenal still has a team full of players of the highest caliber, and the team would easily qualify for the Champions League from the European club tournaments. Only a few of the current Europa League contenders, including Real Betis, Manchester United, and Roma, are legitimate opponents for Arsenal. The others are substantially lower in the football pecking order than Mikel Arteta's squad.

In 2018, Atletico Madrid were unlucky to be relegated from the Champions League, but they nearly practically cruised their way to the championship, with the only little snag occurring when they met the Gunners in the semifinals. There aren't many clubs that can stop Arsenal if they put their minds to lifting the Europa League this year.
