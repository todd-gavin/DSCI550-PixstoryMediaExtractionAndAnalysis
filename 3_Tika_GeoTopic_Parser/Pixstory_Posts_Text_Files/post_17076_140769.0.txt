Brahmastra is one of the most awaited films of the year. The movie took the box office by storm and got a bumper opening. Reportedly, on its day one, the film has collected Rs. 35-36 crore at the box office, and this is surely an excellent start. Brahmastra starring Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Amitabh Bachchan, Nagarjuna, and Mouni Roy is a Hindi film, but it was dubbed and released in various languages like Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam. This year, many Hindi films have been released in regional languages, but none of them did well at the box office. 

However, Brahmastra has done well in the South. According to Sacnilk Entertainment, Brahmastra has collected Rs. 11.10 crore gross down South. On day one, in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana it grossed Rs. 6.70 crore gross, in Karnataka, it collected Rs. 2.30 crore, in Tamil Nadu the collection was Rs 1.55 crore, and in Kerala it collected Rs. 55 lakh.
