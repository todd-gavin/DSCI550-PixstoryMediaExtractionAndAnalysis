Adding to the list of Binge Watch Patriotic series, there is an another one which is an absolute must watch in Amazon Prime. 

The series is a true epic war series about the Forgotten Army, the Azad Hind Fauj of Netaji Shubhas Chandra Bose. Who was a great leader, and the Chief of the Azad Hindu Fauj ( INA). 

With the slogan of “Dilli Chalo”, which was a way cry of the army, following this spirit, thousands of soldiers of his 60,000-strong army sacrificed their lives, and marched 3,884 kms from Singapore to Delhi to free their country. 

This series sheds light on the overlooked chapter of the history, which recently is much talked about. Keeping the politics aside, Kabir Khan's The Forgotten Army - Azaadi ke liye promises a grand look at the INA, from their valiant efforts to the horrors they faced. 

The series is set in two different timelines one during 1942-45 when INA was formed, another in 1996. 

The series is constantly teleporting to flashbacks and different time sequences. It is a 5 episode, with extensive war sequences and showcasing many events from history that are true to the book. 

With Sunny Kaushal and Sharvari in lead showcasing excellent performance. 

The series is completely sprinkled with nationalism and giving you an amazing anthem

A perfect patriotic background score, giving you goosebumps and igniting the sense of patriotism in you. 

And the narration of Shah Rukh Khan at beginning of every episode is cherry on the top.
