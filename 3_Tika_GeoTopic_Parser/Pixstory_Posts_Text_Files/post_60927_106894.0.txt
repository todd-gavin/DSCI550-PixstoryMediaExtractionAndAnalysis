This is situated in the Road right opposite to Red Fort, some of the hotels are more than 100 years old and the sixth generation is managing them. What is unique is the the Paratha here is not made on the Tawa but they are fried in ghee. But as the size is small they are not very heavy. It is definitely worth visit!
