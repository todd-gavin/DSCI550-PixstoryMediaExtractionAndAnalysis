Flowers on a Fountain with a Peacock by Jan Weenix (1642-1719)

A periwinkle rose attempts to hydrate dried angel ghouls; a peacock claws apart seeds to set pomegranates to rot; a snail slugs away from artificial grapes. 

Only clouds tell the truth: This is hell. 

Dedicated to Louis XV and longtime lover Madame de Pompadour, the Back State Room holds art in Rococo style — “from the French word ‘rocaille’, which means loose stones or rocky ground. This exuberant, animated style explores asymmetrical natural shapes with fountain imagery, foliage and flowers, swirling scrolls and sea animals.”

[One of my favorite creative writing courses taught me how to use writing as living – to document the experience of a moment rather than attempting to interpret it. I am always faltering to follow this way of living in the ways I hope, but thought I’ll try an altered format with thoughts and details I gathered at the Wallace Collection.]
