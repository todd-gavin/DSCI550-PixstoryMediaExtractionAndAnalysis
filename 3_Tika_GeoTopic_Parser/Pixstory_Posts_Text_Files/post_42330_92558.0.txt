If you are feeling bored today and finding ways to kill your time are then here I am with the list of movies and web series you can watch on cinema hall and your OTT platforms.

This Friday, there are 3 movies and one web series which I will be recommending to you which are as follows:- 

1. Fantastic beasts- The Secrets of Dumbledore 

Fantastic beasts - The secrets of dumbledore is the third part of this franchise. In this movie, the director explores the part where Professor Albus Dumbledore knows the powerful, dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald is moving to seize control of the wizarding world. Unable to stop him alone, he entrusts magizoologist Newt Scamander to lead an intrepid team of wizards and witches. They soon encounter an array of old and new beasts as they clash with Grindelwald's growing legion of followers.

2. Elite Season-05

‘Elite’ is one of the most successful Spanish web series available on Netflix. This series is about teenagers who are struggling with their problems. But rich kids have rich problems, so, you might not relate to their problems sometimes but otherwise ‘Elite’ is a good show overall. You can binge this series on Netflix.

3. The King’s Man 

The king’s Man was released in theatres back on 14th January and because of the COVID (omicron) variant spread, Indians didn’t enjoy the movie in theatres but now the movie is available on Disney+ Hotstar and this story is about the One man must race against time to stop history's worst tyrants and criminal masterminds as they get together to plot a war that could wipe out millions of people and destroy humanity.

4. Dasvi 

I already reviewed this movie yesterday but if you are still thinking to ignore this movie, so I must tell you that Dasvi is a family entertainer and if you want to spend quality time with parents while watching then Dasvi should be the first movie on your watchlist.
