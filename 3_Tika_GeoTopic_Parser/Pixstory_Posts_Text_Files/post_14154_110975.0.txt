Nottingham Forest’s rebuilding for the Premier League will see the newly promoted club bid for Harry Toffolo of Huddersfield Town and make a second move for Liverpool’s Neco Williams as part of their strategy to create a new-look defence for their return to the top division.

Liverpool have turned down Forest’s opening offer for Williams — understood to be £11 million with £4 million in potential add-ons — even though it has become clear that Fulham’s manager, Marco Silva, seems happy to keep out of it. Williams spent last season on loan at Fulham but, despite having admirers at Craven Cottage, Forest are the only serious bidders so far. As it stands, Silva has other targets in mind to play at right-back rather than competing for the 21-year-old Wales international.
