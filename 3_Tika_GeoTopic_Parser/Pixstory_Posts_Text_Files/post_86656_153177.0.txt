I say that formal education will always be relevant.???
Regarding formal courses:
1) There will always be certain subjects that LOADS UPON LOADS of people want to learn about. This creates a demand for formal courses that would make learning this material far easier than forcing all of these people to endlessly research in mazes about these topics on their own.
Regarding formal schools and universities:
2) Barring the invention of instant teleportation, people will always value access to a centralized hub where they can access masters in a wide variety of disciplines. You can’t make AN IDEAL selection of what you’d like to do in life without access to such a hub where you’re exposed to a wide variety of ideas and experiences.
How formal education is delivered will change, but it will remain indefinitely.
