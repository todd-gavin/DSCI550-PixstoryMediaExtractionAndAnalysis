The decisive mistake in the penalty lottery that awarded Eintracht Frankfurt the Europa League was Aaron Ramsey The Welsh midfielder entered the end of extra time with a view to penalties for a long time despairing after the mistake that buried Glasgow Rangers&#39; hopes His coach Giovanni van Bronckhorst tried to cheer him up Some players weren&#39;t in a good moment to take a penalty Ramsey was available to take it And really already everyone is sick they are disappointed we saw him in the dressing room He took the responsibility of kicking you can score or miss Unfortunately for us did not score Ramsey&#39;s mistake last night could have consequences for Juventus too The months of loan to the Scots started with two goals in the first few games but they soon turned out to be two acute ones amid disappointing performances seasoned with some physical ailments after yesterday it seems rather unlikely that Rangers will want to exercise the right of redemption Ramsey would thus return to Juventus next season and with him also his heavy contract worth over million euros per season The agreement expires in and in Turin they will do everything to anticipate the exit of the Welsh by resorting to a sale at a discounted price or even early termination of the contract
