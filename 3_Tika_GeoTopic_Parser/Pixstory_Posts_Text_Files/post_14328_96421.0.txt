Juventus Women are back in action tomorrow. The Bianconere take on Lazio away, with kick off scheduled for 12h30 CEST, Sunday 24 April.

Barbara Bonansea, Cristiana Girelli, Pauline Peyraud-Magnin and Annahita Zamanian have tested positive for Covid-19, and are therefore not available for tomorrow's match against Lazio. The players are self-isolating and are complying with all the procedures of the protocol currently in force, in agreement with the competent authorities.

Tuija Hyyrynen will also be absent due to lower back pain, for which she has already started specific therapy.

Here is the squad named by Joe Montemurro for the trip to Rome. Catch the game live on Juventus TV!
