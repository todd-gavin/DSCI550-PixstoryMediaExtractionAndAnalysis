Arsenal have had an impressive start to their Premier League campaign this season. The Gunners are currently on the top of the pile, 1 point ahead of second-placed Manchester City. However, Premier League legend Alan Shearer is still not convinced that the North London side can win the title this season. 
Alan Shearer wrote about Arsenal in his blog with BBC news after the Gunners' 3-0 away win against Brentford on Sunday. Having lost 2-0 to the Bees in 2021, the Gunners were impressive this time around as goals from Saliba, Jesus, and Vieira were enough to give Mikel Arteta's side a crucial 3 points. 
However, Alan Shearer is yet to be convinced by the North London side. The Englishman wrote, "It's not time to talk about them as title contenders yet, but people now know that this is a different Arsenal to the team we saw just 13 months ago."
The Gunners have won 6 of their 7 games in this season's Premier League campaign. Their only loss came against Manchester United at Old Trafford. Arsenal's next four Premier League games are against the Spurs, Liverpool, Leeds, and Manchester City. This should help give a realistic picture of the Gunners' overall improvement as the club did not perform very well against their top six rivals. It has to be seen if Arsenal can prove Shearer wrong by winning the Premier League title back after nearly two decades.
