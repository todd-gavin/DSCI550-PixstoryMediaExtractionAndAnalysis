The first Test between India and Sri Lanka scheduled to be played in Mohali from March 4 will not be held behind closed doors as initially planned, BCCI secretary Jay Shah confirmed. The match will be former India captain Virat Kohli's 100th Test for India.

"The first Test between India and Sri Lanka to be played at the Punjab Cricket Stadium in Mohali will not be held behind closed doors. The decision to allow spectators into the ground is one taken by the State Cricketing Associations and in the present circumstances, is based on various factors. 

"While we started off the West Indies Tour of India behind closed doors, the encouraging dip in COVID-19 cases allowed the hosting associations to permit crowds. Based on the advisories by the State Health Authorities fans were able to witness the games in Kolkata and Dharamsala while UPCA had Lucknow T20I without crowds owing to polling a day before the match.

Earlier in the day, Jasprit Bumrah had his say on the matter before the statement from Shah: "See, right now, we're in the frame of mind where we are focusing on what we can control. See if the crowds come, it's good for the energy but that is something that we cannot control. We don't have any power regarding that, we don't decide the rules. So, for us what we can control is our energy and we are trying to focus on that. The basic thing in everybody's mind right now is how do we prepare and how we are in the best frame of mind, even if crowds are not there? How do we keep that energy up? And with that, obviously, as I said, it's a big big day, big match for Virat Kohli. He's obviously contributed towards our team a lot. Right now our focus is to win the test match. And then once we win, all the proceedings will happen and whatever is to be done will be done."
