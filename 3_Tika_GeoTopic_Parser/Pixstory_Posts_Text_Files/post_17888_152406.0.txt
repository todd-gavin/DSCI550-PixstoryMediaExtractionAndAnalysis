Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly have no shortage of fun together. On Tuesday, the 32-year-old rapper enlisted the help of his fianc√©e to give him a futuristic makeover and she did not disappoint.
MGK went live on Instagram from his hotel room in London, where he's currently on his Mainstream Sellout tour to document the 36-year-old actress and his assistant Olivia Stone while they transformed him into an Avatar with a Doja Cat inspired look from the year 3050, per his request.
While Fox and Stone concentrated on their makeup duties, MGK sat shirtless as he sipped a glass of red wine and rapped songs that played in the background. In videos captured by fans, Stone and the singer both sport pink hair, while Fox wore a fuzzy blush-colored bucket hat over her dark locks.
Fox and MGK -- who got engaged in January -- put rumors of relationship trouble to rest with their actions during the IG live. Multiple times, the two locked eyes and looked adoringly at each other. However, one thing he wasn't going to let Fox do was add fake eyelashes to his look.
"I said make me look like 3050!" he replied when the women insisted he needed the lashes. "Give me blood coming out of my nose. I don't want lashes. No, you're not putting these on me!"
"Nope and I'm done. And we're done," he continued, noting the makeup tutorial was over at that point. "Thank you guys for joining us live I don't know what the f--- just happened and peace!" 
The couple sparked split speculation over the summer. A source told ET in September that they are still going strong. Their wedding plans are still on, but they are taking things "one day at a time".
