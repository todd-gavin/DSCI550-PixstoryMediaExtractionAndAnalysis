Can we eat Carbohydrates daily? 

My Answer
Carbohydrates are important- you have to plan what/when/how much. 
Since I have already talked about three Ps already. 
This can be the forth P- planning the cereals. 
Important thing to know is 
What you should take or should not take. 
When you should take and
How much should u take. 
If you are gluten intolerant you can take rice, brown rice, unpolished rice or alternative grains . 
In the right measure for you- depends on your body . May be once a day or twice a day but not three times ..
When is also important .
Ideally  the grains should be finished by seven in the evening.
