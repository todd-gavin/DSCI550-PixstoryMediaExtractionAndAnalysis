Article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) states: "All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law".

But is it followed? Ever?

If you are white in America, you will be arrested alive and taken into custody safely after firing in open crowd, murdering the masses. If you are black, you will have sixty bullets inside you for a traffic stop. That's the reality of America. Everyone is NOT equal before the law.

The systemic racism is so deep rooted that white people do not even think twice before committing racial hate crimes because they know their privilege and they know they'll be taken in safely, and more often than not either granted a bail or released after a few years of prison. White people of color, especially black men cannot even go to the supermarket without the fear of being shot by the police or by that said white young guy who misuses his privilege.

Do not ever tell me America is a safe place for all. It is not and it won't be until everyone opens their eyes to this obvious war waged against black people.
