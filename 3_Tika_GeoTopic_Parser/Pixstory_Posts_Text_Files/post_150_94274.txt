I decorated eggs for the first time two years ago when my roommate came knocking to my door and dragged me out of bed I d never painted on eggs before and the whole process felt so delicate the dipping the drying the scratching with white wax crayons to make a design without breaking through the shell It taught me that boiled eggs are a great canvas to embrace flaws that you can t really mess up an Easter egg once you commit to it
