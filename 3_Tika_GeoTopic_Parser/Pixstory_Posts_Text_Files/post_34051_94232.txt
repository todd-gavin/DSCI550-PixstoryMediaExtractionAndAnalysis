A good Turin equalized at the Olimpico against Lazio stubborn in finding the net in injury time This was Matteo Paro&#39;s comment Juric Pellegri&#39;s assistant granata coach was very sorry for having lost the ball from which the young goal was born and must grow on certain things but I&#39;m glad he scored These are things on the pitch that happen we compared each other because we were all sorry for having equalized at the last minute We are a bit unlucky because we lost so many points in added time a mix of things some episodes and a bit our fault Belotti He felt pain in the flexor We will evaluate it in the next few hours
