In this anomalous year for tennis given the lack of presence of several big names in important tournaments Djokovic due to the lack of vaccine or Medvedev due to the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian tennis players, the throne of number one ATP has changed its king several times The Serbian tennis player who most of all he was on the top step of the podium currently slipped to sixth position despite the Wimbledon won which anomalously did not give ATP points the one that Zverev could have conquered if he had not recovered from a bad injury at Roland Garros In first place at the moment c Daniil Medvedev who enjoys the summit knowing that it could be complicated to keep it for a long time There is another tennis player who according to the Russian will take the throne soon A tennis player who many had considered finished but who did incredible things this year I certainly pay attention to the race for number one at the end of the season one thing that involves me It also depends on the moment because I know that at the end of the year unless I try to win all the remaining tournaments it will probably be Rafa who will end the season on top Nadal the one who is given the final of his career he has won the Grand Slam in recent months, bringing his career level to no one like him And still in time to do the Grand Slam at the US Open where Djokovic may not be able to participate if exceptions are not made given that he is not vaccinated and in America he is not more enter Medvedev back on the court after missing Wimbledon in Los Cabos in Mexico on hard courts Returning to a tournament after a few weeks out is always complicated there are many guys out there who play well and try to beat you
