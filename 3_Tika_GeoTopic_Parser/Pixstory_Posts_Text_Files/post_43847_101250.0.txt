With almost 100 Premier League goals scored this season and the fourth title in five
years still within grasp, Manchester City’s reputation as one of the most entertaining
teams in modern-day football is not in question.

However, the club has gone back to the 1960s searching for inspiration for their new
home kit and modelled by Jack Grealish, Phil Foden, Vicky Losada and Laura Coombs,
the shirt as a homage to the free-flowing City sides of the era.

City won the second division league title in 1965-66, the first division title in 1967-68,
The FA Cup the following year and then topped off their impressive run by winning the
European Cup Winners’ Cup in 1969-70 with the likes of Collin Bell playing an
instrumental role in all the success.

Bell came to personify the swagger and flair with which those classic all-out-attack City teams came to be associated and is rightly held up as one of the finest players to ever
don a sky blue shirt. One of the stands in Etihad is already named under his honours.

And it is the legacy of Bell and his teammates that City have chosen to revisit with their
home jersey which is directly influenced by the kits worn during that period.

While the shirts and shorts were familiar combinations of light blue and white, the socks
worn and tracksuit tops worn by City players at the same time also carried flashes or
maroon trim in the form of bands, cuffs and stripes.

A further tribute to Bell can be found tucked inside the neckline where a golden crown
logo is stamped along with a sample motto, “The King.”
