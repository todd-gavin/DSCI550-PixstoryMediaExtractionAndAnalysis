Finding a good shirt with a design you like requires going on a good hunt. When you do find one you like and in your size, you immediately go for it. The excitement and happiness pours out, the love for the design, just everything feels good. And thennnn, the design starts cracking and fading😑
I mean come on, seriously!? Why such craftsmanship? Let me enjoy the design, if I wanted a plain t-shirt I would've bought one, I don't want a weird coloured and cracked design one at the very least.🤦‍♀️
