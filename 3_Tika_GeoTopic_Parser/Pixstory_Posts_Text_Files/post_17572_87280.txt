While the Los Angeles Lakers were blown out by the Phoenix Suns on Sunday night that didn t stop LeBron James from setting yet another NBA record In perhaps his most impressive feat yet James became the first player in NBA history to record career points rebounds and assists He did so by securing his th assist on Sunday night to go along with rebounds and total points This type of career production is unprecedented as it is but it s even more impressive that these records are being set by someone in their th season at age by a player who is still arguably in the top in the league Following the loss to the Suns James spoke My teammates congratulated me after the game my mom texted me I believe she hit me at halftime I saw it after the game I get a loss for words anytime things like this happen to me just knowing where I come from James said I automatically just start thinking about my hometown of Akron and my upbringing and where I come from The dreams that I had of being in this league and playing at the highest level and to now stand out in a statistical category in this league that I ve really modeled my game after being able to score rebound and assist So to sit alone on that stat is pretty I want to say cool but then it doesn t quite make sense to me said James But it s an honor to be a part of this league and no matter what is going on in the season you try to take the victories that happen throughout the course of a long marathon and tonight is one of them for not only myself but for my hometown and for my family and friends The Lakers are having a difficult season perhaps one of their most frustrating However what James is doing cannot be ignored and it s giving fans something to be excited about each night that the Lakers play Story credit lakersnation
