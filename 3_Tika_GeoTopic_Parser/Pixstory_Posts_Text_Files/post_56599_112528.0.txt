A state funeral will be held for former Victorian government minister Jane Garrett who has died aged 49.

She was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016 and went into remission, but the cancer returned this year.

Ms Garrett was due to leave parliament at this November's state election.

Tributes for the MP have flowed since news of her death with both her family and her colleagues in politics describing her dedication during her career.

Ms Garrett was elected to the parliament in 2010 when she won the seat of Brunswick and was the minister for emergency services, consumer affairs, gaming and liquor regulation.

She resigned from the cabinet in 2016 when the Andrews government tried to push through a bitterly disputed enterprise bargaining agreement for firefighters, which she said she could not support.

The mother of three moved to the Upper House in the 2018 election.

Prior to becoming an MP, Ms Garrett worked as a lawyer and served as a councillor for the City of Yarra.

Family pays tribute to 'contagious love of life'

Ms Garrett's family said she had been admitted to hospital earlier this week after a period of remission, due to the return of her cancer.

The MP was a mother to three children — 19-year-old Molly, 15-year-old Sasha and 10-year-old Max — and the family said their welfare was the priority during the "impossibly difficult time".

"We will always remember Jane for her contagious love of life and people; her intense compassion and the drive which made her a very fierce advocate for women and those most disadvantaged," they said
