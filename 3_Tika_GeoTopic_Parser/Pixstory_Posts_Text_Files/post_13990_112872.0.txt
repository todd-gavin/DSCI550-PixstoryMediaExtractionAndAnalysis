Everyone's emotions are stirred by poetry. Personally, I'm comfortable there. It aids in my realisation that I'm not the only one who has intense feelings and emotions regarding the world. like maybe I'm not the only one after all. I'm not the only person who thinks so profoundly about things, but I am not the only one who believes in paradise. It's not just you who finds it challenging to find peace and solace in the ebbing waves of love and tranquilly.

Poetry enfolds me in a warm hug and calms my deluge of uncertainties. And it dives right in beside me as I cause havoc when I find myself engulfed in a cyclone while swirling around a mass of chaotic emotions.
