While sneaking into the chaotic world we all get caught up in the web of fears That marks the inflexion point of a journey from rejoicing smiles to painful tears When the brain starts reigning over the heart and soul The realisation shall step in to stop that hellion from taking a toll Life sustains in a full circle only to get away with these fearful hitches We ought to have this thing settled before embarking on a journey from rags to riches Only the perceptions will reflect the realities until we liberate ourselves from the world It s the trail that we follow that can turn us from a caged lion to a flying bird Prakhar PS See what needs to be seen and hear what needs to be heard for only you stand responsible for the light of your little world
