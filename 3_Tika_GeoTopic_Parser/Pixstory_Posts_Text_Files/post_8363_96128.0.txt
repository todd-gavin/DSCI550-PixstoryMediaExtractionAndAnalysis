Although intertwined in the laws of nature they follow two different paths,
it's our environment and the mankind that are struggling to stop the godly wraths;

Lost in the fascination of the future, we are clueless about finding our way back home, now it's time we recognise the five elements if we want to breathe and freely roam;

The world now wants those states who stand up to their promises, 
it would need two to build and restore the ecosystem that got destroyed and put into trashes;

We all vie to secure the environment in its pristine state and space, 
but it's only the will of humans that can fend off this disastrous nemesis of the abyss... 

On this earth day, let's all pledge to protect our planet for it's the only one we've got.

Today and every day let's try to put more effort into saving the Earth, fighting climate change and making every day better.

It's now or never, it's the time TO ACT.

So, Let's:

"INVEST IN OUR PLANET" 🌏🏞🌱🌳
