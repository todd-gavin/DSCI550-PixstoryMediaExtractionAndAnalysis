A little boy and his mother were crossing a bridge The mother appeared anxious so she asked her little one Sweetheart please hold my hand so that you don t fall into the river The little Boy said No Mom You hold my hand What s the difference Asked the puzzled Mother There s a big difference replied the little Boy If I hold your hand and something happens to me chances are that I may let your hand go But if you hold my hand I know for sure that no matter what happens you will never let me go In any relationship the essence of trust is not in its bind but in its bond So hold the hand of the person who loves you rather than expecting them to hold yours This one is specially dedicated to the resilience of Afghan women more specifically Afghan mothers Their dedication and services to the nation of course deserves more appreciation than a mere post
