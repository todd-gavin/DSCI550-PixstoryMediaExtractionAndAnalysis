Hosts England won 1-0 against Austria on Wednesday at the Theatre of Dreams; the game was attended by a crowd of 68,871 - a new record for the Women’s Euros. 

But Sarina Weigman' side didn’t perform up to the mark; failure to convert key chances and often getting caught in awkward positions whenever the opposition initiated counter-attacks, only to be saved by England’s Numero Uno - Mary Earps. It was evident that the nerves were high in the opening game but Beth Mead ensured a win for the Lionesses.

There is a certain amount of pressure on England and Sarina Wiegman. The Lionesses head coach won the 2017 edition of the European Championship with the Netherlands and fans expect her to guide this England side to its first-ever major trophy. England, being the hosts, are considered one of the favourites to win this tournament but the game against Austria wasn’t how the favourites should perform. England needed to improve.

Last night, Sarina trusted her side and fielded an unchanged XI against Norway. There were several concerns over the inclusion of Ellen White in the Starting XI but she put all those doubts to bed after securing a first-half brace. The Leah Williamson-led side didn’t let Norway breathe as they scored 6 goals in the first half. England were awarded a penalty in the 11th minute and Stanway scored from the spot. Lauren Hemp made it 2-0 after 3 minutes. Alessia Russo also scored one in the 66th minute after getting subbed on in the 57th minute. 

Beth Mead was the standout performer of the game as she scored her first hat-trick for England at a major tournament. The Arsenal winger is the top scorer right now with 4 goals in 2 games. 

The 28,847 fans inside Brighton’s AMEX Stadium got to witness a historic performance from Sarina Wiegman’s England. Most of them would have sung 𝐈𝐓’𝐒 𝐂𝐎𝐌𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐇𝐎𝐌𝐄 during and after the game but only time will tell if football’s finally coming home for the first time since 1966.
