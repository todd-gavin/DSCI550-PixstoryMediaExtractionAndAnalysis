From the cooking water for pasta and rice to the insulating straw come the secrets for saving vegetable gardens from the effects of drought and helping the Italians who dedicate part of their free time to taking care of vegetables and plants and flowers in pots or on the ground. says Coldiretti who, with the green tutors of Campagna Amica, has developed a handbook to deal with the restriction measures on the use of drinking water starting from the ban on watering launched by many Municipalities while in Lombardy a state of emergency has been declared and the area thirst red now risks spreading to almost the whole country In a time of very serious emergency, it is necessary for water resources to be concentrated on human and agricultural use, underlines Coldiretti but with some small updates it is also possible to help plants on vegetable gardens and terraces to resist waiting for the longed-for rain Faced with the ban on watering, a good solution could be the reuse of the cooking water for pasta, rice or vegetables, explains Coldiretti that once it has cooled down, it will give relief to the plants but will also fertilize the soil with the substances released by the cooked foods. obviously the one used to wash the salad is also fine for this purpose But you can even think of recovering the water from the shower with basins at least that without soap To allow the earth in the vases to remain moist it is important to mulch it continues Coldiretti or cover it with straw which will release also beneficial substances and will promote soil biodiversity as it represents a habitat for useful insects a very small hole will be made with a needle then turned upside down and placed on the ground
