I was never a person who shops online especially clothes. I tried several online shopping platforms like myntra, etc. Myntra really disappointed me in many ways. But then one fine day I came across an app called URBANIC. 🤩💗
After that Urbanic has always been my first choice for shopping online. The fabric of their product is superb.🌼🤌🏻💗
They are absolutely versatile & have got tons of options for women.✨️❤️
I recently bought this grey top which is my favourite in the recent times.😍🤍
Urbanic is a pocket-friendly platform. 🤑💸They never really run out of discounts, coupons, etc. 🎟You'll get many good clothing items in a really Reasonable price. 👗💰
Go and check it out and if you have already tried it out let me know in the notes section how was your first experience. ✨️😉
For new users you can go and download the app. Link is attached below.👇🏻
