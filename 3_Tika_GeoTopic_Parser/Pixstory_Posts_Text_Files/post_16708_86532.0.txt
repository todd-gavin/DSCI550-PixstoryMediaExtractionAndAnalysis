Tara Sutaria is set to reunite with Tiger Shroff on the big screen for the second time with Heropanti 2, following their spectacular performance in Karan Johar"s Student of the Year 2. The movie is currently in its post production. 
Tara was hence photographed while dubbing for the film at a studio in Andheri. She donned a comfortable all-white kurta and pants with grey sandals. Her hair was tied up in a messy bun and she finished the look up with a pair of chic sunglasses.
