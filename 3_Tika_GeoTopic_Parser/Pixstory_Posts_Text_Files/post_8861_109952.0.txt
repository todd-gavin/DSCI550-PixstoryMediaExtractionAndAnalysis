My Years in the Supreme Court continues....

The story of my short sojourn in Hyderabad would be incomplete without my mentioning a very interesting interview that I had with the Nizam. I had heard many stories about him from different sources and when I met him I mentioned some of them in a half jocular way. I asked him why he liked to go about in a Ford car, the oldest model that ever came to India. He told me that, though he possessed numerous cars, including a number of Rolls Royce cars, he preferred his old Ford for the simple reason that he treated the cars more as means of transport than as articles of luxury and his Ford gave him very good service. 

He did not care what the people thought of it. He said people thought he was a great miser but he did not believe in unnecessarily spending money to exhibit his wealth. The Nizam presented to me a book that had been published under his guidance about his administration of the State. 

He also invited me to lunch when Sardar Patel visited Hyderabad during my stay there. His Exalted Highness is not fond of dressing in an up-to-date fashion and sticks to his old clothes. He is very, very particular about the money spent on his wives and children and looks after their food arrangements himself. 

The turn of the wheel of Hyderabadâ€™s fortunes once found him standing by me to receive Sardar Patel at the Begumpet aerodrome. 

When the Sardar arrived, the Nizam garlanded him, paid his respects and saw him duly deposited at the Government guest house. When the Sardar departed, the Nizam came to see him off. 

When I met him after this visit, I discovered that he did not relish all this change but felt that he must adapt himself to the new 
situation and take things philosophically.
