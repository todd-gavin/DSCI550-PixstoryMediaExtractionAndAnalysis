After suffering an odd injury, former Arsenal striker Alexandre Lacazette is questionable for
Sunday's friendly match between Lyon and Feyenoord. In the woodland near Lyon's hotel in
Sint-Michielsgestel, Netherlands, where the first team squad is staying for their preseason
training camp, the 31-year-old received ten wasp stings.

Lacazette will probably not play against Willem II tomorrow since he is apparently being
watched ahead of Sunday's friendly match against Feyenoord. The former France international
spent five years in north London, where he amassed 71 goals in all competitions, before
returning to his previous team earlier this summer.

After joining for £45 million from Manchester City, Gabriel Jesus has practically taken
Lacazette's spot and now wears the No. 9 jersey. The Brazilian international has made an
immediate impact, scoring three goals in as many games while also seeming to click with strike
partner Eddie Nketiah.

After Wednesday's 3-1 victory over Orlando City, Mikel Arteta stated, ‘We want to build those
relationships and they haven’t played a lot of minutes together yet, the same with Martin and
Gabi, for example.’

Jesus, a four-time Premier League champion, believes his position with the Gunners is
drastically different and that he is now viewed as a crucial senior player others look up to. He is
loving this new role.

He said he needed a fresh challenge. He came here because he wanted to play every game.
He contrasts the current Arsenal squad with the City squad he joined before. Numerous young
players are present.

Jesus has been very well received by everyone at the club. Jesus appreciates that even though
he is two or three years older than the majority of the players here, they view him as a very
seasoned player since he enjoys serving as an example for the younger players.
