Let&#39;s go back to the theater For example at the Piccolo Teatro Grassi to see Eichmann Where the night begins The one act by Stefano Massini directed by Mauro Avogadro which debuts in its national premiere on February The imaginary clash between Hannah Arendt and Adolf Eichmann is staged Who Eichmann really was What kind of personality hid behind the Nazi uniform of the one who devised the final solution and organized in detail the massacre of six million Jews Try to give an answer Stefano Massini in the drama that he created starting from the writings of the Jewish philosopher Hannah Arendt from interrogations in Jerusalem where Eichmann was tried after his arrest in Argentina and from the trial records Directed by Mauro Avogadro Ottavia Piccolo and Paolo Pierobon in the roles of Arendt and Eichmann reconstruct the career and rise of the hierarch step by step outlining the portrait of a man mediocre upstart and opportunist and thus opening the door to a disorienting perspective Eichmann is not a monster but a frighteningly normal man This is where evil takes shape in the most common and unsuspected human narrow-mindedness
