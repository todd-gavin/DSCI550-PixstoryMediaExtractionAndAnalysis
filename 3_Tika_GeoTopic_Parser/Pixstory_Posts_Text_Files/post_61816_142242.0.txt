With just as much fanfare but a tad less drama, Harry Styles took the Toronto International Film Festival by storm on Sunday, premiering the tragic gay romance My Policeman less than a week after the much-talked-about debut of Don’t Worry Darling in Venice.
My Policeman, in which Styles stars alongside Emma Corrin and David Dobson, features arguably the fullest dramatic performance yet from the 28-year-old pop star. 
He stars as a closeted 1950s policeman in Brighton, England, who falls in love with a museum curator (Dobson) yet marries a local schoolteacher (Corrin). 
It’s a tasteful period piece, inspired by the life of Howards End author E.M. Forster, split between the ’50s and four decades later, in which the three characters are played by Gina McKee, Linus Roache and Rupert Everett.
My Policeman revolves around an unresolved love triangle that plays out across 40 years due to the injustices of British ’50s-era laws against homosexuality and the repressions of several characters. Harry Styles said he considered it a tragedy of lost time.
“The reason why the story is so devastating is that, ultimately, to me, the whole story is about wasted time, and I think wasted time is the most devastating thing,” Styles said at the earlier talk. “The only thing we cannot control. It’s the one thing you can’t have back. And I think the one thing that I think matters — whatever kind of life you’ve lived — at the end when you think back on time with people you love.”
