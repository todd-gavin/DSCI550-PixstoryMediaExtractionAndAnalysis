hold

The Brazil international is ready to leave Elland Road over the summer, but there is work to be done at Camp Nou before a deal can be completed. 

Raphinha has agreed to personal terms with Barcelona, but negotiations with Leeds have been put on hold until the end of the season as both clubs have more pressing concerns at the moment. 


Those at Elland Road are still sweating on their Premier League status, with one more crucial fixture left to take in their battle to beat the drop, while directions at Camp Nou are working on freeing up space in Xavi’s squad and salary cap for further reinforcements to be drafted in. 

It is understood that a deal with Brazil international Raphinha is being lined up, on a contract that will see his salary doubled, with terms that will take him through to 2027 now drawn up in Catalunya. 


Will Raphinha leave Leeds for Barcelona?

The 25-year-old forward, who has seven senior caps to his name, is represented by former Barca star Deco who he has been working since June 2021. 

Contract with Leeds has been made through the ex-Portugal international, with the Whites making it clear that they will enter into a discussion once their domestic campaign has come to a close following a trip to Brentford on Sunday. 


Raphinha will be hoping to steer his current club to safety, but a significant reduction in his release clause will be triggered if a side managed by American coach Jesse Marsch suffers relegation out of the English top flight. 


Can Barcelona sign Raphinha this season?

The plan is having push Coutinho to Aston Villa on a permanent basis, to get big more earners off the books in the coming weeks- with the potential for the likes of Umtiti, Lenglet, Neto and De Jong who are pushing themselves towards a free agency.
