The first multidisciplinary National Games were held in Lohaur (now in Pakistan) in 1924 before independence.  It was organized to select the Indian delegation for the 1924 Paris Olympics.  The Games were named as the Indian Olympic Games.  The Games were then held every two years.  
The name was changed as the National Games in 1940 during the 9th Games in Bombay.  The Indian Olympic Association, the nation's sports organizing body, mooted the concept of the National Games to promote the growth of sports and the Olympic movement in India, and was responsible for the selection of the host city.
It has been 98 years today that India is organizing the National Games.  Apart from the National Games, India has also organized the National Winter Games of India five times.  The last National Winter Games was held in Gulmarg in the year 2008.
