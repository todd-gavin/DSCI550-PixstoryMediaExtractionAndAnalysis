 Ugh is right! Not only is She-Hulk garbage, but this time the agenda playing is worse than ever. The entire point of this show is basically saying that men are useless creatures and how much better women are than men. Watching the first episode of this monstrosity, I wish I had something to say about this show, but at this point MCU has just hit its lowest with this nonsensical crap that is lacking any sort of substance. It is obvious that MCU has played an UNO reverse card on their priorities, instead of telling some kind of story, ‘The Message’ always has to take precedence.


This woke culture of Disney and Marvel is nothing new, but bringing it to such a level is sickening. Let us look at the characters first. Bruce Banner/The Hulk was a man who did not ask to be given his powers, he was an unfortunate victim who spent years trying to cope with his trauma, until he got enough strength from those around him to turn this trauma of turning into a raging green monster as a new sort of life.


As far as Jennifer Walters goes, she has no character besides being as bland and pathetic as the CGI of her She-Hulk. This show is basically emblematic of all of MCU Phase 4 problems, too little character development, pathetic comedy, garbage storyline, and way too much wokeness.


The story is simple, Jennifer Walters has turned into She-Hulk after getting into an accident where she got some her cousin Bruce’s blood into her bloodstream. After a bit of problem, she immediately controls her Hulk side, just like that!


It took Bruce years to control it and a psychological strong period of acceptance that Hulk is now a part of him. Walters with little training and no challenges is immediately better than him at basically everything. That basically shows the writing standard of Marvel at this point and how much it has fallen. This show and its messaging is as forced, soulless and artificial as the computer it was written in.  


Score: 1/10
