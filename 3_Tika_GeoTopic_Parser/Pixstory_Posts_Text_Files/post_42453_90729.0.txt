Yesterday, an incident happened at The Oscars where Will Smith slapped Chris Rock because he made a joke about Will Smith's wife's disease.

Since then, an eruption of opinions started coming on all social media platforms. Someone is saying that the whole thing was scripted, someone saying this was true, people started sharing memes, made fun of Chris Rock and people sympathises with Jada’s disease.

Chris Rock declined to file a complaint against Will Smith, The Academy also released the statement that they don’t condone violence of any form, and later Will Smith apologized for the incident. This means everything is sorted out from both sides. 

After observing all of this, one question occurred to my mind,

What If this joke was made by a White person or What if a White person slapped Chris Rock in front of the whole world because ceremonies like the Oscars get a worldwide audience.

Will the reaction of the people who are making fun and making memes on Chris Rock be the same? I think not. 

If a white person slapped Chris Rock, Racism would have been entered into this scenario and people from all over the world would ask Will Smith to return his Oscar. But nothing happened because both people are Black. 

And on the other hand, if a white person made a joke about Will Smith’s wife, then, if he is getting criticism from thousand people now, but after that, there will be millions of people who will come on social media to criticize him and demand an apology just because he is a white man. 

In this incident, both Chris Rock and Will Smith were wrong, but people decided that who is wrong and who is right and because of this those people are normalizing violence in the public place. 

I just want to say to everyone who use social media platform to give their opinions, read each and everything about the topic or incident that you are about to write about because it will influence many people all around the world.
