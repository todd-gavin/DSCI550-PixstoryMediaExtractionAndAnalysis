Paris Saint Germain&#39;s sporting director Leonardo commented on Canal&#39;s microphones on the Parisians&#39; second defeat of the season against Nantes. It was a difficult game for us from the start. We conceded two goals and deserved to be under. against us and now there is also the risk of having injured players Announce a minute of injury time and their penalty comes four minutes later at the end of the first half I have the impression that the referee wanted to blow the whistle against us Photo credits TMW
