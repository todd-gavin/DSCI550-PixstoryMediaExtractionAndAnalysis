ðŸ‘‰Edema
Edema, which is characterized by swollen and puffy skin, is a classic symptom of kwashiorkor.
Protein deficiency may lead to fluid buildup inside the abdominal cavity. A bloated belly is a characteristic sign of a kwashiorkor.
ðŸ‘‰Skin, Hair and Nail Problems.
Protein deficiency often leaves its mark on the skin, hair and nails, which are largely made of protein.
Hair thinning, faded hair color, hair loss (alopecia) and brittle nails are also common symptoms.
ðŸ‘‰Stunted Growth in Children.
Protein not only helps maintain muscle and bone mass, but itâ€™s also essential for body growth.
Thus, deficiency or insufficiency is especially harmful to children whose growing bodies require a steady supply.
ðŸ‘‰Increased Severity of Infections.
Even marginally low protein intake may impair immune function. Impaired immune function may increase the risk or severity of infections, a common symptom of severe protein deficiency.
ðŸ‘‰Greater Risk of Bone Fractures.
Protein helps maintain the strength and density of bones. Insufficient protein intake has been linked to a lower bone mineral density and an increased risk of fractures.
