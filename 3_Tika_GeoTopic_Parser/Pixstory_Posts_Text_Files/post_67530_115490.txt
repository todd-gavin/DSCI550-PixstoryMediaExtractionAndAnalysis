Have you ever seen this lattice on your dumplings It s called a skirt and it adds a whole new texture to the dish All you need to make a skirt is starch some oil and water I like to use cornstarch to make dumpling skirts When you re pan frying dumplings or potstickers mix a teaspoon of cornstarch in a cup of water Once the dumplings have a golden brown bottom and no longer stick to the pan pour this mixture in and quickly cover the pan The moisture from the mixture gets converted into steam and cooks the dumplings further while the oil cooks the cornstarch Since the cornstarch was mixed with water and water and oil don t mix it separates into a lattice as the water evaporates Once it s fully cooked you ll have a crispy lattice on your dumplings Just carefully flip the dumplings onto a plate and enjoy
