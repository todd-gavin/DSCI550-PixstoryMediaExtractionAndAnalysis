During an auction at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, Germany on May 5, a 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupe sold for $142 million. It was the highest amount ever paid for a car at auction, easily surpassing the eight-figure Ferrari sales that had long dominated the blue-chip bill.


The buyer of the one-of-two silver stunner with gullwing doors and gleaming exhaust pipes emerging from its right side remains unknown. Despite persistent industry speculations, representatives for Swiss-Italian billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli have flatly denied to Bloomberg that the veteran Mercedes-Benz collector made the winning bid.

"The buyer is a collector first and foremost, not an investor," explains Simon Kidston, who submitted the winning bid on behalf of an anonymous client. "It's someone who adores automobiles." The buyer has never inquired as to how much I believe the automobile is worth in the future."

What is certain is that an item of this value will necessitate a strong insurance policy—especially if the new owner intends to drive it. According to researchers at Hagerty, a company that insures collectible vehicles and collections valued up to $1 billion, if the car is never driven, it is technically not required to have insurance.


Mercedes-Benz declined to comment on insurance for the world-record-breaking coupé, according to a spokeswoman. The most obvious bet for the new owner, according to Abe Barnett, vice president of Hagerty's highest-end insurance division, would be to safeguard it under an inland marine insurance policy, which includes high-value things that are generally prohibited in regular coverage.

The prices and structure of such a policy are determined by a variety of criteria, including location, storage, and vehicle type, but in general, insuring a $100 million vehicle costs well over $100,000 per year.
