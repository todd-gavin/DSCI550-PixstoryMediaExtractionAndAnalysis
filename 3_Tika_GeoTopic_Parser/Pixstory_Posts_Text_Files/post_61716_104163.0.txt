The Atheism of the early twenty-first century seems to have died a painful death and I for one don’t miss it. The intolerant tone of the Atheists was a bit childish. I always felt the need to up my game to be clear about why I believed and why it mattered. 
Some of the points the Atheists made were well made. For instance, Sam Harris argued that theists don’t understand probability – that they attribute things to God that were likely to happen anyway. 
It is a good point, God doesn’t need magical thinking on our part. As an ex-atheist, I have a lot of respect for those who still think as I thought. 
Of course, the argument goes both ways – we too need to interrogate the basis of our faith, to ask difficult questions and perhaps be prepared to change our worldview every time we sincerely debate with someone of no faith. 
The Atheism drew its strength from two ideas. That God is past it and just needs a shove to depart the stage for good; and that 9/11 clearly showed that religion is dangerous. 
This is really interesting. I wonder if Covid has made the very questions the Atheists were asking to seem irrelevant. At the end of the First World War, the faith took a battering because it looked like God had abandoned us amid the senseless slaughter. But Covid doesn’t seem to have brought that sense of God’s abandonment. Science has saved us, thank God, but questions about God seem an irrelevance. 
It looks like the Atheism didn’t really have roots and perhaps it is hard to put roots down when you are essentially against something, rather than for all that makes for the good life. In my opinion, atheism is really cool when you are in the initial stages of understanding religion, questioning god, but inherently rejecting the whole idea of god is something that does not in its essence seem logical.
