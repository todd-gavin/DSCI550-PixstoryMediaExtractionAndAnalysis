A high-level meeting is being convened in Delhi by Union Home Minister Amit Shah in response to the recent spate of targeted killings in Jammu and Kashmir.

The meeting is being attended by Ajit Doval, Army Chief General Manoj Pandey, J&K top cop Dilbaug Singh, and Samant Goel, the chief of the country's foreign intelligence agency R&AW.

Over the previous six months, the number of targeted assassinations in the Union Territory has increased dramatically. Since May 1, eight people have been slain. Dilkhush Kumar (17), a Bihar labourer, was shot by militants in Budgam on Thursday. On the same day, a bank employee from Rajasthan was slain in Kulgam. It was the eighth targeted assassination and the third by a non-Muslim government official.

Following a high-level meeting with top officials from both the police and civil administration in Srinagar on Wednesday, Lieutenant Governor of J&K Manoj Sinha agreed to relocate all Hindu government personnel to district headquarters in the Kashmir valley.

The government would transfer Hindu government personnel serving in remote locations to district headquarters in the Kashmir valley, while the government will offer sufficient security and secure housing for all Hindu government employees in J&K.

Employees have also demonstrated in response to the recent attacks. They want to be transferred from Kashmir to Jammu. A day after their colleague, Rahul Bhat, was slain by terrorists, over 350 government employees in the Kashmir valley, all Kashmiri Pandits, presented their resignations to Manoj Sinha. The Pandits expressed their dissatisfaction with their current situation. Streaming video
