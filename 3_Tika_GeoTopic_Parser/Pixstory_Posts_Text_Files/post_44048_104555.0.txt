UEFA Nations League champions France will begin the defense of their title against Denmark at Stade de France on Friday night.

Denmark placed second in their group, behind Belgium, and can shock the odds on their own turf. The Danes cruised through Serbia 3-0 in their previous international match, but they'll have to fight hard to win again this week.

France, on the other hand, won the UEFA Nations League last season and is currently regarded as one of the top teams in the world. Les Bleus smashed South Africa 5-0 in their previous match and will be confident going into this one.
France vs Denmark: Probable Playing XI

France: Hugo Lloris; Lucas Hernandez, Presnel Kimpembe, Raphael Varane; Benjamin Pavard, Theo Hernandez, N'Golo Kante, Aurelien Tchouameni; Antoine Griezmann, Kylian Mbappe, Karim Benzema.

Denmark:Kasper Schmeichel; Joakim Maehle, Jannik Vestergaard, Andreas Christensen, Daniel Wass; Thomas Delaney, Pierre Emile-Hojbjerg, Christian Eriksen; Robert Skov, Yussuf Poulsen, Kasper Dolberg.

France vs Denmark: Prediction
While both sides have their strengths, France has the advantage of not only having world-class talent but also having ample depth. Deschamps will also have the benefit of playing on home soil, and he will be eager to get his campaign off to a winning start.

Denmark has a chance to surprise Les Bleus if they show up prepared. The World Champions' quality, on the other hand, should come through and earn them all three points on the night.

Prediction: France 2-1 Denmark
