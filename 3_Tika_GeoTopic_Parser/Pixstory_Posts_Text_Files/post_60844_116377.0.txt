We study quite a few subjects because we are pursuing a triple major degree. It's like putting thrice the amount of effort and sometimes the long hours we spend between lectures and studies can wear us out.

I'm majoring in Media and Communication, English and Psychology. Christ University is quite popular for the triple major courses it offers. Sometimes, I love all the subjects we study but sometimes I wish I was only studying one subject because it's taxing to divide equal attention to all three disciplines.

I enjoy the integrated interdisciplinary approach and at the time of admission I was looking forward to exploring my interests. Although I have always wanted to pursue media studies, literature and psychology held a dear place in my heart.

I am an avid reader and writer, so I knew I would flourish as a student of literature.  Before I took up the triple major degree, people had romanticised literature and psychology quite a bit. However, it's not as romantic as it sounds and you have to put in lots of efforts to understand and perform well in these subjects. 

Media studies on the other hand can be physically exhausting because of all the practical work we do. It's most certainly interesting because we get to learn a diverse range of media subjects like photography, software for media, social media, PR and Corporate Communication, journalism, etc., and the hard work definitely pays off.

Although I enjoy most of what I study, some classes don't align with my interests no matter how good the faculty teaches it. At that time we usually sit at the back bench and doodle on tables with chalks to entertain ourselves. Kind of makes us nostalgic about our school days. 

Do you have any such stories to share from your college days when you were just not interested in studying a certain subject?
