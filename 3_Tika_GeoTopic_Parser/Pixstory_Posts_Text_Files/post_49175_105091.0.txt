I don't know how many times it needs to be said but banning guns will not prevent all of this. You say it would reduce it but how exactly? If a criminal wants to commit the crime, they will. They will go an extra mile to do it if it came to that.

In a violent society, guns are a vital tool. They offer defence against muggings, home invasions, terrorist attacks, and mass shootings. We do not prohibit the use of tools just because they are harmful. We don't ban cars even though many people use them to commit murders, we don't ban knives and many drugs. If guns are prohibited, they will simply find another way to commit the crime. Gun ownership, at the very least, ensures that individuals who own them are safe.

Training citizens on how to deal with such occurrences is a better approach to go about it. Armed officers should be present at all times at all such places that have crowds, and they should be properly trained for situations like this. When and when not to use violence should be taught to children in school. It is the conditioning, not the laws, that needs to change.
