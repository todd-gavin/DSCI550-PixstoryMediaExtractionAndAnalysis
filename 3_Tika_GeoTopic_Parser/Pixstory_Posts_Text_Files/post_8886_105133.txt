On the Bench Once More continues While I was in Simla the Maharaja of Patiala asked me on telephone whether I would be willing to come to him as his adviser He wrote to me saying that the State was passing through a critical time and it would be good to have an experienced and eminent person like me at hand I apologized to him for my inability to act as his adviser as I intended to continue my work in the High Court particularly in view of the fact that the Chief Justice of India had been making enquiries from me whether I would be willing to go to the Federal Court if an offer was made On the th July Chief Justice Kania wrote to me I do not know what you ultimately decided about your connection with the East Punjab High Court Have you entered into any definite agreement with Bikaner Anyway I want at least two more judges for the Federal Court and I am considering your name Their terms of service as you know are a little uncertain as the new Constitution has not been passed It contemplates a reduction of salaries of all the Judges including the Judges of the Federal Court We trust they will not reduce the salaries of officers already in service but one never knows The present salary is Rs I do not know how you stand in Bikaner Perhaps service in India may be considered more suitable I should like to know if you like to be considered for the Federal Court After all it will be the highest Court in our country Please do not mention this to anyone yet To be continued
