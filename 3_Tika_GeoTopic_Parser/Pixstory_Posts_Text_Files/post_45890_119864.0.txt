On Wednesday, July 27, 2022, Donald Trump and his wife Melania Trump attended the LIV Golf-sponsored event in Manhattan. On July 28, 2022, the Saudi-sponsored LIV Golf International tournaments are scheduled to begin at Trump's golf facilities. 

As per news portals, the former president is seeded against players like Bryson DeChambeau and Dustin Johnson. At the Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster, New Jersey, the LIV Golf Invitational's pro-am competition comes before the opening round. 

Those who are outraged by the Saudi government's egregious history of violating human rights and connections to terrorism and the 9/11 attacks blame Trump for brushing these matters under the rug in exchange for the huge "paycheck" to host the golf tournament. 

Trump had controversially agreed to host the event at his club after it was dumped by the PGA in 2016 and again in 2021 after the Capitol riot.
