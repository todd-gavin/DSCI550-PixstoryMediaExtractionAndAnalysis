According to a study published in April by experts at Virginia Commonwealth University, the University of Colorado Boulder, and the Urban Institute, the pandemic has resulted in the largest drop in American life since 1943, the worst year for Americans during WWII. 

According to the report, the drop in life expectancy in the United States was heavily racialized, with Hispanic and Black people losing the most time between 2019 and 2021. 

VCU News reported that statistics say that for the entire U.S. population, the overall decline in life expectancy over two years between 2019 (78.85 years) and 2021 (76.44 years) was substantial, a decrease of 2.41 years, but the researchers found even larger losses in Native American (4.71 years), Hispanic (3.85 years), and Black (3.70 years) populations. In contrast, the decrease in the white population was 2.10 years.

The researchers have now released an update to their analysis that includes newly developed data on Asian and Native American populations (American Indian and Alaska Native). They discovered that between 2019 and 2021, the Native American population lost more life expectancy than the Hispanic and Black groups combined.
