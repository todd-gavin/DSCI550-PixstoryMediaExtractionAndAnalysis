Another day, another victory for Real Madrid. This time Real Madrid beat Osasuna by 1-3 at their home. Real Madrid deserves to win the match last night but they won it in a very weird way and Iâ€™ll tell you why.

The first thing that shook all the fans of Real Madrid was that Carlo Ancelotti made so many changes in Playing 11 for which he is not famous and players like Rodrygo and Nacho were playing in different positions.

The second thing that felt bizarre to me was Benzema missed two penalties on the same day and if he converted those penalties, the score could be 1-5 at least. Benzema should improve his penalty-taking skills because the next match he will play against is Manchester City and to win that match, he has to be clinical in situations like these.

But whatever said and done, Real Madrid won the match, and win is the only thing that mattered and because of this win, Real Madrid took one more step toward the La Liga title and if Barcelona drops more points in their upcoming fixtures, Real Madrid will win the league title without even playing the match against Espanyol on 30th April.

As for now, Good times for Real Madrid but the next match against Manchester City will be the real test for them and as a Madrid fan, I am a little bit nervous.
