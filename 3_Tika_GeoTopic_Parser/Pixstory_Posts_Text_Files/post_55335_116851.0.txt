Brain International School, Vikas Puri, New Delhi recognises that since its inception, Earth Day continues to be a worldwide phenomenon focusing on promoting clean living and a healthy, sustainable habitat for people and wildlife. This day has significantly raised concerns over some of the most crucial environmental and social problems that include climate change, biodiversity loss and dwindling natural resources. It also serves as a conscious reminder of how fragile our planet is and how important it is to protect it. 
In the endeavour to sensitise students about their responsibility towards Earth, Brain International school, Vikaspuri organised a special Earth Day Assembly wherein students understood the importance of sustainable development and the urgent need to take care of our planet laying special emphasis on this year’s theme – 'Invest In Our Planet'. 
Commemorations commenced with a welcome song by the school choir. Students staged a mind - altering skit or Nukkad Natak as well as presented a spectacular dance performance on the given theme.
