Where would we be without our mothers? We wouldn’t be! Even Jesus, Lamb of the Lord, needed a mother to descend the Earth, to come to our aid. That is how important a mother is to mankind. Out of all of humanity, God chose Mary to perform such an important part of the Bible. She was an unmarried adolescent, a 13 year old in the Middle East when she was chosen to be Jesus's mother. She was betrothed to Joseph. Back then, women were not allowed to commit adultery like they are today. Mary was at the risk of losing it all—from her alliance with Joseph to being stoned to death for being pregnant before marriage, but she still chose to be the servant of the Lord. Mary's response was, "I am the Lord's servant...May your word to me be fulfilled." In 2015 the Pope said: "The Gospel also shows us the truest reason for Mary's greatness and her blessedness: it is faith". Mary was an ideal woman. She taught that women, especially mothers, have to sacrifice a lot for the greater good. She became the Mother of Jesus, such was her fortune. Mary's heart was obedient, submissive and pure, which is why she was worthy of God's protection. There's a difference between following a religion and true devotion, and Mother Mary taught us what devotion truly is. There's so much to learn from her. And the biggest of it is, Faith.
