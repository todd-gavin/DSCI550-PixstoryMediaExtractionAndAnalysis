Giant mountain ranges at least as high as the Himalayas and stretching up to kilometers across entire supercontinents played a crucial role in the evolution of early life on Earth according to a new study by researchers at The Australian National University ANU The researchers tracked the formation of these supermountains throughout Earth s history using traces of zircon with low lutetium content a combination of mineral and rare earth element only found in the roots of high mountains where they form under intense pressure The study found the most giant of these supermountains only formed twice in Earth s history the first between and million years ago and the second between and million years ago Both mountain ranges rose during periods of supercontinent formation Lead author ANU PhD candidate Ziyi Zhu said there are links between these two instances of supermountains and the two most important periods of evolution in Earth s history There s nothing like these two supermountains today It s not just their height if you can imagine the km long Himalayas repeated three or four times you get an idea of the scale she said We call the first example the Nuna Supermountain It coincides with the likely appearance of eukaryotes organisms that later gave rise to plants and animals The second known as the Transgondwanan Supermountain coincides with the appearance of the first large animals million years ago and the Cambrian explosion million years later when most animal groups appeared in the fossil record Co author Professor Jochen Brocks said What s stunning is the entire record of mountain building through time is so clear It shows these two huge spikes one is linked to the emergence of animals and the other to the emergence of complex big cells When the mountains eroded they provided essential nutrients like phosphorous and iron to the oceans supercharging biological cycles and driving evolution to greater complexity The supermountains may also have boosted oxygen levels in the atmosphere needed for complex life to breathe There is no evidence of other supermountains forming at any stage between these two events making them even more significant nature
