I'm deeply shocked that more people aren't talking about it. i randomly picked this up in the bookstore a couple months ago and just from reading the synopsis, i knew this would be something right up my alley. the concept was one of the most unique ones i've ever heard of.
this is a love story told in reverse. we start at the end of a 5 year relationship, with the couple saying their final goodbyes & then we move through time in reverse. we move through the messy breakup, the reason it fell apart, the good times, all the way to how they met and fell in love in the first place.
FULL DISCOLSURE... this book might be for a very specific group of people. i mean guess not everyone wants to read about a couple that doesn't have a happy ending. but for me, that was part of the intrigue. i'm someone who loves reading about love in all of its forms. and here it was very interesting to see how love can go wrong. it also teaches an important lesson of knowing when to let go & move on.
the writing in this was BEAUTIFUL. i adore the prose. it describes so many little intricacies of a relationship (even the bad parts) in such a beautiful and relatable way. i think it reminds me a bit of sally rooney.
this also dealt with some tough topics such as mental health, motherhood, & familial relationships. so many great points are brought up all around.
overall, this book just made me feel so empty i guess? but in a way that kind of liked. in a very bittersweet, 'this is definitely for the better' kind of way. it felt like watching a car crash happen in reverse. we start with seeing a relationship in ruins, and then seeing the beauty of the formation of the relationship, my heart was left feeling like a crushed empty soda can by the end of it. something about this story & it's characters was so beautifully raw & real. i was left feeling equally disenchanted and hopeful about love.
