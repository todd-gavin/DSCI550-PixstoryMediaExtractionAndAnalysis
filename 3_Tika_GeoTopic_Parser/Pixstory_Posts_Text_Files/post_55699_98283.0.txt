For the first time in more than a decade, Australia's central bank has lifted interest rates, joining a growing list of Asia-Pacific economies taking action to combat rising inflation. 

Al Jazeera reported that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) hiked the benchmark interest rate from 0.1 percent to 0.35 percent on Tuesday. 

But why is it happening? Well, all I know is that the first rate hike since late 2010 comes after consumer prices in Australia rose at their quickest rate in two decades in the first quarter, owing to rising gas, home building, and food expenses. 

Unfortunately, the consequences of this would be dire! 

Millions of Australians would face higher house loan repayments as a result of the higher benchmark rate, which reflects the interest banks charge each other on loans.

Moreover, Mariano Kulish, an economics professor at the University of Sydney who previously worked at the RBA, said the central bank's move was a "significant shift" from its relatively accommodative position on inflation just a few months ago.

Letâ€™s see what happens next!
