The fake newspaper clipping carries a photo of a Muslim woman with the headline, "Qatari Princess caught in Orgy with 7 men".

the newspaper clipping is fake and has been viral since 2016. We did not find any article published by Financial Times reporting that Qatari Princess Sheikha Salwa was caught in an orgy with seven men.

Additionally, the woman in the photo used in the newspaper clipping is Alia Al Mazrouei, Chief Operating Officer of Dubai-based Al Mazrui Holdings.

We found that the Financial Times in August 2016 denied publishing any such article on Qatari Princess Sheikha Salwa being caught in an orgy with seven men.

On comparing the viral photo and the photo of Mazrouei, we found that both match, showing that she is being falsely misidentified as Qatari Princess Sheikha Salwa. The photo below matches with the viral photo used in the newspaper clipping.
