Frens! Come see AppuEsthose and me talk about our book on Mahatma Gandhi's assassination on January 27 at 5 pm GMT. Here's a link to register for the event : https://www.lse.ac.uk/International-Inequalities/Events/The-Murderer-The-Monarch-and-The-Fakir/The-Murderer-The-Monarch-and-The-Fakir-A-New-Investigation-of-Mahatma-Gandhis-Assassination?fbclid=IwAR38isRFt5KwezwqB8_ND2Mzr17FftKBtWeHZdHGV1imrvr8ytcZlgDjUro

Would be happy to receive tips and suggestions on holding audience attention for a whole hour!! What a terrifying thought, but I bet it comes naturally to AppuEsthose 😬
Tx tx in advance 🌝🙏🏼 

Hope to see you there !
