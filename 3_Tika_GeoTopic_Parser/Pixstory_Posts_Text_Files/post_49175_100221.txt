It is getting repetitive It s like anything wrong happens anywhere Mr Trump is to be blamed Everyone acts like he is some kind of megavillain or something It s not Trump s fault that people don t know how to use social media effectively And who is to say Khan is even saying the truth Maybe he is actually not abused like he claims but is only being called out for his work and this claim is actually a cop out It s nothing out of the ordinary for the other side to play the victim card to demean President Trump Not to mention what does it have anything to do with Trump s suspension anyway He was the only who was wrongfully suspended how does it stop the crowd from hurling abuses at anyone How does it change anything Or a very probable case scenario is that it s just another one out of the countless attempts to speak against the man truly capable of being the president He s been out of the position for two years now stop the obsession and instead focus on Biden s administration who is pretty much failing to keep the country on surface
