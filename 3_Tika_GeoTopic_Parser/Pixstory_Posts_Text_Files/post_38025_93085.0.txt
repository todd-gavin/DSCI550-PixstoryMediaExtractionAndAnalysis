As per the Sun, Paris Saint-Germain are looking to sign Romelu Lukaku in the summer. The French giants have reportedly identified him as a viable option as they look to add the striker to their roster. 

Paris Saint-Germain could lose out on Kylian Mbappe in the summer. Though the club's management is desperately trying to keep the Frenchman, Real Madrid are certainly looking confident about their chances to sign Mbappe. 

Hence PSG are looking to keep their options open in case they fail to keep hold of Kylian Mbappe. Owing to this, the Ligue 1 side has reportedly added Romelu Lukaku to their shortlist. Chelsea could also be willing to let the striker leave for a "worthy" transfer fee as they are themselves targetting other players in the summer. 

The report also suggests that Paris Saint-Germain have Ajax's Anthony and Nice's Amine Gouiri on the shortlist as well. Both these strikers are currently in better form than Romelu Lukaku and will also be a cheaper option. 

Hence it has to be seen what PSG decide to do in the summer transfer window. Nevertheless, the club's main goal remains to extend Kylian Mbappe's contract for at least a couple of seasons.






What went wrong for Lukaku at Chelsea?

Romelu Lukaku arrived at Chelsea to a lot of fanfare. The striker scored on his debut and looked like a 'special signing'. But things took a downturn after he was injured against Malmo in the Champions League in October. 

Owing to the injury, Lukaku missed over a month of action. To add to this, he has also lost his form and confidence ever since, hence dropping out of Thomas Tuchel's playing XI as well.

Romelu Lukaku has scored 12 goals in 36 games since rejoining Chelsea. These numbers are certainly quite low for a player worth £98 million. Hence the player and manager would certainly be hoping that Lukaku rediscovers his form in the final stretch of the 2021/22 season.
