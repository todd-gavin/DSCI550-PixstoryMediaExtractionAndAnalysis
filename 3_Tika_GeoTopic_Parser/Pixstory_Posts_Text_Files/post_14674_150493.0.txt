If you’ve heard that red wine can help lower cholesterol, chances are you’ve heard of resveratrol — the much-hyped plant compound found in red wine.
In fact, resveratrol supplements have been linked to many exciting health benefits, including protecting brain function and lowering blood pressure.
Resveratrol is a plant compound that acts like an antioxidant. The top food sources include red wine, grapes, some berries and peanuts.
This compound tends to be concentrated mostly in the skins and seeds of grapes and berries. These parts of the grape are included in the fermentation of red wine, hence its particularly high concentration of resveratrol.
However, much of the research on resveratrol has been done in animals and test tubes using high amounts of the compound.
Of the limited research in humans, most have focused on supplemental forms of the compound, in concentrations higher than those you could get through food.
Resveratrol Supplements May Help Lower Blood Pressure because of its antioxidant properties, resveratrol could be a promising supplement for lowering blood pressure.
A 2015 review concluded that high doses may help reduce the pressure exerted on artery walls when the heart beats.
That type of pressure is called systolic blood pressure, and appears as the upper number in blood pressure readings.
Systolic blood pressure typically goes up with age, as arteries stiffen. When high, it’s a risk factor for heart disease.
Resveratrol may accomplish this blood-pressure-lowering effect by helping to produce more nitric oxide, which causes blood vessels to relax 
However, the authors of that study say more research is needed before specific recommendations can be made about the best dose of resveratrol to maximize blood pressure benefits.
