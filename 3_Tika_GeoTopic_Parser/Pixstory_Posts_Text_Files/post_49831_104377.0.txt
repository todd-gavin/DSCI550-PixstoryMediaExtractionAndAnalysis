‌House of Judiciary is planning on protecting our kid's activities in the light of recent events. House Democrats are in full support of gun bills after the shootings and they were always ready.
‌
‌Many yet are not expected to pass the Senate because of GOP opposition to stricter gun control. A bipartisan group of senators is engaging in talks in an endeavour to find common ground on gun policy yet hope is very less and nothing has changed till now.
‌
The “Protecting Our Kids Act,” put forward by Democrats, includes a series of individual bills intended for at preventing gun violence.

 It would put forward the legal age to buy certain semiautomatic centerfire rifles from 18 to 21 years old.

Establish new federal violations for gun trafficking and for selling large-capacity magazines, and enable local governments to compensate people who surrender such magazines through a buyback program.

It would create a tax incentive for retail sales of safe storage equipment and criminal penalties for breaking new requirements regulating firearm storage on residential premises. 

The measure would also take steps to strengthen prevailing federal regulations on bump stocks and ghost guns.

Most legislation needs 60 votes to withstand a filibuster and pass in the Senate and Democrats only control 50 seats. We can expect what will happen. Republicans have already disputed the legislative package of gun control measures.

Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, rejected the package of gun bills as partisan.

“No one wants another tragedy. No one wants this to happen again. That’s why it’s regretful that Democrats have rushed to a markup today in what seems more like political theatre than a real attempt at improving public safety or finding solutions,” he said.

Jordan also rejected Democratic calls to increase the age of buying a semi-automatic rifle to 21, calling it unconstitutional.
