If you’re on the hunt for a forever home, especially in a major city, you’re likely inspecting professionally styled properties. But all that styling disappears the moment you get the keys, so do look beyond the sumptuous soft furnishings, warns buyer’s agent Michelle May, who says the following techniques are common place.

Removing the curtains: this makes a room look brighter, bigger and a lot cleaner but is generally not a practical way to live.

Turning the lights on: an easy way to hide a lack of natural light. Switch lights off to get a more accurate representation of lighting.

Swapping furniture for smaller pieces: a bedroom looks bigger with a double bed over a king; the same goes for couches.

Playing music: a curated playlist is an easy way to create a homely vibe in a property and also a great way to distract from unwanted noises such as arguing neighbours, traffic, barking dogs and screeching pipes.

Sending belongings to storage: the price of a storage unit for a few weeks is insignificant compared to many thousands on a sale price, which is what good styling can bring to a sale. Many sellers pack up their non-essentials while their home is on the market, so ask yourself, ‘what’s missing here?’

And then there’s this ...

One major factor often forgotten in the excitement of open homes is storage.

From appliances such as air fryers and rice cookers in the kitchen to the ironing board, vacuum cleaner, tools, lawn mower, excess linen, suitcases, and even shoes.

No matter how minimally you live, you’ll undoubtedly have a few bulky items that need a home.

Keep a checklist of things you own on your phone as you wander around any open homes to help you avoid any rude shocks come move-in day.
