Through the official channels of Fiorentina, Alfred Duncan has returned to talk about a theme that is unfortunately still very topical in Italian football, such as racism. For me, racism will never end. happened to receive insults from players I could react but if no one from outside hears later if I went to talk about it they would say No he didn&#39;t say that It would be my word against his no one would believe me They do it because in the end they have nothing different we are on the pitch from opponents we both play in Serie A we play in strong teams so we don&#39;t have anything different And at that moment the only thing he can say to me to annoy me is if a fan boos a black player on the pitch and the club is fined a large amount the club goes to the fans and tells them to stop It&#39;s not the fans who pay the fines but the clubs Or if the pitch were disqualified for a large number of matches, for example, situations would arise Many parents tell their children the black one or the yellow one immediately marking a difference with white White shouldn&#39;t be soiled you can soil black Education for me is the basis of all this
