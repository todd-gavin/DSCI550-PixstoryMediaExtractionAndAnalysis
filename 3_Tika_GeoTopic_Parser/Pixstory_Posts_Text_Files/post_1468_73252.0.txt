Dear Sister X,

We feel inadequate to write to you in this time of unjust trial - we do not want to glorify bravery, courage, or strength to fight systems that have been designed to break us. We just want to stand with you.

Today, we will not put on a pedestal  those oft-quoted values of kindness, generosity, and long-suffering in adversity.

Today, we just want to be with you in strength, truth, prayer, rage, and love. We will be with you, we will believe you and we will believe in you for as long as you need us to.

In solidarity,
Chitrakoot Collective
