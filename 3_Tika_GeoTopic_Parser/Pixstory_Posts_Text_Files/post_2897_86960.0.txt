Ukraine, Kyiv and Volodymyr Zelensky are now household names. Before war drums started beating late last year, many of us couldn’t have pointed out Ukraine on the world map or correctly named its capital or president. Now that we do, we may often get the spellings wrong, which is understandable, but the distinctions do matter: they reveal the political bias.
 
Some refer to this nation as ‘the Ukraine’. The definite article, however, may indicate a region or territory (like the Levant, the Crimea – though there’s also the Netherlands). That might have been ok before 1991. After it won independence, ‘the Ukraine’ is discouraged by its government: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_of_Ukraine 

The Ukrainian Weekly (which happens to be published from the US) was joyous in December 1991: “The ‘the’ is gone”: https://www.ukrweekly.com/archive/1991/The_Ukrainian_Weekly_1991-49.pdf

Still, mistakes have been made. By President Obama in 2014: https://www.vox.com/2014/9/3/18088560/ukraine-everything-you-need-to-know ,by actor Brian Cox last month: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTQIci_xtqs ,and many in between:

The way you spell the name of its capital is also prone to politics. ‘Kyiv’ is the right transliteration. ‘Kiev’ is how Russia would spell it. The English-language media, however, continued to write it the old way, forcing the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to organize an online campaign (‘KyivNotKiev’) to educate journalists: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KyivNotKiev

It was part of a larger campaign, called ‘CorrectUA’, to insist on the proper naming of Ukrainian places in English: https://mfa.gov.ua/en/correctua

Finally, the authoritative Oxford English Dictionary corrected its entry, ditching the linguistic relic of the Soviet era.

As for the surname of the president, you might have noticed the confusion – even in Pixstory tags. Once the New York Times and Washington Post decided that one ‘y’ was economical and hence enough, that became the gold standard, but the Associated Press puts another ‘y’ after that. Why ‘yy’, you might ask. Simply because the man himself writes it that way, so we should respect him at least in this matter: https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa 

Wikipedia too honors his wish, directing “Zelensky” searches to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy 

Yet, there might be a Russian angle in the spelling of his name too. Apparently, the single-y sounds more Russian and the other one more Ukrainian: https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/03/09/language-ukraine-war-kyiv-kiev/
