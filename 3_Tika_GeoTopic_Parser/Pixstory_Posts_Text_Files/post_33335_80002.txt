A simple definition of equanimity considering the various Pali roots the capacity to not be caught up with what happens to us We can practice with equanimity by studying the ways that we get caught Instead of pursuing the ideal of balance and non reactivity directly we can give careful attention to how balance is lost and how reactivity is triggered Trying to fit into some idealistic model of what equanimous is supposed to look like can all too easy produce such threats to equanimity as indifference aloofness rigidity or complacency But when the obstacles are removed then the resulting equanimity can be the foundation for caring presence flexibility and diligence
