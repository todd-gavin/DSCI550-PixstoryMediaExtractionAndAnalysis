Imagine going to the hospital for neurosurgery as thousands of people do every day Now imagine finding out that as a consequence of this surgery you were infected with an agent that has a mortality rate Surely this couldn t happen in the twenty first century right Sadly the answer is yes it has happened but we must stress it is exceedingly rare In the s microbiologists were challenged when it became clear that a previously unknown infectious agent the prion was not susceptible to any of the disinfection methods in practice at that time Composed entirely of protein prions resist decontamination efforts that involve heat radiation and chemicals that attack cellular components Prions are composed only of protein The need to protect against prion contamination was made frighteningly clear when it was determined that infected individuals exhibit high levels of prions in brain and neural tissue and suffer neurological symptoms that always result in death That s why microorganism continues to be a hot topic as microorganisms evolve to resist current strategies Control efforts have a substantial role in public health to prevent disease as well as in therapeutic use to treat disease
