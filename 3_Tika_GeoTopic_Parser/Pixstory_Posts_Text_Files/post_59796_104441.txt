Every day the Indian film industry evolves from filming black and white films to producing internationally acclaimed films However nowadays the majority of films are about someone or something real and everyone enjoys and appreciates them However the question that arises in my mind is why My own feelings on this are that relating to someone s life who has worked hard to get to where they are now is inspiring and can leave a lasting impression on the minds of fans and followers Bhag Milkha Bhag Gangubai Shershaah Super and Neerja are among the best biopics in my opinion These are biopics made in India and inspired by the most amazing personalities who have made India proud to have them The public s interest is piqued by learning what they accomplished to earn their respect and status As a result these films are popular among both young and middle aged audiences Because youth are inspired while middle aged people are glad to express their perspectives on how everyone worked hard to get what they have now
