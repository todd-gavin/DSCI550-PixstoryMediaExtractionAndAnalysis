Among some of my fondest memories there s this scene nestled somewhere This picture was taken when I was on my Bhutan trip We had taken a road trip from Kolkata to Siliguri From there we headed to Bhutan On the way back we visited places like Darjeeling Gangtok etc I captured this scenery en route to Changu when it was snowing This was my first time seeing snowfall It felt so magical I was shivering inside the car but the outside made it so worth it I have always felt close to nature Much of my inspiration to create stems from nature itself I remember the sensation of cupping the fresh snow in my palms and catching some of the falling snow I also remember throwing snowballs at my cousins Now that most of us have grown up and have gone different ways these memories occasionally knock to remind me of happy times whenever I don t feel at my best I also vividly remember driving down a road lined with flower trees on either side I am convinced they were rhododenrons but I can t remember for sure They might have been different flowers but they did resemble the red pink rhododendron blossoms I love how nature finds ways to thrive even in adverse conditions It uplifts my spirit whenever I m close to breaking down I do give myself breaks to recover but when I m stretched I remind myself that the world is a marvelous place If nature can survive harsh conditions then I can endure difficulties and try my best to resolve them Even If I can t resolve something I don t carry any baggage and tell myself to do better next time
