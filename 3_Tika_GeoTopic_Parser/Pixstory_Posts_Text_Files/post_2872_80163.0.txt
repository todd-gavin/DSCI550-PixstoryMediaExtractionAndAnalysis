A little over two months ago, writing on her verified handle on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, tennis star Peng Shuai, alleged that Zhang Gaoli, a former vice-premier of China and Communist Party of China (CPC) leader, sexually assaulted her. Within hours, the message was deleted and anything related to her news also vanished from the Chinese media. Then there was a long silence from Peng leading to speculation and even the International tennis authorities jumped in to know her whereabouts. China was unfazed for a while.

But that didn't last for long. A video call involving Peng and Thomas Bach, the I.O.C. president, took place in which the IOC said that Peng was fine. But that was not enough to convince the world. (https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/01/tennis/peng-shuai-pound-intl-spt/index.html) 

Peng later was shown in good spirits and attending a few tennis events in the country. According to Chinese media, claiming that she was fine, Peng also supposedly wrote a mail to the Women's Tennis Association (WTA). That also failed.

As pressure has increased with negative news headlines in Australia and now with Beijing Olympics on, China seemed to have orchestrated yet another show in which Peng had a dinner meeting with IOC President Thomas Bach. 
According to the IOC, in the "face-to-face meeting" with Peng, they were joined by former Chair of the Athletes' Commission and IOC member Kirsty Coventry. (https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-statement-on-meeting-with-peng-shuai)

She even met a few journalists. But the same journalists, according to the Associated Press are not convinced if Peng is entirely free to express her views. (https://www.voanews.com/a/journalist-who-spoke-to-peng-shuai-says-doubts-remain-/6432301.html) She had claimed in her interviews that her Weibo post alleging sexual assault was 'huge misunderstanding.'

So, China's attempts to put a lid on the controversy related to Peng is yet to come to fruition.
