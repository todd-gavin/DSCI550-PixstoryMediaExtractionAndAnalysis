After days and weeks of deliberation, Premier League side, Wolves have announced the signing of Malian midfielder Boubacar Traore from FC Metz on deadline day of the summer transfer window in Europe.
Notably, there had been talks of Wolves being interested in Traore from the very inception of the transfer window. However, Metz were keen on retaining their midfielder who had made his debut for them just a year ago. It is learnt that Traore himself was keen on joining the Premier League side.
Traore, born in 2001, is a young midfielder from Mali, who was associated with Ligue 2 side, FC Metz. On the deadline day of the summer transfer window, FC Metz announced the signing of Boubacar Traore on Loan from Metz. The deal is a season-long loan deal with an option to buy for Wolves once the loan period completes. 
In 2021, Boubacar Traore had a total of 6 appearances for Metz wherein, he scored 2 goals. In the 2022 season, he played 3 games including Metz’s win over Valenciennes. 
In January, Metz received an offer from Wolves for the signing of Traore for 13 Million Euros as per some reports. However, Metz had then declined the offer as they were in anticipation of receiving a 20 Million Euros offer for the Malian midfielder. 
With Metz’s relegation to Ligue 2, the French club had to rethink their pricing. There was competition for Traore from Lille and AC Milan too. However, the Wolves have managed to sign the sturdy midfielder.
Wolves have cracked the right deal in signing the 21-year-old as their midfield squad depth looks terrific. For Traore, this might just be the move, that brings him to the centre stage and playing alongside Ruben Neves and Matheus Nunes will certainly add to his experience.
Wolves have had a forgetful start to their Premier League campaign this year as they have not managed to win a single game so far as they have lost games to Leeds United and Tottenham and have salvaged a draw against Fulham.
