Stephenson has referred to the existence of the remains of a mound of solid brick work near the village (Besarh), about 40 feet high, and about the same diameter at the base; on the top of which were two muslim religious structures and the tomb of a saint who he was told as having the name as Mir Abdulla, dead about 250 years ago. On the side of the mound fronting the north, a large Burr (Banyan) tree reared its branches to a great height, supported by about 30 trunks, forming a cool pleasant shade for the muslim devotee. A little to the north were seen the ruins of a large fort (called Raja Vishal ka garh) of an oblong shape, one side of which was full 1000 yards in length. It was found to be surrounded by a ditch, then filled with water and jungle grass. 
The remains of the wall can still be seen by the visitor. He further mentioned that the elevation of the wall above the ground was from 6 to 8 feet, and it appeared to be built entirely of brick – which was taken advantage of by the local hindus who had built a temple on the south end of the ruins, though it was then only half finished.  He mentioned that the mound and the fort were certainly coeval with each other and of considerable antiquity, and that he could not find any credible tradition regarding their origins. During his visit seldom did he know that he was at the site of Vaishali – one of the most important cities in ancient India, and frequented by visitors from faraway places, and also blessed by the Buddha.
