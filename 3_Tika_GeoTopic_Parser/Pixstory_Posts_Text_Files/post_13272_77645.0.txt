One way to look at different cultures is to see how much a culture institutionalizes the preoccupation in people's souls. How much do the people of that culture live with hesitation, reflection and a sense of care? In a culture where people are prone to animals, plants, objects, their boots, and caravans of ants, small and large, the lives of human beings are automatically considered dear. Precaution is a general quality, it is not a matter of being preoccupied with some things but not with other things, but a general approach to life.
On the contrary, Parva is a forerunner of secret style and exaggeration. Per capita style culture does not recognize the value of anything enough. Life in it is also vulgar and trivial. Such cannibalism makes human life miserable. Killing, torturing, helplessness and misery do not move anyone. Everything is omnivorous and looks are humiliating and crushing. In our country, such an established culture has become a humiliation of human nature, just as dumping garbage and garbage on the streets is common, as well as humiliating human beings.
How can one claim to be religious but destroy the sanctity of life and the world and treat it like dirty pieces of garbage? While its sacred function has been to bring care, foresight and respect to human life. The most sacred things, such as a group identified with a symbol or totem, were in fact the most important interests and vital needs of the people in that group, as were the lives of individuals and other important collective things, and the general view of all was sacred. It is a late power-hungry ploy to make the basis of our work sacred, but to humiliate life and human beings, because vulgar objects that can be kicked away.
