I know that kids need rest And they should have it But if we don t push them to be the best versions of themselves then we as a society are failing to mould a better generation after us If we don t put pressure over kids to be at their best everyday how will society make any progress It s high time that we stop settling for mediocrity Also if we don t put this burdens on them how are they supposed to know their true self and become the diamond that they are destined to be Kids need homework more than they need rest
