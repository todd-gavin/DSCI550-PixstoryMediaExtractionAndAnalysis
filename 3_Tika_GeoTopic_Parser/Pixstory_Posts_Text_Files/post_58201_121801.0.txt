Lee Rang from the Tale of the Nine tailed .
I have loved Kim Bum 😍 since boys over flowers . He always caught my attention but him playing a villain hits differently. His   playful, charismatic portrayal of a lee rang , won many hearts . Lee rang ' s charming smile , mischievous eyes and easy going attitude were the highlight of the drama.
