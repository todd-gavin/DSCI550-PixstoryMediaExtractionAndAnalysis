You're not allowed to hit kids. It's not that difficult to understand. They're kids, they are NOT expected to be mature. They are allowed to make mistakes, however bad you believe those are. There are other ways to make them understand something's wrong. Healthier ways. You just are not supposed hit them. That's that simple. You're the adult here, you're supposed to do the mental gymnastics to think and come up with a healthy way to tell the kid that something they did is wrong, resorting to hitting just because it's an easy way out is bad parenting and there's NOTHING that justifies that.

Parents often feel entitled to hitting their kids because "We brought you into this world, raised you, did so much for you" but well, the kid didn't ask to be born. It was your decision. And did you only birth a child to beat them up? If you can hold back from hitting a friend or your parents when you're mad, you can hold back from hitting your kid. It's literally the same kind of control. The issue here is that you, as a parent, refuse to take responsibility of raising your kid properly and want to resort to the easier way which is abuse. YOU are lazy, YOU are not taking responsibility for your actions and YOU are shaking your hands off your duty as a parent. With your logic, you should be beaten a lot more.

Several studies have found that beating children to reprimand or discipline them does far more harm than good. I advocate enrolling in a healthy parenting class to discover effective methods for parenting, guiding, and teaching your child that do not require physical aggression, such as corporal punishment. It is NEVER acceptable. And if you think it is, you should probably not have kids.
