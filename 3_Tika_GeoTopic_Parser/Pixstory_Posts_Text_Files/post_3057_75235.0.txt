The European Union has Russia again that sanctions will be swift if it attacks Ukraine. EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday are expected to issue a joint warning yet again even as Russian troops amassed on the Ukrainian border may wait for orders from Moscow.

The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov have been holding talks in Geneva on Ukraine with little of a breakthrough. However, both sides have agreed to continue to talk.

If not a military attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin could have an alternate plan to change the government in Ukraine and have a ruler of its choice. That’s the conclusion of the U.K intelligence agencies. 

In a statement, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said: "The information being released today shines a light on the extent of Russian activity designed to subvert Ukraine, and is an insight into Kremlin thinking…Russia must de-escalate, end its campaigns of aggression and disinformation, and pursue a path of diplomacy."

The Foreign Office went ahead and even named former Ukrainian MP Yevhen Murayev as a potential Russian candidate. The Russian Foreign Ministry has condemned the allegations. “We call on the British Foreign Office to stop its provocative activities and focus on studying the history of the Tatar-Mongol yoke,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a tweet.

Murayev, a media owner, and a former candidate for the Ukrainian parliament, has also brushed aside the allegations. The British have also named four other Ukranian politicians and officials who could be in touch with the Russian intelligence for toppling the government.

The U.S. seemed to agree with the British intelligence assessment. “This kind of plotting is deeply concerning,” White House National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne said in a statement. If this turns out be true, Putin clearly has more than one ace up his sleeve to install a government of his choice in Ukraine.
