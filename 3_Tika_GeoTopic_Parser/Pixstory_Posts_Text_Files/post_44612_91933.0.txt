The Snow Lion and the Dragon:
Tibet-China Relations

Just as the Chinese looked upon the steppe nomads as barbarians, the Mongols looked upon the farming Chinese as grazing animals rather than as real humans who ate meat. The Mongols referred to the ‘grasseating’ Chinese in the same words that they used for cows and sheep. 

While they regarded the lives of their own soldiers very highly, they had utter disregard for the lives of the Chinese peasantry, and were quite seriously prepared to exterminate the populations of entire provinces in order to convert the farmlands into pastures. Another example of their low regard for the Chinese was the annual rite performed by the Mongols 
in order to control the growth of the Chinese population. They ritually rounded up thousands of Chinese people and drowned them in Lake Miyou. When Kublai Khan was formally initiated into Buddhism in 1254 CE by his Tibetan teacher Dogon Choegyal Phagpa, the guru asked his new disciple to take three vows, one of which was to give up this practice .Yet another significant difference between the Chinese and the Mongols lay in their respective attitudes to war and fighting. 

The Mongols fought on the move; the Chinese preferred to fight from fixed positions, to try and drive the enemy away from their defences. For the Chinese farmer-soldier, to flee was to lose . On the other hand, the Mongol nomad-soldier fought to kill; it did not matter to him whether he did it while attacking or while retreating from the enemy.
