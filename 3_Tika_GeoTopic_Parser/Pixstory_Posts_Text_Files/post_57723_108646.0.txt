Honestly, this is how it is! It works too! There's no brain fog, no sleep deprivation many a times, as if the mind is so happy and peaceful about being able to read that it let's you feel okay too😂
Your psychological satisfaction of using sleep time for reading time translates to your physical balanced state😂
This is the life man😂
