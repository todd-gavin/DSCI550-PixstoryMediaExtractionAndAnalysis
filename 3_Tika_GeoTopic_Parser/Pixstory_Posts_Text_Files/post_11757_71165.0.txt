The heme iron found in meat and animal products is generally more easily absorbed by the human body than the non-heme iron found in plants. For this reason, the recommended daily intake of iron is 1.8 times higher for vegetarians and vegans than those who eat meat 

This amounts to approximately 14 mg per day for men and post-menopausal women, 32 mg per day for menstruating women and 49 mg per day for pregnant women.

However, there are various strategies that can be employed to increase the body’s ability to absorb non-heme iron. Here are the best-researched methods:

▪️Eat vitamin C-rich foods: Consuming vitamin C-rich foods together with foods rich in non-heme iron may increase the absorption of iron by up 300%.

▪️Avoid coffee and tea with meals: Drinking coffee and tea with meals can reduce iron absorption by 50-90%.

▪️Soak, sprout and ferment: Soaking, sprouting and fermenting grains and legumes can improve iron absorption by lowering the amount of phytates naturally present in these foods.

▪️Use a cast iron pan: Foods prepared in a cast iron pan tend to provide two to three times more iron as those prepared in non-iron cookware.

▪️Consume lysine-rich foods: Consuming plant foods like legumes and quinoa that are rich in the amino acid lysine together with your iron-rich meals may increase iron absorption.
