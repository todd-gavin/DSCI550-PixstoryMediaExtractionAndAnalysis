The majority of young children treated with peanut immunotherapy achieved desensitisation after two and a half years of treatment, and one in five remained in remission 26 weeks after treatment ended, according to a randomised controlled trial published in The Lancet.

Achieving remission was more common the younger the child was at the start of therapy: 71% (5/7) of those aged one year old, 35% (7/20) of those aged two years old, and 19% (8/43) of those aged three years old achieved remission.

Peanut allergy affects 2% of children in Western countries and most remain allergic across their lifetime. [1] Current standard of care for children with peanut allergy is dietary avoidance and access to self-injectable epinephrine, but the risk of peanut-induced anaphylaxis from accidental exposures persists, highlighting the need for safe and effective therapies. [2]

Immunotherapy involves repeated exposure over time to gradually increasing doses of the allergen, to reduce allergic reactions. Previous studies in school-aged children and young adults have demonstrated that peanut oral immunotherapy can achieve desensitisation (an increased allergic reaction threshold while on therapy) in most participants, but success in achieving remission (lack of reactivity after discontinuing therapy over a prolonged period) has been limited. [3] Therefore, the observation that one in five children achieved remission is the most novel outcome in this study, and it provides a better indication of a lasting treatment effect than desensitisation.

•The study included 146 peanut-allergic children and measured desensitisation (safe consumption of 5000mg peanut protein powder in a food challenge supervised by researchers after two and a half years of daily treatment) and remission (ability to repeat this food challenge 26 weeks after treatment ended).

•In children who received peanut oral immunotherapy 71% (68/96) achieved desensitisation versus 2% (1/50) in the placebo group, while 21% (20/96) achieved remission versus 2% (1/50) in the the placebo group.
