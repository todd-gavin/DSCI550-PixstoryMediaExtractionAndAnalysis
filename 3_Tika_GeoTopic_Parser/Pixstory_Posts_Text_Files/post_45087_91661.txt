 I think Harry Kane wants to win trophies that s for sure he told Football Insider s Ewan Kingsbury But he s not getting any younger and he s not going to be able to achieve that at Man United any time soon A move to United would most definitely not mean an upgrade for Kane I do feel like that d be a sideways move Yes Man United have got all this history but that s not going to win you titles at the end of the day I think he s got more chance of winning a trophy at Tottenham than at Man United to be honest If he wants to win silverware I think he s better off leaving to a club guaranteed to get that success said Agbonlahor in an exclusive Football Insider statement The Englishman is his country s crowning jewel and undoubtedly so at this year s World Cup Regardless of how dangerous their flair and speed is there s one player Gareth Southgate cannot replace and that s Kane Finding the net times in England caps is not a feat most premier league forwards would achieve even when given the chance The summer of comes with promises and tough decisions to make for many players like Kane Gabby Agbonlahor does make a valid point about Manchester United s lack of recent success and surely that is something Kane s agents will remind him on the other side of the World cup Trophies or not Kane will go down as one of the most complete centre forwards of this generation
