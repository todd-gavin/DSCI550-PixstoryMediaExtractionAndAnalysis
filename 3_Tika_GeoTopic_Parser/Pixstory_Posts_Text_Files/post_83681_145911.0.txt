Here's a great quote about the difference between men and women that I think is pretty true, pretty accurate. It's just that the difference between men and women. Most men and women, I should say. Is that "While women do something for the sake of doing it. Men do something for the sake of accomplishing it."
For example: a woman will cook something, but she doesn't think of herself as a chef. When a man cooks, he thinks of himself as a chef.
And I know it's a bit of a stereotype, but I think there's some truth to it, which is that a lot of men expect to be praised as heroes when they do something pretty ordinary. Which belies the truth that many women do extraordinary things every day simply to keep things working.
And so I think there's a kind of truth to that, that men want to accomplish something and women know it needs to be done.
