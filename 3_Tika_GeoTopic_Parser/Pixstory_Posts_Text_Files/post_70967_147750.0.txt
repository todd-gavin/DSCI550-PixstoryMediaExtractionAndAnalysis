Ever since Blackpink dropped their latest album, Born Pink, there hasn’t been a single day where the girls haven’t broken a record. Their comeback has taken over the music industry by storm. Fans have fallen in love with the songs and are simply on cloud nine after getting new music from their fav group almost 2 years later.
For those who may not be aware of it, Blackpink dropped their eagerly anticipated album, Born Pink on Sept 16 along with the music video for the title track, Shut Down. The excitement among BLINKs is reflected in the way that the album is performing.
One record after another, this YG Entertainment group is truly on a roll. Now the latest addition to their list of records comes with the sales. 
Today, on Sept 23, we got the latest update from the official charts. As per data shared by the Hanteo Chart, Born Pink has sold an impressive total of 1,542,950 copies in the first week of its release (September 16 to 22).
With this, they have now broken the record for highest first-week sales by any female artist in Hanteo history. Previously, the record was held by aespa’s album, Girls which was dropped earlier, this year where they sold 1,126,068 copies in Week 1. Now the title has been officially passed to Blackpink.
According to the data by Circle Chart, Born Pink also set a record for the biggest first-week sales of any female artist in history, with an even higher number of 2,141,281 copies sold, making it the first "double million-seller" album by a K-pop girl group. Circle Chart tracks shipments of stock sales made to retailers, in contrast to Hanteo, which is why their sales numbers frequently contradict.
Meanwhile, the group is all set to embark on their world tour titled, Born Pink, in October, this year.
