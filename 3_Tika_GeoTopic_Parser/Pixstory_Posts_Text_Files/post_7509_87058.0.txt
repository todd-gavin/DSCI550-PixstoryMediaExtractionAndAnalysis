A man who was denied entry to the Museum of Modern Art because his membership had been revoked jumped over the reception desk and stabbed two employees on Saturday afternoon, the police said.

The attack was captured by surveillance video from the museum on West 53rd Street that police released on Sunday along with photos of the suspect, Gary Cabana, 60, who was still being sought. The victims, a 24-year-old woman stabbed in the back and neck and a 24-year-old man stabbed in the left collar bone, were listed in stable condition at Bellevue Hospital, the police said.

The video shows the man barrel through a revolving door and climb across the wooden counter with a knife in his hand, cornering three people behind the desk. After stumbling into a wall, he begins jabbing and swinging the knife while the employees cower under the desk.

The video shows him grabbing one worker as the worker tried to run past him, then swinging the knife into the worker’s torso. The attacker then releases the worker. Another worker manages to run past the attacker as a man in a suit threw items at him.

Mr. Cabana’s last-known address was a supportive housing residence in Midtown operated by a nonprofit, Breaking Ground, offering shelter for the homeless, the mentally ill and those diagnosed with H.I.V./AIDS, the police said, and he had no prior arrests.

During a news conference after the incident, police officials said the letter revoking the suspect’s membership had gone out on Friday, but he appeared at the museum on Saturday, seeking to watch a film.

At a news conference outside the museum, John Miller, the deputy commissioner for the Police Department’s Intelligence and Counterterrorism Bureaus, said the membership had “expired as a result of two incidents involving disorderly conduct here at the museum on two separate dates in recent days.”
