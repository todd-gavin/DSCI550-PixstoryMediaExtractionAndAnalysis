Recently the Pentagon declassified and released video footage of a failed drone strike in Kabul that killed 10 civilians, including seven children, just before the US withdrew from the country. The New York Times first accessed the footage through a Freedom of Information Act against US Central Command, which was then posted publicly for the first time.

The videos, according to the Times, were footage from two MQ-19 Reaper drones, depicting the scene of the strike, just before a missile struck a courtyard killing 10 members of a family.

In November, the Pentagon, however, had acknowledged that it was a tragic error which mistook an aid worker for a terrorist. But the department later said it was an “honest mistake” and no personnel was held accountable for the error.   

After the publication of the Times report and the video, Congressional democrats urged President Biden to restructure counter-terrorism strategy, especially the use of drone strikes, that have a history of killing innocent civilians.

Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the US has significantly increased use of drones to track and target terrorists in the Middle East and Afghanistan. These devices are comparatively cheaper, can be despatched easily in unfamiliar terrains and can be controlled remotely. However, drone strikes are not always as precise as claimed and they often kill civilians in so -called “collateral damages”.    

In the past two years, drone strikes have become a regular affair in West Asia where these are deployed by both terrorists and counter-terrorist organisations. But their rampant use raises ethical concerns as they often kill innocents, either due to inaccurate data or because of civilians' presence in close proximity of the intended targets.
