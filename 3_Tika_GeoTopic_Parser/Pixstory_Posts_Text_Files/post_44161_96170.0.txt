On the all-time list, the experienced Spain international is currently just behind Xavi and Lionel Messi.

After being picked in the starting lineup for Barcelona's La Liga match against Real Sociedad on Thursday, Sergio Busquets moved up to third in the club's all-time appearance record.

After making his 675th appearance for the Blaugrana at Anoeta Stadium, the 33-year-old went ahead of Andres Iniesta.

Only current Barcelona manager Xavi and superstar Lionel Messi are now ahead of Busquets on the all-time list.

Busquets has spent his whole career with Barcelona, making his debut against Racing 
Santander at the age of 20 in 2008.

He went on to be a stalwart in the heart of Barca's midfield for more than a decade, including the treble-winning teams of 2009 and 2014, to cement his place in the club's history.

For the club, he has won 30 domestic trophies, including eight La Liga crowns and three 
Champions League victories. He also has 133 caps for Spain, including World Cup and 
European Championship victories in 2010 and 2012.

Busquets became club captain in August 2021, following Messi's transfer to PSG, and he is one 
of just four players in the club's history to reach 600 appearances, along with Messi, Xavi, and 
Iniesta.

He still has a long way to go if he hopes to overtake Messi on the all-time appearance record, with 104 games required.
