Elsa Pataky has flaunted her incredible figure in a tiny bikini while holidaying with husband Chris Hemsworth and their family.

The Spanish model and actor showed off her toned derrière in the G-string swimsuit in a series of snaps on Instagram, lapping up the sunshine alongside Hemsworth and their three children: daughter India Rose, 9, and twin boys Sasha and Tristan, 8.

“Such an amazing holidays. I feel so grateful!” the 45-year-old captioned the photos.

Another shot showed her cuddled up alongside Hemsworth – her husband of 12 years – as they enjoyed a sunset together on the beach, and with her lookalike daughter on a boat.

Pataky, who released her book Strong: How to Eat, Move and Live with Strength and Vitality in November 2019, has frequently spoken about how she keeps in shape, telling Body+Soul in a 2020 interview that “if I’m not exercising, I don’t feel strong. I feel soft and I don’t like it”.

“I am a very active person. I want my body to stay young – in strength and energy,” she said.

“I want to still go horseriding with my daughter when I’m 80!”

The mum-of-three said her obsession with fitness was piqued when watching the Olympics as a teenager in Spain.

“I was in awe of the fit, athletic body and my whole life became about exercise. I’ve never stopped since I was 14. I just fell in love with being healthy and fit,” she recalled.

She’s also previously spoken about her and Hemsworth motivating each other to stay on track, writing in her book that she “loves” training with him.

It’s been a rocky start to the year for the family, though, with Pataky and their three children stranded (albeit in their $30 million mansion) in March due to the wild weather in Byron Bay.
