 Introduction Diabetes mellitus DM has considered as one of the most common metabolic disorders affecting people with high mortality worldwide Based on the American Diabetes Association ADA diabetes can be classified into four different types including type diabetes type diabetes gestational diabetes mellitus GDM and monogenic diabetes syndromes Based on different studies on the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the progression of diabetes we found findings that led to the study of the worrying role of miRNAs in regulating the function of the immune system associated with different types of diabetes Dysfunction of cells in the pancreatic islet could be a common point involved in progressing diabetic diseases Islet related inflammation and autoimmunity act as factors that exacerbate the progression of various types of diabetes The relationship between cells and immune system cells affects the cells function through various cellular and molecular processes Furthermore the most recent studies have suggested miRNAs as new biomarkers involved in developing diabetic disorders and their related complications miRNAs are single strands short nucleotides and small non coding RNAs modulating of protein coding genes expression These RNAs generate during various intracellular processes via recruiting specific RNase enzymes Drosha and Dicer into the nucleus and cytoplasm respectively and can exert their functions either separately or in collaboration miRNAs use several manners for regulating gene expression including effect on epigenetic factors extracellular vesicles EVs and posttranscriptional intracellular regulation that results in inhibition of translation or mRNA degradation Fig In this review we aim to focus on the involvement of the immune system in diabetic disorders and the regulation of their activities through miRNAs Sources
