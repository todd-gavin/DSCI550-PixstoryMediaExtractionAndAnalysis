Two years after the Delhi police said that political activist Umar Khalid—in jail without trial or bail for 547 days—was the mastermind behind the Delhi riots in February 2020, our study of eight months of bail hearings and chargesheets reveals that the prosecution’s case against Khalid stands on a handful of WhatsApp messages that he neither wrote nor were sent to him, two conspiracy meetings alleged by witnesses shown to be unreliable and other far-fetched connections and falsehoods that, expert said, barely pass muster as legal arguments.

After playing out like a bitterly contested trial spanning 17 hearings in eight months, the bail arguments for political activist Umar Khalid in the Delhi riots conspiracy case concluded at the same point from where they started: a speech he gave in the northeastern  Maharashtra town of Amravati on 17 February 2020, a week before communal violence erupted in India’s capital.

On 3 March 2022, the police and prosecution made another attempt to impugn the speech on which they have built a case that alleges 34-year-old Khalid, a PhD from Jawaharlal Nehru University, was the mastermind behind the riots that claimed 53 lives and left over 500 people injured, and chargesheeted him for terrorism, sedition and murder among other crimes. 

The prosecution did this by introducing a fresh allegation on the day his defence lawyer was closing his rebuttal arguments: that Khalid gave the speech in contravention of an order issued by the Amravati authorities, denying him permission to speak. 

This fresh allegation did little to address the questions that additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat had pointedly asked special public prosecutor Amit Prasad, a day earlier: what was wrong with the “content” of Khalid’s speech and why of the many students and activists who protested against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, did the Delhi police hold a few of them responsible for the rioting in northeast Delhi in February 2020.
