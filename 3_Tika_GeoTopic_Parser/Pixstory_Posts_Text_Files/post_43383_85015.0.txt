One of the most controversial topic in India- "Uniform Civil Code". 
Uniform Civil Code (UCC) is an ongoing debate in the indian constitution's mandate which if implemented removes any kind of injustice and will replace any scriptures or customs of all religions that threaten the lives or minds of people till date. In simple words, everyone will be treated equally having same kind of laws.

This was first introduced by Dr. B.R Ambedkar, but it was said that UCC is desirable for the moment it should remain voluntary. Thus, including it as Article 44 into the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP). 
As we know, DPSPs are asserted to be fundamental in governing the country but aren't enforceable by law, thus making UCC not enforceable by law. 

Article 44 of the Constitution says that "the state shall endeavour to secure for citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India."
By implementing it no political party or a leader would be bias regarding any religion or any caste and this will force them to nominate a good candidate. As a result it is impossible for them to implement it, as it will go against the Secular Fabric of India.

What are your opinions? Don't you want a country where every law is applied equally to every citizen?
