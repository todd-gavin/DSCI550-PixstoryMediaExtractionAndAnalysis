Paris Saint-Germain wants a central defender before the summer transfer window closes. The capital club has been in connection with Inter Milan defender Milan Škriniar; however, the French giants are also in on Leicester City’s Wesley Fofana.

Le Parisien reported on Monday that sporting advisor Luis Campos is keen on the French defender despite the profile being more expensive than pursuing Škriniar. Fofana is 21 years old and under contract until 2027, which explains the high price, but the PSG club chief feels this file is worth splurging. 

Les Parisiens aren’t the only club eyeing The Foxes’ marquee defender. Chelsea has already pushed to land the defender but had seen two offers, one for €75 million and another for €82 million, rejected.  

Whether it’s not wanting to sell Fofana to a Premier League rival or wanting more for the France international, who they don’t want to sell but will listen to suitable offers, what price that is, only Leicester City knows.

If €82 million isn’t enough, the former AS Saint-Etienne man could break the record for the most expensive defender. This title belongs to Harry Maguire, who joined Manchester United in 2019 for €89 million from Leicester City.
