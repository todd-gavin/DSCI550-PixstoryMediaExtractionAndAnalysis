Beauty lies in the eye of a beholder. We all have heard this phrase a little too much now, or maybe even read it a lot. However, how true is it? Beauty is subjective, isn't it? Different people have different ideas when it comes to calling someone 'beautiful'. Yet in our society, even today beauty is defined by an individual's skin colour, their figure or how sharp their jawlines are. And to add to this, with their shallow marketing gimmicks we have brands redefining beauty standards by asking a girl to apply skin whitening cream because she has a dark texture which again reinforces the roots of patriarchy in our society. I have never understood why my mother always asks me to wear jewellery pieces or always maintain my hair in a particular way or even do exercises that would change my body, only because this will help me to be more beautiful. But then why did our parents tell us that beauty comes from within and it's s not about the face, it's about your character? Why did they tell us that you are beautiful just the way you are when they are constantly asking us to do something that will probably fit us to the so-called accepted beauty standards of our society? Wearing jewellery pieces or doing something to your body is not wrong, and neither I am someone who could ask you to refrain from doing that, however, limiting the whole idea of beauty to it is a little ludicrous. 
After all it's time that we give each other real than skin-deep power.
