Hrithik Roshan recently delivered a terrific performance as Vedha in Vikram Vedha Now Hrithik took to his Instagram and shared a video of himself in which he can be seen cutting a black thread tied to his wrist The actor penned a note as he bid goodbye to his character Vedha Hrithik also revealed a secret pact he does during his film shoots and taking to his social media he shared a video in which he can be seen cutting a black thread tied to his wrist He wrote Time to let go I don t know exactly when I started doing this Or even why But I realized today that i v secretly done this for every character that terrified me Mostly it s a red mauli kabir wore that and sometimes it s a black thread Can t even remember when I started this Was it kaho na pyaar hai Or koi mil gaya or much later Wil have to go back and check my wrists or neck in those films cause it s never planned Vedha got it at dress rehearsals n became it Kabir got it at the War mahurat pooja and i made it a part of him He continued I think I do it cause it physically anchors the commitment I make to myself before I begin A secret pact between me and myself The ritual of cutting it is always confusing For vedha I tried once my shoot got over but couldn t then when my dub got over but again couldn t And then I finally did when the question I ask myself had a satisfactory answer Did I give this everything I had Can I do more it s a question that scares me drives me n keeps me searching for more Vedha has been a terrific journey Thru him I learnt to be At peace with my failings Unafraid and unapologetic I will always be grateful to my directors and writers Pushkar and Gayatri for creating this opportunity Thank you Vedha I let go With love and gratitude
