Stem cell based therapy is considered to be one of the most promising methods for treating muscular dystrophies. Stem cells are defined by certain features and, foremost, an ability for long-term self-renewal and the capacity to differentiate into multiple cell lineages. 

Stem cell based therapies for the treatment of DMD can proceed via two strategies. The first is autologous stem cell transfer involving cells from a patient with DMD that are genetically altered in vitro to restore dystrophin expression and are subsequently re-implanted.

The second is allogenic stem cell transfer, containing cells from an individual with functional dystrophin, which are transplanted into a dystrophic patient.

Skeletal muscle damaged by injury or by degenerative disease, such as muscular dystrophy, is able to regenerate new muscle fibers. Regeneration depends mainly on satellite cells (SCs), myogenic progenitors localized between the basal lamina and the muscle fiber membrane, but other cell types outside the basal lamina, such as pericytes, also have myogenic potency.

Because of the proprieties of SCs, there have been several clinical trials since the early 1980s involving the transplant of SCs by intramuscular injections of these cells into several locations of a single muscle or at most a few muscles.
