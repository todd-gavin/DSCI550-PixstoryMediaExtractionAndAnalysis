It is a well-accepted idea that a work validates itself when it is actually valued among people.
So if someone has done well enough in their field of work, there has to be a source of appreciation and applause, and this could be anything that justifies their hard work and dedication for most employees; they get a promotion and bonus for their phenomenal work.
Very likely, every field of work, art and artist needs acknowledgement and response, sometimes the response of the spectators and audience will suffice, but for one time in their life, they want to sit on the pedestal that satiates their desires and anticipation, most importantly their vision of success.
And for this, awards were created to value and acknowledge the work that made itself unique among others. To not let ignorance affect something that needed most of the attention.
The approval and gratitude received from some of the experienced connoisseurs make it all worth it.
Moreover, it motivates the person to put extra effort into reaching the heights of their work.
If we speak of the overall existence and creation of the awards system, there won't be a point opposing its relevance today and forever.
