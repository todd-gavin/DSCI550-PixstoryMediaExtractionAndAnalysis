The European Consortium for Scientific Drilling of the Ocean Seabed ECORD has chosen the OGS National Institute of Oceanography and Experimental Geophysics to coordinate the activities of its ESSAC Scientific Committee for the next three years ESSAC has in fact recently moved to the Trieste headquarters of the OGS to ensure planning activities coordination of the scientific and technological contribution and participation of ECORD in the activities of the International Ocean Discovery Program IODP The sea and ocean floors occupy three quarters of the total surface of the Earth and are the great frontier of knowledge of our planet explains Angelo Camerlenghi, OGS researcher and coordinator of the ESSAC office Since the 1960s, parallel to the development of space research, many countries have launched a scientific exploration program of the ocean floor which, under various names, Deep Sea Drilling Project Ocean Drilling Program Integrated Ocean Drilling Program gave birth to the largest and longest-running international scientific cooperation program in the field of Earth Sciences Studying the ocean floor of fundamental importance for various reasons The archive of climatic history is preserved in the sediments while volcanic rocks contain the history of the evolution of the Earth On the seabed moreover, the greatest geological hazard phenomena are originated explosion of submerged volcanoes large earthquakes submarine landslides that can cause tsunamis that hit the coasts But it is not just a question of geology because sediments and rocks of the ocean floor contain evidence of marine biodiversity and its evolution in relation to global changes as well as a largely unknown deep biosphere and represent extreme living environments of which we know very little today Currently, various scientific drilling infrastructures are active around the world hosting research technicians and students to study the secrets of the ocean floor From fifteen European countries and Canada have joined forces to participate in the program through the ECORD consortium which has, among others, the task of implementing drilling in sensitive environments that are not easily accessible from the platforms made available by the United States of America and Japan, such as polar waters and shallow ones at the edge of the oceans
