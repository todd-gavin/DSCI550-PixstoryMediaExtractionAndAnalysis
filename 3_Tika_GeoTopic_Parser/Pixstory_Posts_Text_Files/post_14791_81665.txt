They are called CAR killers and they are cells that the researchers of the Car T project of the Alliance Against Cancer, the National Oncological Network of the Ministry of Health chaired by Prof. Ruggero De Maria are developing and directing towards innovative targets in solid tumors. This ambitious portion of the project coordinated by prof Franco Locatelli part of the largest research program financed by the Parliament with ten million euros We are talking about new CAR chimeric antigenic receptors explains Concetta Quintarelli coordinator of the ACC Immunology Working Group and head of Gene Therapy of Tumors at Bambino Ges of Rome IRCCS associated with the Network where the WG capable of controlling lung cancer, pancreas, colon and brain tumors is based. In this direction, numerous projects have been developed in the ACC that involve the other WGs of the Network. The preclinical stage of research. New vectors for gene therapy have been developed, the efficacy of which is tested both on cell cultures and in animal models. Only at the end of a high and meticulous preclinical characterization and after having developed material for gene therapy having characteristics compatible with the release for human use the researcher still specifies, it will be possible to move on to clinical studies
