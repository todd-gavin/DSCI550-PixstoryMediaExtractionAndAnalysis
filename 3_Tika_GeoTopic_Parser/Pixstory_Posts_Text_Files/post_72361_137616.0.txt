Teachers are integral to one’s formative years, having left an impression which you may realise years later.

Bollywood has paid its due to the evergreen character of the ‘teacher’ figure in more ways than one. Somewhere, some time in our lives we have all met teachers who remind us of the gorgeous Ms. Chandni from ‘Main Hoon Na’, or the fearsome Dr. Asthana from ‘Munnabhai M.B.B.S’.

1. Jitendra in Parichay
Jitendra in the film Parichay was repeatedly warned of five mischievous children in the same household who drove every teacher away with their antics.

5. Rani Mukerji in Hichki
Rani Mukerji in Hichki was a path-breaking new character, who handled a rowdy bunch of students even though she suffered from a nervous disorder called the Tourette’s syndrome. 

6. Rishi Kapoor in Do Dooni Chaar
His journey articulated the struggles of every teacher in the field, trying to arouse his pupils interest in the subject in spite of their aversion to the same.

7. Shah Rukh Khan in Mohabbatein

8. Boman Irani in Munnabhai MBBS & 3 Idiots
Both professors made us laugh, made us shake with fear, sometimes angry as well. Their methods and ways of achieving discipline were far from ideal
