Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor have finally started the promotions of their upcoming film, Brahmastra. The couple made a joint appearance after a long time as they joined Brahmastra director Ayan Mukerji for the launch of a song preview. 

Alia, who has been regularly spotted in loose attires during the promotions of her just released film Darlings, stepped out in a short brown dress, highlighting her baby bump for the first time. She paired it with two-tone heels. Ranbir Kapoor joined her in black casuals. The two posed for some adorable couple pictures as the paparazzi clicked them after a long time.
