In the County Championship England s new Test captain Ben Stokes was bowled out by an Australian paceman but it wasn t the bowler you d think After taking a terrible ball from none other than Marnus Labuschagne who was bowling medium pace in the first class match on Thursday the Durham all rounder was left reeling on the ground in agony When Stokes tried to pull a short delivery from Labuschagne through square leg in the th over the left hander instead edged the Duke ball into the midriff The year old immediately collapsed to the deck and dropped his bat moving his legs around to deal with the after effects of the painful blow Labuschagne offered a sheepish apology before Stokes gingerly returned to his feet a few seconds later However Stokes got his payback by brutishly smacking two sixes off Labuschagne s leg spin later that day
