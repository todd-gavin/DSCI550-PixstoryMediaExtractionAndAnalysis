Sassuolo midfielder Davide Frattesi gave an interview to DAZN talking about many topics The season goes well also thanks to the coach At the beginning of the year I wanted to leave then we found the right team Things are going well but we always hope they can get better Furthermore he also talked about his relationship with Gianluca Scamacca striker of the neroverdi and his roommate We always eat pasta with pesto The sauce makes the pasta dirty in a sad white and then all that remains is the pesto We have huge jars at home We eat it with Scamacca at least dinners on Il mister non lo you know but I think it&#39;s ok We arrived at Lazio together then at Roma then he went to PSV and we ended up at Sassuolo We always go in the same direction we are very similar in character I have never argued with each other in years The best midfielder in Italy Barella Him really the number in his role However good he has to score more goals he scores many assists but he could score more I would like to steal his intensity and assists he runs from first to ninetieth certainly the strongest I don&#39;t know how to manage myself yet I&#39;m working on it Photo credits Dazn
