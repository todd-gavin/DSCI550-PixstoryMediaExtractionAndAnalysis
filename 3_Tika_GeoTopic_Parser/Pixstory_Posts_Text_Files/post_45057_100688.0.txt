Karim Benzema has explained why he took a Panenka penalty against Manchester City in the
Champions League semi-final first leg at the Etihad Stadium last month.

The Frenchman scored a superb penalty to give the hosts a 4-3 victory - and ensuring that Madrid were close enough to need extra-time a week later in a dramatic second leg that saw
them advance to the final against Liverpool.

On that occasion, Benzema scored the game-winning penalty, but it was his finish in
Manchester that got everyone talking - and now he's confessed that it was a move he'd been
waiting to do in a big game.

"I was trying for a long time [to do this]," the forward said in an interview with UEFA. "I was
waiting for the right moment, in a match like this with a lot of pressure. In a way, the pressure is
gone, [or] it's good pressure, it's a kind of pressure that allows you to do this kind of thing.

"It was my opinion, I don't know about the others. I put the ball down and I knew that I was going
to do it. I thought of nothing else, I only thought of doing it."

Ronaldo scored 450 goals in 438 games in all competitions during his nine years in Madrid,
helping the Blancos win two La Liga titles and four Champions League wins. Benzema scored
192 goals in 412 appearances during the same period, having also been signed in a sensational
summer transfer window in 2009.

The French striker did cross the 20-goal barrier six times in a row, with a high of 32 in 2011-12,
but he was always overshadowed by Ronaldo, who only went below 40 goals once during his
tenure with Real, scoring 61 in 2014-15.
