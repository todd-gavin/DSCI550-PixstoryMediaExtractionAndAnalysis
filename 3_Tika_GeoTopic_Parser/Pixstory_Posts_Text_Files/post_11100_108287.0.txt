In India, a girl’s identity revolves around her marriage. As children, most of the girls are raised to understand that they must end up with the right partner, and must go to a nice family as a daughter-in-law. Does our society realize how draining it must be for single women to answer the unending questions about ‘getting settled’ that comes their way? To have to deal with the taunts, shaming, criticism for just being unmarried? Why our society is so intimidated by the idea of an independent unmarried woman? If given a choice most women and even men would rather not marry until they feel absolutely sure.
