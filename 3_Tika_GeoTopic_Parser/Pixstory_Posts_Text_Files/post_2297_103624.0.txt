The BJP has not named union minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi as its Rajya Sabha candidate. 

Naqvi's name was missing in the second list of four candidates, bringing curtains to his another term in the Upper House of Parliament. 

With this, there are two likely vacancies in the Union Cabinet. Earlier, the Janata Dal (United) and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar denied a ticket to union minister and his one-time close confidant RCP Singh. 

Singh was virtually the number two in the JD(U).

Both Naqvi and Singh will have to resign from the Union Council of Ministers. 

Political observers wondered if Naqvi could be the BJP's vice-presidential candidate as the term of incumbent M Venkaiah Naidu is going to expire soon. 

The Presidential elections are also scheduled for July and the BJP has already initiated the process to look for incumbent Ram Nath Kovind's replacement. 

In the first list of 18 candidates released on Sunday, the BJP dropped veteran OP Mathur,  general secretary Dushyant Gautam, and Vinay Sahastrabuddhe. 

The party's chief whip in the Rajya Sabha and former union minister, Shiv Pratap Shukla, is also excluded.

Sanjay Seth, who switched to the Samajwadi Party before the UP election, and BJP national spokesperson Syed Zafar Islam have also been dropped.

Islam was instrumental in the induction of former Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia in the BJP.
