Toronto finally got to see Rage Against The Machine play live after an year hiatus The group known for its rebel music was originally supposed to do its reunion tour in and had even announced the dates however the Coronavirus pandemic had other plans All of the band members are known for being very politically vocal and that s what increases the longevity of their lyrics in a way too Fun fact the song Killing In The Name which is against police brutality and racism is one of the songs most used by the far right and Back The Blue supporters All because of the line F k you I won t do what you tell me at the end that is repeated as a chant Some people aren t known for their ability to recognise irony If you ever get the opportunity to see them live do grab it and see their energy for yourself
