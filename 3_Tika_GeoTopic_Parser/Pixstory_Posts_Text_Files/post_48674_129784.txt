Misogynists have no place on public platforms period This includes social media online forums and any other type of platform where people can share their opinions They are contributing to a rise in crime rates against women because they are providing a platform for haters to vent their frustrations and spread hate It is not freedom of speech and it does not deserve to be tolerated This often leads to hateful rhetoric and violence against women which is especially harmful for young boys who are impressionable and can easily be influenced by such hatred Additionally misogynists hamper progress towards gender equality by creating an environment of intimidation and fear One very recent example is obviously Andrew Tate The amount of men and especially young boys who look up to Andrew Tate is genuinely terrifying for all women There s a literal video evidence going around of him beating a woman with a belt and men are still up there defending him and making him their role model What does it say about them Are they indifferent to violence against women or are they attracted to it Because sure as hell they re not against it Therefore it s important that we do everything we can to remove them from public platforms where they have a lot of influence over the masses We need to send a strong message that this kind of behavior is not tolerated and that anyone who participates in it will face consequences Men like Andrew Tate deserve the worst
