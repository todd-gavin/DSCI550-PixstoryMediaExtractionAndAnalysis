Six games into the current season, Odegaard has already scored three goals and is on track to have an even better season than the last. These stats are even more impressive when you take a wider look at the Arsenal squad. There are several players who play higher up on the pitch than Odegaard such as Gabriel Jesus, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli. It's clear that Odegaard isn't expected to be the main player contributing to Arsenal's goals, yet the skipper still contributes often. 
"I think we see football the same way, I understand a lot of the things he wants me to do so it's a natural thing. We have a good connection though and I try to do the best for the team so you have to ask," said Odegaard in an interview after being named as the Arsenal captain. 
“I feel really at home. I moved around a bit too much and it was maybe not the best thing but I learned a lot for it," Odegaard said.
“I went to Madrid very young – but, of course, it’s hard to play there so I had to go elsewhere, I think I changed club three or four times. It was not the best situation for me, I wanted to get stability but I’ve found that here and I’m really happy and feel at home. Even before the loan spell, I always liked Arsenal, the way they played, the way they wanted to do things so it’s always been a club I could see myself playing."
