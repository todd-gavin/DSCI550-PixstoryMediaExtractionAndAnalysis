A video shot during the nomination of a Mukhiya candidate Shakir Hussain in Dokidih panchayat of Giridih district in Jharkhand is viral on social media. It is being claimed that slogans of ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ were raised in the nomination rally. Several mainstream media channels and news outlets carried the video with this claim. After the video went viral, an FIR was lodged against Shakir Hussain and others under several sections of the Indian Penal Code, including but not limited to Section 124A (sedition) and Section 153A (disturbing public peace). The Jharkhand police have arrested the chief candidate and three of his supporters.

In a video report, News18 Bihar Jharkhand claimed that slogans of ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ were raised in the nomination procession for Dokidih mukhiya candidate ‘Shafiq Haider’ who did not stop his supporters. News18 accused the Indian Reserve Battalion (IRB) force of Gandey police station of inaction. News18 Jharkhand claimed the same from the channel’s Twitter handle.

Fact-check
Alt News contacted local residents of Dokidih to investigate the viral video. We were told that ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogans were not raised during the procession. Apart from the viral videos, we found several other videos taken from different angles.

We watched one of these videos in slow-motion at 0.75x speech and found that the chants made during the nomination procession were “Shakir Hussain Zindabad, Shakir Hussain Zindabad, Dokidih Panchayat ka mukhiya kaisa ho – Shakir Hussain jaisa ho”.

We request readers to use earphones while listening to the video below.
