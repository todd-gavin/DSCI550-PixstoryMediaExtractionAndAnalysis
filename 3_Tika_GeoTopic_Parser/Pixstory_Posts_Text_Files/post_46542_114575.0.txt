Imagine - it’s becoming gray and rainy outside , I’ve whipped up the perfect solution to brighten up your house – with this Homemade Caramel Coconut Oatmeal . A bowl filled with cream coconut oats , topped with peanuts and banana and a pool of silky smooth healthyish caramel syrup ! 🤤🥣❤️

Yesterday I made coconut caramel with oats for the first time . Lemme tell you how to make Syrup Firstly ! Here is what I did ; 🥣❤️

🌴 200ml coconut milk
🌴 30g brown sugar ( can use more if you have a sweet tooth )

Mix together and bring to a boil . Afterwards let it simmer until it thickens ( me : 30 minutes ) .
Before pouring it into a jar , I added vanilla powder . You could also use vanilla extract or salt for a salty caramel . 🤤🥣

Let it cool down completely before using it . ❤️

Well this is all about Syrup ! And how to add oats ??  Lemme tell you ; 🥣

1 I like to begin with cooking oats . Add water in the pan and Simply add in all the oats in pan and bring it to a boil . Stir the oats and turn down the oatmeal to low heat and stir gently . Let the oats cook away for 3 minutes . 

2 While stirring the oats see if you need to add additional water . Otherwise the oats will stick to the bottom of the pan ! 

3 At this point the oats should be done . Pour the oats into a bowl , and pour the caramel syrup , sprinkle a generous amount of unsweetened shredded coconut , banana and peanuts ! 

Trust me , This caramel coconut Oatmeal is soo much tasty and creamy and Healthy ! I loved it alot ! Perfect for Breakfast and Evening time and dinner too ! This Oatmeal took my heart away ! ❤️🥣
