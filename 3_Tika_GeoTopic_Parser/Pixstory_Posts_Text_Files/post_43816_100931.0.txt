On his comeback to Newcastle United's starting XI at St. James Park on Tuesday, Callum
Wilson was left with a tooth hanging out after a nasty injury. The striker was instrumental in Newcastle's 2-0 victory over Arsenal.

Arsenal's chances of qualifying for the UEFA Champions League were severely harmed by the
victory. Wilson was seen on live television in the 27th minute undergoing care on the sidelines,
with his gums bleeding and a front tooth dislodged. Despite his injury, the Englishman soon
returned to the pitch.

Wilson's injury was not recorded on camera, and it was also his first start since suffering a calf
ailment that kept him out of cheval since January.

Here are some of the photographs that fans shared on social media of Wilson's tooth injury:

Meanwhile, Wilson responded to his tooth injury and the win on Twitter:

He wrote, "How it started vs How it ended.... I'd lose a tooth every week for nights like that What
an atmosphere and what a performance from everyone with 3pts to go with it!!"

Arsenal is currently fifth in the Premier League table, with 66 points from 37 games.

Tottenham
currently holds the final UCL spot, having accumulated 68 points in 37 games.Both teams have
one more game to play.

Newcastle, meanwhile, is 12th in the table with 46 points from 37
games.

Arsenal's defeat also ensured Chelsea's place in the Champions League next season. Ben White's own goal and Bruno Guimaraes' late strike separated the teams. The manner in which
Newcastle performed was even more impressive, as Eddie Howe's men sent a message that
they could compete for a top-four finish next season.
