e e cummings prefered to write his name in lower cases He wrote approximately poems two autobiographical novels four plays and several essays He is a proponent of modernist free form poems Most of his work has idiosyncratic syntax and lower case spellings Even though he was proclaimed as a rebel to conventions he was tied to conventions Many of his poems are sonnets albeit often with a modern twist Cummings s poetry often deals with topics of love and nature as well as the relationship of the individual to the masses and the world His poems are also often rife with satire The reason he uses structure in this fashion is to give the reader insight into what the character in the poem is feeling He even adds visual effects to his poems The norm for poetry is not to have such odd structure it s to have in importance every line a complete thought and a comma at the end of each line Cummings breaks through this and does not allow regulation poetry to be his norm Very few topics of his poems are honest but there is innocence in how they are written because of his structure Cummings truly uses this structure to his advantage by giving the reader so much more than the ordinary
