The unwanted return of significant price increases has changed the political landscape, with serious implications for Biden's programme. The American people today believe that inflation is the most pressing issue confronting the economy and the country, and that President Biden is ignoring it. This explains why so many Americans are dissatisfied with his economic performance, which is jeopardising his administration.

Brooking reported that most Americans are too young to remember the inflationary boom of the 1970s and early 1980s, which is why the return of inflation has been so surprising. Many economists were also caught off guard. They contended for a year after prices began to rise that this stage of the economic recovery would be "transitory"—until last week, when the annual rate of inflation was announced to have reached 7.5 percent. The revelation was the final nail in the coffin for this awful term, confirming the predictions of dissident economists like Larry Summers and Jason Furman that inflation would remain. The Biden administration maintained a public confidence about inflation until recent events made that optimism unsustainable.

According to a recent CBS/YouGov poll, 58 percent of Americans believe Biden isn't focused enough on the economy, and even more—65 percent—that he isn't focusing enough on inflation. Only 33% believe Biden and the Democrats are focusing on the topics that matter most to them. According to a CNN study, seven out of ten Americans believe the government isn't doing enough to decrease inflation and supply-chain disruptions. In light of this, it's hardly surprise that only 38% of Americans approve of the president's handling of the economy, and even fewer (30%) approve of his handling of inflation.
