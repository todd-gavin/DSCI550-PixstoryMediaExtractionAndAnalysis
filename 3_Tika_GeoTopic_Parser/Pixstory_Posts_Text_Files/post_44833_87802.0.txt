The race for Champions League triumph in 2021-22 is well and truly on, with only eight teams remaining in contention by the quarter-final stage.
There have been some noteworthy losses along the way, with Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund both failing to progress from their respective groups, and more hopes have been dashed in the last 16.
All of those still chasing a coveted European trophy are hoping to repeat Chelsea's feats from a year ago, when the Blues beat Manchester City in Porto, but when will the next set of fixtures be announced? All of the information you need is right here on GOAL!
The draw for the Champions League quarter-finals will take place at the House of European Football in Nyon, Switzerland on Friday, March 18 at 11 a.m. GMT/6 a.m. ET.
Along with a draw for the last eight, teams will also learn their semi-final paths, making this the last draw for the 2021-22 season.
At this point, the draw is completely open, with no constraints on which teams can be placed against one another.
The first legs of this season's Champions League quarter-finals will take place on April 5/6, with April 12/13 as the return dates.
The semi-finals will be held on April 26/27 and May 3/4, with the final scheduled for May 28 at the Stade de France in Paris, following the decision to remove the Gazprom Arena in St Petersburg from hosting rights.
Big-spending Real Madrid eliminated Paris Saint-Germain, Atletico Madrid eliminated Manchester United, reigning champions Chelsea defeated Ligue 1 championship holders Lille, and Liverpool defeated Serie A champions Inter.
