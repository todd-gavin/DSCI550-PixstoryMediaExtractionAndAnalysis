Satyendar Jain, the Delhi health minister, was arrested on Monday evening, according to top sources, for allegedly'misleading the inquiry and transferring the proceeds of crime,' a major offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

On Tuesday, the minister is set to appear in front of a designated court.
Jain was the subject of a money laundering probe after being charged under the PMLA, and properties linked to him and his family worth Rs 5 crore were attached on April 5 this year.

The BJP has jailed Jain to prevent him from going to Himachal (for campaigning) because the saffron party knows it is losing in the hill state, according to Delhi's deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia. "The ED has been examining this 'fake' case for eight years and has found nothing against him," Sisodia remarked (Jain).

"ED had stopped even calling him for probe for many years because there was nothing found against him," Sisodia said. They've resumed now that Jain is the AAP's election in-charge of Himachal, he noted.

According to the ED, the Delhi health minister has been accused of laundering black money through Kolkata-based shell businesses. The agency named Akinchan Developers Pvt Ltd, Indo Metal Impex Pvt Ltd, Paryas Infosolutions Pvt Ltd, Manglayatan Projects Pvt Ltd, J.J. Ideal Estate Pvt Ltd, and his close family members Swati Jain, Sushila Jain, and Indu Jain as co-accused in the case under PMLA in its attachment order dated April 5.

"During 2015-16, when Satyendar Kumar Jain was a public servant, the above-mentioned companies beneficially owned and controlled by him received accommodation entries worth Rs 4.81 crore from shell companies in exchange for cash transferred to Kolkata-based entry operators through the hawala route," the ED said in its attachment.
