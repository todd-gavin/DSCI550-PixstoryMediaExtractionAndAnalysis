The US LGBTQ+ wage gap is widening: for every dollar, LGBTQ+ workers are earning 90 cents, with the gap widening disproportionately for people of color, trans and non-binary folks, according to data released yesterday by the Human Rights Campaign.

The report released yesterday, analyzed the median weekly wages of nearly 7,000 full-time LGBTQ+ workers, comparing them to the median weekly wages of others.

For every dollar, women who are trans earn about 60 cents; men who are trans, and non-binary, genderqueer, genderfluid and two-spirit folks earned about 70 cents; Latinx LGBTQ+ women earn about 72 cents; Black women earn about 85 cents.

“Despite decades of work to achieve equal pay for equal work, LGBTQ+ workers continue to earn less than their heterosexual and cisgender peers and discrimination throughout the workforce—in hiring, salaries, and promotions—is likely playing a large role,” Jay Brown, HRC Senior Vice President of Programs, Research and Training said in a statement.

The racial disparities of the broader workforce are replicated, with people of color being paid less than white people: for every dollar, white LGBTQ+ workers earn 97 cents; Native American LGBTQ+ workers earn 70 cents; Black LGBTQ+ workers earn 80 cents; Latinx LGBTQ+ workers earn 90 cents.

“It is possible that wage disparities may be even larger than what is reported here because our analyses focused just on full-time employed workers, and did not account for wages among part-time workers, or non-wage earners. Earning less impacts every facet of our lives - including access to housing, healthcare and food security—and must be addressed head on," Brown said. 

“While Asian/Asian Pacific Islander LGBTQ+ workers earned approximately the same as a typical worker in the United States, this represents a wage gap in and of itself: Among all workers in the United States, Asian/Asian Pacific Islander workers reported higher median weekly wages than the typical worker, though there is some nuance to this finding,” HRC reports.
