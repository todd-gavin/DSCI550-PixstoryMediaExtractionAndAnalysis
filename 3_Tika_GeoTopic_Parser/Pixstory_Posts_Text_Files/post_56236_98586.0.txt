‌Relations between UK and Japan are growing stronger with the new defence deal. According to Boris Johnson, the deal will allow their national forces to work more closely together.

The two nations have agreed two nations have conceded a reciprocal access agreement (RAA) for armed services. Amidst the war seems like Europe and Asia are becoming allies and supporting each other.

This was the first official visit of Mr Fumio Kishida at the invitation of the Government and was marked with a guard of honour and an RAF flypast over Horse Guards Parade in central London. Mr Kishida was then invited in Japanese by the captain of the Nijmegen Company, Grenadier Guards, to examine the troops. Then, Mr Johnson and Mr Kishida steered to Downing Street where the British leader announced that a military treaty has been struck.

The Prime Minister said the world has observed the “strong stance” the Japanese government has taken “against the Russian aggression in Ukraine”. He added, "We in the UK recognise that our security in Europe is indivisible from the security, our collective security, in the Asia-Pacific, in the Indo-Pacific region."


No 10 said the “landmark” RAA will allow the two countries’ armies to deploy together for training, joint exercises and disaster relief.

Downing Street said the agreement will boost the UK’s commitment to the Indo-Pacific and further safeguard global peace and security, and build on the already close alliance on defence and security technology between both nations.

Me Kishida further told the Prime Minister he looks forward to a “very fruitful discussion” on the London-Tokyo bilateral relationship, as well as on Ukraine and global affairs.
