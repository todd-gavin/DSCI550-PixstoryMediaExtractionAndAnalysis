Steam wasn t really an actual band it was just a couple of guys who recorded a few songs for Mercury in Mercury was enamoured with the songs and wanted to record them all as hit singles However singles require B sides As a result Steam produced a fresh rendition of an old song they had on hand They recorded it in one session but it was too short so a chorus was added They couldn t think of anything for the chorus so they just sang na na na na na na hey hey hey That B side a reworking of an old throwaway tune became a tremendous runaway number one success for a band that didn t exist in the first place In December Steam s Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye stayed at number one for two weeks And it s still heard every week in sports stadiums around the world most typically from the fans of the winning side as the game nears its conclusion Nobody has ever heard of those fantastic A sides If you asked most people who Steam was they would have no idea they suddenly vanished This song on the other hand is timeless
