At the age of 76, David Moores, a former owner and chairman of Liverpool, passed away. Moores held the position of chairman of Liverpool from 1991 to 2007, and after relinquishing his controlling ownership of the team in that year, he was appointed honorary life president.

During his 16-year reign, Liverpool won 10 significant trophies, including the Champions League in 2005. Only a few weeks had elapsed since the passing of Moores' beloved wife of 39 years, Marge. The Moores family held a dominating ownership position at Liverpool for more than 50 years until David took over at Anfield in September 1991.

He handled the selection of Roy Evans, Gerard Houllier, and Rafael Benitez as Liverpool's managers during his tenure at the club, working alongside chief executive Rick Parry to oversee the club's 1992 admission into the newly established Premier League.

However, in 2007 Moores sold his majority stake to Tom Hicks and George Gillett in order to attract outside capital to assist develop a new field.

It was a decision that rapidly backfired, with the Americans being ousted in a contentious boardroom battle amid strong fan opposition and the bank RBS calling in a loan for $237 million, which led to a sale to New England Sports Ventures (who subsequently became current owners Fenway Sports Group). In December 2019, Moores visited Anfield for the first time in ten years to watch Jurgen Klopp's team defeat Everton 5-2.

Kenny Dalglish, a former player and manager, claimed on Twitter that Moores was a devoted Liverpool supporter whose dream came true when he was named chairman and that he done a wonderful amount for the team. We extend our sympathies to his family. All who knew Moores will sadly miss him.
