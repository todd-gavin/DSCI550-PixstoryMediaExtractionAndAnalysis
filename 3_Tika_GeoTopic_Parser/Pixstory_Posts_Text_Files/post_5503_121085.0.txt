Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan, two American detainees in Russia, have been proposed as a swap for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, also known as the "merchant of death." Viktor Bout is now serving a sentence of 25 years in federal prison for breaking numerous federal statutes pertaining to conspiracies to murder Americans and provide very lethal and sophisticated weaponry to foreign adversaries.

This is a horrible transaction for two reasons. Paul Whelan has been imprisoned in Russia for three years, and even during periods of relative peace, he has never been offered such an advantageous bargain. And second, t he fact that another American, schoolteacher Marc Fogel, was imprisoned in Russia last year for carrying medicinal marijuana - a charge similar to Griner - was not mentioned in the arrangement.

This is highly remarkable given that Bout has a long history of igniting conflicts with his ability to purchase sophisticated weaponry and supply it to countries, and the three American inmates in Russia have little to no political importance other than their nationality.

Russia has been striving to acquire Bout for many years, and not only does it seem that they will succeed, but it also appears that they will do so at a bargain.
