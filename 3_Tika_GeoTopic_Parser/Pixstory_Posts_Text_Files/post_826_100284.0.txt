The former Australian allrounder who played in 26 Tests and 198 ODIs in an international career spanning from 1998 through 2009, has died in a car accident in Queensland.

Symonds was a two-time World Cup winner during both of Australia's undefeated title runs in 2003 and 2007 as well as a key member of the Test side in the mid-2000s. His death is the third one of an Australian cricketer in 2022, following the passing of Shane Warne and Rodney Marsh in the first week of March.

"Australian cricket has lost another of its very best," Cricket Australia chairman Lachlan Henderson said. "Andrew was a generational talent who was instrumental in Australia's success at World Cups and as part of Queensland's rich cricket history.

"He was a cult figure to many who was treasured by his fans and friends. On behalf of Australian cricket our deepest sympathies are with Andrew's family, team-mates, and friends."

Symonds was the ultimate allrounder - a fearsome striker of a cricket, a bowler capable of brisk medium pace and offspin plus one of the greatest fielders in the game.
