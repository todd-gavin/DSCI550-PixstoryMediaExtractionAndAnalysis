While autotune is sometimes criticized for making music sound artificial, studies have shown that it actually makes it easier for singers to sing accurately in tune. This is because autotune helps them get rid of any unwanted vibrato or pitch variation, which can make their voicesound amateurish and unprofessional. In fact, many singers swear by autotune as the key to sounding perfect on stage!

It gives their music more consistency and avoids any jarring sounds. On top of that, autotune can help them to avoid sounding too high or too low in pitch, which can make their voice sound unnatural.

Come on now, not all technology is bad.
