You and I 
under the same sky 
willing to fly high 
You and I 
Want to complete the story 
So to win us the glory 
You and I 
Facing the gloomy situation 
Like solving a mathematical equation 
You and I 
Waiting for the feeling 
When the pain will be healing 
You and I 
Want to pause 
But afraid of the wounds it can cause 
You and I 
Won't pounce in the dreamy well 
But it's door bell is pulling us very well
You and I 
Shall leave through this sore span 
And be happy again
