Australia’s oldest man has celebrated his 110th birthday.

Born in 1912, Frank Mawer turned 110 on August 15 and is officially the country’s oldest person.

Mr Mawer, who lives with his family on the NSW south coast, spent his birthday weekend with family and friends, both in person and over Zoom.

His son Phillip was asked about his father’s secret to living a long life on 2GB radio

“That’s a hard one,” he said.

“He has his own ideas, but he’s getting a lot of support.”

Frank had reluctantly agreed to leave his home in Gymea to live with family in Tilba, but his son says he is going strong now.

Frank has lived through two pandemics, losing his brother to the Spanish flu.

He was married for 70 years before losing his beloved wife to breast cancer in 2012.

The Australian record holder has six children, 13 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren.

The previous record holder, Dexter Kruger, died at the age of 111 in May last year.
