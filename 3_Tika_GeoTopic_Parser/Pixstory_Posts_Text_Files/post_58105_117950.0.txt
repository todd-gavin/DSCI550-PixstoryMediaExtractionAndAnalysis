Victorian era truly was an era of change ,it allowed women to participate in variety of activities such as horseback riding, tennis, cycling . Which they were tradionally were not allowed to do , but with it came another problem of clothing. Dresses worn  during that time would not be ideal for these activities, so a new type of skirt was created . 

A bifurcated skirt which took inspiration from culottes . These skirts were divided in the middle to allow ease and comfort while riding bicycle and horse riding. But they created an illusion of wearing a skirt . Especially in horse back riding , women could straddle a horse instead of side straddle. Since they looked like skirts it did not get much social backlash.

However, it was Elsa Schiaparelli who would make the bold move of creating culottes that made no attempt to hide what they really were: pants for women.Though the Press at that time tore down her designs and insulted her idea , calling it manly with hints of lesbianism .
But it is no doubt that their popularity has continued to grow . It is part of many school uniforms as well as daily wear of women and girls today . It is practical as well as stylish.
