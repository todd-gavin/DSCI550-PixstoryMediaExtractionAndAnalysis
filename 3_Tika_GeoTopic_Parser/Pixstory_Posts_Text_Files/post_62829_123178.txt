With all the violence that is happening against children lately I think safety becomes their top most priority Children are being bullied in schools for everything For their height color ethnicity gender sexuality you name it And in circumstances like that it becomes necessary to let them have something to call for help immediately Phones give a sense of protection to children It s unfair to take that away from them Not to mention a lot of students are not as fast as other students and are often left behind in class In a situation like that phones come pretty handy Maybe to click pictures of the board or to help with a certain equation I don t think there should be such a debate on whether something that can possibly get them out of s scary situation be legal or not
