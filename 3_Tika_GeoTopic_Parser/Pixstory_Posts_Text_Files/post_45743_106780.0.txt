Astra launched two shoebox-sized NASA satellites from Cape Canaveral on Sunday in a modest mission to enhance hurricane forecasts, but the second stage of the company's low-cost launcher failed before reaching orbit, and the payloads were lost. 

â€œThe upper stage shut down early and we did not deliver the payloads to orbit," Astra tweeted. "We have shared our regrets with NASA and the payload team. More information will be provided after we complete a full data analysis."

CBS reported that it was the company's fifth failure and the seventh launch of Astra's tiny "Venture-class" rocket. NASA's first of three scheduled launches of six mini CubeSats, two at a time, into three orbital planes took place on Sunday. 

Given the rather dangerous nature of depending on tiny shoebox-size CubeAats and a rocket with a very short track record to accomplish mission objectives, the $40 million project only requires four satellites and two successful launches.

The NASA contract calls for the final two flights by the end of July. Whether Astra can meet that schedule given Sunday's failure is not yet known.

"Although today's launch with Astra did not go as planned, the mission offered a great opportunity for new science and launch capabilities," tweeted NASA science chief Thomas Zurbuchen.
