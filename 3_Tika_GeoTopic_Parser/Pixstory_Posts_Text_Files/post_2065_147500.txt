People would be outraged if a Republican attorney general said in public that they were prosecuting a illegitimate president They would say that this was the politicization of prosecutorial authority that the attorney general was displaying Yet since liberals have been conditioned to think that Trump Hitler literally they interpret this speech not as a politicization of prosecutorial power but rather as an attorney general pursuing one of the most notorious and dangerous criminals in the world Prosecutors must adhere to the law and not political ambitions When people hear words like these from a prosecutor it raises the issue of whether they are motivated by anything other than the law Obviously there was no legal case against Trump being a legitimate president as an attorney she should be aware of this Thus her claim that he is illegitimate must merely is a reflection of her hatred for him No surprise people perceive each and every case against Trump as a witch hunt given that each and every time Trump is prosecuted in some fashion the prosecutor makes incendiary remarks and exploits the trial to advance their political career Wait until Letitia James runs for governor again or even the Senate Do you think her campaign announcement will contain the statement I prosecuted Donald Trump Probably
