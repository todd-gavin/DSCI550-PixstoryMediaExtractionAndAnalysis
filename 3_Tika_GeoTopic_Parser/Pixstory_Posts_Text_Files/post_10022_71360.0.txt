The sky was clear, the sun was shining, and the air (though polluted) seemed cleaner than usual. Farid paused from pushing the cart he was holding for a moment, to catch his breath. He leaned against the wall on his right, relieved at the few seconds of shade it could offer. Behind the tall wall was a beautiful blue building. All the rich people lived there. Farid knew it was silly, but he always imagined himself living there when he grew up. Someday he would get on the other side of the wall. Someday he would. 

Farid was the errand-boy in Kart-e- Mandawi . He was the guy everyone would call on when they needed a favor, an errand, a delivery. He made a decent amount of money from his varying tasks, and it was better than selling plastic bags in the other markets. Competition in those areas was high, and the kids could get really aggressive. Farid liked his peace, his solitude. He was currently delivering a beautiful carpet from kaka Jamal’s rug store to a customer’s house. Kaka Jamal had promised him 20 afghanis if he was able to complete the task in 30 minutes. He would have to run back to make it on time. 

He glanced down at his feet. They were starting to become blistered, and he knew he would have to replace his worn sandals soon, or he wouldn’t be able to work anymore. He couldn’t stop working. He had to feed his mother and his 3 younger sisters. He wouldn’t be able to bear it if they had to start working because of his stupid blistered feet. 

As he began to lift the cart back up to continue his errand, his eyes fell on a string of messy words, graffiti’d on the wall he had been leaning on. 

“ما نسل تغییر هستیم” 
- “we are the generation of change” 

Farid scoffed and chuckled quietly, shaking his head. 𝘐’𝘮 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘵 𝘰𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘨𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘯, he thought. 𝘐 𝘤𝘢𝘯’𝘵 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘯 𝘢𝘧𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘥 𝘵𝘰 𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘦 𝘮𝘺 𝘰𝘸𝘯 𝘴𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘢𝘭𝘴, 𝘭𝘦𝘵 𝘢𝘭𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘤𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘵𝘳𝘺.
