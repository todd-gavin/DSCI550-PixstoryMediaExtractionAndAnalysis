Leeds recently announced their ninth signing of the summer in the form of young WilfriedGnonto on a five-year deal for an undisclosed fee.

The wonderkid is a versatile forward who can play on both wings but is considered the bestwhen playing as a support striker.
 Despite being short in height, he has immense strength,incredible dribbling skills and effective finishing techniques, which makes him a hot property.

Playing for FC Zurich last season, he netted 10 times in 36 appearances across all
competitions despite starting most games on the bench. As a result, Zurich went on to wintheir first league title in 13 years.

Born in Verbania, Italy in 2003, the Italian footballer is a product of the Inter Milan academy. However, he came into the limelight during the UEFA Nations League in June.

Debuting for the Italian national side, the 18-year-old forward provided an assist after comingoff the bench to help his side settle for a 1-1 draw against Germany at home.

On 14 June 2022, Gnonto, aged 18 years and 222 days, broke Bruno Nicole’s record tobecome the youngest goalscorer for Italy when he scored against Germany in a 5-2 awayloss.

Many consider the young forward to have a game-style similar to his inspiration, Englandwinger Raheem Sterling. "I'm inspired by Raheem Sterling, but I play football thanks toLionel Messi. He is the best in history,” Gnonto said.

After completing his move to The Whites, the Italian forward expressed his excitement toplay for his new home.

“I’m very happy to be here, this is a great club, “I can’t wait to see all of the fans and be atElland Road very soon. I’m very proud and my family is too, Leeds United is an incredibleclub with a great history. “Playing in the Premier League is something I’ve always wantedand that has driven me to work even more, I can’t wait to see the fans and help the team.”
