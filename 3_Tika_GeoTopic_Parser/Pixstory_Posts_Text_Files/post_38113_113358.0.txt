Barcelona have kicked off their summer transfer acquisitions with a bang! The Blaugrana on Monday confirmed the signings of Andreas Christensen and Franck Kessie on free transfers. The two players would be joining the club from Chelsea and AC Milan respectively. 

Andreas Christensen was expected to re-sign his contract with Chelsea before it expired in the summer. However, the interest from Barcelona coupled with the ban on Chelsea contributed to his departure from the club. 

Franck Kessie on the other hand had publicly confirmed that he would not be extending his stay with the Serie A giants. AC Milan had offered their influential midfielder a new contract. However, Kessie did not agree to the terms and made it clear before the January transfer window itself. 

The signings of Christensen and Kessie on free transfers would give a huge boost to Xavi Hernandez's side. Barcelona had struggled to keep clean sheets last season. This contributed to them exiting the Champions League early and eventually ending the 2021/22 season trophyless. 

Both players have signed four-year contracts at the Nou Camp and have release clauses of Â£430m. It has to be seen if the two players can combine and bring forth a new era for Barcelona and their supporters in the coming seasons.
