Snake bites are not uncommon Around to people die each year because of snake bites and around three times as many amputations and other permanent disabilities are caused by snakebites annually But how common are manbites How many times have you heard a man bite a snake back in revenge In one bizarre story like this a tribal man from India bit a snake back after being bitten by it It s no kidding he really did that The snake obviously died The hospital staff was shocked and I mean who wouldn t be when the man s family brought the snake s remains to the hospital Luckily the snake wasn t too venomous and only one of them died and the man was not one of them
