As per The Guardian, Sweatshop, western Sydney's literacy movement, is producing some of the country's most vital and fascinating writing, and associate director Peter Polites finally released his debut novel Down the Hume last year. 

In 2014, he co-wrote and starred in the Sweatshop production #ThreeJerks, a spoken-word piece about the media's reaction to the Sydney gang rapes in 2000. 

Peter is a true original in all of his work: he's known for writing dark realism in the vein of Christos Tsiolkas and Luke Davies' early works, but I think he's funnier than either of them. Down the Hume is queer noir, a melodrama that is modest, minimalist, and set in his hometown of western Sydney.

A first generation Greek Australian, Peter’s writing examines the borders of society, both geographical and imagined, and the intersections between queer and ethnic identity. He’s one of the most intelligent writers I’ve ever read, and I can’t wait to see what he does next.
