TO THE MAX - Juve extended their unbeaten run in Serie A to 14 matches (nine wins and five draws), the longest period without loss since between April 2018 and March 2019 when the Bianconeri put together a 31-game stretch without defeat, in coach Max Allegri’s previous spell at the club.

SPEZIA SPLICED - With his first goal since 18th December 2021, Alvaro Morata has now been directly involved in scoring in all four Serie A meetings with Spezia (three goals and two assists) - his longest consecutive run of active involvement in scoring in Italy’s top flight.

TWO THIRDS - With a third assist on top of his three goals, Manuel Locatelli equalled his record of direct participation in scoring in a single Serie A season (six, both in 2020/21 and 2018/19 with Sassuolo).

SEVEN/ELEVEN - Since 15th October, Juventus have conceded only five goals in 11 home games in Serie A and after keeping Spezia out, have now collected seven clean sheets: in Europe’s Big-5 leagues, no team has played as many matches without losing a goal.

BLANKED OUT - Juventus have not conceded a goal in the first half in 18 of the 28 games of this campaign, only Napoli (20) have done better this campaign.
