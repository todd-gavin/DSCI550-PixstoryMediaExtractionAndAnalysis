The first time I learnt of Radium Girls, I was both shocked and in awe. These women fought to save thousands of lives while lying on their deathbeds. 
After the World War I, many industries started manufacturing watches and military dials. Women were recruited in large numbers to paint the dials of the watches. The paint used contained Radium, a radioactive element which glowed in the dark. 
Their hair, skin and clothes often glowed due to their exposure to radium dust. Their employers asked that they ‘point’ their brushes by lips, instead of using water or rags to save time. Thus they ingested 
copious amounts of Radium. Few women even rubbed it on their teeth and nails as it gave them a radiant glow. 
But soon the symptoms of Radium poisoning showed up. The first of the Radium girls, Amelia Maggia 
experienced toothache and had to remove two teeth. This was followed by blisters and ulcers in mouth, and finally her jaw had to be removed. The doctors could not make out the mysterious malady that the 
women succumbed. 
The companies denied any connection between the deaths and their work vigorously for two years. In 1925, pathologist Harrison Martland produced a report that proved that the women died of Radium poisoning. Yet the industry discredited it. 
The Radium girls knew their days were numbered but still they wanted to help their colleagues. In 1927, 
attorney Raymond Berry took up the case. But most of the women were bedridden, hence they had to settle with out of court settlement. 
Deaths continued. Finally in 1938, dying Radium worker Catherine Von Donohue successfully sued the company. This had a huge impact, since this was the first time a company was held responsible for their actions. This led to reforms and creation of U. S Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
