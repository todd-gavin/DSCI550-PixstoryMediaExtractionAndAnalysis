The festival is over after days of eating most of us want to get to a diet or some of us struggle to keep a healthy weight There is so much being written and talked about diet that the consumer is confused Interestingly I recently came across a new diet called the CONFUSION DIET The premise is CONFUSE YOUR METABOLISM Eat a calorie rich diet one day and a calorie deficient another This will surely confuse ur metabolism and it will not know what to do Don t laugh it s actually science In the series Eminent Nutritionist and Diet Expert Ishi Khosla will talk about food help us understand obesity food and food rhythm She says there is more to food and diet and a lot of knowledge in what your grandma used to tell u So read on Q How would you define food and concept of obesity A Working in hospitals we would laugh at patients who said gas has gone to my head We would say headache is a headache and it has nothing to do with acidity We would say patients dont understand the science hence say anything Hence this whole concept of gas moving out of your GI tract into some other part of the body was so alien to a Western trained practitioners of medicine It was true for me as well I didn t know that till I got a patient who was burping all the time she would even burp if her hand was pressed She told me she was burping all the time and she showed it as well even while getting a massage done she was constantly burp She was my first such patient after that there were multiple such cases whom I met during my practice Hence I now believe the correlation is there people eat wrong and they get a headache People have acidity they get a headache Many mainstream practitioner will still question it To be continued
