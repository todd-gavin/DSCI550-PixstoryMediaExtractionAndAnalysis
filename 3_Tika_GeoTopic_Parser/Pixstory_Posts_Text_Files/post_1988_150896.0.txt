The city of Philadelphia recently achieved a new milestone. For the first time in the city’s history, the number of carjackings exceeded 1,000 in one year. That’s right, from January 1st until late September, over 1,000 people had their cars stolen in just one city.To put this into perspective, New York City has less than 300 car jacking with this year despite its infamous rise in crime during the pandemic.Urban neighborhoods have become riddled with crime, destroying businesses and driving people away from the place they call home. Crime has become a lucrative, low-risk business as a result of prosecutors, flat out refusing to take action against these criminals under the guise of criminal justice reform.The Philadelphia DA, for example, stated that he plans to prosecute people who carry guns lawfully with a permit in areas that they are not permitted. Why go after law abiding citizens for carrying guns in the wrong places when there are people in the streets flagrantly violating the law?
