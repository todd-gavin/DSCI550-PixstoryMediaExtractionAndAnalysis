Next time you see a bee hovering around a fruit tree you re probably witnessing pollination in action Pollination is what enables a plant to produce seeds and fruit and as research has shown pollination by insects can greatly improve the quality and quantity of fruit produced There s mounting evidence of a decline in the populations of pollinators all over the world The consequences for agriculture could be significant In some scientists calculated the economic value that insect pollination contributed to world agricultural output The number they came up with was billion a year it s likely to be much higher now Some fruit crops require very specific kinds of insect pollination Take blueberries Their flowers have specialised anthers the part of the stamen containing pollen which release large amounts of pollen only when certain pollinators visit them such as blueberry bees bumble bees and mining bees In a process called buzz pollination bumble bees vibrate their bodies at a certain frequency when they visit blueberry flowers This triggers vibrations in the anthers that cause the pollen to burst out The special shape of blueberry flowers and the number of flowers on a blueberry bush mean there s no way to mechanically pollinate blueberry plants on a commercial scale In recent years blueberries have become increasingly popular because of their perceived health benefits They re now planted all over the world including areas where their natural pollinators don t occur like South Africa where the blueberry exports to the world have grown from tonnes in to tonnes in In South Africa there aren t any native pollinators for the fruit in the country and the local honey bees aren t seen as an efficient substitute Farmers are considering importing large bees like bumble bees that aren t native to the country The big bees South Africans may see in their gardens that look like bumble bees are actually carpenter bees But that could devastate local environments Read more
