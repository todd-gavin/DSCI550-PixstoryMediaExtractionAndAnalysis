What else were we expecting when Johnny Depp was already a victor in this case It was very apparent how whole social media and the people following the case manifested their profound misogynistic tendencies Undoubtedly no one knows what happened between two people behind a room but this case turned against Heard showed how correctly Heard has said that she seemed to have lost her right as an American and most importantly as a woman The case revealed the history of Depp s substance abuse and violent outbursts But it was all covered up by the fame of Depp and his worshippers who would blindly believe in everything that was being said or shown A lot has changed for women in America and the picture is quite tragic the Depp Heard verdict is another tragic picture for all those women who have been the victims of abuse It is not about winning this time it depends on how this case s whole narrative was set Hashtags like justiceforjohnnydepp spread across social media with a whole army of attackers ready to condemn Heard It was to the extent that she even received death threats In addition it appeared that anti Amber propaganda was concocted with sentences like fake crying and this woman should be in jail bombarded on Amber Heard People seemed to have lost the basic decency that spoke about a woman being abused and anyone who is pilloried publicly without knowing the actual and real scenes behind the camera as the case was broadcasted live
