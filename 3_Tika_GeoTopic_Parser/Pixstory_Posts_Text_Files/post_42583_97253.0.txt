In football, the transfer of a footballer from one club to another is very common and a role of bridge between footballer and clubs is played by an agent.

The role of an agent is to make transfer deals as smooth as possible because footballers cannot involve themselves a lot in deals. After all, they have so much to do on-field, so almost every footballer hires an agent to solve all the issues regarding any transfer.

And today one of the best football agents has passed the day and the name of that agent is Mino Raiola.

His image in the football world was of a “money-minded man” because he always demanded too much money as a commission whenever he was involved in any transfer deal.

But whatever is said and done, this is a huge loss and he will be remembered as one of the strongest personalities in world football.
