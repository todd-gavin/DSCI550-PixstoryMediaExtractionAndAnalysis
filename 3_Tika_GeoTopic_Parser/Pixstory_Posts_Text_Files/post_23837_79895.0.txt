On Feb. 7, 1984, NASA astronaut Bruce McCandless became the first person to go on a spacewalk without a tether. McCandless was wearing a type of jetpack known as the Manned Maneuvering Unit, or MMU. The MMU fit over a regular EMU spacesuit and included gas thrusters that allowed astronauts to venture much farther away from the space shuttle.
