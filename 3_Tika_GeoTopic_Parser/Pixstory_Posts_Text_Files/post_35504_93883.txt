A bad Atalanta is eliminated from the Europa League The Bergamo players appear tired and never able to dominate their opponents and so Leipzig thanks them and returns to Germany with a full pocket Gasperini tries everything but no Nerazzurri player stands up as a driving force for his teammates and so the natural defeat Let&#39;s see the match statistics together Atalanta Ball Possession Shots on Goal Shots Blocked Offside Corner Cross Dribbling Fouls Drawn Yellow Cards Leipzig Ball Possession Shots on Goal Shots Blocked Offside Corner Cross Dribbling Fouls Drawn Yellow Cards The Goddess plays too much with the ball and in fact possession ball in favor of the home side but a useless figure if we think that the Germans shot many times The Nerazzurri line up all the players possible and imaginable in attack but in the end the shots on goal defended by Gulacsi will only be too little if you want to grab the semi-final of the Europa League Even the flanks were little exploited despite the many spaces granted by the German rearguard and the crosses by the Bergamo players were therefore almost useless because they led nowhere The same goes for dribbling Since it shouldn&#39;t do text when Boga takes to the field because the Ivorian tightrope walker enjoys aiming at the man in the middle of the field and then supporting his teammates Atalanta needs to make some serious arguments about this player From a disciplinary point of view, the match was rough but fair I the Germans had fun wasting some time in the Italian way The Spanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz did not appear up to the match, however He was punctilious like few others and uneven in his decisions But in Europe it did not prevail to play more games without booing all the normal contacts of game Sad evening for Atalanta who abandon the competition but take heart with their fans once again the only true bearers of banners of real passion and pride
