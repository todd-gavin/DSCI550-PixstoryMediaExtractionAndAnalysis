Trying to please everyone if you try to make everyone happy by changing who you are to fit their needs the one person that won t be happy is you Wasting time trying to find yourself instead of creating yourself Purpose doesn t just hit you over the head one day You need to bring meaning to life based on your strengths Fearing rejection and failure Regretting what could have been a burden compared to a few seconds of embarrassment say how you feel and do what you fear Attempting to make their parents happy instead of standing up for what they re truly passionate about Staying in meaningless or abusive relationships Whether it is a friend or a partner don t attempt to make someone love you it is a serious and painful waste of time Each morning you are born again what you do today is what matters most Make your future self proud
