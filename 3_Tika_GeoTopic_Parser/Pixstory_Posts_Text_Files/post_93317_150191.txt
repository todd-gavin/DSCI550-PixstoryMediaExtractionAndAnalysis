The absurdity of life No body knows what we are here for Nobody knows what exactly should we live our lives like At one end there is no explanation for the basic humans functions that we as humans do like breathing walking defecation feeding and reproduction on the other everybody is busy making their lives seem perfect to standards set by people we cannot pinpoint and tell that they are worthy of setting the bar this high But three thousand years of our civilisation has brought us to what we are today In this journey religion philosophy and science have played the major role They have accounted and showed the path for the future These have set the direction to the correct way of surviving and evolving It s the same as yesterday Survival of the fittest Especially in the corporate sector One has to run in the rat race where no one is heading anywhere than the arms of the ultimate truth death Widespread inequality violence and hatred have penetrated deep into our hearts Freedom is a facade Everyday something called human rights are severely violated on various lines of extremism practice in China proclaiming one s lost territory Russian Ukrain war and dictating people how to live their life and use their body for producing babies Abortion rights scrapping in the USA We are quick to judge and kill and slow to sit and talk The world and its people need to come out of the echo chambers and engage with each other Without this the world isn t going to change It is not going to provide better future to our future generations It isn t going make us the fittest It isn t going to be place where anyone can be truly happy To make it we need to stand up We need to become empathetic We need to engage in dialog be it between the super powers or the streets We need to come together for our own survival
