India is famous around the world for its unusual diversity India has a rich past that must be conserved from its people all the way up to its flora and fauna As a result we not only need to be proud of our rich culture but also need to find a method to preserve it India s large and healthy young population is currently its greatest asset Of course we need all of these young people to be productive if we hope to utilise this wonderful natural resource to its full potential Clearly we need entrepreneurs who will instead become job producers rather than job seekers if we are to create work for such large people We Indians display a strange attitude toward all forms of government Many people today don t even use their voting privileges Even those who vote believe that after they have given their valuable vote their work is done In actuality that is when our jobs actually start We must be more proactive and actively engage in the governance of the state or country The information age is here right now As a result we must constantly keep up to date on global affairs in to understand how they affect the lives of the billions of Indians So let s make a commitment to reading the newspaper or watching the news so that we may all become informed citizens and make wise judgements Whether we like to believe it or not the size of the world is quite limiting As a result make a commitment to having small families and urge your friends and families to do the same if they are reading this High unemployment rates drive young people toward a life of crime and other social problems in the absence of a social security system Before to the issue escalating into social disturbance the government parties and businesspeople must work together to solve it The issues that this country s youth are dealing with should concern every man and woman Therefore it is crucial that the government private parties and entrepreneurs work together to address the issue before it worsens and sparks public unrest
