We re all fighting with fire these days Aren t we No I mean quite literally With around half a million wild fires annually across the globe in the last years it s a state that our planet hasnt been in for a long time In these dire times Fire Ecology helps us not only answer a lot of the questions about the future but also reasons for the past It seeks to understand when fires occurred in the past how plants and animals and various environments respond and adapt to fire and how fires and there effects may change in the future Fire managers look to scientific research for guidance on how prescribed burns and lighting started fires can be used to benefit ecological systems They examine historic fire regimes and past cultural practices and use predictive modeling to study future fire effects under different climates and communities For if we couldn t prevent atleast we should be ready with the cure
