Jim's not alone in this regard! Be it at work, in school, at home, wherever, we have these moments where we're just like,"uffff I don't have anything to do", "I don't want to do anything I'm supposed to, I'm so bored". Those days definitely feel like the longest daysðŸ˜‚ 
You're tired, you're bored, you want to do something but at the same time, neither have much energy nor much want to do something productiveðŸ˜‚
