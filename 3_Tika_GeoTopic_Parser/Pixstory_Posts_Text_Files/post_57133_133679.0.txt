Are you someone who is thrilled by gothic settings or scary plots where someone is rising from the grave and looking at you as if you're present with them?
Do these kinds of adventures make you happy?
Of course, there are countless people out there who love watching horror movies.
It is their favourite date night or maybe the best sleepover plan with friends.
But what is actually startling about all of this?
Interesting theories and studies say that watching horror movies help you ease anxiety.
I think we never think of watching anything while remembering how the catharsis will help us relieve our stress and thoughts.
But surprisingly, this is the truth, horror movies work as a catharsis, and it helps in easing anxiety or fear.
It would seem counterintuitive, but frightening scenes have helped many people lower their anxiety problems.
"When you feel fear, your heart beats faster, your breathing picks up, and the nervous system releases cortisol and adrenalineâ€”stress hormones. All ways the body prepares to protect itself; the fight or flight response."
The satisfaction that you can experience fear in actually a comfortable situation helps you in fighting with it easily, hence letting your emotions out.
This helps in releasing anxiety.
