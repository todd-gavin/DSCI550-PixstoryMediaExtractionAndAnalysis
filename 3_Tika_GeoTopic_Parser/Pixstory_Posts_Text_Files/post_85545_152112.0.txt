How to deal with rejections?
Rejections and failures are really a part and parcel of all of our lives. It is not very easy to overcome them. They question us and our self-worth. But, it is very essential for us to move on from it and get ourselves back on the right track. Here are a few things that I focused on while I got rejected:
*Gratitude: I feel grateful for the fact that I at least got the opportunity to do something that I loved. I also feel thankful to my assessor for taking out time for me because they wouldn't have done it if they didn't see me as a potential fit.
*Self-reflection: I ask for genuine feedback from those who rejected me. This helps me to figure out where I went wrong and improve myself.
