Chief Minister Pramod Sawant highlighted the state government's efforts in promoting football at the grassroots level through Goa Football Development Council (GFDC). He was speaking at the opening ceremony of the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup being held in Goa. Praising former International footballers Brahmanand Shankwalkar, who is the current GFDC Chairman, and Bruno Coutinho, Sawant said, "Football is played by Goans in every village, by both boys and girls. It was declared as the state sport by late Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar. And in order to promote football among the youth, he launched Goa Football Development Council. Today, there are more than 30 centres run by the Council in every village. Children in the age group of 6 to 14 years are being exposed to the sport.""Many Goan clubs have contributed towards developing football. SAG are doing their work as well in promoting sports. Goa Football Association has contributed immensely to promote football. There is a sports fever in the state due to the World Cup. We are lucky to get to witness these international games in Goa, and I hope everyone turns up in large numbers," he said. Shankhwalkar, Coutinho as well as former India women’s team head coach Maymol Rocky were felicitated at the event.
