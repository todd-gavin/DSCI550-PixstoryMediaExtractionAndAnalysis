Cherries are blossoming somewhat earlier due to warm weather. Washington’s famous cherry blossoms have peaked this week, a day before the forecast, and full ten days before the thirty-year average. In Japan, where the annual cherry blossom season holds great cultural importance, the peak last year arrived earlier than anytime in centuries – due to global warming.

The springtime blooming of the cherry trees around the Tidal Basin in the US capital has become iconic of the natural beauty of the city: https://www.nps.gov/subjects/cherryblossom/index.htm 
Japan had gifted these trees in 1912. The records have been kept since 1921 of their peak bloom date and this year’s day (March 21) is the eighth-earliest peak bloom on record: https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2022/03/21/cherry-blossoms-peak-bloom-2022/

This year, in Washington it has been relatively warmer since mid-February. (It was Washington’s 18th warmest February.) That explains the early blossoming. In 1990, the bloom came as early as on March 15. The most delayed appearance was way back in 1958, on April 18.

Over the past century, temperatures have been rising in late winter and early spring. As a result, the average peak bloom day has advanced from April 4 in the 1920s-30s to March 31.

Last year, Japan brought the world attention to this alarming trend. A researcher had devised the annual blossom dates for every year since 812 AD – and the last year’s date (March 26) turned out to be earlier than ever before: https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/05/asia/japan-cherry-blossoms-climate-change-intl-hnk-scn/index.html

"The impact from climate change is indisputable, I think," Naoko Abe, author of The Sakura Obsession, told NPR: https://www.npr.org/2021/04/05/984470981/what-the-cherry-blossom-bloom-can-tell-us-about-climate-change (‘Sakura’ refers to cherry blossoms, a culturally significant phenomenon in Japan and now a chief attraction for global tourists.) 

Along with springtime temperatures, winter temperatures also matter greatly for the beautiful flowers. Abe explains that cherry trees need a full month of chilly weather below 41 degrees to properly blossom when it gets warmer. Warmer springs are advancing blooms, but warmer winters can delay it – there may not be even any bloom if the trees don't get chilly winters.
