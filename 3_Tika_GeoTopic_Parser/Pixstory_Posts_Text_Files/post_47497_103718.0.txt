HIT of the Season: Christian Eriksen

Christian Eriksen has had a dramatic effect on a team fighting for Premier League survival while
also making one of the most amazing sporting comebacks in recent memory, despite only
joining Brentford at the end of January.

After a complete recovery from last summer's very public heart crisis at Euro 2020, the Danish
star's return to elite-level action saw the Bees grab 16 points from his first seven games.

While others were instrumental in getting Thomas Frank's club to the top flight and then
maintaining them there, Eriksen was the driving force behind an unlikely run to the top half of
the league.

The former Tottenham and Inter playmaker has clearly relished his time in West London, weaving multiple passing plays into each game and displaying the assurance and brilliance in
possession that has made him one of the best creative midfielders in the world.

Only Liverpool and Manchester City have created more efforts from dead-balls than Brentford
this season, thanks to Eriksen's contributions.

FLOP OF THE SEASON-FRANK ONYEKA

Frank Onyeka's performances in 2021/22 will disappoint Thomas Frank. Brentford paid £10
million for the midfielder in the summer transfer window, but he did not live up to the promise.

He failed to score or assist in any of his 20 appearances for Brentford. When he was on the
field, the Nigerian international did not appear to be at ease. In the 2022/23 season, he will be
aiming for a change of fortune.

Ivan Toney (twelve goals)—Top Scorer

Ivan Toney is the top scorer this season for Brentford. After helping Brentford secure promotion
in 2020/21, Ivan Toney set the EPL stage on fire. Ivan Toney, the highest goalscorer for the
Bees, appeared in 32 games, scoring 12 goals and five assists.
