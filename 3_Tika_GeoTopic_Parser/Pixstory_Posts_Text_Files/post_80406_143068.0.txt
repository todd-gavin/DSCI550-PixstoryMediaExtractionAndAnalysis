#5 Olivier Giroud
The Frenchman never received the praise he deserved. The lethal striker had scored many memorable games for Arsenal, most of which was jaw-dropping; the Frenchman was a technically gifted player, and his movement in the box was immaculate. 
He was a complete striker who inhabited everything and inscribed his name in Arsenal's legendary list. Giroud could score goals anywhere, and when Van Persie left, he stepped up and delivered goals; in played 253 games for Arsenal and scored 105 goals. 
#4 Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang
Arsenal broke their club record fee to acquire the Gabon striker, who unconventionally left them, but when he played for them, he had a goal in every game, and he was worth every penny, and it didn't take time for the striker to adjust in Premier League. 
Scoring 92 goals for Arsenal in 163 appearances should be talked about a lot, but things became unpleasant for the striker with manager Arteta, as the striker left the club for Barcelona in 2022. 
#3 Robin van Persie
Van Persie had been the unluckiest player who joined the Arsenal when their downward spiral began in 2004. But that did not stop the Dutchman from scoring goals from left to right, and the player was averaging a goal every 90 minutes. 
His best season came in 2011/12 when he netted 30 goals and won the golden boot of the Premier League. But the player left the club, making 278 appearances and registering 132 goals in search of trophies in that season only, and won Premier League with Manchester United.
