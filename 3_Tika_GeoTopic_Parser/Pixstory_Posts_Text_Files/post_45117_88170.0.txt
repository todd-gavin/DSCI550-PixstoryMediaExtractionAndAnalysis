After hurting his left thigh, sergino Dest will miss the United States' final three World Cup qualifiers, and left back George Bello will take his place on the team on Friday.

Dest, the top American candidate at right back, was injured during Barcelona's Europa League victory over Galatasaray of Turkey on Thursday.

DeAndre Yedlin and Reggie Cannon are the leading candidates to start at right back in next Thursday's match against Mexico due to his injury. The United States will then host Panama on March 27 before finishing qualifying three days later in Costa Rica.

Bello moved from Atlanta to Arminia Bielefeld in January, making his debut on February 7 and making his first start on Sunday. Dest was Robinson's cover and will most likely be a backup to Fulham's Antonee Robinson, who is the projected left back starting for the United States.

â€œWe also see Kellyn Acosta potentially being able to play left back, but with him having minutes in midfield, it may not be ideal," U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter said.

Bello has made six international appearances, including a start in the CONCACAF Gold Cup final against Mexico last summer. Berhalter claimed he was also contemplating Joe Scally, Shaq Moore, and Sam Vines on Thursday.

After missing the 2018 World Cup, the United States visits Mexico on March 24, hosts Panama three days later in Orlando, Florida, and finishes on March 30 in Costa Rica. In Houston, training begins on Monday.

With 25 points, Canada leads North and Central America and the Caribbean, while the United States is second with 21, one goal ahead of Mexico on goal differential. Panama is in fourth place with 17 points, ahead of Costa Rica (16) and El Salvador (9).
