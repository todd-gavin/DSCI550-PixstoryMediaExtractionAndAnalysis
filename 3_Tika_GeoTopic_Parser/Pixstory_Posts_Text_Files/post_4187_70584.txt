I would like to appreciate the cinematography of the film to a level The performances of Allu Arjun shows improvement yet at many levels he gets overwhelmed Rashmika Mandanna with her very expressive face is getting stereotyped into bubbly roles and directors not emphasizing her acting skills Villains including Fahad Fazil exhibits good acting skills but Fahad Fazil the versatile actor resembles his appreciated character Shammi from Kumbalangi nights at some points The film is a very popular medium of influence In this era wherein both commercial and politically right movies are appreciated Even though claiming to be an entertainer movies should maximum avoid such insults on women and try not to glorify patriarchal norms to appeal to the audience We cannot ever deny the fact that cinema has a major influence on people of all ages
