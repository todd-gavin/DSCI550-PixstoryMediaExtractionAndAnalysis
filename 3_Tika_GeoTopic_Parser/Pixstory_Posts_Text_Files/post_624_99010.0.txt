When I became mother around 15 years ago, It was an emotion I had never felt before. Still drowsy with anesthesia, I kept asking about the baby, not the gender but whether the baby is ok. Whether breathing normally, are fingers and toes in place. I was paranoid about the child even before he was born, even while not fully conscious and aware of my self. This love was different. 
My world changed after I became a mother. One of my close friends who didn’t wish me on the most important event in my life ceased to be my friend. My baby had carved such a place in my heart, that I measured people’s love for me on how much they cared about my child. 
Recently a close friend told me, She likes everyone who is good to her five year old daughter. 
Everything takes a back seat. I was most ambitious and work meant everything to me, after the baby things changed. I was still in love with my work  but now I loved my child more. His welfare was most important even if it meant leaving the one work place I was in love with and changing cities.
It’s same with everyone. But there are mothers who have to take tough decisions for mere survival of their children. One can’t miss those make shift cloth cradles and little children in them while their mothers toil at construction sites, mother working in fields while their new borns are tied to their backs. Those images of young children following their mothers in brick Kilns or open fields leaves you heart broken. Mothers watching their children even as they do hard labour. Of course the mothers love their children equally or more but their work is directly proportional to the existence of their children. This Mother’s Day we at pixstory want to celebrate these brave moms. Who are the earners, the providers for their children. We celebrate their struggles to do the best for their children, as they try to make sense of their place in the world. We celebrate them as mothers, as women.
