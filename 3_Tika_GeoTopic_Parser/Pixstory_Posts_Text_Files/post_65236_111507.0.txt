I went to park.A park is a place where there are many trees and plants and also swings for children. It is a place for enjoyment where children and people can go to walk, run, play or sit. A park can be of different size.

A park can be big or small. It can have different things because they are made for a different purpose. Some parks have many swings for children. Swings like a merry-go-round, see-saw, slides are placed where all children can enjoy together. Some parks are for adults and they have fitness equipment, walking path and benches for old people.
