The contents on the eBooks are primarily cloud-based, meaning they can be updated at any time. Therefore, authors and publishers can always add up-to-date information, providing users with the latest digital content. This saves reprinting costs and the time involved in the process.
You can share the eBook contents with multiple users. In addition, the social feature on the ebook allows sharing and liking content, which is not possible with printed books.
You might share a printed book with one person at a time, but an eBook can be shared with many people at once. Students and employees can use this feature to collaborate with their peers.
Augmented reality has taken the eBook experience to a whole new level. Texts and images can now be embedded with an augmented three-dimensional visual which pops up on the user’s screen. In addition, readers can view a computer-generated 3D model of the image, which does reading and learning a much more immersive experience.
The user only has to point the device at the image or text, and an enhanced version of the image will be displayed on their screen.
Many educational institutes and organizations are adopting this technology into their eBooks to enhance user experience. Here’s all you need to know about how augmented reality can transform the classroom.
Also, it's easy on the eyes as eReaders these days come with features where you can adjust the screen's brightness according to the time of the day and depending upon your preferences.
Many eReaders even have read in the dark feature, with lights that won’t strain your eyes, and neither would they disturb others around you. Users can even change the fonts of the text. In addition, they can increase or decrease the size of the font. EBooks ensure that your eyes are taken care of.
