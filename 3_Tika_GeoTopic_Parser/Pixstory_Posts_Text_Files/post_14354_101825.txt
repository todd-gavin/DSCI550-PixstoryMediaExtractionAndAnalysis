The season is over and I wanted to thank my teammates for how they treated me since I arrived and my family for accompanying me and supporting me always It was a different year for everything that happened but at the end of it all we got a league that I was very excited to achieve for what it means to be the first trophy here in Paris We were left with the bitter taste of falling in the Champions League in a knockout that we were getting better and at the same time I want to take the joy of having added another title that was also one of the goals Surely good things are coming in this it will be an important year and we will fight to be competing with ambition for everything
