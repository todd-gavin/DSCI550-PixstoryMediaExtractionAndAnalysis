Apple has announced that it will soon release a new mode for the iPhone called “lock down” which will enable users who believe they are targets of government sponsored or other high level, coordinate cyber security attacks to protect themselves. The feature will turn off a plethora of features in the phone that could enable hackers to get through.

Apple has stressed that most users will never have to use this feature, as it most people are not subjected to cyber threats at such a high level. However, this type of technology can be extremely useful for government actors, journalists, human rights activists, and others who could be targets.

As our world increasingly moves online, more and more people will become targets of cyber threats. It is necessary that large tech companies take an initiative to protect their users.

Google also offers a similar service for their devices which is intended for use by similar persons as Apple’s.
