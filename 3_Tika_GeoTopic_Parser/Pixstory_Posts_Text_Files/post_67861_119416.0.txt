2019 World Championship Final vs Nozomi Okuhara

The contrast between the World Championship finals in 2017 and 2019 could hardly be more pronounced. Sindhu successfully broke her 'Silver Sindhu' curse by defeating Okuhara 21-7, 21-7 in the finals of the 2019 edition, after being out-rallied by Okuhara in 2017 and out-smashed by Marin in 2018. As a result, she became India's first badminton World Champion. She finally had the chance to wear the gold medal after losing in the Rio Olympics finals and the World Championship finals in 2017 and 2018. 

The World Champion title catapulted Sindhu to levels of stardom that few Indian athletes outside of cricket have attained.

After her victory in the final, she said, “I am really happy, I have waited for this victory, and finally I've become world champion. I've no words to express it because I was waiting, last year it was silver, before that it was silver and then finally I'm world champion.”
