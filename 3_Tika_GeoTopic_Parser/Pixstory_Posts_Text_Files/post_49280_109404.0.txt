I just asked this to my dog, he said "woof woof, gurrrr". Haha, kidding. I picked this line from somewhere else. Thought it was funny so I'd share. Coming back to the topic, I always believed dogs did enjoy music. I have seen countless of them videos where they're singing along to a song in their own dog - way, dancing to some music and loudly howling to opera. In fact dogs also not enjoy certain music, they could show their displeasure in many ways - from barking angrily to straight up leaving the room. These interesting, adorable, stoopid creatures! Dogs do appear to enjoy music, according to research done by animal behaviourist Deborah Wells. Wells' research showed that while dogs are uninterested in pop music or radio programmes, they do find some types of classical music to be calming and soothing. It appears that, like us, our furry buddies have their own musical tastes. But there are further research to back the fact that dogs can enjoy pop, it just depends on their own music taste. So blast a Taylor Swift and find out if your dog likes it!
