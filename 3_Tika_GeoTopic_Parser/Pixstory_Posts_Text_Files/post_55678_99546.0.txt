Carolyn Glascodine, a Melbourne resident, developed a severe case of melancholy when record-breaking bushfires ravaged most of eastern Australia in late 2019. "I was depressed," admits the 58-year-old editor. "I couldn't even get out of bed." 

FT reported that she claims she has witnessed Australia's conservative Liberal-National government ignore climate scientists' warnings and continue to support fossil fuel extraction and carbon-intensive industry for years. 

The bushfires, which burned cities and engulfed Sydney and Melbourne in smoke for weeks, demonstrated what was at stake in a country wealthy in fossil fuels but unusually vulnerable to climate warming's worst effects.

“Nothing was changing,” she says. “I’d never been involved in politics before, but I had to do something.”

According to many critics, Australia has been a climate laggard. Per capita greenhouse gas emissions in the country are among the highest in the world, on level with Saudi Arabia. There are no national carbon prices, incentives for electric vehicles, or fuel requirements. It has continued to build its massive fossil-fuel extraction industries, promoting coal and gas power over renewables, and undermining international climate talks. 

Australia's 2030 carbon reduction objectives are among the least ambitious of any developed country, at 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels. By comparison, the UK's 2030 aim is 68 percent, the EU's is 55 percent, and the US's is 50 to 52 percent.

As James Feenyhough writes, this perceived negligence comes not only from the ruling Liberal-National coalition, whose ranks of lawmakers and supporters are riddled with climate change deniers, but also from an opposition Labor party whose current environmental platform has been criticised by activists and business leaders as unambitious.

Let’s see how this rising concern affects the elections!
