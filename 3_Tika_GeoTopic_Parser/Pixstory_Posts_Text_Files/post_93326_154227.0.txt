Slovenia, surrounded with countries like Poland and Hungary, where LGBTQ people are discriminated and it's banned to use word gay in mainstream, respectively,Â  becomes the first eastern european country to legalise same sex marriage and adoption.
The historic moment has come about after a 6-3 Constitutional Court decision in July and parliament has been ordered to make amendment within six months.
This bill was passed on 4th October, 48 people voted in favour of the bill, 29 were against it and 1 abstained from making any opinion. 
Slovenia, was a part of Yugoslavia which was against gay men and banned it in 1952. Eventually, when Slovenia was given an option to make its own criminal code, it decriminalised homosexuality.
