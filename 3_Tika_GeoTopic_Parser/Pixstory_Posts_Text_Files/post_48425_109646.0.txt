If we get religion into abortion rights which pro groups already did; then there is a need to be on equal footing in this democracy especially when the law was signed at a church! Why is only one religious law being protected? 

The synagogue's lawsuit puts forward the question of which religion takes priority when it comes to legislation. It also underlines the difference between "This is against my religion, therefore no one can do it" and "This is part of my religious tradition, therefore I legally have a right to access it." The former has no place in U.S. law, as it infringes the traditional separation of church and state, and the latter is a prime example of the goal of the First Amendment right to freedom of religion.

Banning abortion is, in effect, ascertaining a particular religious belief as law and restricting the free exercise of religion for an entire group of people. All I have to say is at the basic level abortion is a healthcare and not something to be judged, it is a choice that is an individual's belief. These are not enough for legislators who can't stay away from the right over a human's body! Hence we have to ponder on 'Religiously'. We are in such a situation that we have to bring out our spiritual reasons than basic logical ones. This is what the world looks like!
