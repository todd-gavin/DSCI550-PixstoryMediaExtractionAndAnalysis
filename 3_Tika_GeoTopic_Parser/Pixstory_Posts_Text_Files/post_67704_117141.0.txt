This ain't a formal introduction. Hi, this is Rishika, your next door social media art queen trying to achieve her dream as an artist. Quick interesting fact! Spent my entire school life running after the domain of physics, chemistry and maths. Completed my graduation in the fields of arts, specialized in English Literature and now aiming to become a museum instructor with intermediate freelance jobs in content creation. What a learning curve, one might start wondering! 

It is pretty difficult to introduce yourself as an artist isn't it? "I am an artist" is way too mainstream and doesn't seem to roll off the tongue quite easily. You know at heart that you are an artist, it goes beyond show casing creativity on a particular medium, don't you think? I have never believed in institutional learning therefore I've never officially learned art and its types. Can you even learn/spoon fed through a routine on how to be creative?Â  It was always embedded in me and I sensed it since the beginning. Gallery representation, creative writing certificates, cultural head in high school, museum exhibition, art poster medals, I have bagged it all. Yet never entirely got rid of *there is no reliable future in this domain, take up science*. Always felt like, if I see myself as an artist, there is nothing to apologize for and nothing to explain. Social media platforms are my only opportunity to reach out to my fellow artist pals who share a common field of interest with me, so I'm constantly posting my works, probably asking for validation?! Yes, that's my canvas work you are looking at! It's a classic abstract inspired by post modernistic ways of art..

This might give you guys a confidence boost. The moto of this low key artist in life is to *be yourself, be fun and be confident*.
