Meditation is one of the most ancient teachings that have survived in the world despite of all the history that has been erased over the rise and downfalls of so many civilisations Meditation is considered one of the easiest paths to enlightenment as illustrated by Buddha himself Out of body experiences are common when you have become a practitioner of meditation It is not uncommon Or uncomfortable to have this experiences Meditation helps us to clear out the chatter in our mind And when our mind is at the utmost peace it unlocks a new level within us which is often referred to as intuition Everybody has intuition or sixth sense but when you practice meditation your intuition is heightened to such a level that you can anticipate events or have an intuition about how a certain situation is going to turn out Such out of body experiences during meditation are common However they should not become the focal point of meditation Meditation is done to tune your mind get rid of the noise in our head and not to have some out of body experiences People often confuse that since I haven t had an experience of that stature maybe meditation is not for me I would like to assure you that is not the case Meditation is done solely for the mind to keep it s calm and preserve the peace around us by invoking positivity around us
