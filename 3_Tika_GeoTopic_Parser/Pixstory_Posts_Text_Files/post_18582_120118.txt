Juventus still looking for a striker to work alongside Vlahovic Morata is not easy to get back because Atletico Madrid are asking for a lot of money for the sale after two consecutive loans the redemption was set at millions of euros Arnautovic one of the viable avenues but more like deputy Vlahovic Firmino has also been rumored but it doesn&#39;t seem like a feasible negotiation Juventus&#39; new target now seems to be Timo Werner of the Chelsea forward who had amazed the whole of Europe in the season with goals scored with the Leipzig shirt dragged to the Champions League semi-final Chelsea didn&#39;t let him slip away but with the Blues they were unable to replicate what was done in Germany The black and whites would like him but it depends on Chelsea&#39;s request which, given the investment made by millions of euros, would like to loan him out Juventus on the other hand would like at least one right Hiring question High salary question but the Turin club could be able to guarantee him the net millions of euros he takes in London as long as Chelsea don&#39;t ask for too much money for the loan
