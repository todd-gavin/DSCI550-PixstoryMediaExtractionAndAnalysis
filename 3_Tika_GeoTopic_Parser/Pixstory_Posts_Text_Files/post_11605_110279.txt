Just Say NO Firstly these sugar detoxes will backfire This has been shown in multiple studies where access to sugary substances were removed or limited and when access was given again they were eaten in binge like patterns However the non restricted ones have a more moderation or balanced style of eating Secondly there is sugar in most things Those carrots that someone is eating Yeah they have sugar Most people mean added sugar but the above point mentioned still stands But when someone makes a blanket statement of no sugar it makes it clear they likely don t know what sugar truly is This does not imply eat sugar all day every day and you ll be fine I know that fueling our bodies with nothing but added sugar on daily basis likely won t allow us to feel it s best or allow our bodies to function optimally The key is to have a healthy relationship with sugary foods and also learn to connect with your body and learn to listen to your hunger fullness and satisfaction
