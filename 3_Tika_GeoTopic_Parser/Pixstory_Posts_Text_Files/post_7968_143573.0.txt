Equity markets are rising even when the life of the ordinary person is becoming worse. 
Inflation is stubbornly high, GDP growth is below expectations, joblessness is growing, corporate earnings continue to stay subdued. 
The market is supposed to be the barometer of the health of the economy. When the economy is in such a shambles, why are stock prices rising?
Is it speculation on steroids or have the markets become the playing field of the top 1%?
One thing is for sure: Equities have decoupled from reality and become the ultimate symbol of inequality.
