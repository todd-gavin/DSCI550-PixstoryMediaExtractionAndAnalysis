China and Columbia squared off in their second match of U Women s World Cup s Group C at the DY Patil Stadium The match ended in a win in favour of Columbia that stirred up the Group C points table in a massive way Columbia who registered their first win of the tournament tonight are now the table toppers in an unbelievable fashion In fact every team in the Group currently has points which means that anything can happen with each team yet to play their last match Let us talk about the incidents of this match now It would be wrong to say that Columbia dominated the entire match Yes it might be true that they had most of the possession but China were very clinical in their counters They created a lot of chances but ultimately fell short of their opposition s physicality and were unable to convert those chances Statistically speaking Columbia attempted shots on target compared to China s on target This also shows that Team China never gave up their hope Both the goals were scored by Linda Caicedo in the first half She scored the first goal of the night in the th minute and not much later she went on to score her brace and thus double Columbia s lead China kept on attacking after conceding their second goal and made it sure that their intent was to at least secure point Sadly today was not their day China s Liu Chen particularly had an unlucky day China will now face tough opposition from Spain in their last match of the Group stage and it is a do or die match Columbia on the other hand will face Mexico The winners of these matches will decide who will qualify for the knockout stage
