According to NBC, Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler confirmed House Judiciary Committee plans to hold a hearing on the "implications" of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.

The hearing will "expose the extremism of this leaked opinion — it is undoing 50 years of precedent and signalling that they will go after other privacy rights. Nobody is safe," Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa., a Judiciary member and co-chair of the bipartisan Women's Caucus, said in an interview. 
“You might think, ‘This is really about women and their reproductive freedom.’ It is. It’s also about girls — that affects me when I think about my daughters and my three granddaughters — that if something were to happen to one of my granddaughters and they needed reproductive freedom, they wouldn’t have it under this regime over here,” Dean added, pointing her finger at the Supreme Court building.

On Wednesday, Senate Republicans, along with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., successfully obstructed a House-passed Democratic bill that would have enshrined abortion-rights protections into federal law. The vote was 49-51, far short of the 60 votes needed to defeat a GOP filibuster.

So Democrats are employing other political tools at their removal to attract attention to the issue ahead of the midterm elections, where both Democratic House and Senate majorities are at stake which includes hearings, like the one next week, but also news conferences and rallies.

Please understand this isn't a political game to play but a serious decision that is going to affect the future of women in America, making America unsafe and oppressing for women.
