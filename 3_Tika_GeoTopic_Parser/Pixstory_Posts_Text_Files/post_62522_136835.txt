I can give many reasons why schools aren t right at all at this point in time Schools can be a lot of work and not just for the students Teachers administrators and other staff members are also required to deal with constant demands and pressures from parents You re constantly dealing with stressors in your environment From class assignments to fighting with classmates schools can be a stressful place to be You don t get enough breaks School is usually a continuous barrage of activity which can lead to burnout for teachers and students alike There s little room for creativity or individuality In most schools pupils are expected to conform to a certain set of expectations and behave in a uniform way This limits their ability to express themselves freely and become creative individuals You re not given the opportunity to develop relationships with other students outside of school hours or during breaks This can make it difficult when it comes to forming friendships later on in life when you re potentially going to need them more than ever You re often left feeling depressed and unhappy after school is finished for the day This is because school doesn t provide children with any opportunities for leisure or fun something that s essential for healthy development in all domains of life Schools need major changes in them and those changes definitely won t be some reforms We have advanced so much in technology yet haven t come up with a less stressful way to give children good education We keep playing with their mental health as if it doesn t matter It s simple we just don t consider children human beings deserving of respect and autonomy We just treat them like machines
