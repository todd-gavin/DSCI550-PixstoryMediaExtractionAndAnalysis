Atomic clocks combined with precise astronomical measurements have revealed that the length of a day is suddenly getting longer and scientists don t know why This has critical impacts not just on our timekeeping but also things like GPS and other technologies that govern our modern life Over the past few decades Earth s rotation around its axis which determines how long a day is has been speeding up This trend has been making our days shorter in fact in June we set a record for the shortest day over the past half a century or so But despite this record since that steady speedup has curiously switched to a slowdown days are getting longer again and the reason is so far a mystery While the clocks in our phones indicate there are exactly hours in a day the actual time it takes for Earth to complete a single rotation varies ever so slightly These changes occur over periods of millions of years to almost instantly even earthquakes and storm events can play a role It turns out a day is very rarely exactly the magic number of seconds The ever changing planet Over millions of years Earth s rotation has been slowing down due to friction effects associated with the tides driven by the Moon That process adds about about milliseconds to the length of each day every century A few billion years ago an Earth day was only about hours For the past years another process has been working in the opposite direction speeding up Earth s rotation When the last ice age ended melting polar ice sheets reduced surface pressure and Earth s mantle started steadily moving toward the poles Just as a ballet dancer spins faster as they bring their arms toward their body the axis around which they spin so our planet s spin rate increases when this mass of mantle moves closer to Earth s axis And this process shortens each day by about milliseconds each century Read more
