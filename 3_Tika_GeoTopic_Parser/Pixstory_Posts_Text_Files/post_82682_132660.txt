A new day brings in the hope of many new beginnings in life As I begin the day my mind starts scribbling with the notes of the list of jobs Some of them are in my workplace some at my daughter s school some for the others I enjoy the juggling of work as I quickly change my doctor s apron and put on the mother s uniform while picking up my daughter after her long day at school Yes it s tiring But what matters most is that I can do what I wish to do I am able enough to alleviate the pain and sufferings of many at my workplace to bring change in the lives of many whom I am not related to I feel empowered every day when I reach my workplace To me empowerment is all about being free to make your own choices take decisions in your life and stand by it and be strong and able enough to help others My journey from a village girl to a faculty at the premier institute of the country was tough but I never felt the hurdles My parents laid the first stepping stone of my journey and ingrained a deep belief in me No matter what I can Now they are no longer with me but it is my responsibility to take their teaching forward through my daughter I feel deeply indebted to them every day every moment for the confidence they inculcated in me for the compassion they ingrained in me In my growing years they never let me feel the difference of genders difference of caste and religion I take every human as a different individual full of potential to blossom Now when it is my time to pay back I know it s my responsible to empower those I come in touch with This starts with my daughter my students my patients To each my role might be different but what matters is the earnest wish with which I can work and face the mirror smilingly at the end of the day
