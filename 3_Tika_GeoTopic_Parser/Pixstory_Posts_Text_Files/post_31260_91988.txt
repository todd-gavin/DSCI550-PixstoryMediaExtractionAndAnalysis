We are business as usual if having planned the expansion of an airport like Malpensa within the Ticino Park was an irreparable planning error, asking for its further expansion to the detriment of the protected area is a wicked act compared to what should be coherent biodiversity conservation objectives, he declares Barbara Meggetto president of Legambiente Lombardia We send a call to responsibility to the Lombardy Region as well as SEA the airport must develop its own projects without wasting any more territory and the mayors should let go of compensations that really have nothing environmental The heath must be redeveloped and protected not destroyed For trying to safeguard the heath for over a decade, the Ticino Park has presented the Region with an application for recognition of the same as a SCI Site of Community Importance But despite the evident naturalistic value of the area, the Lombardy Region has not taken any protection measures, citing as a reason the need to evaluate the fate of the area pending approval of the airport Masterplan Basically attributing more importance to the location of the sheds and aprons than to the safeguarding of a unique natural asset and as such not reproducible Legambiente complaint The ongoing negotiation among the Municipalities of the CUV Voluntary Urban Consortium which includes Somma Lombardo Arsago Seprio Cardano al Campo Casorate Sempione Ferno Golasecca Lonate Pozzolo Samarate and Vizzola Ticino Lombardy Region Ticino Park and SEA which will be launched with a meeting in the Region scheduled for Monday April in fact risks seeing a downward agreement arises which, in the face of obvious environmental damage, does not take into account the new consumption of soil and biodiversity with the aggravating factor of the grounding of compensations resulting from agreements of the last century and never implemented, all based on the increase in arterial roads
