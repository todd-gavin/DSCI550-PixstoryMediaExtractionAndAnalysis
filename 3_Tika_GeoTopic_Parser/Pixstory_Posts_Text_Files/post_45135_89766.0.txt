#4 England (1994)

England has only failed to qualify for the tournament three times in their history, and their 1994 qualification campaign was a complete disaster.

They ended third after only one win in four games against Poland and Norway, and — believe it or not — even conceded against San Marino in the last group game.

#5 Argentina (1970)

Argentina has only missed one World Cup, in 1970, when their quest to qualify for the tournament was marred by anarchy.

In three years, there have been four different managers, defeats to Peru and Bolivia, and a 2-2 draw against the latter in the last group game when a win would have sufficed. Eight years later, they would go a little better, winning the tournament for the first time.
