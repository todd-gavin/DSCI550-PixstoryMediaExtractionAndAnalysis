A* was no more than 15 when her parents, ashamed and angry, asked her to leave home in a village in Punjab’s Patiala district.



From classmates and neighbours, A's parents found out that their son dressed and sexually identified as female, a transwoman. It was nothing they could understand or accept.



So, A, who is 32 now and lives in the eastern Uttar Pradesh city of Varanasi, left home, "for a whole new place, dreaming of a new life,” she said. “But life had other plans.”



In a few months in Varanasi, she found work as a waiter, was summarily sacked when her employer found out she was a trans person. Then, owner of the house where she was a tenant raped her repeatedly.


Alone and traumatised in an unfamiliar city, A spent a few weeks in a dharamshala (a charity-run guest-house that charges no rent) before finding a room on rent at the home of a retired engineer, in the Lanka area in the heart of Varanasi.



“He rented me the room after a lot of interrogation,” A said, “but I was still very thankful.”



She found work as a waiter in a small restaurant, for a monthly salary of Rs 900, which covered her rent and food.



“Two months later, the owner found out that I was trans, he abused me and threw me out of the job,” said A. “I then asked the house owner to give me 15 days’ time to pay the rent. The following evening he came to my room and asked for a favour.”



A said the owner made her sit on his lap and then proceeded to rape her.



She was still a minor. “I just cried the whole night after he left,” said A, who is today a spokesperson for the transgender community.


Her journey from abused teenager is a measure of her resilience and determination, her confidence hiding the trauma she endured and justice she was denied, as thousands continue to be.
