The stage is set and strategies are almost finalised for the much talked about IPL media rights e-auction to be held on Sunday. The outcome of the auction is expected to be announced on the same day, unless the bidding does not turn into a full-blown war.

Players in the fray this time are Disney-Star, Sony, Zee, Viacom18/Reliance, Google, Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Dream11, Sky Sports UK, SuperSport SA and Fancode.

Almost all the big broadcast and digital players seem to have fallen prey to BCCI’s plan. The board did not fix the base price on the basis of valuation and projected ROI, sensing that no one can afford to leave the tournament’s rights at any cost.

While BCCI officials have been quoted multiple times in media reports saying that they expect to earn up to Rs 50,000 crores from IPL media rights, the board has kept the base price at Rs 32,890 crore.

Media analysts are of the view that this kind of valuation game is harmful for both broadcasting and sports businesses and this is akin to killing the golden goose.

Until a few days back, the incumbent media rights holder Disney Star India wasn’t being considered as an aggressive bidder but with Walt Disney Chairman, International Content and Operations, Rebecca Campbell camping in India, the broadcast and digital player is again in the limelight as a strong contender.

“As we speak, only Star will be able to monetise the broadcast rights. But they might not go beyond a sustainable amount for broadcast business. Sony is said to be in deep trouble if they pick up the broadcast rights. They recently bought Zee and if they go for IPL’s broadcast rights, they will run into debts as the amount required is as big as is needed for acquiring an entire network,” a media observer said.
