Senior Congressman Mallikarjun Kharge stated on Sunday that, should he be elected party president, he would not feel guilty about seeking the Gandhi family's guidance and assistance in managing the party's affairs because they have worked so hard and sacrificed so much for its development.
The seasoned leader declared himself the "delegates' candidate" in the polls for the party's highest office, which are due on October 17.
"They make claims like there is nothing else to say. The BJP engages in this kind of campaign, and others imitate it. They have fought for the party and invested their strength in its growth, Sonia Gandhi has worked for the organisation for 20 years, and Rahul Gandhi served as president "In response to a question about rumours, Mr. Kharge stated that if elected president of the AICC, the Gandhi family would use him as their remote control.
Speaking to reporters in Bengaluru, he emphasised the sacrifices and contributions made by the Nehru-Gandhi family, including those made by Rajiv, Indira, and Sonia Gandhi as well as Jawaharlal Nehru.
"Saying such a thing (against the Gandhis) is wrong simply because we (the Congress) lost a few elections. They have done good for this nation, and their counsel will help the party, so I will absolutely ask for it. Nothing about it is shameful. I'll follow your (media) recommendations if they help something. They worked for this party, so I should heed their counsel "said Mr. Kharge.
