Russia and Ukraine have remained locked in conflict for close to a month now with neither side gaining an upper hand. Amid mounting fatalities, there are speculations of backdoor parleys and a possible peace deal. An agreement can bring ceasefire immediately even if its detailing may take a while.

The war has not progressed on the expected lines so far. Russia, despite its superior military power, has faced strong resistance in Ukraine, which however has suffered immensely with attacks on civilian localities.

Ukraine wants the war to end soonest, and in any case it was not the one that started the action. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a video address on Saturday morning, called for peace talks: https://www.dw.com/en/ukraines-zelenskyy-calls-for-talks-with-russia-live-updates/a-61182407

Zelenskyy earlier told ABC, “I’m ready for dialogue; we’re not ready for capitulation”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieaS3jvZS9Q

News reports suggest negotiations between Ukraine and Russia might be going on already through secret channels (which understandably make the West nervous): https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/03/18/russia-ukraine-peace-negotiations/

As for Russia, a nuclear power’s desperation after facing hurdles on ground is making the world jittery. Still, Putin has the other option of choosing peace too, though he would like it at his terms and with a face-saver. 

There are neutral players like Israel and Turkey that have come forward to broker a peace deal. 

On Wednesday, the Financial Times reported Israel’s Prime Minister Naftali Bennett was mediating a 15-point deal: https://www.ft.com/content/7b341e46-d375-4817-be67-802b7fa77ef1

The next day, BBC reported on Putin’s phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during which he listed his demands: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60785754

The demands broadly are of two types, the obvious ones that Ukraine will have no trouble in expecting, and some face-saving ones, which can be dicey. The key demand is Ukraine would remain neutral and won’t join the NATO. Russia may also want disarmament to ensure that Ukraine is no threat to it, backed by western guarantees and that might be difficult to meet. Face-savers might include protection to Russian language and “de-nazification”. 

The last item, crucial to Putin’s propaganda, is ridiculous – Zelenskyy himself is a Jew, yet it too can be met by “resolving” to fight all forms of Nazism.
