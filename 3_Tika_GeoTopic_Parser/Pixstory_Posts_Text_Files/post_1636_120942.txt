On the mountainsides of Nepal and Turkey bees produce a strange and dangerous concoction mad honey It s a rare variety of the natural fluid Compared to the several hundred other types of honey produced around the world mad honey is redder and slightly more bitter tasting and it comes from the world s largest honey bee Apis dorsata laboriosa But what really distinguishes mad honey are its physiological effects In lower doses mad honey causes dizziness lightheadedness and euphoria Higher doses can cause hallucinations vomiting loss of consciousness seizures and in rare cases death The psychoactive effects of mad honey stem not from bees but from what bees feed on in certain regions a genus of flowering plants called rhododendrons All species of these plants contain a group of neurotoxic compounds called grayanotoxins When bees feed on the nectar and pollen of certain types of rhododendrons the insects ingest grayanotoxins which eventually make their way into the bees honey effectively making it mad Bees are more likely to produce mad honey when and where rhododendrons are dominating The reason has to do with scarcity With fewer types of plants to feed on the insects feed almost solely on rhododendrons so they consume more grayanotoxins The result is especially pure mad honey
