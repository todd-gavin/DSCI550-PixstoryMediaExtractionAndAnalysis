Revenge Play is also called Revenge Tragedy. As the name suggests it is a dramatic genre in which the protagonist seeks vengeance for an imagined or actual injury. 

It was first introduced in 1900 by A. H. Thorndike to label a class of plays written in the late Elizabethan and early Jacobean eras.

The conventional revenge tragedies included The ghost of the murdered victim urges revenge, meta theatricality, madness, murder and cannibalism.

The revenge tragedy was established on the Elizabethan stage with Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy in 1587.

The distinction and cultural assertion between public and private revenge has been evaluated by some to be the defining theme of not only early modern revenge tragedy but all early modern tragedy. The tension between public and private revenge, then, has also led to conflicts about whether the protagonists enacting private revenge are heroes or villains.

Most revenge tragedies end with a scene of carnage that disposes of the avenger as well as his victims. Other examples are Shakespeare’s Titus Andronicus, Henry Chettle’s The Tragedy of Hoffman and Thomas Middleton’s The Revenger’s Tragedy (1607).
