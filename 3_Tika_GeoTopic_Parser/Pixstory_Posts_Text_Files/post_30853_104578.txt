Empoli has decided to sack the coach Aurelio Andreazzoli despite a contract valid until and the comfortable salvation achieved in the Serie A championship that has just ended President Corsi justified the choice with this A painful but considered decision resulting from an examination of the last few months Al clear of the satisfactions with Napoli and Atalanta the team in the second round lost its spark and conviction The next championship will be even more difficult we think that the players will be able to continue their path of completion with a new method and I also hope new enthusiasm We are sorry because We will always be grateful to Aurelio he has given us great satisfaction but we have to go beyond the emotional aspect Paolo Zanetti is the name in pole position to inherit the Tuscan bench from Andreazzoli who thus commented on the club&#39;s decision I acknowledge the president&#39;s decision which does not correspond to the my expectations nor my will But this is football My job is also made of this let&#39;s look ahead
