AMANTI BASTARDI is released on Friday May, the new song by VERONICA PERSEO, Sardinian singer-songwriter, winner of the first edition of Tali e Quali, a spin-off program of Tale and Which Show broadcast on Rai. Amanti Bastardi written by Veronica Perseo, Marcello Balestra and Marco Baracchino, a song in which the the classic concept of a couple relationship in which one suffers and the other makes the victim and perpetrator suffer, they become accomplices in an unhealthy game The difference is made by the choice to remain in the toxic relationship because in the end it&#39;s two who are bastards And so the classic fil rouge becomes a barbed wire that will bind and unite lovers forever With Amanti Bastardi I wanted to tell myself in a different guise, less fragile and more confident than myself. decided to try anyway aware that we would have suffered and not a little In the song the protagonist instead knows she is not a victim she knows her feminine power she can play with fire and why not be a bastard as much as her partner Her greatest conquest is the awareness that no one will never be able to decide for him and will always be free to choose
