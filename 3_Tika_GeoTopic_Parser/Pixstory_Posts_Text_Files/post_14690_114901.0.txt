An expert in sports and performance psychology, Haley Perlus, PhD and Amy Bragagnini, MS, RD, CSO, an oncology nutrition specialist also shared to Healthline that there are many possible reasons for summertime weight gain. 

They include: 

• sugary summer beverages 

• summer BBQs 

• graduation and wedding celebrations 

• vacation food and drink temptations 

• decrease in regular exercise routine due to attending more events 

Bragagnini says that, “Many people participate in summer weddings, graduations, and family gatherings. There are usually lots of decadent food and beverages at such events. At these gatherings, it is easy to be in a celebratory mode and consume more food and calorie-laden beverages than one would on a typical day."

“When I am on vacation, I often justify my plentiful food and beverages choices by saying the statement, ‘I am on vacation and I can eat and drink whatever I want,’” Bragagnini said. 

She added, “Now, don’t get me wrong, vacation time is a great time to relax and have fun and eat good food. But it is also important to find some balance between eating and drinking and physical activity."
