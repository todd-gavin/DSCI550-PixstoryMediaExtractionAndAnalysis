Former President Donald Trump responded on Wednesday night to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by returning to his false claims that he won the 2020 presidential election.

“It all happened because of a rigged election,” Trump told Fox News.

Trump had described Russian President Vladimir Putin’s advance on his country’s peaceful western neighbor as “genius” and “savvy,” but found harsher words for the American commander-in-chief, including that President Biden was “probably sleeping” when the full invasion started.

The twice-impeached president said Putin acted on Biden’s administration’s “incompetence and the stupidity.”

Biden released a statement late Wednesday saying that “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way.”

“The world will hold Russia accountable,” Biden said in the statement.
