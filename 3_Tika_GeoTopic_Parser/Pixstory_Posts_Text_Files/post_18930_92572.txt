We could have lost but also won Gasperini&#39;s thoughts on the first leg of the quarter-finals of the Europa League can be summed up in this way that his Atalanta drew in Germany against Leipzig It was a daring match in which the players from Bergamo took the lead before conceding return of the opponents stopped by a post and the penalty saved by Musso An own goal from Zappacosta gave the equalizer It was a great match This is Europe, this type of match can only be seen in this type of competition I am satisfied with the performance and how we played the match In the first half we conceded a couple of situations where we lost the ball but overall we had excellent situations We have to be happy The return match in Bergamo in a week&#39;s time If we all stay there we risk going to penalties but due to our characteristics we are destined to play in the opposing half we are able to open the defensive boxes We create a lot and we materialize less if we improve we raise the level
