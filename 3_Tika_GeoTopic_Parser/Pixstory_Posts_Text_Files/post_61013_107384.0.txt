At the corner of this jam session was this guy, Jyotirish. He was pretty good at making small talks and complimenting all those who joined the jam session. I could not imagine that he was 'familiar' with this equipment. On further conversing, I found out how talented he actually is. He is a bass guitarist with expertise in rock and metal music. This experience showed how music can bring everyone and anyone together because he now is one of my closest friends.
