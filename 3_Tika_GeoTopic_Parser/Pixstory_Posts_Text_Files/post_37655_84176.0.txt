Although Alfa Romeo’s C42 already completed F1 pre-season running over three days at Barcelona last week, it did so in camouflage livery which at its official launch today was replaced by an updated variation on Alfa’s traditional red and white colours.

The Swiss team ran a special camouflage design during three days of pre-season running in Barcelona, with Valtteri Bottas, rookie Zhou Guanyu and reserve Robert Kubica sharing driving duties.

A series of mechanical glitches confined the car to the garage for long periods, and they ultimately managed just 175 laps, putting them ninth out of 10 teams in the mileage charts.

They give a clearer impression of the car’s elegant lines and its relatively short wheelbase, within which notable design features include:

• A quite sophisticated front wing
• A push-rod rear suspension (like Red Bull, AlphaTauri and McLaren) and an unusual geometry of its front push-rod layout
• Similar packaging of the Ferrari cooling system, as seen on the Ferrari itself (and the Haas), giving sidepods which are fat but heavily undercut at the front, with heavily louvred sidepod tops.

On Sunday, they became the final squad to launch their season – showcasing a livery that they said is “a subtle nod to the past, recalling historical designs of years past and the heritage of Alfa Romeo and Sauber Motorsport” in what will be the Hinwil team’s 30th year in F1.

"The start of the season is always an exciting time, one in which we see the fruit of the work of hundreds of people over a long period of time,” said Team Principal Fred Vasseur.

“The C42 is a car we look forward to seeing racing, not just because it is the first we built in this new regulations cycle, one in which racing should be closer and more thrilling, but because we have the utmost confidence in this car helping the team make a big step forward towards the front of the grid.”
