Granit Xhaka An under appreciated presence When you think of the star players for Arteta you think of the likes of Saka Odegaard and recently Jesus Saliba Zinchenko Rightly so but one of the most key cogs Granit Xhaka The Swiss midfielder often has a very unfair reputation which gets used to downplay his footballing qualities Since Arteta s arrival Xhaka has been one of the most consistent players at the club Often in a pivot however Granit has taken up a new role which has become especially evident this season and in the nd half of last season the role in Mikel s highly anticipated Xhaka has provided the balance of a strong duel monster who s very complete aerially very good at sensing danger but also being a surprise goal threat with goal contributions in his opening games for Arsenal Aside from just the numbers backing it up the year old s positioning is very telling anticipating loose balls making rd man box runs ultimately adding an extra man to deal with for opponents almost filling a Gundogan type role Despite his evident lack of mobility Xhaka s intelligence partnered with Arteta s flexibility of his squad has showcased Xhaka s versatility too As well as being a surprise dropping deeper often into a back earlier into Arteta s tenure Granit has also filled the makeshift role of Left back allowing new signing Zinchenko to thrive into midfield zones while Xhaka occupies the left side in his absence As the Arsenal squad develops Xhaka does too Fans have become more welcomed to his qualities even creating a chant for him which says a lot about how much the Swiss has improved on and off the pitch under Mikel Arteta after the previous incident which has been mentioned several times at the Emirates A versatile hardworking positionally excellent leader with an immense passing range a great shot a big midfield presence and a great perception of the game Granit Xhaka integral to Arsenal
