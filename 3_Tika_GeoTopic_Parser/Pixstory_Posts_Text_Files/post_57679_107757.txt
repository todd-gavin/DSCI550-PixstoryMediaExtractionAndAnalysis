Hate crimes as it is not difficult to comprehend by their name are motivated by hate or abhorrence towards something A person who commits a hate crime need not actually be motivated by hatred for his or her victim but rather it is his or her expression of prejudice or bias against the victim s presumed group membership that more properly characterizes such crimes They re always motivated by the extreme prejudices that compel people to perform acts that manifest the biased society s profound influence on their minds Since the rise in cases of crimes motivated by hatred more specifically during recent times in America it is hatred for black people it has become essential to understand the viciousness of such crimes and how it not only affects the victim but instead it also traumatizes and harms people in the society According to the FBI s annual hate crime statistics report more than people reported to law enforcement last year that they were the victim of a hate crime because of their race or ethnicity sexual orientation gender religion or disability a number that has been on the rise in recent years The numbers are rising relentlessly in America Hate crimes send a message from the perpetrator to the victim s community or group that they re not welcomed or safe in society It inflicts pain and haunts them to the extent that they suffer from distress or lower self esteem This is why hate crimes are not confined to affecting just the victim it has a greater trap which directs violence toward everyone associated with a particular group religion or community
