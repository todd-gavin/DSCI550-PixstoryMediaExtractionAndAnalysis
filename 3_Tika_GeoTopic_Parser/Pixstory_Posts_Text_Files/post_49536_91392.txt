Hard agree I don t think movies or even series for that matter can do justice to the books It just cannot Like you said everytime we read a book we create a mental image of it in our heads The characters their looks even the sets From a bookshelf to a castle we just have our own imagery for it For a reader having all of that being given a concrete shape takes away a big portion of the experience from us I am a fan of details I like analyzing I like observing the intricacies And that is something that s always overlooked in the live adaptations of the books I think it s very very rare when they get it right They re two completely different mediums and the film will have to cut out a lot of what the book has to offer There s a sense of having to choose what will and won t fit into the running time Many times they interpret a scene or characterization differently Books give a lot of scope to imagine which movies don t Reading a book would be a totally different experience for two people however when it becomes a movie we re forced to have the same perception Oftentimes movies completely change how some things were supposed to be In The Giver for example Asher Jonas witty pal takes a darker turn The film s producers may have desired greater drama between the two characters but their friendship was shattered in the process Another example is Wonder s film adaptation August s hearing aids aren t included in the film Hearing aids are not even mentioned in the film Auggie s difficulty adjusting to school is significantly reduced without them Hearing aides were a significant stumbling block for Auggie throughout the book I m big on leaving books alone There can be great great movies without ruining the reading experience of so many people Or at the very least include the main details in the adaptations
