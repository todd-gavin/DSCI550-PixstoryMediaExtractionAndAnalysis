The World Health Organisation (WHO) have been tracking on the sublineages of the Covid variant Omicron, which involves BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3. Its looking into the real world data and are analysing if these subvariants could be more severe disease under the experimental conditions while testing on the hamsters. 

We are aware about various sublineages of the Covid variant Omicron and the most well known among the public are BA.1 and BA. 2. The third subvariant of Omicron is being tracked which is called as the BA.3 by analysing the real world data to understand its causes which could be "more severe disease". 

Maria Van Kerkhove, the infectious disease expert of WHO stated that Omicron will still remain as a concern and they are tracking on various sublineages of the variant. "The most prominent ones that are detected worldwide are BA.1, BA.1.1 and BA.2. There's also BA.3 and other sublineages as well," she said.


To know more about this Omicron sublineage, a study titled 'Emergence of Omicron third lineage BA.3 and its importance', and published in the Journal of Medical Virology, was conducted in January. It sheds light on how the global health bodies should be looking at Omicron BA.3. 

What is Omcron BA.3? 

After the emergence of Omcron in November 2021 in Botswana, the WHO classified it as the fifth variant of concern. It found that Omicron was also the most mutated variant of SARS-CoV-2 so far, which had now circulated in 150 countries/territories until January 8, 2022. Omicron has three lineages BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3. The study showed that both BA.1 and BA.2 lineages differ in their spike protein but there were no specific mutations for the BA.3 lineage in spike protein, it said, adding that it's a combination of mutations in BA.1 and BA.2 spike proteins.
