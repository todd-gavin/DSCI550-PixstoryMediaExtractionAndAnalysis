As per Metro, the Blues were asked to back out of the "Haaland transfer race" by the scouts. The scouts had reportedly raised questions about the Norwegian's playing style. 

The Blues were linked with the Borussia Dortmund striker before signing Romelu Lukaku last season. But according to the reports, the Chelsea scouts felt that Erling Haaland would find it difficult to adjust to the Premier League. 

The scouts reportedly felt that Haaland is being given a lot of space in the Bundesliga and hence he is able to make explosive runs in Germany. However, they felt that this would not be possible in the Premier League.

Hence, the London-based club backed out from signing Erling Haaland in the summer. The 21-year-old has since signed with Chelsea's rivals Manchester City. Hence the Norwegian would have a chance to prove the scouts wrong next season. 

Not just Chelsea, but other European clubs also reportedly had doubts over Erling Haaland's transfer. Barcelona reportedly raised questions about the striker's personality and character. 

Real Madrid on the other hand fought Manchester City for Erling Haaland until the last few days. However, the Spanish giants eventually backed out due to injury concerns regarding the 21-year-old.

Following the snub from Chelsea and other European clubs, Erling Haaland eventually signed up with Manchester City. The Sky Blues have reportedly signed the Norwegian on a four-year deal. 


The Borussia Dortmund striker has scored 85 goals in 88 appearances for the German giants. Hence Erling Haaland is certainly coming into the Premier League with a lot of hype. It has to be seen if he can prove his doubters wrong at Manchester City.
