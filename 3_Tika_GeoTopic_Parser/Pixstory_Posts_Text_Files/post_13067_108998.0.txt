The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) says that only a small proportion of refugees are resettled in migrant countries as the number of refugees increases worldwide. Last year, only 39,000 people were transferred to these countries through the United Nations.

According to AFP, Afghans are the second largest migrant population in the world, after the Syrian people, seeking refuge in UN-sponsored countries. According to the organization, 200,00074,000 Afghan refugees have applied to immigrate to a third country.

Currently, most of these refugees live in Iran and Pakistan with unclear legal and economic status. They hope that the UN will help them settle in Western countries.

In April, a number of Afghan refugees in Pakistan protested in front of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Islamabad against the unclear situation and the slow pace of processing. Wearing a shroud, they chanted "Kill us" and called on the United Nations to speed up registration, distribution of immigration cards and transfer to other countries.

The organization called on immigrant countries to increase the process of resettlement of deserving refugees. Especially since more than two million people are expected to need to settle in immigrant countries next year.
There are more than 27 million refugees in the world, most of them living in poor countries.
Currently, only the United States, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Scandinavian countries cooperate with the High Commissioner for Refugees in the field of refugee accommodation
