Being a Vegetarian is good being a vegan is super good. Vegetarians often travel to veganism. My journey being a Vegetarian is when I realised it is not only good for my body but also the planet. When so many other options are available it is cruel to kill animals for food as they also have the right to live on this planet. Animals are sentimental beings that have emotions and social connections. Scientific studies show that cattle, pigs, chickens, and all warm-blooded animals can experience stress, pain, and fear. Many animals before killing are confined and tortured. Some of them are tortured from birth until death for meat. 

Many fights against the fact that a vegetarian diet isn't efficient and doesn't provide the right amount of protein. But it is wrong. It is a proven fact that a vegetarian diet can meet protein requirements, provide all the necessary amino acids and improve health. It can also provide all the necessary vitamins, fats, and minerals, and can enhance one’s health.

A vegetarian diet can also prevent the overuse of antibiotics. Studies have tied heme iron found in red meat with an increased risk of colorectal, stomach, and oesophagal cancers. Vegetarian sources of iron like leafy greens and beans contain non-heme iron which has zero risk factors. Moreover, it contributes to the environment in many ways. Animals are being over-grazed for meat and reducing it would restore land more naturally suited to provide habitat for native plants and animals. A vegetarian diet leads to lessened greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gases are created by enteric fermentation, manure decomposition, and deforestation to make room for grazing animals and growing feed. A study found that diets including meat cause the creation of up to 54% more greenhouse gas emissions than vegetarian diets. 

These are some merits in many of being a vegetarian or vegan so it's your call to choose a healthy lifestyle before it's too late.
