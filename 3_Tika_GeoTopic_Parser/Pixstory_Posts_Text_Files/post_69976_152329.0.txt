Why doctors always  say don't wash your vahlgina?🧽🚿

The thing is you can use soap or water on your vulva which is the outer part of your genitals, but inside in your vagina nothing, that long canal in the inside you should not put anything, no soap no water.🧼🚿
Your vagina is a self cleaning organ. 
Inside your vagina you've got lots of good bacteria these are your cheerleaders and your army.👯👮 
They fight all of the bad infections, funguses, viruses, parasites, all the bad things to make sure your vagina is clean, healthy and happy.🥳
Sometimes however you put soap and water inside. What this does is kills all the good fantastic bacteria.They die of slow tragic death and then the bad guys step in.😈
With The good bacteria gone, the bad bacteria start causing a pH change, infection, irritation and having a bad bacteria party inside your vagina.🤡👹🎊
It's a bad idea overall.🤷
Just don't wash your vagina🚿🙅
