The year is And I thought what we wear on our head is not anyones business Feminism and women empowerment taught us that a strong women doesn t need anyone to tell her about what to wear and what to do But due to the past few event there s an ongoing confusion about hijab and it s compulsion To be fair growing up as a hijabi wasn t the easiest for me The strange stare full of questions the Pity the look that clearly made me feel like I didn t belong here has left me with so many questions to raise and words to write Through centuries all of us dreamed to see a Developed modern and free India but who knew that it is still enslaved to its people man made ideologies or a sect of society who still think it s okay to decide how to dress and what to eat If we think about it hijab is not only a piece of fabric or just another religious obligation that you can ask people to stop doing it s sometimes a person s identity and could mean them more than anything I have been wearing the hijab since I was and back then it was just another religious obligation that I was fulfilling like praying times or observing fasts etc In after I passed out high school and got enrolled in a college I couldn t let go of my Hijab I was in an all women college but yet I couldn t bring myself to take if off This made me realise that the Hijab had become a part of my identity a part of who I was as an individual amongst thousands others Atifa haroon student of Jamia Millia Islamia
