 If you cast your mind back to last April, you might recall that several images of Zac Efron went viral across social media after fans noticed that his face looked pretty different.
For those who missed it, Zac attracted attention online after he appeared in Bill Nye’s Earth Day special, and several internet users speculated that he’d altered his face with plastic surgery.
“I refuse to believe this is Zac Efron,” one person tweeted. Another wrote: “Holy shit I can’t believe Zac Efron is Handsome Squidward.”
And while many fans defended the That Awkward Moment star, Zac’s face quickly became the subject of many memes and ongoing mockery.
A year and a half later, Zac ended up addressing the debacle this month, explaining during an interview with Men’s Health that he’d previously been injured in a severe accident that left his jaw completely shattered.
Revealing that he’d slipped while running through his house in socks, Zac said that he hit his chin on a granite fountain and lost consciousness. When he awoke, the actor said that his chin bone was “hanging off” his face.
The incident occurred in 2013 and caused Zac to have his mouth wired shut. He also sustained a gash so deep that it required stitches, per E! News.
And as a result of breaking his jaw, Zac said that his other facial muscles — namely the masseters, which are used for chewing — had to “compensate,” ultimately leading his jaw to look different.
“The masseters just grew,” he said. “They just got really, really big.”
“I started to develop insomnia,” he said. “I fell into a pretty bad depression, for a long time. Something about that experience burned me out. I had a really hard time recentering. Ultimately they chalked it up to taking way too many diuretics for way too long, and it messed something up.”
