Vegans reject the cruelty associated with eating meat Regardless of how one feels about the flavour of animal products becoming a vegan is the result of the repulsion to the suffering and death that accompany those animals Some people choose food that has a comparable flavour and texture but doesn t contain any dead animals We replicate animal foods using non animal sources because we grew up eating them enjoy the taste and are accustomed to them There is nothing improper about that Why shouldn t we consume a similar tasting meat burger if we can avoid subjecting someone to such horrifying tortures and without killing them directly Why must that cruelty be a part of the process anyway Humans are creatures of comfort and we tend to find comfort in food associated with our childhood Many people crave their traditional food It s okay for them to want it back without compromising on their morals
