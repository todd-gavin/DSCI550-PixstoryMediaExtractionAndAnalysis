As per reports, following Maradona's death, prosecutors are pushing for eight medical professionals to be found guilty of negligent homicide, an Argentine court ruling made public on Wednesday has shown.

As per the Sun, The footballer's doctor Leopoldo Luque, his psychiatrist Agustina Cosachov, his psychologist Carlos Diaz, and his medical coordinator Nancy Forlini are amongÂ eight health professionals told they are now under formal investigation on suspicion of a type of homicide. The trial is set to begin in late 2023 and the people involved could face a sentence of up to 25 years if found guilty.
