Love for my country made me proud to say that I am an  Afghan wherever I am asked about my nationality.
Yes! I am an Afghan and I am proud of that.
Some may look down on me,
Some may belittle me and some may even insult my country,
But they do not know where Afghanistan is and what its people are like.
Afghanistan is a land of love and sacrifice and I was born in Afghanistan!
So I will solve all those insults and humiliations in the sea of forgiveness and my love.
