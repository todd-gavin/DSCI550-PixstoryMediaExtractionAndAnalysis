Abstract 

Background and aims 

Evaluating the impact of Ramadan fasting on Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) among Patients with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) using Flash Glucose Monitoring (FGM) System. 

Methods 

The present study is a comparative study, performed using 87 patients with T1D, whose health status permitted them to fast, based on the risk stratification adopted by Diabetes and Ramadan (DAR Guidelines). Besides the demographic data, other data connected with the glycemic profile such as the mean Time in Range (TIR), mean Time Above Range (TAR), mean Time Below Range (TBR), mean glucose level, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), Glucose Variability (GV), and Glucose Monitoring Indicator (GMI %), were recorded at three specific periods, namely, pre- (prior to), during and post Ramadan. 

Results 

The mean age of the study population was 24.3 ± 8.2 years, and 52.9% of this population was female. Compared to the pre-Ramadan data, no significant alterations (p > 0.05) were noted in terms of the low glucose events, percentage of glucose level below 70 mg/dL, the average duration of hypoglycemic events, and percentage of glucose level below 54 mg/dL, from the values observed during and post-Ramadan. In comparison with the pre-Ramadan data, no significant changes appeared (p > 0.05) concerning the GV, average glucose, GMI, percentage within target, TAR (181–250 mg/dL), and percentage >250 mg/dL), for the periods during and post-Ramadan, except scanning of FreeStyle Libre (p = 0.042) during Ramadan month compared to pre-Ramadan. 

Conclusion 

Fasting during Ramadan was achievable in patients with T1D who received adequate counseling and support.
