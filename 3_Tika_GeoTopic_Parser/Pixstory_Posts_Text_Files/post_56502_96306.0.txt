A Sydney apartment has been listed for sale with a large lift designed to bring cars from road level into the living room.

The McMahons Point home overlooking the harbour was built with the hydraulic feature in 2019.  

According to the listing, residents can “drive straight into the lift for the ultimate in direct and private secure entry.”

A metal plate behind a garage door at ground level lifts vehicles approximately six metres into a private room within the 315 square-metre complex.

A promotional video published with the sale demonstrates the unique feature with a white Bentley Continental coupe.

The property also includes two underground car spaces, with drawings of a Ferrari and Aston Martin convertible depicted on floor plans.

No price guide is provided for the apartment, however according to CoreLogic it last sold in February 2021 for $7.8 million.

A Vaucluse mansion sold earlier this year for $62 million had a private 20-car garage underground.

The recently-listed McMahons Point property will go under the hammer on 14 May 2022.
