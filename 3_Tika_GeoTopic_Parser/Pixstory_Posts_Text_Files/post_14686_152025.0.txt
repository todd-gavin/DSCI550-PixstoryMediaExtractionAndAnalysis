New studies from the National Cancer Institute talks about how lifting weights reduces an older person's risk of premature death, especially while pumping iron with aerobic exercise is also done with it. 
The researchers stated that the more stronger the muscles mean, more protection against every life threatening illness and better mental health. 
The researchers noted that the strongest results happen among women. 
Researchers also said that lifting weights is better for the body, as it makes it leaner and it also improves the mental well being as the gyms are social environments. 
“Our finding that mortality risk appeared to be lowest for those who participated in both types of exercise provides strong support for current recommendations to engage in both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities,” researchers said, in a statement. “Older adults would probably benefit from adding weightlifting exercises to their physical activity routines.” 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that adults require 150 minutes of moderate to intense physical activity and two days of muscle strengthening activity in a week.
