Let's start with a definition of shrinkflation.

Wait, definitions aren't required to comprehend the phenomenon. It's been going on all around us for a long time, and we're all well aware of it.
Let's use a chocolate bar as an example. Have you noticed how chocolate bars are'shrinking?'
The amount of chocolate has obviously decreased. 'Shrinkage' refers to the amount of anything that has shrunk.

Various brands in the Food and Beverage business have been shrinking their quantities.
Shrinkflation is a strategy used by businesses to boost profit margins while lowering costs. But they also know that we, as buyers, are more likely to notice product price rises rather than the size of them.

More money is squeezed out by pricing the same amount for a package that contains somewhat less.
It's a win for a business. It's a good strategy to improve or maintain profit margins for a while without attracting too much notice.

A tiny box of Kleenex in the United States currently contains 60 tissues, compared to 65 a few months ago. Chobani Flips yoghurts have been reduced in size from 5.3 oz. to 4.5 oz. Nestle reduced the size of Nescafe Azera Americano coffee tins in the United Kingdom from 100 to 90 grammes. A bar of Vim dish soap in India has been reduced in size from 155 grammes to 135 grammes.

Some businesses are up front about the adjustments. Calbee Inc., a Japanese snack company, said in May that many of its products, including veggie chips and crispy edamame, would be 10% lighter – and 10% more expensive — than before. A substantial increase in raw material costs was blamed by the corporation.
In January, Domino's Pizza announced that its 10-piece chicken wings would be reduced to eight pieces for the same $7.99 carryout pricing. The high cost of chicken was cited by Domino's.
