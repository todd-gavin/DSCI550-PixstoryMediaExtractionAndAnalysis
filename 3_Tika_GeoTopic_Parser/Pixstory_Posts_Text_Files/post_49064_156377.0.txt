The dairy industry puts cows through literal hell during their lifetimes. They are treated like commodities from the moment they enter this world. Cows suffer from agonizing medical ailments as a result of special ties being broken on a regular basis.
Cows produce milk just for their offspring, just like humans. As a result, every year they are forcibly impregnated. A mother and her children are subjected to a horrific cycle that culminates in their slaughter.
Cows, like humans, have strong maternal instincts, yet in factory dairy farms, a mother's attachment with her calf has no place. Calves are snatched away from their mothers shortly after birth, never to be seen again. Every year of a cow's life, she will have to go through this agonizing process. Instead, the milk she provides for her calf is stolen from her and sold to the human population.
Calves will spend most of their life in cruel confinement after being taken away from their moms. In fact, most will spend their first two to three months of existence confined in barren hutches, fed a diet of milk replacer while people sip the milk meant for them.
Over 90% of dairy cows in the United States are confined to mostly indoor operations, with more than 60% chained by the neck within barren cubicles, unable to conduct even the most basic activities necessary for their well-being.
Is being a vegetarian enough?
No. The dairy industry's cows have the same fate as the meat industry's cows. When their milk production drops, they are slaughtered. No cow is permitted to live out their normal 25-year lifespan. In truth, the dairy sector exploits cows, and 20% of the beef sold in shops comes from them.
Cows are forced into stun boxes after being hauled over great distances. They are shot in the head inside these chambers in order to render them unconscious. In fact, when their throats are sliced, many are still conscious.
Ditch dairy today for a better life for these innocent beings.
