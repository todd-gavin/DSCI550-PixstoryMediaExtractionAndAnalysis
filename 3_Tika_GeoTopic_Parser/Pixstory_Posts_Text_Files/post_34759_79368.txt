Ingredients Medium sized potatoes cloves of garlic gr of extra virgin olive oil teaspoon of paprika about gr salt to taste Preparation Wash the potatoes and put them still with their skin on in a saucepan with cold water and a handful of salt Many say not to add salt cooking water from the potatoes to prevent them from flaking for me they have never flaked and therefore I put salt Cover the pot with a lid until it comes to a boil then remove the lid and let it finish cooking The cooking time obviously depends always on the size of the potatoes Before removing them from the heat, check the cooking by inserting a toothpick or a fork into the potatoes. They must be soft inside. When they are soft inside, remove them from the water and peel them while they are still warm so they peel more easily. Once you have peeled the potatoes, let them cool and cut them into pieces At this point you can arrange the chunks of baby food in a salad bowl, salt them again if necessary and set them aside Peel the garlic and put it in a saucepan with the extra virgin olive oil and do it fry When the garlic is golden, turn off the heat and immediately add the paprika to the saucepan so that the paprika will also suffer and when the heat is off, it will not burn. With the oil obtained, season the potatoes and mix them gently. Now that the potatoes are seasoned, put them in a dish serve them both hot by passing them for a moment in the microwave oven and cold However hot or cold they are delicious and I can assure you that when I prepare them at home they are very successful and there are never any leftovers Advice on burns a slice of raw potato relieves the burning they are used for soothe redness and itching of the skin
