Troppo is based on Candice Fox's best-selling Crimson Lake thrillers and stars and is executive produced by Thomas Jane (The Expanse). 

As per collider, Jane plays Ted Conkaffey, an ex-cop and American expat who hides out in the tropics of Far North Queensland after being wrongly accused of committing a heinous murder. While there, he becomes entangled in a missing person inquiry that leads to the death of Amanda Pharrell (Nicole Chamoun), a convicted murderer with her own dark secrets. 

Snakes, crocodiles, sugar cane fields, and mangroves abound in this distinctly Australian landscape, and the hazy tropical heat literally pours from the TV screen.

Although, I felt while the plotting may be sluggish at times — like a Far North Queensland summer day — Troppo’s complex storyline and diversity of supporting characters make for a compelling crime drama about second chances.
