One year after the fall of Kabul, the American Time magazine published an article about the Afghan women's stand, and devoted its cover design to a photo of Hasina Najibi and Rihana Rahimi, two Afghan female pilots. These two young ladies are wearing the air force uniform of the former government of Afghanistan.

Stating that for many Afghan women, the domination of the Taliban meant the end of the freedoms they had enjoyed for two decades, this publication wrote that it was not easy for them to start over.

 Afghan women are suffering for their homeland and their loved ones and they are not sure when they will see it again.
Time describes the pains that Afghan women endure and writes that they often return to Afghanistan in their sleep and spend their days learning new languages ​​while struggling with new identities. While the women who left Afghanistan are lucky, they feel betrayed by the world that promised to stand by them. According to this magazine, Afghan women are mourning the loss of freedoms that have cast a shadow over several generations of this country.

In its new article dedicated to Afghan women, Time magazine has tried to tell the story of hope and resilience of eight Afghan women who are building a new life far from their homeland on the coast of Florida to the suburbs of Dublin.
