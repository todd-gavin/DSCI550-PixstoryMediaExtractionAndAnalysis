At the American outdoor track and field championships on Saturday, Olympic champion Sydney McLaughlin smashed her own world record in the 400-meter hurdles. 

US News reported that when her time was called, McLaughlin grinned widely and gave a thumbs-up. She broke her own record at Hayward Field, finishing in 51.41 seconds as opposed to the 51.46 she had set the year prior in the Tokyo Games, where she had won the gold medal.

“I mean it's Track Town USA, what do you expect? she said afterward. “Every time I come here I can just feel something amazing is going to happen.”

Asked how she was going to celebrated afterward, McLaughlin joked: “Eating some real food besides vegetables. Like a cheeseburger or something, some pancakes.”

Moreover, the top three finishers in each event at the national championships will represent the United States in the world outdoor championships, also at Eugene's Hayward Field, next month. It is the first time that track and field's biggest event outside of the Olympics will be held on American soil.
