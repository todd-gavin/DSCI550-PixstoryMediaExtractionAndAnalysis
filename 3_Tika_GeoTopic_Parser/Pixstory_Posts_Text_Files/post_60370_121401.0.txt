1. Ik Jun

While I was watching him on screen, it actually felt like he's wearing these glasses which let him see the pain the other person is experiencing. He is funny, extremely smart and is outgoing. He's everything we love to see in a male lead. Best dad, best brother, best best friend and the best doctor.

2. Choi ung

Unlike other male leads who'd fume up when they come to know that their best friend has feelings for their girlfriend, Choi Ung chose to turn a blind eye and kept being the best friend he always was to Ji Ung. Plus, he gave a second chance to Yeon Soo who broke up with him terribly. 

3. Chief Hong

A male lead character who would make you go "my whole life was a lie". Chief Hong chooses peace over luxury, people over things and love over money. His way of life is worth incorporating. It's soothing to see a male lead who's living his life to the fullest without running behind anything.

4. Hwi Young

The fact that he portrayed himself as a coward who doesn't know anything other than writing cheesy novels so that his real identity of being a brave revolutionary doesn't get revealed, gave me goosebumps. He lived and died for his country. Truly a character that demands respect.

5. Yoon Jae

A very relatable male lead character. The way he loved Shi Won is the way we all want to be loved. Plus, the fact that he decided to vanish from Shi Won's life bc of his love for his brother, made me respect him more. He taught us how to love and the importance family holds in our life.
