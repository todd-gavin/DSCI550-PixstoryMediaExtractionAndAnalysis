Priyanka Chopra launched her haircare line Anomaly earlier this year. The product line instantly became a favourite as it is one of the few beauty and care brands that is entirely cruelty free, vegan and eco- conscious that caters to a wide variety of hair types. The brand was primarily launched in the USA and was carried by places like Target and others.

So it comes as a joyous revelation to Indians when Priyanka Chopra Jonas finally took to Instagram to announce the launch of Anomaly in India in collaboration with Nykaa. The brand is going to be launching on the official website as well as offline stores across India. The brand promises to be beneficial to all hair types and provides a large range of products
 
The actress was seen gushing in the post about the launch scheduled for 26th of August and how she is excited to have the product be launched in her home country. "26.08.22… mark the date because anomalyhaircare will now be available in India. I can’t even begin to explain how excited I am to share this news with you," she wrote on Instagram.
 
"It’s only fitting that Anomaly is coming home to India, where the seed for this idea was born so many years ago… with the traditions of a strong haircare routine that was instilled in me. We’ve combined that understanding with our clean, superior formulas that will give you your best hair yet," she added.
