Let's settle the age-old debate once and for all. Delhi v/s Kolkata, which city has the best street food and why is it Kolkata? Because let's face it, CCU cuisine is supreme.

Delhi is infamous for shitting on diversity and this phenomenon is evident in their street food. Kolkata street food is a seamless amalgamation of native and immigrant. Bengali, Chinese, Tibetian, all three cuisines coexist in harmony.

Phuchkas are made with a mixture of boiled gram, while gol gappas are made with sooji. Therefore scientifically the integrity of the phuchka is superior, thus declaring them the better option.

Indo-Chinese cuisine traces back to Hakka Chinese traders who immigrated to Kolkata during the late 1700s when it was the capital of the British empire in India. While Kolkata created a fiery fusion of flavours that left a mark on history, Delhi doused it in orange gravy. Not cool.

Unlike Delhi, Kolkata street food doesn't need burning masala. Kolkata seasoning is a gentle burst of spice leaving behind a zesty, tangy sensation. Health again.

Take a walk around the bustling streets of Tiretti Bazaar that'll stuff the freshest sea (or in our case, river) food down the throats of any authentic Chinese lover. One trip here and you'll forget all about Delhi Chinese. From fresh steaming seafood dumplings and fish sui mais to fishball soups, coconut balls, rice and sesame seed sweet balls, sticky rice and even pies, the place serves homecooked fish in a way nowhere else can.

Chilly pork, breaded pork chops, steamed pork momos, pork thupka: street food is empty without them. And in Delhi, they're a rare sight.

Luchi ghugni is 100 times lighter than chole bhature which requires ten Digenes to ingest.

Sorry Delhi, you might think that your street food is cheap, but anything above 100 bucks is considered an absurd amount in Kolkata.

By the way, why is all Delhi street food orange?
