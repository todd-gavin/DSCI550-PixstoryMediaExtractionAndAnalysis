The Sacramento Kings have reached a four-year agreement to hire Mike Brown as their next head coach, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reports. Terms of the deal weren't initially reported.

The Kings selected Brown from a reported list of candidates that included fellow head-coaching veterans Mike D'Antoni, Steve Clifford and Mark Jackson. Sacramento's vacancy is the first filled this offseason as the Los Angeles Lakers and Charlotte Hornets continue to conduct their searches after firing Frank Vogel and James Borrego, respectively.

Brown, 52, has spent the last six seasons as an assistant under head coach Steve Kerr with the Golden State Warriors. The Kings job marks his fourth head-coaching stop in the NBA after previously leading the Los Angeles Lakers and the Cleveland Cavaliers in two separate stints.

Brown has seven-plus seasons of head-coaching experience, spending 2005-10 in Cleveland before joining the Lakers from 2011-12. He was fired early in his second season with the Lakers following a 1-4 start. He returned to coach the Cavaliers for a single season in 2013. He holds a 347-216 (61.6%) record as head coach and was named NBA Coach of the Year in 2009.

Brown will continue his role on the Warriors bench as Golden State remains in the playoffs, according to the report.
