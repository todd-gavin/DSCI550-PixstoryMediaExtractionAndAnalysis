18) 21-23rd October- United States

The Circuit of the Americas will be the second race to be held in the United States following the inaugural edition of the Miami Grand Prix. The 2021 United States Grand Prix concluded with Max drawing the top spot as Hamilton could only manage to finish second despite Redbull opting for a two-stop strategy. 

19) 28-30th October- Mexico

Located in the heartlands of Mexico City, the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez will serve as the circuit for the Mexican Grand Prix. The bumpy racetrack makes overtaking almost impossible, making tire selection and pit strategy the difference between a win and a loss. This was evident in the 2021Mexican Grand Prix as Max undercut Hamilton and was able to successfully close the gap to first place.

20) 11-13th November- Brazil

The Interlagos circuit will serve as the home to the Brazilian Grand Prix, at least until 2025. It’s one of the only circuits to run in a counter clock-wise direction which remains a rarity in today’s day and age of modern racing. In the 2021 Brazilian Grand Prix, Hamilton climbed back to the top of the leaderboard as he finished ahead of the Dutchman. Will one of them lift the title or will we see the crowning of a new champion in LeClerc this year?
