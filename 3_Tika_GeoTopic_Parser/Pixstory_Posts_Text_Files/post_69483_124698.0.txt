Doodhpathri is a meadow in Kashmir’s Budgam district that is steeped in local legend. Legend has it that the Kashmiri saint Sheikh ul Aalam Sheikh Noor din Noorani came here in search of water, but instead found milk. As a result, the meadow was given the name Doodhpathri. Picnickers and trekkers flock to Doodhpatri, which is now one of Kashmir’s quietest destinations. Not only does the meadow contain some of the most beautiful picnic spots in the hill station, but it also contains several moderately difficult hiking trails.
