The quick ascent of Darius Garland to NBA elite rank is over. 

The Associated Press was informed on Saturday that Cleveland's All-Star point guard has reached a five-year, $193 million agreement. 

US Sports reported that the Cavaliers think that by signing Garland to the largest contract in the team's history, they can once again compete at the top of the NBA. 

Garland, who was selected with the fifth overall choice in 2019, has immediately emerged as one of the greatest guards in the league. In 68 games last season, he contributed 21.7 points and 8.6 assists on average, helping the Cavaliers win 22 more games than the year before.

The 22-year-old Garland's statistics have gotten better each season, but he has also developed as a leader for a Cleveland club that is on the rise and narrowly missed the playoffs last year. Along with forward Evan Mobley and All-Star centre Jarrett Allen, he forms a crucial part of the club. 

Garland accepted the same deal that Memphis Grizzlies player Ja Morant, another outstanding young guard, had committed to earlier in the week as the rest of the league's offseason transactions got under way. 

Garland would start earning slightly over $33 million in the first year of his agreement, which starts in the 2023–24 season, then steadily increase to $44 million in 2027–28.
