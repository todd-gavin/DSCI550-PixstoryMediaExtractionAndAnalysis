One of the top contenders for the France's President's post is far right candidate Eric Zemmour. And hate towards the Muslims is his central plank. If he becomes the president, his agenda includes banning women from wearing Muslim headscarves in public and prohibiting the construction of any "imposing" mosques in France.

Another frontrunner and last presidential elections' runner-up Marine Le Pe is also running a very anti-immigrant and what is considered anti-minority campaign to garner more votes than the incumbent president Emmanuel Macron.

How could Macron not do anything to show that he was taking steps to control "radical Islam"? Macron announced a new body 'The Forum of Islam in France' to "reshape" Islam. This comes weeks after the state-backed French Council of Muslim Worship (CFCM) was dissolved as it was "completely paralysed" and failed in the mission for which it was created in 2003.  

With these moves, Is France on a dangerous path of fighting its own Muslim citizens?

Macron's government says that it will train imams in France instead of bringing them in from Turkey, Morocco or Algeria. It could also break the leadership of clerics, which many within France are important to let independent voices rise and challenge the established practice.

Muslims in France are saying that some the steps by the new group may not result in a reduction in discrimination of Muslims in public life. Supporters of the new move say that foreign influence on French Muslims will be minimal and, hence, good for the country. As it comes just before the elections, it is being seen a political move. 

Last month, the French Senate voted in favor of the ban on wearing the hijab and other "conspicuous religious symbols" in sports competitions. While some Muslim women supported the move, many have opposed it. (https://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/2022/muslim-women-footballers-in-france-campaign-against-hijab-ban-in-competitions/)

France has around 5.7 million Muslims as it citizens and this is the largest Muslim population in Europe. (https://www.statista.com/statistics/1058154/women-wearing-hijab-france/)
