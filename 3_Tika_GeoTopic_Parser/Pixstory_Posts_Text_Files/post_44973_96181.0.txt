Mohamed Salah has stated that he does not know whether or not he will be able to agree to a new deal with Liverpool, emphasizing that the talks are not just about money.

The Premier League's top scorer is presently leading Liverpool's hunt for an unprecedented 
quadruple, and he sat down with FourFourTwo to discuss his five incredibly successful years 
since joining the Reds from Roma in 2017.

Salah has been in talks with Liverpool for a new contract for some time, but no agreement has 
yet been reached, with his current term set to expire next summer-and the Egyptian claimed 
that the present stumbling block isn't entirely financial.

Salah told FFT: "I don't know. I have one year left." When asked if he was sure about staying at Anfield for a long time, Salah replied: "I don't know, I have one year left." I believe the 
supporters understand what I want, but the deal isn't only about the money. So, I'm not sure, and I can't give you a precise answer. I've just got a year left, and the fans already know what I want."

Salah also stated that he is unconcerned about entering the last year of his current contract 
without a deal. He explained: "I'm not concerned; I don't allow myself to be concerned." 

"Since the season hasn't been over yet, let's complete it as best we canâ€”that's the most important thing." Then we'll wait until the end of the year to see what happens."

Salah's intention to stay at Liverpool for many more years is demonstrated by his aim to one day break Ian Rush's club record of 346 goals. He presently has 155 goals, which places him tenth all-time among Liverpool's best scorers. Hopefully, I'll be the first one before I go, "he remarked.

"It's more than 300, which is quite a lot."
