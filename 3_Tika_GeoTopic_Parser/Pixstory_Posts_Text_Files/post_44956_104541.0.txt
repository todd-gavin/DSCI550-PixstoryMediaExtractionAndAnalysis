After eight years, the former Spanish midfielder is bidding farewell to Old Trafford, with
his countryman wishing him well on his way.

David De Gea posted a heartfelt tribute to Juan Mata after it was confirmed the
midfielder would leave Manchester United after eight years this summer.

The ex-Spain international arrived at the club in 2014 and was one of the key figures on
the pitch of the post-Alex Ferguson era at Old Trafford.

The Veteran moves on now in search of further game-time however, following Paul
Pogba and Jessie Lingard through the road - and now goalkeeper Dea Gea has
reflected on his time alongside the playmaker in emotional terms.

What has Dea Gea said about Mata?

“Though this would be a very difficult one to express in words when I thought about it
more, the main feeling I am left with is happiness.” De Gea wrote in a long Instagram
post.

“This guy has been a teammate, a friend and is my family. The ultimate professional,
one of the best players and people you could have graced your life. I am so thankful to
have been on so many journeys with you, happy that our paths crossed and we shared
a dressing room.

“I love you, my brother, I wish you everything and absolutely nothing but joy and
success in your next stage of an unbelievable career.”

A Champions League winner with Chelsea and World Cup and European
Championship victor with Spain before he arrived at Old Trafford, Mata landed at the
Theatre Of Dreams as David Moyes’ flagship mid-season purchase in January 2014.
