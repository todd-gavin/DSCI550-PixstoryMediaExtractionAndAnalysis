The Biden administration tried to downplay American intelligence's role in the high-profile sinking of the Russian missile cruiser Moskva on Friday, attempting to distance itself from any direct involvement in one of Russia's biggest embarrassments since it attacked Ukraine. 

US News reported that the White House and Pentagon portrayed a limited participation in last month's strike and said the Ukrainians make their own decisions, a day after an American official confirmed that the US gave Ukraine with information on the position of the ship. 

The attempt mirrored President Joe Biden's delicate balancing act of promoting further assistance for Ukraine while fending off charges that he isn't doing enough and avoiding a direct confrontation with Russia.

“We had no prior knowledge of Ukraine’s intent to target the ship,” White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. “The Ukrainians have their own intelligence capabilities to track and target Russian naval vessels, as they did in this case.”

The administration has provided more than $3.4 billion in military assistance to Ukraine with strong bipartisan support, and US personnel are actively training Ukrainian troops in the use of howitzers, drones, and other gear in a battle now concentrated on the country's eastern Donbas region. 

On Friday, the White House announced an additional $150 million in military aid, which included artillery rounds, radar systems capable of detecting artillery projectiles, and other items.
