 External affairs minister S Jaishankar took a jibe at china and Pakistan in his UNGA addressal targeting the cross border terrorism He targeted China on its opposition to the UN s blacklisting of terrorists stating that The United nations responds to terrorism by sanctioning its perpetrators Those who politicize UNSC sanctions regime sometimes even to the extent of defending proclaimed terrorists do so at their own peril They advance neither their own interests nor indeed their reputation The resolution of UNSC puts sanctions against organisations which supports or finances the activities of terrorist groups like ISIS Al Qaeda JEM and similar organizations On September China blocked a proposal moved at the United Nations by the US and co supported by India to designate Lashkar e Taiba LeT terrorist Sajid Mir as a global terrorist who was involved in the Mumbai attacks This is the third time that China has blocked an India US proposal in recent months after protecting Abdul Rehman Makki LeT and Jamaat ud Dawa JuD leader as well as Abdul Rauf Azhar the brother of Jaish e Mohammed JEM chief Masood Azhar On the other hand Pakistan s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif made false accusations against India on Kashmir while Islamabad has been supporting cross border terrorism in the region Though his statement was contrary as the country that wants peace would never shelter conspirators of Mumbai bomb blasts Jaishankar then opposed Pakistan s support of cross border terrorism stating that Having borne the brunt of cross border terrorism for decades India firmly advocates a zero tolerance approach In our view there is no justification for any act of terrorism regardless of motivation And no rhetoric however sanctimonious can ever cover up blood stains
