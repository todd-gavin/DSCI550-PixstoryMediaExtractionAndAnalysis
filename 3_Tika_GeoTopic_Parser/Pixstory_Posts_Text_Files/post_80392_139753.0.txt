On August 31, 2011, Mikel Arteta signed a four-year contract with Arsenal and a £10 million transfer fee from Everton. A few days later, on September 10, 2011, he made his debut at the Emirates against Swansea.
On that same day, Per Mertesacker of Germany made his debut for Arsenal alongside him. Andrey Arshavin scored the game-winning goal for Arsenal after Swansea keeper Michel Vorm's clearance was mishandled and fell to him.
Arteta, meanwhile, stood out in midfield with his explosive running and versatile passing skills. Within two minutes, he set Aaron Ramsey, but Ramsey was unable to keep his shot on goal. He was content to receive the three points, though.
"Getting the three points was crucial, and we succeeded in doing so. It was crucial to put the 8-2 loss to Manchester United from two weeks ago behind us. It was excellent. It became more difficult as we missed early opportunities to take control of the game. Although it wasn't easy, I'm happy with the three points and the debut "After the game, he said.
These are the following ten players who played with Arteta in his first Arsenal match.
1 GK – Wojciech Szczęsny
In 2006, the goalkeeper from Poland joined Arsenal's junior division. He made his professional debut in a 2-0 home victory over West Brom in the third round of the Football League Cup. In the game, he made a few crucial stops, first stopping Danny Graham from close quarters and subsequently stopping the game with a shorter reaction stop. Szczesny spent two seasons on loan with Roma before permanently departing the club in 2017. He then signed up with Juventus and is now playing in Turin.
2 RB Bacary Sagna
The French full-back played until 2014 after moving to Arsenal from Auxerre in 2007. Later, he moved on to Manchester City, where he played for three seasons. Prior to his retirement from top flight football in 2019, Sagna most recently played for MLS team Montreal Impact.
