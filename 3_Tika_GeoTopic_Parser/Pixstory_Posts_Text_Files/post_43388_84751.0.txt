What does really the term "conventional beauty" means? So, let me tell you about it. In simple words, a person who is conventionally beautiful is considered to have a perfect body which is suppose to be not too thin or too fat; again when it comes to the face, it should be fair enough but not pale and there are many more factors. 
Our society has been going on with this perception of theirs and judging people's physical features and call it a "beauty standard".

I wonder, why is it even a thing? Who am I or you to judge anyone based on the way they look?
Now when I think about body positivity, the only person that comes into my mind is Ashley Graham-an American model, who fights for size inclusivity in the society and also rejects the word "plus-size" arguing that it is outdated and divisive. She is a person I always admired. 

“I wish that, when I was younger, there had been someone as outspoken as I was. Someone who was as fearless with their cellulite and back fat, so I could know that this was normal; this was what a body looks like.” - Graham told in an interview.
