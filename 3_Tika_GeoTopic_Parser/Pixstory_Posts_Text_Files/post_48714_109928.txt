I am always so amused by the arguments brought up by the right It s always somehow something very bizarre something very out of touch from the reality You know for example a fetus has a life and rights or Cops are there to protect us or something like that And I must admit they don t disappoint Mr Campbell I have a very serious question Have you ever attended a protest Have you ever seen one in person even Because if you did you d know why it s the way it is To answer your own question all you had to do was read up on protest history You may learn more by doing even basic research on the Civil Rights protests the Vietnam War protests or the very recent BLM protests You don t have to do anything wrong to be recognised and pursued by malicious rivals who in the worst case scenario would have the resources and impunity to persecute you
