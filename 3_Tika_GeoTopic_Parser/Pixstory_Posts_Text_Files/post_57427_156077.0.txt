Intermittent fasting might be an excellent way to lose weight, but it isn't for everyone.
People should know the demands of the diet before actually choosing to do it.
Intermittent fasting has some rules involving skipping most of the meals, so everyone shouldn't be qualified for it.
ChildrenChildren and teens under 18 should not choose such weight loss methods.
As they might not have the capability to do so, keeping track of your health is necessary.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not choose intermittent fasting as the body needs more nutrition and nurturing during these times; you can't go on avoiding meals or taking care of weight loss through some rigorous eating methods.
Also, people with health conditions like diabetes or blood sugar must not choose this kind of diet; they need an amount of food to fulfil their health requirements which remain ignorant in a diet like intermittent fasting.
Even people with a history of eating disorders should not try this diet.
As it may trigger the symptoms or even aggravate the already existing ones.
