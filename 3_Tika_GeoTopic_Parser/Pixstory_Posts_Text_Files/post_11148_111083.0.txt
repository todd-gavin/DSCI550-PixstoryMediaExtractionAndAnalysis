VITAMIN B12 + FOLATE
Helps assess brain, blood, and nervous system health. These nutrients are especially important for energy and fertility.

VITAMIN D
Helps assess bone health, fertility, immune health, and more. Make sure it's the 25-hydroxy form.

THYROID
Tests for metabolic/thyroid function and possible autoimmune disorders. If abnormal then ask your doctor to run full panel with reverse thyroid values.
This includes T3, T3 free, T3 reverse. T3, T4 free, thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies, and TSH.

COMPREHENSIVE METABOLIC PANEL
Tests your blood glucose, electrolytes, and liver and kidney function.

IRON STATUS
Tests for iron deficiencies and body's iron stores. Here it's important to ask for total iron, total iron binding capacity, and ferritin. It's tricky to know whether you are really iron deficient but this is a good starting point! If you are deficient, use food sources before supplementing as I don't recommend iron supplements unless absolutely ncessary.

LIPID PANEL
Tests your cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Bonus if you can get the omega 3 and omega 6 values!

HBA1C
Tests your blood glucose average over 3 months which is more representative than one glucose level.

FASTING INSULIN
Assesses any level of insulin resistance that could contribute to blood sugar dysregulation, diabetes, or other metabolic diseases.
