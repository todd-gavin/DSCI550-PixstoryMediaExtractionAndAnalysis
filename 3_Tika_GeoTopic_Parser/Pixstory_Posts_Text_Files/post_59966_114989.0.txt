With a victory over unseeded Australian Nick Kyrgios, Novak Djokovic won his sixth Wimbledon championship. At the All England Club, the top seed from Serbia won a fourth straight championship, bringing his total number of Grand Slam victories to 21. Having jumped off to a quick 6-1 lead in the fourth set tiebreaker, Djokovic was able to capitalise on his third match point when Kyrgios missed a backhand. In total, Djokovic has won 20 Grand Slam tournaments, one less than Rafael Nadal, who holds the record. With eight Wimbledon victories, only Roger Federer has more. In his maiden Grand Slam final, Kyrgios was competing.

Rafael Nadal's record of 22 major championships is now just one behind the 35-year-old Serb, who is currently one Slam ahead of Federer in the all-time race.

In addition, he joins Bjorn Borg, Federer, and Sampras as the only other men to have won four straight Wimbledon championships during the Open era.
