So Tired Blues 

With the sun in my hand
Gonna throw the sun
Way across the land-
Cause I’m tired,
Tired as I can be

James Mercer Langston Hughes was an American poet, social activist, novelist, playwright, and columnist from Joplin, Missouri. One of the earliest writers of the literary art form called jazz poetry, Hughes is best known as a leader of the Harlem Renaissance. He famously wrote about the period that "the Negro was in vogue", which was later paraphrased as "when Harlem was in vogue."

This is a short five-line poem conveying succinctly the Speaker’s desire to get the day’s responsibilities over with and go to bed. He interprets here a desire to move the sun rapidly toward sunset. Fatigue is a regular theme for Hughes in his poetry. “Tired” as used by Hughes should be glimpsed as something that is both corporeal and spiritual.

Hughes often incorporated syncopated rhythms, jive language, or easier phrasing to mimic the improvisatory nature of jazz; in other poems, his verse reads like the lyrics of a blues song. The result was as close as you could get to spelling out jazz.
