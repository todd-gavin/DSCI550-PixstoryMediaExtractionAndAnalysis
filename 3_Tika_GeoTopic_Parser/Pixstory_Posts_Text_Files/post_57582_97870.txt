Most of the time we focus on women s body image issues for decades it has been a repeatedly seen behaviour that parents are concerned with the negative body image of their girl child who is exposed to the pressure of making a perfect body However it is a well known fact that girls face the stress of maintaining a good body but the case is not so different for boys They are equally victims of negative body image that compels them to look taller more robust and leaner There is this set narrative that it doesn t affect guys and it becomes the reason why they are underdiagnosed However in a survey conducted it was observed that eating disorders are increasing in boys the most common is muscularity oriented They focus on taking enough protein to gain good body weight and look stronger while looking thin at the same time Lauren Smolar vice president of mission at the National Eating Disorders Association says They want to modify their bodies They have discomfort with weight shape and body image the same as girls But they display a little differently From a younger age it is observed that boys are surrounded by men who portray an ideal body image This educes in them an idea of building muscles and body even when they haven t reached an appropriate age for doing so And when they re unable to do it the thought of negative body image starts shaping their minds So it is essential to make them realise and say that this is not realistic and one should accept their body the way it is
