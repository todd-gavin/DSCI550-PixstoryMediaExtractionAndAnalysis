Want to nourish your gut microbiome? 🌟
❤️You love the idea of a nourished gut microbiome but confused about what to eat and what not to eat?
With so much information online 💻 about gut health and eating for optimal gut function, it can be tricky to be sure about what's best for a healthy gut.
Here are five foods to show some well deserved TLC to your gut,
1. Kefir 🥛 is a probiotic yogurt drink made by fermenting milk and is packed with good bacteria. It originated in the mountainous region between Asia and Europe, as well as Russia and Centeral Asia.
It also makes a great addition to smoothies and soups, or you can use it as a base for salad dressing (add lemon juice and seasoning).🥗
2. Kimchi- this Korean speciality of fermented vagetables brings the benefits of probiotic bacteria along with vitamins and fibre.
Use it as a lively side dish with meat, salad or eggs.🥚🥗
It's so popular that Koreans say , "kimchi" in the same way that we say "cheese" when they have their photos taken.💫📸
3. Sourdough🍞- this is very fashionable at the moment, but there's a good reason for that. Made by fermenting the doug, it's more digestible than regular bread and it's energy releases slowly.
4. Garlic🧄 - with its antibacterial and antifungal properties, can help keep "bad" gut bacteria under control and help balance Yeast in the gut.
The properties within garlic act as a fuel source to allow the bacteria to do their job better which overall improves gut function.💖🌟
