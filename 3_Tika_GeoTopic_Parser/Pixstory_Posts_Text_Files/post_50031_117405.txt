A Boat BY RICHARD BRAUTIGAN O beautiful was the werewolf in his evil forest We took him to the carnival and he started crying when he saw the Ferris wheel Electric green and red tears flowed down his furry cheeks He looked like a boat out on the dark water Richard is a poet from the beat generation in the poem he talks about culture and belonging We cannot force something upon somebody people belong where they belong we have to embrace everything hem They are beautiful because of their origin experiences and their past If we pull them out of their roots they might feel a sense of belonging and feel like they are a misfit for that particular place they are been forcefully rooted
