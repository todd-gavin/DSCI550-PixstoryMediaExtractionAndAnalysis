A few days ago anti trans meme creator Elon Musk posted a photo of Bill Gates collaged with a pregnant man emoji with the text in case u need to lose a b ner fast While some news outlets covered this tweet in context to Bill Gates none seem to go into how the tweet endorses the ongoing legacy of infantalizing transgender men and masc folks through a desexualization driven by the patriarchal need to control all bodies And how Musk repurposes this infantilization and anti trans hate circulating around what this emoji attempts to represent men and gender nonconforming folks can get pregnant too Musk follows this up with another meme to criticize the moderation of hate speech on social media shadow ban council reviewing tweet he posted with an image of figures covered in dark and torn apart bedsheet like clocks As a self described free speech absolutist Musk s move to seize Twitter while riding on a free speech echo the arguments used by the powerful right when they get agitated about being called out for their transphobia While the United States associates itself as the beacon of free speech it forgets to mention the terms and conditions that apply from the Don t Say Gay bills to the books banning LGBTQI and race related books free speech only applies when it conserves the white heteropatriarchal status quo Musk is infamous for using his platform to mock transgender people and for using irrelevant remarks to silence anyone who calls him out Twitter is already a thriving space for influential figures who can attack transgender people without being held accountable by the platform scroll down JK Rowling s feed and you ll find plenty of evidence to back my argument It s easy to use free speech as a euphemism for hate when you couldn t care about the concrete harm and violence that it translates into beyond the screen What will a social media platform like Twitter reflect if it is governed by someone who s actions endorse hate
