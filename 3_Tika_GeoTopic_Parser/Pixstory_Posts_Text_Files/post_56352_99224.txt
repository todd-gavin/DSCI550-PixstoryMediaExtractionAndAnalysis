I always see a statement used to justify the toxicity of parents You will always be children to your parents no matter how old you are Let s not forget that they are individuals with preferences and choices Manipulation happens in childhood where the likes and dislikes of children are the likes and dislikes of the parents Slowly most children as teenage try to unlearn or develop their personalities and have sexual preferences dissimilar to their parents It s perfect when parents let their children s choices before their egos But when this does happen you force your children to be something you are not You are forcing your ambitions on your children You are making them exactly like you and not letting them embrace their individuality Sometimes some children take time to figure out what they want in life This doesn t mean you are barge in and make your dreams theirs Your child should not be forced to fulfil your dreams So if you think having a child gives you authority to make decisions for them Then better don t have one Bringing life into a world is equally important as letting them decide what they want in life Better don t be a parent if you can t be a good one
