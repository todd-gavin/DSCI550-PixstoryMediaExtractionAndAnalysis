Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals,[a] and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”(Genesis 1:26)
   So God created mankind in his own image,
    in the image of God he created them;
    male and female he created them. (Genesis 1:27)
I know not a lot of people pay heed to what's written in the Bible because it's apparently become cool to listen to Him but just on the odd chance that you will, I just will remind you to do something for your own betterment and the betterment of the world instead of risking your life, and by extension of those who love you!
