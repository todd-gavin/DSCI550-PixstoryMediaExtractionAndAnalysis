Noise pollution is an invisible danger. It cannot be seen, but it is always present both on land and under the sea. It is an unwanted sound that affects the health and well-being of humans and other organisms. It creates disturbance and hinders our everyday life.
Sound is always measured in decibels. The environment is filled with different sounds such as the rustling leaves (20 to 30 decibels), a thunderclap (120 decibels) a siren (120 to 140 decibels). The sound that is 85 decibels or higher can harm an individualâ€™s ears. Such sounds that exceed this level include lawn mowers, subway trains, and other such sources that are all around us. Thus noise pollution impacts people on a daily basis and causes high blood pressure, stress, sleep disturbances and noise induced hearing loss.
