This is my cat, BlueMoon, or BuMu for short. I rescued him when he was just one month old. I found him at a farm in December 2021, covered with flees and motherless. According to the farmers, his mother was killed by a snakebite when he was just a week old. When I took him to the vet, the doctor was shocked by how many flees this poor little creature had on him. He said and I quote "I have no idea how he has any blood left in him". We brought him home and cleaned him up. The floors were too cold for him to walk, so he got around the house on everyone's shoulders. We called him our little parrot. It was also fitting, because instead of meowing, he would squawk. 

Now you may be wondering, why is he called BlueMoon? When he was younger, he had the bluest eyes. They were the colour of the deep sea on a sunny morning. I would often say he held the oceans in his eyes. As he grew up, his eyes turned from blue to green to a light amber. Although his eyes are blue no more, I will always believe he holds the oceans in his eyes. 

Do you have a pet? How'd you come up with their name?
