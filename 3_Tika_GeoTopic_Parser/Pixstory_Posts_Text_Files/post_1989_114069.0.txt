A tragedy was likely averted recently in a San Antonio Amazon warehouse that a 19-year-old threatened to shoot up. Others overheard him planning the mass shooting, and he was promptly reported to the authorities, who, upon determining that the threat was credible, detained him and seized an AR-15 from his residence. 

With so many mass shootings occurring in the United States but not elsewhere, and even more threatened mass shootings that were prevented before they could occur, the issue arises as to how this epidemic of mass shootings may be avoided. 

Obviously, the United States is not the only country with firearms, nor is it the only one with a large number of firearms. This is why there have been so many arguments on the fundamental cause of gun violence in America. 

I feel that mental health and culture are a determining factor in whether or not a person chooses to use a firearm to kill someone, especially given the ease with which a gun can be used to kill someone and the impersonal character of the killing. Therefore, it is crucial to keep weapons out of the hands of those who have mental health issues and those who may experience brief errors in judgment. 

What are your thoughts? What do you believe the root cause of the epidemic of mass shootings to be?
