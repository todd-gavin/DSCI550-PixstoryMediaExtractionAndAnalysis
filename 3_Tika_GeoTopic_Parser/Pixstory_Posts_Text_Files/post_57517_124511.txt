Since people have become more aware of mental health everyone wants to seek therapy But unfortunately and surprisingly most people don t understand what it really is They linger in that delusion and call therapy a panacea for all their problems But it isn t the truth therapy is not all you need to heal I choose to say so because thinking about seeking therapy and actually doing it are two different things It may or may not work for you Firstly a person wishing to go for therapy may not feel so comfortable sharing their thoughts with a stranger Many people have shame and anxiety about discussing their most problematic behaviours or thoughts and only share part of the story with their therapist The process of finding what method and which therapist will suit you is perplexing Sometimes the client and therapist are not a good interpersonal fit But there it has changed for failing Sometimes it is like that even if the therapists are not so skilled you could go for choosing one of the best ones but there you need research because ending up with someone who doesn t know how to deal with your negative thoughts and emotions would instead aggravate the situation for you Lastly even if it all goes best in your case therapy might still not answer all your questions unless you answer them The wish to change would evoke from within and that s how it works you don t always need to spend a lot on therapies without acknowledging the real problems
