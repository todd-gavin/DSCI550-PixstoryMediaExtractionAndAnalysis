The question should rather be, how can we stop damaging the environment. We are too feeble to protect anything.
We have been living in this earth for a long long time now. Slowly, through our ability to think, we started over using our brain and somehow in the process got too greedy. And the rest is simply history.
But, about few years ago, a female scientist called Janine Benyus pioneered an interesting field known asÂ Biomimicry. It is to mimic nature and everything around us. The rest of the natural world is so brilliant and it lives sustainably. All we have to do is just look at them and live exactly that way.
We draw inspiration for architecture, design, transportation, houses , community and more from many many creatures and the output that we obtain is immeasurably more elegant than otherwise designed.
In other words, simply be more connected to nature. Be a great recipient for nature's calls. It always guides. Live like , we are also one of the thousands of inheritors on this earth. This is the ultimate way we can stop causing so much damage to the world around us.
