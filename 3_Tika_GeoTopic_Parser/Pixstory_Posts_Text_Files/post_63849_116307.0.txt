With a bizzare new take on your beloved childhood icon, ITN Studios is coming to ruin your childhood with its new literally killer reimagining of Winnie The Pooh, in the upcoming horror film Winnie The Pooh: Blood and Honey. Releasing its official poster on 14th July, the once gentle bear is certainly giving off the vibe of a demented serial killer.
 
The poster gives us a closer look at the normally very friendly and adorable looking bear, looking not so adorable and friendly and wielding a blood stained mallet. Neither is Piglet looking much too adorable for that matter holding a knife and standing over a body.
 
The movie may certainly prove to be nightmare fuel,particularly when your childhood characters are taken away for a twisted  surgery. But it is too hard to take it seriously with the poster’s tagline “This Ain’t No Bedtime Story”. Well after that, this certainly ain’t looking like much of a horror story either. But it is too early to judge yet, considering that the movie does not even have a trailer yet.
 
The plot is certainly unique though, according to director Rhys Frake-Waterfield “Christopher Robin is pulled away from them, and he’s not given them food. It’s made Pooh and Piglet’s life quite difficult. Because they’ve had to fend for themselves so much, they’ve essentially become feral. So they’ve gone back to their animal roots. They are no longer tame: they’re like a vicious bear and pig who want to go around and try and find prey.”
 
The movie seems like its unafraid to straddle that fine line between horror and absurdity, thus in all likelihood aiming for the dumb fun angle. 

Waterfield also noted in his chat with Variety that while Tigger and Eeyore won’t appear in the movie due to copyright issues, the story in his mind is that Pooh and Piglet got so hungry they ate Eeyore somewhere along the way. 

Craig David Dowsett plays Winnie the Pooh, and Chris Cordell stars as Piglet in the slasher-horror film.
