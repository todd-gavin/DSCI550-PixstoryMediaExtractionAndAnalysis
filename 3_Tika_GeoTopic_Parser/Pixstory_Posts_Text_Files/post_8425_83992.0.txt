A monk wandering in peace for a heavenly abode,

Often gets wobbled by the iniquities of a strangely bumpy road,

Manifested with the mighty ruse,

That exists to sully the evil hues,

His grit to attain nirvana finally met the fate of gawd...

POETRY STYLE: LIMERICK

AÂ limerick poemÂ is a type of poem where the first, second and fifth lines have the same rhyme and rhythm. The third and fourth lines within a limerick will rhyme too!

A limerickÂ contains just one stanza, which is a group of lines within a poem, much like a verse within a song. When discussing the way that poems rhyme, we often refer to it as a rhyming scheme. In the case of the limerick,Â the rhyming scheme is AABBA

The origin of the limerick is not defined, however, it is suggested the name isÂ derived from the place in Ireland which is also called LimerickÂ and referred toÂ an old-style parlour gameÂ which began with the line "Will you come up to Limerick?"

The first limericks wereÂ written in the early 1700s, and they were oftenÂ used in folk songs. However,Â the father of the limerick is considered to beÂ Edward Lear, the famous British poet. Even if he didnâ€™t write the first limerick poem, he popularized it. His limericks are considered to be the best ones. Most of them tell the story of an old man.
