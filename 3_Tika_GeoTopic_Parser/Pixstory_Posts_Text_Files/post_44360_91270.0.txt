Thibaut Courtois of Real Madrid has given his opinion on the upcoming Champions League
match against Chelsea. In a rematch of last season's semi-final, in which Champions League winners Chelsea upset Los Blancos, the two teams will meet in the quarter-finals this season.

Real Madrid will visit Stamford Bridge for the first leg next week, and for star goalkeeper Thibaut
Courtois, it will be a homecoming to an old haunt.

The Belgian spent seven years at Chelsea before joining Real Madrid in 2018, and his previous
team praised him. That should ensure a warm welcome when he travels next week, and he is
excited to return to Stamford Bridge now that the fans have returned.

“It will be special. Last year, we lost in the semis and I hope this year will be a victory,” he said
on Thibaut Talks via Mundo Deportivo.
“This year is going to be different because there will be fans. It will be special and while, at best
there will be some whistles, I hope that people remember the beautiful moments.

“We won two titles, an FA up. For me, Chelsea is a special team, they helped me be the
goalkeeper I am today.

“They bought me when I was 18 and gave me the opportunity to be at Atletico, to play in the
Premier League, to win it.

“It’s an important team and I have many friends there. It’s always a pleasure to face them
again.”

This season, Courtois has been outstanding for Real Madrid, and he will be crucial to his team's
chances of winning the Champions League but first and foremost, Carlo Ancelotti's side must
exact vengeance on the squad that denied them a place in last season's final.
