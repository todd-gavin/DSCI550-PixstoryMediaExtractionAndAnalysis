Florida Panthers are now in danger, as two more losses and they'll fall in the wrong place. The pressure in the series rests upon them now. 

"The Panthers finished the 2021-22 regular season with the league’s best record, claiming its first Presidents’ Trophy in franchise history, and became the first team in 25 years to average more than four goals per game over an 82-game season. On top of that, it came into the playoffs looking like an absolute wagon by winning 23 of 28 games (23-4-1) since the start of March," NBC wrote.

In their first-round series against the Washington Capitals, the Panthers took it on the chin in Game 1, losing 4-2 to the Caps. Florida avoided a two-game deficit Thursday in Game 2, beating Washington 5-1. But Saturday night in D.C., the Capitals re-established the series lead with a 6-1 victory. In a best-of-five series, the Panthers find themselves trailing Washington 2-1, with another Caps home game scheduled for Monday. Florida may head home for a midweek Game 5 on the verge of being eliminated by the Capitals.

The Panthers are now on Gut-Check Time. People can talk about the pressure a team like the Toronto Maple Leafs face in this post-season, but there are different pressures for different groups. The tension has been ratcheted up to levels they probably believed wouldn’t be a problem if they were in a conference or Cup final.
