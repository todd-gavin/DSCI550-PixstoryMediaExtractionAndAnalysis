Shrimanjunath Sankanagoudar Praveen Sharma Abstract Background and aims Over the past few years branched chain amino acids BCAAs are increasingly being linked to insulin resistance and type diabetes mellitus T DM but their relevance for metabolic dyslipidaemia in T DM is unclear This study aims to determine the plasma and urinary BCAAs and their association with insulin resistance lipid profile and glycated haemoglobin in patients with T DM among Indian adults Methods In this analytical cross sectional study a total of eighty subjects were recruited T DM cases and healthy controls Blood samples collected were subjected to fasting blood sugar FBS lipid profile HbA c insulin and BCAAs analysis and urine samples were assessed for BCAAs All associations were assessed using Spearman Rank Correlation Results The plasma levels of BCAAs were significantly higher p in subjects with T DM than in control subjects Spearman Rank Correlation analyses revealed a non significant p but positive association between BCAAs and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance HOMA IR in patients with T DM Rho Among lipid profile parameters only triglycerides had a significant positive correlation to plasma BCAAs in cases Rho but not in control subjects Findings also revealed a significant positive p association between plasma BCAAs and HbA c in patients with T DM Rho Urinary BCAAs levels had a non significant increase in T DM subjects and did not show any significant correlation with other parameters assessed Conclusion Elevated levels of plasma BCAAs are positively associated with triglyceride and HbA c They could serve as an effective marker for the assessment of metabolic dyslipidaemia in subjects with T DM Further large scale studies are needed for confirmation of the same Sources
