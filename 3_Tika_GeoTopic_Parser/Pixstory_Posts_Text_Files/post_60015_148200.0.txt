Against England on Saturday, Indian icon Jhulan GoswamiÂ  playing her final one-day international. In the 40th over, when the 7th wicket fell, the future ICC Hall of Famer came out to bat. Naturally, the England players were prepared to honour Jhulan and provided her with a guard of honour as she stepped out to bat.
While Jhulan left, even England's replacement players remained in the centre. In addition to England players, Deepti Sharma hailed Jhulan.
Jhulan didn't stay in the middle for very long before leaving after the first ball. India was bowled out after scoring only 169 runs. Before the ODI series began, Jhulan announced her retirement from the sport and said she will represent India in her final match at the Lord's Cricket Ground.
Jhulan is the bowler with the most women's ODI wickets with 253*, and she has the opportunity to increase that total during the current match. By the end of the competition, she can also reach the milestone of bowling 10,000 balls in 50-over cricket.
