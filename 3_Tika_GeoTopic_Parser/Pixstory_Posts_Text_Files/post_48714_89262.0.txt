Saying "why should we change it if it's doing us no harm?" and "privilege is a made-up crap" in the same breath is so ironic it's laughable. And it is not just hypocritical, it is insensitive and reeks of privilege.

You never tell kids to be nice to someone only if it benefits you, but as soon as you as an adult have to implement that same theory, it's suddenly up for debate? Putting someone else through hell because it benefits you is selfish, and in this case where you have countless victims, it's oppressive.

Men who purposefully avoid vulnerability, act on homophobic ideas, neglect personal traumas, or engage in discriminatory behaviours toward women contribute to a number of wider societal issues, including gender-based violence, sexual assault, and gun violence.

Men are perceived as being more violent than women, which is in fact true and the proof is crime statistics. Not only men commit the majority of criminal offences, but they also commit those offences against men (with the exception of sexual assault). Men have increasingly high suicide rates and mental heath issues. So maybe you would want to reconsider "Toxic masculinity does more good than harm to men" because that is simply not true.

Toxic masculinity is still a crisis, and the only way to teach men that their emotions do not invalidate them or make them weak is to establish that perspective in them from an early age, which is why it's important to teach them that in schools. The consequences of toxic masculinity are obvious, and it's crucial for us as a society to recognise that we're all human, and finding healthy ways to process emotions is important for everyone, especially men.

And once again, something shouldn't have to affect men for you to speak against it if it's affecting other genders. We could all start by being kinder.
