Are you dealing with low vagal tone?

Vagal tone is a marker of stress reactivity and sensitivity. A low vagal tone means that you have a hard time getting into a parasympathetic state. This may lead to a heightened stress response that becomes chronic, possibly resulting in depression, anxiety, gut issues, and inflammation.

The most important function of the vagus nerve is afferent, bringing information of the inner organs, such as the gut, liver, heart, and lungs to the brain. This suggests that the inner organs are major sources of sensory information to the brain - mental and physical health is fundamentally linked.
