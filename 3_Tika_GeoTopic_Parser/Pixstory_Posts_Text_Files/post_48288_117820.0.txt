Periods are important because it is the regular vaginal bleeding that occurs every month as part of the reproductive health cycle of women. Your body prepares for pregnancy every month between puberty (about the age of 11 to 16) and menopause (around the age of 51). 
One of your ovaries releases an egg after it develops in your uterus. If fertilisation does not take place and you don’t get pregnant, your estrogen and progesterone levels will drop until they reach a level that indicates that you’ll begin menstruating. When your period starts, the uterine lining starts shedding itself and is removed along with some blood through the vaginal canal.
During their menstrual month, women of reproductive age loses roughly 2 to 3 tablespoons of blood. The average interval between the last day of your periods to the first day is 28 days, with bleeding lasting 4 to 5 days on average. People can, however, have completely “regular” cycles while having longer periods and fewer or more days of bleeding. 
You may be having irregular periods if your menstrual cycle is less than 24 days, longer than 38 days, or fluctuates greatly from month to month. However, it depends on other factors as well. These factors could be stress, hormonal shifts, weight loss, excessive exercise, family history, birth control and so on.
Is there something to worry about?
Periods are necessary and a normal part of your life. Periods are important for pregnancy and helps your body to prepare for it. Your body expels tissue that it no longer needs to nurture a fertilised egg every month so that you do not become pregnant.
Consult your doctor or gynaecologist if you notice any irregularities in your monthly regularity, frequency, duration, or volume.
