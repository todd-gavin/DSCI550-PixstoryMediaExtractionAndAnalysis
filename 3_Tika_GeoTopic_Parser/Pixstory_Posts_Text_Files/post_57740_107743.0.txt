Fortunately in my experience, it was usually some ball he found in the backyard😂
But honestly it's pretty scary imagining what could possibly be in my dogs mouth😂
Some trash, some insect🤦‍♀️😂
And when they run away, probably thinking you're playing with them, it's a whole workout trying to just find out what is there😂
