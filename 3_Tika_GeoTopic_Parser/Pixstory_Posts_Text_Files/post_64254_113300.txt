There has been a constant struggle amongst different generations with their own set of challenges and impending desires to fulfill I have seen older people talk about the freedom that people today have wistfully looking at them and envisioning how their lives would have been if they were empowered and did things differently than how they turned out to be But today with too many choices too early the perpetual pursuit of validation from others the overwhelming need to perform better and better on what is thought to be a world stage the quest for perfection an exhilarating set of demands from oneself and broader set of concerns not only ones but also of others all these coming at the cost of the thrilling life has to offer the fame people want with the sole objective of individuality and independence it has created enormous pressure one that s difficult to deal with Freedom comes with a cost one that should be carefully negotiated otherwise our path of searching that has an active quest and numerous creative possibilities does even have the potential for self destruction With our lives moving at a rapid pace the focus today should be on the happiness quotient The awareness that life has to be lived rather than saunter as a mere state of existence should be deep rooted in our way of living And thus I hope that there are days when we appreciate small things and fall in love with being alive again I hope there are days when we explore our wild sides put an end to dead equations and simply love the ability and option to make new choices I hope that we come to embrace this new level of personal freedom even more than making it exhaust us
