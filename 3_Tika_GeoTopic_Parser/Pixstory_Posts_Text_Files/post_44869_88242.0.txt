Real Madrid 4 – 2 Barcelona (2005)
When it comes to the top El Clásico matches, the 2005 match is unavoidable. It included some of soccer's greatest players, including Beckham, Owen, Ronaldo, Zidane, and Ronaldinho. It was a game to remember, especially since it took place during the peak of the Galacticos era.
While Barcelona may have lost, the curve on Ronaldinho's free kick in the 73rd minute was something extraordinary.

Barcelona 2 – 0 Real Madrid (2010/11)
Last but not least, there was the Champions League match between Real Madrid and Barcelona. This was an exciting match that pitted two of the best managers and rivals, Mourinho and Guardiola, against one other. It did not let me down!
Pepe was shown a red card, which threw the game into disarray and resulted to Barcelona's 2-0 victory over Real Madrid. Messi scored both goals, but the second was particularly magnificent, and many people still talk about it years later.
