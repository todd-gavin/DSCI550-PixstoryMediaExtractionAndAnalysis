By making an effort to reach out to others especially to those we haven't spoke for a while can have a large and positive impact than we can think, according to the studies. 
With so much happening in our life, we often keep our relations at bay and it effects the quality of relation we have with our loved ones. Particularly during the last years when we have spend half of our time in the homes, socializing have been less for many of us. 
In a study, author Peggy J. Liu, PhD, the Ben L. Fryrear Chair in Marketing at the University of Pittsburgh Katz Graduate School of Business, they found that there is a tendency to underestimate on how much people appreciate when friends reach out to them. 
People Appreciate Messages and Gifts From Friends 
With the first part of the study, over 200 participants in total looked back to times when they reached out to others or somebody else. They rated on how much they appreciated the contact themselves or how much they thought the other person appreciated the contact. 
The Benefits of Reaching Out 
When we get into a lonely routine of doing the same work, eating the same food or doing the same activities day after day, a surprise text, gift or a call is a great mood booster. 
“We have a fundamental need to have personal, meaningful connection, so when people reach out to others this starts a biochemical reaction of hormones and neurotransmitters such as oxytocin (bonding and resilience), dopamine (reward and motivation), endorphins (feel good and pain relief) and DHEA (anti-aging),” says Rachel Taylor, PhD, neuropsychologist and Founder of UNBroken.  
“Mix all that together with fond memories and nostalgia and you will be building a nice pot of cognitive reserve which enables psychological and physical wellbeing,” says Taylor.
