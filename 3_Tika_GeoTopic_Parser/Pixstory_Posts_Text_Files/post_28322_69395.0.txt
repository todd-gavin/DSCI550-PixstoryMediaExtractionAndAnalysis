Every year I always wait till that first snowfall.

The snowflakes falling down so gracefully, 
Looking out my window with such a surprise, 
That the winter season has finally arrived.

Those great winter memories that are still to come, 
Thinking to myself, oh what fun! 
Hot coco drinks and warm cookie treats, 
This is the time of year I long to meet.

Sledding, skiing, and so much more, 
These are the memories I adore, 
Glancing out the window peacefully, 
The First Snowfall Fall is down and ready!
