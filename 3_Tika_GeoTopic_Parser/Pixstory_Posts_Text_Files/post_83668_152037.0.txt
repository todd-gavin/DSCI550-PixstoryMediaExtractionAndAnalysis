You will always be misunderstood. You will always be judged. That's why Lacon said that language is a prison house and we are its prisoners, or Hegel, the philosopher who said that as soon as you speak, you are doomed because you are bound to be misinterpreted. This is why communication is so important. It's crucial in any healthy, happy relationship, whether it's friendship, marriage, or any other type of partnership. If you're serious about that person, and you're interested in learning how to express yourself, and you're interested in being vulnerable enough to self-reflect and communicate your wants, needs, and desires.
It's why, if we're all trapped in the prison of language, and we're all trapped in endless strings of miscommunication, you treat the person you love with kindness and clear communication. You don't have to be clever; you just have to be clear about your intentions, be honest with yourself, and be honest with them.
