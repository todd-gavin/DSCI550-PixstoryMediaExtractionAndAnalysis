Carol Couse explained the development of Womens Football perfectly 

“We’ve come a long way from 1921 (thank god!) when The FA banned women’s association football. The FA Consultative Committee ruling stated: 

“Complaints having been made as to football being played by women, Council felt impelled to express the strong opinion that the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and should not be encouraged.”  

The ban lasted 51 years!!  I wonder what those men would think of Mead, Russo, Hemp, Bronze et al, raising the spirits of a nation and inspiring a new generation of female players to play our national game?
 
I feel really humbled to support many of these now household name players on and off the field. There is no doubt these talented, determined women are fantastic role models worthy of parity with the men on so many levels.  But from a legal, policy and structural perspective, so much more has to change if we want a meaningful legacy from #weuros2022.
