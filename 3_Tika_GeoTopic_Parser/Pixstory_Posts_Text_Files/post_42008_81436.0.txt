It is extremely fascinating that almost everything manmade, every machine be it a car or an airplane works in the way of nature. The workings, the mechanics of even the most complicated things have been inspired from how the nature works. There is this strange relationship between the both. Nature is extremely fascinating and works in this coherent and symmetric way that itâ€™s almost poetic. Biomimicry takes inspiration from the workings of the nature to solve some of most complex human problems. Throughout history, humans have looked to nature for solutions to challenges. Self-healing powers, environmental exposure tolerance and resistance, hydrophobicity, self-assembly, and solar energy harvesting are just a few of the engineering difficulties that nature has handled. Biomimicry is the answer.
