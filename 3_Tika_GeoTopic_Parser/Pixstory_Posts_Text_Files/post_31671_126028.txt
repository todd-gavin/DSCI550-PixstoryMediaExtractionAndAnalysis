To celebrate years of A casa di Luca, a song presented at the Sanremo Festival by and winner of the Award for best text, Silvia Salemi has chosen to return to the scene with a song written together with Matteo Faustini, a young singer-songwriter who was the protagonist of the 20th edition of the Sanremo Festival in the New Proposals section and to Marco Rettani co-author also of the last two songs by Silvia Chagall and I Sogni nelle pockets Characterized by summer sounds Noi contro di noi a song that invites the listener to reflect on delicate issues such as the strong need for unity and peace A text direct and current that is linked to the difficulties that have marked the last few years and that have led human beings to distrust their neighbors and not to see the good that is in the other Knowing that Us against Us is meeting with public approval and that four weeks is one of the most played songs on the radio makes me very happy also because a song with a very important message says Silvia Salemi Peace is not the absence of war a virtue a state of mind a disposition for benevolence trust and justice In the face of Spinoza&#39;s words we all agree but our present and indeed the whole history of man demonstrate the opposite Sometimes just a little kindness and tenderness would be enough that only the awareness of being all on the same planet on the same blue ball can make us try Being against each other as Hobbes tells us in his wholly pessimistic view of man has not done us and is not doing us any good and will not lead us to promote good After Covid it would have been desirable for all of us to have united in one big universal global embrace to seek peace instead we are forced to see dramatic images bordering on the grotesque where people run away from soldiers who shoot wearing masks Total madness The war within the pandemic an evil within another evil
