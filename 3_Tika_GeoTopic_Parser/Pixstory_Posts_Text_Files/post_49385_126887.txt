If what you re saying does make as much sense as you think it is why exactly are crimes committed by adults on rise There is an apparently proper system to deal with those criminals There are consequences of their actions which they are fully aware of Then why is this competent system not working to its full potential Why are the crimes rising like they are Because punishment does not prevent crimes They serve as justice to the victims but they don t prevent crimes Building a society based on humanitarian ethics does No criminal while committing the act in hand think of the consequences he d face Because if that would have been the case the crimes would have dramatically reduced if not stopped all together In this fast pace world we have forgotten our children completely We are so busy with jobs and making money and forcing people to give birth that we completely neglect our responsibility as parents And that s when we raise our kids as immoral violent criminal adults The responsibility lies in our hands as society to stop the crime We have to buck up
