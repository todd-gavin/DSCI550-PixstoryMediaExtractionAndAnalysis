Alinghi Red Bull Racing secured the 2022 TF35 Trophy title with one event to spare after finishing second in the TF35 Malcesine Cup.

Back on Lake Garda, Alinghi Red Bull Racing made the most of the four days of racing as - despite the complicated weather conditions - seven races were completed on the water.

- With two wins on the final day, Alinghi Red Bull Racing finished second behind winner Spindrift to wrap up the title as the worst result of the season does not count in the final ranking.

- Lucien Cujean said: "We're lucky to have sailed a great last day. The race committee took the right decisions to make the most of it. We didn't have the classic Lake Garda conditions this time. Instead, we had storms, very strong winds in the morning, very light in the afternoon, and a lot of waiting on shore. Despite the weather, getting back into race mode was very beneficial for us, as in our America's Cup campaign where we won't be racing much before 2024. It's important to find the right balance between the AC preparation and racing on interesting series like this."

- Arnaud Psarofaghis said: "After a disappointing Bol d'Or Mirabaud before the summer break, we had a great feeling here in Malcesine. The whole team knows its role on board and has quickly found its marks. Ernesto Bertarelli helmed very well, Lucien did his physical training for the month and Nicolas Charbonnier made excellent tactical choices - as always!"

- Second in 2021 behind Realteam Sailing, Bertarelli's team claimed revenge with two wins and two second places, the Swiss challenger for the next America's Cup rewarded for its consistency.

- Cujean added: "The key to success this season has been our preparation, and I keep in mind a good memory from our Genève-Rolle-Genève victory."

- The Alinghi Red Bull Racing crew will now return to Barcelona to resume preparations for the 37th America's Cup and train on the AC75. They will go back to Italy to join their TF35 competitors for the final leg of the season in Scarlino, Tuscany, from October 6-9.
