The LA Lakers will do everything in their power to improve the deficiencies in their roster, on the trade deadline. They have been linked with several names, including Jerami Grant, John Wall, Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes and Myles Turner. However, it seems they might have to settle for something below their expected targets.

Some of the trade candidates for the Lakers are Talen Horton-Tucker, DeAndre Jordan and Kent Bazemore. Horton-Tucker could be their most valuable trade chip, while Jordan and Bazemore may not net them anything of value. However, according toÂ Eric Pincus of Bleacher Report, Horton-Tucker is viewed as a marginal asset by NBA teams.

"Now that the Lakers are looking to improve their roster ahead of the trade deadline, Horton-Tucker is viewed by other teams as a marginal asset. He's still a developing prospect," Pincus wrote.

It's going to be a tough second half of the season for LeBron James and co. They are still a talented bunch, but it would be very difficult to have any success without changes to their roster. James is playing like an MVP this season, but his teammates haven't quite complemented his efforts.
