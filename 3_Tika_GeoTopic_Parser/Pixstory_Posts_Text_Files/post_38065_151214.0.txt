Barcelona make a massive overhaul in their squad in the transfer windows of 2022. However, as per multiple reports, the Spanish club are yet to settle their dues to Foreign clubs as rumours of bankruptcy take centre stage! 
The Blaugrana signed a host of players including Robert Lewandowski, Ferran Torres, Raphinha, and Jules Kounde this year. But if reports are true, Joan Laporta's club has failed to settle their transfer dues over the years. This includes deals that go back several seasons. 
As per Sportskeeda, Barcelona are yet to pay Liverpool €14m for the services of Philippe Coutinho. The Brazilian left Barca this season on a permanent transfer to Aston Villa. The Blaugrana have also failed to pay Juventus about €36 million for Miralem Pjanic. 
Among recent transfers, Ferran Torres joined Barcelona from Manchester City in January this year. The Blaugrana are yet to pay €52 million to the Cityzens. Also, the club needs to pay Ajax €42 million for Frenkie De Jong and Serginio Dest. 
It is not known if Barcelona have paid the complete fee to Bayern, Sevilla, and Leeds for Lewandowski, Kounde, and Raphinha respectively. But these reports certainly paint a dark picture regarding the club's finances. 
It has to be seen if UEFA would decide to look into these allegations. The aforementioned clubs are yet to file any complaints regarding the non-payment. Hence it is likely that Barcelona would have made a pact regarding the eventual payment of the sum.
