Austin Reaves chalked up the first NBA start of his career in the loss to the L A Clippers celebrating it with a few notable plays Reaves clocked in the most minutes in a single game this season with nearly on Friday ending the night with six points three assists an offensive rebound and a couple of blocks Those two rejections helped the Lakers keep their second half comeback rally alive allowing the Purple and Gold to get back in the lead late in the third quarter Also Reaves blocks happened to come against Reggie Jackson who had driven past the Lakers rookie to score the game winning bucket in the previous meeting between the two sides But the year old guard said he didn t seek revenge when swatting away Jackson s shots in the third quarter He s a really good player he scores on people all the time so it s nothing I don t think about whatever happened in the past Reaves said I really just stay in the moment trying to do whatever it takes to help our team be successful Reaves blocks mattered for a different reason The guard said plays like those provide the team and the home crowd with an energy boost which the Lakers particularly needed while coming back from a point deficit Those are hustle plays that I feel like get everybody involved the crowd as well your teammates as well Reaves said It really just gives a different energy for the team and the crowd that you need when you re down at half and then coming out in the third We started off kind of slow but defensively we were locked in and we were doing a lot of things defensively really well so we were just trying to compete and do whatever it took Reaves has frequently been targeted by opposing offenses hoping his lack of experience will result in defensive breakdowns But the guard usually stands his ground proving his talent and skills on the defensive end
