Joe E. Tata, who portrayed Nat Bussichio in the well-known American teen drama television series Beverly Hills, 90210 in the 1990s, died today, Thursday, August 25, at the age of 85. For the past four years, he had been battling Alzheimer's illness. 

EWN reported that Tata's death, the third from the show in a couple of months, was revealed by his close friend and co-star Ian Ziering in a moving Instagram post. Ian's post was accompanied with two pictures of Joe, one from when the two were on the show and the other from more recently.

 “In the last few months we’ve lost Jessica Klein one of 90210’s most prolific writers and producers, Denise Douse who played Mrs Teasley, and now I’m very sad to say Joe E Tata has passed away”, wrote Ziering.

He continued: “Joey was truly an OG, I remember seeing him on the Rockford files with James Garner years before we worked together on 90210. He was often one of the background villains in the original Batman series”.

May his soul rest in peace!
