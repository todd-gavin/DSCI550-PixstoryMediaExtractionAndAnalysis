Semi-final record: W9 L2

Campaign in a nutshell:

Came through a potentially difficult qualifying tie with Levante and, despite losing at Bayern, always appeared to be on course for Group D's top spot as they sought to reclaim their champion status after losing it last season. 

Ada Hegerberg returned from a long term injury and was quickly back among the goals, including a crucial strike in the return against Juve to erase OL's first-leg deficit, demonstrating the French Club's enduring strength.

Lyon wield the competition records for title wins, final appearances, semi-final appearances (in fact, they have won their last nine), games played, goals scored and longest unbeaten run. This season, OL's Melvine Malard also slashed the historic first-ever group stage goal.

Campaign in a nutshell:

Following their home and away defeats of Real Madrid on Matchdays 3 and 4, Paris displayed the form that helped them knock Lyon out of Europe and depose them in the French league last season.

After finishing the group stage as both the top scorers and the only team not to concede, they were pushed to the quarter-finals by Bayern and needed Ramona Bachmann's extra-time winner to settle a Parc des Princes classic.

The Paris squad includes three Olympic gold medallists: Huitema, Ashley Lawrence (Canada, 2021) and Sara Däbritz (Germany, 2016).
