It is astounding that in this era of enlightenment, technology, and modern life, approximately 800 million adults globally are considered to be illiterate in even the most fundamental literacy skills. 

The purpose of International Literacy Day is to raise awareness of the significance and benefits of literary education for both people and groups, as well as for the advancement of world culture. 

The capacity to read and write has been closely linked in the modern world to decreased poverty, increased socioeconomic position, decreased population growth, minimised child and maternal death rates, and achieving sustainable gender and equality.

Because of this, many nations and governments feel that the future well-being of children and their families will directly be impacted by rising reading rates. 

This day was designated International Literacy Day by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1966. It is also known as World Literacy Day. It was intended to serve as a reminder to people everywhere that reading and writing skills should not be taken for granted. An effort has been made to raise literacy rates.
