NASA s Resilience The Mastcam Z camera system on the Mars rover captured film of Phobos one of Mars two moons obscuring the Sun It s the highest resolution highest frame rate view of an Phobos solar eclipse ever captured from the Martian surface I knew it was going to be good but I didn t expect it to be this amazing said Rachel Howson of Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego one of the Mastcam Z team members who operates the camera NASA TV reported that over the last years several Mars rovers have observed Phobos moving in front of the Sun In Spirit and Opportunity took the first time lapse photographs of Phobos while Curiosity was the first to film the event moons mars moons phobos in depth These eclipses allow astronomers to track small alterations in Phobos orbit over time each time they are viewed The Red Planet s deep interior as well as its crust and mantle are pulled by the moon s tidal forces analysing how much Phobos shifts over time informs something about how resistant the crust and mantle are and thus what materials they re made of
