Going to those shows to watch the seals perform is participating in cruelty Keeping an animal captive is just inherently wrong especially when that animal is wild Visitors wants and economic concerns take precedence over the requirements of the animals in marine mammal shows Enclosures are made to make the animals visible rather than comfortable and slick surfaces are preferred over naturalistic textures and substrates for ease of upkeep From capture to transit to a lifelong existence in small barren tanks keeping marine animals prisoner whether taken from the wild or reared in captivity causes enormous physical and psychological pain and anguish Natural behaviours include constant cardiovascular exercise prey foraging and social engagement with huge groups of strongly connected pod mates are suppressed in captivity due to insufficient space Free the tanks free the seal Our enjoyment is not worth their lives
