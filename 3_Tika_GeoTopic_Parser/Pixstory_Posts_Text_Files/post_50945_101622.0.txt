These days is all about recycling and repurposing old stuff that we don’t use anymore. We don’t have to throw away light bulbs that are not broken, but we can give them another use.  You can use them as decorations at your home. Make vases with flowers or make modern lamps. They can fit in different spaces and look interesting in the same time. 💡😍
