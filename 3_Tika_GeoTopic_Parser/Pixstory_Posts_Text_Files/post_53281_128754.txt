In a new D modelling study published this week in Science Advances we show that the giant extinct shark Otodus megalodon was a true globetrotting super predator It was capable of covering vast distances in short order and could eat the largest of modern living super predators the killer whale in five gargantuan bites It could have swallowed a great white shark whole The largest shark that ever lived Megalodon was the largest shark that ever lived and it was around for a long time from around million to million years ago At one time its range was enormous its fossilised teeth have been found on every continent except Antarctica These teeth are not hard to recognise if you come across them as they can be up to centimetres long Just why this formidable predator went extinct remains a mystery It could have been linked to global cooling or competition from other predators such as orcas killer whales This is just one of many unanswered questions One thing we know for sure is that the megalodon was big but just how big has remained a point of contention among scientists because previous estimates have been effectively based on just fragmentary remains And its size really matters because it helps us to interpret its biology the kinds of prey an animal can kill and eat the amount of food it needs to survive and the speed at which it can travel The question of diet is particularly important as it determines an animal s role and impact on its ecosystem Historically many thought megalodon took very big prey including large whales But it has recently been argued that it may not have been quite the super predator it had been cracked up to be concluding that it concentrated on lesser prey such as seals dolphins and small whales between around two and seven metres in length Read more
