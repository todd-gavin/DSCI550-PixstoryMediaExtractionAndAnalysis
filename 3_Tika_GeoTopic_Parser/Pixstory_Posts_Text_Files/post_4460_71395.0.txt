I’m totally on medicine, hot water, hot soups, fruits and multivitamins. My physicians is keeping check on my health through video calls, he calls me twice a day for the check-ups, he visits us one a week.
I’m keeping the record of my body temperature regularly, today it was 98C.

Liquid diet helps me alot, i have asked to consume 5 Liters of warm water everyday.

I wanna thank my friends, my family, my relatives and everyone for keeping a check on me, for talking to me over video calls, audio calls. Playing online games with me and motivating me to get recover fast.

I miss everything, for people who know me knows how much i love going out. I’m kind of a person who Never sits at home, i miss the sun, i miss the moon, i miss the people, i miss my fav food.

I remember my father was crying seeing us all three in different rooms quarantine , he is the strongest man trust me.

I am not a reader but this covid pushed me to read books, i kept myself motivating by reading positive journals, by lightening scented candles, playing music which makes me happy.

I’m taking long long hot showers, i’m wearing my best warm pajamas and hoodies.
I’m enjoying my coffee and tea alot more.
I wanna go out from these four walls, i want to hug my family. Meet my friends :( 

I want to get tested negative, and get recover fast. 
I wish all the good health to everyone, please stay at home. Wear your masks for yourself and for everyone around you.
