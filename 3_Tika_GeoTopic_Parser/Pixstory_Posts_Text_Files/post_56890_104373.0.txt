Metaverse Group, a vertically integrated NFT based metaverse real estate company and a subsidiary of Canada’s Tokens.com, has joined hands with Miami Fashion Week to host fashion week events in the metaverse on Fashion Street Estate. Miami Fashion Week is currently underway and will end on June 5.
The virtual grand opening will take place from June 3-5. Miami Fashion Week will be the second event hosted on the Fashion Estate this year. The metaverse event offers an immersive experience featuring fashion shows, catwalks, and avatar models, and gives attendees direct links to purchase virtual goods via the marketplace for quick and seamless transactions.

“Miami Fashion Week is the first global fashion week to bridge the physical-first fashion industry to digital-first Web3 designers and brands together through several Metaverse Group powered metaverse experiences and activations congruent with the week's events. Our Fashion Estate has become a pillar in the virtual fashion community and a popular virtual destination to host metaverse fashion events,” said Andrew Kiguel, CEO of Tokens.com and Metaverse Group executive chair.
