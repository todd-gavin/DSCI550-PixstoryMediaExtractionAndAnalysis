The years of Rino Gaetano and Stefano Rosso Concert and show at the Teatro delle Arti An interesting appointment with music and entertainment will be Friday February at the Teatro delle Arti in Signa Florence A tribute concert to Rino Gaetano and Stefano Rosso The sky is always bluer and Gianna Letto and A dishonest story Songs that marked their careers and the golden age of Italian songwriting in the Seventies Songs that act as a leitmotif to the musical theater show A few more details to tease you Rino Gaetano&#39;s songs offer themselves as a guide to a path that crosses cultural and other events of the seventies The contribution of the Michelangiolo Paoli Philharmonic made up of over musicians and with over two centuries of history precious for underlining the colorful aspects of some of his songs while some songs by Stefano Rosso, Rino&#39;s friend and sometimes forgotten singer-songwriter, give way to grasp the acoustic side of those years too In the busy context of the time the poetics and image of Rino Gaetano seemed to be distant if not even opposite In reality the irreverent eye of the Roman-adopted Calabrian singer-songwriter did not forget the suffering of those who lived in a shack of those who sweated their wages or died on the job Rino did it with a brilliant and desecrating original spirit he knew how to blend this look with an amused propensity for nonsense derived from Ionesco&#39;s theater of the absurd
