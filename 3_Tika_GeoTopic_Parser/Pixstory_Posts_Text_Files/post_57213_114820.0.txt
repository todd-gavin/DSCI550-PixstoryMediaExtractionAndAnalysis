You might be doing this to keep yourself safe, which could be a sign that you have a toxic thought tree dominating your thinking, and the root system is some abusive relationship that happened in your past. The only way you managed to cope during that time was a fawning trauma response, which is no longer sustainable in your life, as it has affected your ability to trust yourself and your self-confidence.
You may also slip into an over-explaining response if you have been gaslit. This can make you feel like you must say a lot and say things differently so that the person gaslighting you canâ€™t distort your words and make you look bad by using what you say against you.

It could also be that you are trying to make people understand where you are coming from, and you feel the need to use a prefacing comment or story as a protective barrier to make people see your reasoning.
You may need to justify yourself or your decisions to make someone accept who you are and how you think, which is also a trauma root that you will need to work on.
You could also be trying to keep the peace and over-explain.
