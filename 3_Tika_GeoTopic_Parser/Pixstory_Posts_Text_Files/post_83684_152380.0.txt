Today I spent the entire day at a library studying for the upcoming exams. I despise spending long periods of time studying on a regular basis, but it's a requirement before the exams, so I have to do it. I enjoy sitting for a day or two to intensely read and study the syllabus, but more than two days is torturous for me, and now that I'm in college, the syllabus is so vast that I have to start studying at least a month before the exam.
So, please feel free to share your advice on how to deal with long periods of studying.
