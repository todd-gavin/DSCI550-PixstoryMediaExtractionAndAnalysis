MY PALETTE IS FULL 

The colours of life
Yellow, green, purple,blue and white,
All wrapped up in mystery,
Sometimes they lay scattered 
As in a jigsaw puzzle,
I weave them into a beautiful tapestry. 

Let rays of light be one with the being,
And rain make the music,
With my palette full
I paint the days with the best colours ,
Some days when tears roll down my eyes
In multiple shades
I hide myself behind my smile. 

I embrace my colours of love 
My colours of joy
And colours of grief,
I can't deny their call,
In my rhythm of existence
I stand up for my beliefs.
