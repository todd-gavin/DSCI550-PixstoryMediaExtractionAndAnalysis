Paris Saint-Germain Women punched their ticket for the final four of the Women's Champions League by eliminating Bayern Munich at the Parc des Princes. They will face arch-rivals Lyon in the next round!

Les Rouge et Bleu now know their next opponents! The Parisians will face their great rivals from Olympique Lyonnais in the European semi-finals on 23 and 30 April.

The capital club qualified thanks to a strong performance in Munich - with a double from Marie-Antoinette Katoto (1-2) - before equalising dramatically at the Parc des Princes thanks to Sandy Baltimore and Ramona Bachmann (2-2).

Lyon qualified by eliminating Juventus.

This clash between the French champions and the current D1 Arkema leaders is also a well known fixture in the Women's Champions League. Indeed, the Paris Saint-Germain players eliminated the title holders and seven-time winners of the competition last season, at the quarter-final stage, turning things around with a win at the Parc OL (0-1, 1-2).

This time, it will be a question of obtaining a ticket for the showpiece final, which will be held on 21 May 2022 in Turin. The winners of this double-header will meet the winners of the other semi-final between Wolfsburg and Arsenal.
