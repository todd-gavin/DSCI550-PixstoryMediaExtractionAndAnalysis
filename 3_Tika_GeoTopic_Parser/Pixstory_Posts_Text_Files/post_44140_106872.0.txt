According to Gabby Agbonlahor, Liverpool could sell Mohamed Salah for "£40 million" and
replace him with Raphinha of Leeds United. The ex-Aston Villa and England attacker said to
Football Insider that every major team will be interested in signing Raphinha this summer.

Salah, 29, stated to Sky Sports last month (27 May) that he will finish the final year of his Liverpool deal at Anfield. Raphinha blew away their scouts in his debut season at Leeds, Football Insider initially reported last year (6 February 2021).

Since then, the 25-year-old has progressed from strength to strength, contributing 14 goals to the Whites' 17th-place finish in the Premier League in 2021-22.

“I think he would be a good player for Liverpool,” Agbonlahor told Football Insider correspondent
Connor Whitley.

“His better football is on the right and that position is taken up by Salah. Would they think ‘Salah
can go then, we can get £30million,£40 million with a year left on his contract’.

“I don’t see any top team not looking to sign Raphinha, I rate him that highly.

Raphinha's contract with Leeds expires in two years, and negotiations for a new deal have
stalled. In October 2020, he moved to Elland Road for £17 million from Rennes.

According to Football Insider, Aston Villa are interested in signing Liverpool midfielder Alex
Oxlade-Chamberlain. Now that he is approaching the end of his contract, the Merseyside giants
are willing to sell the versatile midfielder this summer.

According to a Villa source, Steven Gerrard is a "big" fan of Oxlade-Chamberlain, 28, and has
made him a major target for the remainder of the transfer window. Intriguingly, the Villa manager
wants to deploy Oxlade-Chamberlain in an attacking role, where his goal-scoring and
goal-creating abilities may be put to good use.
