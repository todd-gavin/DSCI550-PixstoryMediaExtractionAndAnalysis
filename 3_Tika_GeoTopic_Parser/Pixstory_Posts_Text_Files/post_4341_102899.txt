It looks like you have a yearning for a bygone era understandable given your advanced age But the world has changed The policies that Nehru espoused are now demonstrably false From non alignment to socialism from central planning to focus on a few higher education institutes key decisions taken in that era resulted in hardship for the masses and ended up benefitting only a few Nehru s thinking on economy education health rule of law the mainstays of any modern nation was faulty at best and regressive in many cases The obfuscation in history textbooks conceived and implemented on his watch has only led to a severe backlash decades down the line Instead of being honest about India s troubled past he tried to paint a distorted image and the country is paying the price for it Hope you understand that blind faith is wrong Be it for Modi or be it for Nehru Have a good day
