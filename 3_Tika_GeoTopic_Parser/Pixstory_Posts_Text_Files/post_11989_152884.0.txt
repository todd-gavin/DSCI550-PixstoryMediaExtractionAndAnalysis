How colourful is your plate ? Remember - that you need an extra 450 calories a day at thisÂ  stage of your pregnancy .
If you have variety , youâ€™ll get enough of these nutrients from the food you eat ! 
Let's discuss what you should eat in third trimester ; âœ…ðŸ¤°
1 Calcium - It forms bones and teeths . Eat - Peanuts , dark green leafy vegetables , oranges and organe juice .
2 Vitamin B6 - It helps in formation of baby's red blood cells and brain . Eat - Bananas , starchy vegetables like potatoes and whole grain Cereals .
3 Choline - It helps in your baby's brain and spinal cord formation . Eat - Potatoes , soy products and Cruciferous vegetables .
4 Omega 3 Acids - It helps in formation of cells and brain development . Eat - Spinach , kidney beans and walnuts .
5 Protein - It grows the baby's body overall to enter the world . Eat - paneer , legumes and peas .
Wash and slice fruit such as kiwis , strawberries , melon and papaya and tuck in for vitamin C , as well as fibre . Know a secret element that helps release the nutrients from other foods effectively ? Its called Thiamine . Sweet potatoes have a lot of it . Also , for thiamine , try a daal-based soup every day . Have a pouch of nuts and seeds in your handbag for the occasional hunger pang .
How about a bhel salad in the early evening ? Packed with murmura , and boiled legumes that have protein ! Remember , you need at least 100 grams of protein per day . Chop tomatoes in it for the Vitamin C .
Finally , your greens continue to remain important . And , they donâ€™t have to be boring ! How about spinach and beans and a topping of crunchy sliced walnuts on top
