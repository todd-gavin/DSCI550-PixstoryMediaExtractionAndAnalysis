Officials of the International Rescue Committee say: "The economic crisis that has engulfed Afghanistan since August 2021 is the main cause of hunger and threatens the survival of nearly 20 million Afghans."

Since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, the economy has reached the brink and poverty and hunger are growing every day.

Access to Afghanistan's foreign reserves is now blocked, the banking system is dysfunctional, and development aid that used to fund most government services has been halted. The International Rescue Committee says the number of people in need of humanitarian aid in Afghanistan has increased by 33 percent.


"While the political cycle in Afghanistan turns, it is ordinary Afghans who suffer from the economic collapse," said a note published on the website of the International Rescue Committee on Wednesday, 12 Asad.

The International Rescue Committee was established in 1933 at the invitation of Albert Einstein, a famous physicist. It works in more than 40 countries to restore health, safety, education, economic well-being and power to affected people." 43 percent of Afghanistan's population lives on less than one meal a day, with household debt levels skyrocketing. Food prices are rising and reports of child marriage, child labor and the sale of human body parts are on the rise."

 Afghan people now spend 90% of their income on food, and it is predicted that by the second half of this year, 97% of the population will live below the poverty line.

At the same time, budget cuts have reduced the ability of UN agencies and NGOs to provide vital services, the International Rescue Committee says.

The committee called on the international community to focus on protecting innocent Afghan lives and increase humanitarian aid to prevent further spread of possible famine.
