“How to win the game of life,” and this one quote sum up the first three episodes of ‘We Crashed,’ web series available on Apple TV+.

“We Crashed,” is a story about Adam (played by Jared Leto) and his struggle to start his own business.

The first episode starts where we see that Adam is pitching his business idea to so many investors in 2007 and each one of them rejected his idea then Adam met Rebekah (played by Anne Hathaway) and Miguel (played by Kyle Marwin) who helped him to start his business. Rebekah boost his morale and Miguel gave him space and funds to start his business and they started their new business named ‘Greendesk.’

But the nature of humans is to grow at any cost and for that, Adam scraped off ‘Greendesk,’ and tried to get new investors for a bigger business idea and one investor agreed to fund his idea.

The second episode began with the conflict when the investor ditched Adam and the struggle of Adam continues. Then Adam and Rebekah got married to each other and Rebekah’s dad gave them one million dollars as a gift but Adam used that money to invest in his business and then Adam, Rebekah, and Miguel started “WeWork.”

In episode three, we saw the success of the “WeWork” and by 2012 they have 10k members working for it but every success story has its hurdle and now the hurdle was one quote from Rebekah (which I’ll not tell because it can be the spoiler) which put “WeWork” and Adam into trouble but at the end of the episode, everything got sorted out.

What I liked about the series till now is its story and its pace things that I didn’t like about the series till now are the third episode because this episode didn’t add anything to the story.

The next episode of the series will premiere on 25th March. 

If you are interested in business then you should watch this series.

I’ll talk about everything in details once all the episodes come out.
