Vehicles that run on gasoline or diesel will continuously pollute the environment for the duration of their effective life This is just the simple yet unfortunate consequence of how a gasoline vehicle powers its propulsion which is by combustion of the air fuel mixture it uses However it means that an internal combustion engine s tailpipe will perpetually emit harmful emissions and contaminate the environment whenever the vehicle is in use This huge difference in the amount of pollution that these vehicles contribute is what allows electric cars to be cleaner than their ICE counterparts over a long time even when they initially exact a heavier toll on the environment due to the manufacturing process unique to EVs
