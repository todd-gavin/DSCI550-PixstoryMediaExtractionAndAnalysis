Breaking points are never fun but I m glad I reached mine as they pushed me to start therapy which has given me the tools to deal with the distress so that I can be myself I believe that if you feel like you re not being able to be who you are every day and if it is creating distress in your life there s no harm in speaking to a therapist You might go in for one session or you might decide you want multiple like I did The goal is to come closer to being content within yourself
