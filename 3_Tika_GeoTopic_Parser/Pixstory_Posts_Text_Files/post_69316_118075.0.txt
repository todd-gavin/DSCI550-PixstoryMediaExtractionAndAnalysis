Halwa Paratha is an interesting yet straightforward street snack that is widely available. Sooji (semolina) is used to make Halwa, while flour is used to make Parath. With a 3 foot circumference, this paratha is truly quite large. Each and every Kashmiri loves to purchase this. The moderate sweetness of the paratha, which is intended to be consumed hot, makes it quite appealing.
