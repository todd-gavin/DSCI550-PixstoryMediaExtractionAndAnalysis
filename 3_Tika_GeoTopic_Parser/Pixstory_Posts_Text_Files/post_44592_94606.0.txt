The Snow Lion and the Dragon:
Tibet-China Relations
continues.....

The subsequent Ming Dynasty in China (1368-1644 CE) labeled the Tibetans as ‘foreigners’ in the chronicles of the period, and did not attempt to invade or control the Tibetan-inhabited region to the west of the lands inhabited by the Han people. Tibet functioned as an independent geographical and political entity during this entire period, continuing to maintain their ‘Teacher-Protector’ relationship with the Mongols. Later, another foreign non-Han dynasty that conquered and ruled China, the Manchus of the Qing dynasty, who invaded China from Manchuria to its north-east, expanded their empire by conquering Tibet and Eastern Turkestan. But eventually the decaying Manchu Empire collapsed under European pressure, with the British invading China and capturing Beijing, using both British and Indian troops, a fact which till today also remains a Chinese grudge against the Indian Army.

The Choe-Yon system began to break down in modern times due to a number of simultaneously-operating factors.

Firstly, the increasing weakness of the Manchu Empire as it degenerated did not physically permit it to be a ‘protector’ of Tibetan autonomy or ‘independence’, depending upon the differing points of view. This showed itself very clearly to the Tibetans when the Chinese were helpless to prevent forcible British penetration into Sikkim, and later the Younghusband military expedition to Lhasa.

Secondly, the Chinese themselves began to abandon the concept when they started dealing with the British regarding Tibet and Sikkim, without either reference to, or any consultation with, the Tibetan government.
