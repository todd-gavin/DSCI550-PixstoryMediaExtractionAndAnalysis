This is alarming because the Arctic contains sensitive and delicately balanced climate components that if pushed too hard will respond with global consequences Why is the Arctic warming so much faster A large part of the explanation relates to sea ice This is a thin layer typically one metre to five metres thick of sea water that freezes in winter and partially melts in the summer The sea ice is covered in a bright layer of snow which reflects around of incoming solar radiation back out to space The opposite occurs in the open ocean As the darkest natural surface on the planet the ocean absorbs of solar radiation When covered with sea ice the Arctic Ocean acts like a large reflective blanket reducing the absorption of solar radiation As the sea ice melts absorption rates increase resulting in a positive feedback loop where the rapid pace of ocean warming further amplifies sea ice melt contributing to even faster ocean warming This feedback loop is largely responsible for what is known as Arctic amplification and is the explanation for why the Arctic is warming so much more than the rest of the planet Is Arctic amplification underestimated Numerical climate models have been used to quantify the magnitude of Arctic amplification They typically estimate the amplification ratio to be about meaning the Arctic is warming times faster than the global average Based on the observational record of surface temperatures over the last years the new study estimates the Arctic amplification rate to be about four Rarely do the climate models obtain values as high that This suggests the models may not fully capture the complete feedback loops responsible for Arctic amplification and may as a consequence underestimate future Arctic warming and the potential consequences that accompany that Read more
