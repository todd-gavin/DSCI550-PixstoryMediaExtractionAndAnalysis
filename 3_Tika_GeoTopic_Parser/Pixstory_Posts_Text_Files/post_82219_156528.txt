My favourite subject is history I love it because everywhere I turn there is so much learn Every thing we see has a history even the most miniscule inconsequential thing has a history Food clothes utensils and so on is deeply embedded in the pages of ancient civilizations Even something so small like buttons have a history a period when it was considered luxurious The first buttons were invented in Indus Valley Civilization It was used as ornamental embellishments to a person s attire It also signified wealth and status It was made out of seashell and often had holes for sewing Often it was embellished in a geometrical pattern rather than the straight line we see now As centuries progressed the buttons became the fastener of clothes as Romans used it to pin clothes It was only in the mediaeval times that buttonhole was created The design was that the button could be slotted in and it would stay in place Fashion would never be the same again It s so interesting to find that an insignificant button which isn t even noticed nowadays was the indicator of status back then How far have we come
