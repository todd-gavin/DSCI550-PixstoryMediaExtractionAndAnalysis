Pets are part of our families, 
it’s important we create the most pet-friendly environment for them. ❤️Many of our systems have evolved to be less than welcoming to our furry companions. With some effort, we can make them friendlier and ease for them.✔️
For the campaign we can reach multiple government, NGOs and city organizations around the world to make cities pet-friendly also to people at different markets, shops, some cafe , malls to spread awareness regarding pet friendly city . 📝We can educate people about issues faced by pets. From teaching responsible pet ownership and working to reduce pet homelessness we can spread general awareness. ✔️Creating more park areas, friendly public transport, shelter and food at public are some of the good ideas . ✔️📝
These steps can help make the world a more pet-friendly place.🏁👍
We all can work together to create a more welcoming environment for these animals …!!✔️❤️
