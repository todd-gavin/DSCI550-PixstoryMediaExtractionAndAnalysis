Narwar's history appears to go back a long distance, possibly all the way to mythology. The village below the fort was called Nalapura until the 12th century, and it is claimed to have been the capital of Raja Nala from the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata. 

According to archaeological evidence, the Naga rulers controlled Narwar from 0 AD to 225 AD, with a sequence of nine Naga kings. Surprisingly, the archaeological record is silent for the next eight centuries, with no coins or inscriptions unearthed in the area, though an inscription discovered at Eran may suggest that the territory was ruled by the Toramana dynasty. 

We don't know how long the Toramana dynasty lasted, but we do know that it existed. Archaeological Survey of India Volume II 1864-65 by Alexander Cunningham tells us that from the 12th century onwards Narwar was held successively by Kachwaha, Parihar, and Tomar Rajputs (warrior caste) until its capture by the Mughals in the early 16th century. It was subsequently conquered by the Maratha Maharaja Scindia in the 19th century.

The best way to get to Narwar Fort is from the east; on Google maps, you can plainly see the trail leaving town and heading north before turning left immediately before Alamgir Gate, which was previously known as Pisanhari Gate and was restored in the Moghul style by Aurangzeb.
