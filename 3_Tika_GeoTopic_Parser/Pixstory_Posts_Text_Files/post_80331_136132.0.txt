Offsides - a Frustrating Inconsistency 

Offsides were introduced to prevent goal hanging, to stop a forward player constantly sitting on the last line, and in essence waiting to poach without consequence. 

So far this season in the Premier League, there has been a number of incredibly tight offside calls - some which have gone the way of the offensive team, and others which have gone against.

Isak’s vs Liverpool is the most recent one, with the Swede adjudged to be slightly offside, although there was nothing conclusive to suggest so. Jesus vs Bournemouth maybe very slightly, Rashford vs Liverpool’s also looked very tight but stood. Those are just a few examples off the top of my head.

Now for me the main problem with these specific calls, is the player is only offside (if that’s even the case) because he’s naturally leaning forward, compared to gaining an advantage by being in an offside position. 

I get the offside rule will always be relatively subjective and debatable, but at the same time, how can a decision be ‘clear and obvious’ when it takes 10-15 replays and it almost looks like the intent is to find a way they’re offside? 

When VAR first came in, it’s first full season of being implemented was a horrific spectacle for the neutral, and the perspectives on offside was the large reason for that. Lines which looked like something out of Year 4 Art, 2 minutes on a decision to get the wrong call, frequent controversy - it was a disaster.

Whilst the league is no where near as bad as that, the inconsistency still looms, and ultimately the narrative ‘clear and obvious’ can’t be the logic when a decision can’t be decided with conviction.
