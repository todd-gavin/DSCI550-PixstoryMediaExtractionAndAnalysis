Despite reports associating Thomas Tuchel with a move away from Stamford Bridge following the sanctions imposed on Roman Abramovich Chelsea technical director Petr Cech says he hopes he will stay Due to his ties with Vladimir Putin the Russian billionaire s assets were frozen earlier this week and Chelsea is now functioning under a special licence that prevents the club from signing and selling players selling match tickets or issuing new contracts Tuchel has been a revelation in west London but since the news of the sanctions broke he s been linked with Manchester United with Ralf Rangnick keen to appoint his apprentice at Old Trafford With so much uncertainty surrounding the club s future including the possibility of administration Cech spoke to SkySports before of today s match against Newcastle United attempting to answer some tough questions concerning the club s future When asked about Tuchel s future Cech stated that all current contracts are valid and that he hopes Tuchel will stay at Stamford Bridge Well Thomas has a contract until and as it stands we ve been told that the contracts will be valid Cech told SkySports In that way we hope that we will have him as a coach because he s been absolutely brilliant on every level but that s another thing that tomorrow the situation can change and my answer will be irrelevant Cech talked strongly about the club s ideals claiming that the next owners will inherit a club with a storied history that predates Abramovich s ownership by years It has its own journey and its own success and of course I hear around that people try to take the last years and try to erase it from the memory of the football community but this is not about money this is about dedication hard work and the players that sweat every day and work hard with people behind the scenes to make people successful
