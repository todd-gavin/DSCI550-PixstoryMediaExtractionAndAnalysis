The costumes in "The Gilded Age," HBO's buzz-worthy series that premiered this season, are sumptuous. The mansions are lavishly decorated. The chasms between classes are wide. And, at least when it comes to Dansville, the Livingston County town that is the origin of the American Red Cross, the history is — sort of — accurate. 

Clara Barton, the founder of the American Red Cross, is a prominent character in the show. Bertha Russell, the wife of a fictional robber baron railroad billionaire, supports three Red Cross chapters in the late 1800s series in an attempt to ingratiate herself with "old money" New York City society. 

Russell and other characters travel to Dansville for an event in episode five, titled "Charity Has Two Functions."

The Evening Tribune reported that no actual Dansville landmarks will be recognised by viewers of "The Gilded Age" from the Southern Tier. Many of the series' scenes were shot in Newport, Rhode Island, including the Dansville battle, which took place on School Street. The early saltbox style New England architecture shown in the background of the Red Cross scenario would be out of place in most Southern Tier towns. 

Newport also acts as a backdrop for the series' settings in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, as well as the wealthy's vacation houses. 

"I guess it would have to be the buildings [that] convey that age," said Dansville Mayor Peter R. Vogt, laughing about the City-By-The-Sea functioning as a stand-in for his hometown.
