A diet with a low glycemic index could prevent type diabetes This is the result of the MEDGI Carb study published in Nutrients conducted by researchers from the Institute of Food Sciences of the National Research Council of Avellino Cnr Isa in collaboration with the Diabetes Nutrition and Metabolism Unit of University of Naples Federico II and the Universities of Purdue USA and Chalmers Sweden The research team evaluated how the daily glycemic profile of overweight individuals without diabetes was influenced by diet. The main assumption of this study is the awareness that lowering blood sugar after the meal can be an effective strategy to reduce the incidence of diabetes in fact the increase in postprandial glycemia represents the beginning of the process that leads to the development of the disease says Rosalba Giacco researcher in the area of human nutrition and metabolism at the Cnr Isa of Avellino and responsible for the research project Previous studies have shown that foods with a high glycemic index such as white bread, rice, polenta, pizza and potatoes favor the increase in blood sugar. Therefore, people with diabetes must reduce their consumption of sugar to keep their blood sugar under control after a meal. these foods, preferring not only those rich in fiber such as legumes, fruit, vegetables and whole grains but also those with a low glycemic index such as pasta, parboiled rice, piadinas However, it has never been ascertained whether even for overweight people at risk of developing diabetes type may be useful food choices that take into account the glycemic index
