San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich is not one to call attention to himself, but his players made sure he basked in the limelight for at least a few minutes after he became the NBA's all-time leader in regular-season coaching wins on Friday night.

The Spurs players kept Popovich on the court to soak in the applause from the home fans after his team rallied for a 104-102 win over the Utah Jazz. He looked uncomfortable amid the attention but finally cracked a smile.

His grin was about more than just the record, as the Spurs rallied from 15 points down in the fourth quarter to give Popovich the record. San Antonio had been 0-33 in games it was trailing entering the final period. The victory, Popovich's 1,336th, pushed him past Don Nelson. Popovich is in his 26th NBA season, all with the Spurs.

Dejounte Murray led the Spurs with 27 points, with Jakob Poeltl adding 15 points and 11 rebounds. Donovan Mitchell scored 24 points to lead the Jazz, while Jordan Clarkson chipped in 17 points.

Lakers 122, Wizards 109

LeBron James scored 33 of his 50 points after halftime and host Los Angeles won for just the second time in eight games, pulling away to defeat Washington.

James shot 18 of 25 from the field and 6 of 9 from 3-point range. He became the first Lakers player with multiple games of 50 points in a season since Kobe Bryant in 2007-08. He also had six assists, leaving him two shy of 10,000 for his career.

Malik Monk added 21 points for the Lakers. Former Laker Kyle Kuzma had 23 points and rookie Corey Kispert scored a career-best 21 for the Wizards, who lost for the fifth time in seven games.

Raptors 117, Suns 112

Gary Trent Jr. matched his season best with 42 points, hitting eight 3-pointers, and visiting Toronto withstood a comeback by Phoenix for the win.

Pascal Siakam added 25 points and 10 assists for the Raptors, who won their second in a row. Toronto's Scottie Barnes had 15 points.
