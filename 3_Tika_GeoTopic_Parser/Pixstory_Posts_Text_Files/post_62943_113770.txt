I find relaxation in leisure travel It helps me escape my thoughts my work and my daily routines and puts me in a situation where I can find pleasure in new things new people and new experiences It enlightens me to the glories of nature and demonstrates that my world extends beyond the square miles that I earlier stayed in You have no idea what all traveling can do to you and for you It can change your entire life Your thoughts your outlook your perceptions will br challenged You will be forced to look at the world in a different light A light that is more compassionate and brighter You will see things that you never thought you could You will meet people with experiences so different from yours In the end you ll forever be a small memory of them and they ll forever be a small memory of you I often wonder if somebody somewhere tells their kids or friends or family stories of me stories of when they met me just how I tell my friends the stories of when I met them I ve met so many other tourists on foreign land I have met the natives With each one of them I ve had an experience unlike the others I have been in situations where language was a barrier but we all managed to communicate Travel opened the doors to spirituality for me And no not in the religious God ly sense But in a very I can connect to other people better sense
