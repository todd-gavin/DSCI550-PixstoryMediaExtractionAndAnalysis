North London Derby tomorrow; one of the biggest games of every season. Let’s get straight into the Combined XI…GK - Ramsdale - Not hearing any of these Lloris shouts. Give me a modern, ball-playing goalkeeper. Simple as.LB - Zinchenko - In a back four I’m going Zinchenko over Perisic easily. People won’t like it, but Perisic is overrated.CB - Romero - He is, unfortunately, very good. Back three helps him at Spurs, but he plays well in Argentina’s back four, too.CB - Saliba - Has to be in there. Fast, tall, excellent on the ball, I can keep going…RB - White - Him or Tomiyasu, take your pick. I’ll go for Ben - he starts for us right now. Absolutely no debate on this one.DM - Partey - Excellent when fit. I like Hojberg, but realistically he’s not better.#8 - Xhaka - One of the best midfielders in the league this season. Walks into this combined XI.#8 - Ødegaard - No real creative comparison at Spurs. Ødegaard is in, he’ll control the tempo.LW - Son - I do this he’s rather inconsistent, and Martinelli has been far better this season, but Son goes in. Can’t deny how good he was last season.ST - Kane - Again, it feels criminal to not have Jesus in this team, but Kane is one of the very best. Painful to say it.RW - Saka - Easy. Not even going to entertain the Kulusevski debate. Saka is better, but the Spurs man is it a top player. Don’t think this team is too controversial, but maybe rival fans won’t like it. Let me know your thoughts.
