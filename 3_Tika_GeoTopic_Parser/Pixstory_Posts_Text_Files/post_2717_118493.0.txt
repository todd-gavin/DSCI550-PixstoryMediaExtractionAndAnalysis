Jeeves, I have just returned from the Drones, there is total confusion, the guys apparently saw on TV that  some Indian chappie is becoming the PM.
Sir, It is confusing no doubt but please permit me to make a correction, an Englishman of Indian origin.

Jeeves, one is either English or Indian. I have not heard of an Englishman of Indian origin.
Sir, as we can see, the times have changed, today it is possible to be English but of an origin of another country. 

Sir, the Aspiring PM was born here and so the sobriquet, an Englishman of Indian origin.
So Jeeves, tomorrow a Frenchman who comes to England and settled down here will be English of French origin.
Precisely Sir, I am glad you have grasped this complicated issue with such consummate ease.
Hold on , hold on, this Frenchie will then have to speak English
Absolutely Sir
So this Indian chappie speaks the Queens English. 
Certainly sir, I have heard him speak so well with such good diction that an English man of English origin will be put to shame.
Jeeves , once again the head throbs violently . What is this about an Englishman of English origin?
Sir, an Englishman whose parents for several generations have been in England.
Frankly this was getting beyond me. Discussing Newts with Gussie was far easier.
Jeeves come to the point. Is our country in safe hands
No doubt sir, I have no doubts. the PM to be is impeccably dressed and groomed. His tie has been knotted with perfection. The country is in safe hands
Thank you Jeeves, you put my mind at ease. Please a stiffish whisky and soda. I need to calm the ganglions which are all at a flutter. If you could be so kind 
Certainly Sir. I do hope you will not take umbrage at the fact that all pink shirts have been returned to Peabody and Simms. I have retained only the whites. Thank you sir. I will bring the whisky and soda at once.
