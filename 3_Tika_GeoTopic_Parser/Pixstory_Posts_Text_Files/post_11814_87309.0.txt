During menstrual periods most of us do get worried and irritated with the mood swings and with many other mundane things. But the more stress providing factor is when we don't get our periods on time and many other factors. But sometimes some signs tells us to consult a gynec such like an instance where there are changes in the length, frequency or heaviness of your period. 

Menstruation have been a very important indicator of our health but its only looked into for Pap smears or for birth controls and not further learned upon. 

But here we have a large scale study being made on mental cycles and the variations in it 

The Apple Women's Health Study have been the first long term study which tries to understand the menstrual cycle and how it is related to health conditions like infertility, heart health and menopause. The study is widely open for anyone who has menstraat least once irrespective of their gender. 

Data for the study is being collected via the Apple Research App on study participants’ iPhones, Apple Watches, or both, giving researchers unprecedented access to users’ health data.

Dr. Shruthi Mahalingaiah, an assistant professor of environmental, reproductive, and women’s health in the department of environmental health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said this is why the Apple Women’s Health Study, which she is a principal investigator on, is so important.

“Our study hopes to empower women to contribute longitudinal, scientific data as they go about their everyday lives, rather than only being able to gather fragmented data in a limited setting or during a doctor’s visit,” said Mahalingaiah.
