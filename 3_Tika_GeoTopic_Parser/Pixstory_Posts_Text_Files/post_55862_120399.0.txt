According to a Report, The Prince of Wales received a £1m donation for his charity from relatives of Osama bin Laden. The Sunday Times alleged that the future king accepted the payment from Bakr bin Laden, the patriarch of the Saudi family, and his brother Shafiq.

The reports say that Prince Charles, 73, is said to have held a private meeting with Bakr, 76, at Clarence House in London on 30 October 2013, two years after Osama bin Laden was shot dead by the US in Pakistan.

Clarence House strongly disagrees the many of the claims and puts it as the decision to accept the donation to his charity was taken by the trustees and not the Prince. 

Bakr and Shafiq bin Laden are half-brothers of Osama, related to the founder of al-Qaida through their father Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, a Yemeni-born billionaire. There is no suggestion that Bakr or Shafiq bin Laden has funded or been implicated in acts of terrorism.

Sir Ian Cheshire, chairman of the Prince of Wales Charitable Foundation (PWCF), where the money was deposited, said in a statement: “The donation from Sheik Bakr bin Laden in 2013 was carefully considered by PWCF Trustees at the time.

“Due diligence was conducted, with information sought from a wide range of sources, including government. The decision to accept the donation was taken wholly by the Trustees.

Any attempt to suggest otherwise is misleading and inaccurate.”
