French label Marine Serre sent athletes and artists to stroll a track field runway on Saturday evening, showcasing a sport-inspired wardrobe infused with artistic references in an all-ages, open-to-the-public fashion show.

Like Olympic opening ceremonies, delegations succeeded one another.

The collection, as always with Marine Serre, emphasises clothes made from recycled materials. White cotton embroidered pillowcases turn into shirts, shorts and skirts, matched with coats, jackets and dresses assembled from different types of denim. Oversize scarves morph into flowing dresses. A maxi coat is covered with a deluge of appliqué pockets, from the shoulders to the bottom hem. 

Light-coloured leather triangles are cleverly fitted together to make jigsaw trousers and blousons, while lace doilies are elegantly inserted into crocheted knitwear.
 
For next summer, anticipating future heatwaves, Serre has used terry fabric extensively to fashion snug trouser sets, tight-fitting playsuits and assorted bathrobe-style coats. 

In a more sophisticated vein, she has also designed chic suits, tweed jackets with golden buttons, outfits with a tonal tapestry effect, and even wrapped multiple gold chains around the neck, arms and waist of Lourdes Leon, Madonna’s daughter, who brought the show to a close.
