One ability which at most times I am not able to identify whether is it is a boon or bane is our ability to produce kids. For that we need to menstruate every month. With only twelve percent of Indian women having access to sanitary napkins (sn), the women and girls who would be travelling whilst they are on their periods would be extremely uncomfortable. What other women (no access to sn) use is dirty rags, straws or torn clothes which are already terribly unhygienic causing reproductive tract infection, reproductive complexities and other types of cancers. 
When a girl is on her period, ideally, she needs to change the pad after every six to seven hours regularly. A woman traveling 300 kilometres would have to stop every 15 kilometres to change her pads which I doubt any migrant labour woman or girl can afford because sanitary napkins are charged whereas brooms are tax free because apparently, it's more important to keep our houses clean than our body. No woman would want to become a cause of halt or delay for a petty thing like this, in already distressing time, also because of the stigma related to menstruation. 
Like food, we also should have handed out and publicly distributed sanitary napkins. I know it is a big taboo to be broken for our society at this time. But this is the time to bring about a change. It's high time now. Change is the only constant. As a society we need to take cognizance that women are at a greater risk and more vulnerable than men during any crisis, war, pandemic, public places or even homes. Hence the people and the state should work together to make our children and women feel even more protected and less affected just because they can reproduce and properly the species forward.
