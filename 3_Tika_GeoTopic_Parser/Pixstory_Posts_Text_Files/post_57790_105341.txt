We all live life with some expectations some aspirations some goals some hope All of these things are our driving forces We hope for all these things and then work towards attaining them We go through so many ups and downs and lefts and rights with so many people and so many situations just hanging on and looking towards this hope in our lives Wanting to live healthily is hoping to live happily is hoping to live lavishly is hoping and to live comfortably is hoping Hope is being able to see that there is light in the pitch black darkness Hope is the one thing that helps us get through the darkest of times Carry hope throughout your life so that you believe in better things ahead letting you know where you are meant to be right now and that where you are is your right path Let hope guide you through life Once you choose hope anythings possible Hope is a waking dream Hope is the ability to hear the melody of the future Hope lies in dreams and imaginations and in the courage of those who dare to make those dreams a reality Hope is that thing in us that insists despite all the evidence to the contrary that something better awaits us if we have the courage to reach for it to work for it and to fight for it Where there is hope there is life Hope is an orientation of spirit an orientation of the heart It is not the conviction that something will turn out well but the certainty that something makes sense regardless of how it turns out and that you will figure it out and keep moving on Hope is passion for what is possible Hope is the only thing stronger than fear Hope and face your fears Let your choices reflect your hope and not your fear for it is our purpose of life to hope
