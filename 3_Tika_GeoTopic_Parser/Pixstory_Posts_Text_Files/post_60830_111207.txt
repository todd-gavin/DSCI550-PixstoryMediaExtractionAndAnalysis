Right now I m visiting a place where there are more trees and gardens than houses Having come from a city environment this change is like a breath of fresh air literally Everyone talks about sustainability but do people practice it According to statistics shoppers say that they are aware of environmental responsibility but only practice it consistently What does that say about spreading awareness It s extremely important to preach but it s also important to get people to convert that awareness into practice I have studied environmental science as part of our curriculum from a very young age However it was difficult to make HUGE changes to my lifestyle right away After all we are creatures of habit favouring convenience I believe change happens gradually and by taking small actionable steps They don t need to have a great impact right away You don t have to shoulder the responsibility of saving the turtles by yourself But you can make small changes that may save them one day Somethings you can do to make small changes before transitioning into the big ones tried and tested by me Replace your plastic bottle cutlery tiffin boxes with metal glass Replacing plastic toothbrush comb with bamboo ones Trying to use as many refillable products as possible like pens Growing more plants in my garden and home start by getting a small indoor plant then you ll feel like getting more Shopping fresh instead of using canned packaged ones I make my own juice chicken nuggets dressings now instead of buying the retail ones much more tastier Decluttering my email inbox small step but reduces carbon footprints These are baby steps Not huge ones Even these baby steps require efforts but it s still a start You don t have to follow all of them Even following just a few will drastically reduce the amount of waste you generate everyday Make the change when you feel ready
