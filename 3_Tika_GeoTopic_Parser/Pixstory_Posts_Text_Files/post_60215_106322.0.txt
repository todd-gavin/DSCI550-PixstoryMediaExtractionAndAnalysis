A big fire broke out at a petrol pump after an oil tanker carrying over 10,000 litres of gasoline caught fire.

Faisal, on the other hand, drove the truck for another two kilometres in an attempt to save lives. His video went viral on social media, and he was named a "real-life hero" by many.

Faisal was given a cash prize of Rs. 5,00,000 by the Chief Minister of Balochistan for his bravery in saving numerous lives.

Salman Sufi, the head of the Prime Minister's Strategic Reforms, on the other hand, has invited Faisal to Islamabad as a special guest.

Sufi expressed his "deep thanks" to Faisal for his "selfless contribution to humanity" on Twitter, saying he sent Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's "deep gratitude."
