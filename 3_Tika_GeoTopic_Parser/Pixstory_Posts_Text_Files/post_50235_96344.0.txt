In a very cordial setting it was unanimously decided to create the atmosphere for the organization of a major cultural and social event in the premises of the Rohtas Fort in the near future.

 I consciously avoided naming the Maoists as a problem in the region and made only indirect references about the atmosphere of violence and uncertainty prevailing in the region, which was continuously impeding the development. For I fully understood that if a movement for change was to be started in the area and had to counter Maoist propaganda it could not start with blaming the Maoists who enjoyed a sort of popular support due to reasons which included fear as well as circumstances in the recent past. If I had started with a theme of eradication of the Maoists it would surely have failed with the Maoists targeting it from Day One. The strategy was to keep the Maoists who also drew their numbers from the community confused since they should normally not be opposing a movement which aimed at restoring the cultural heritage and pride of the the community they were a part of. The changed police linguistic was being watched at close quarters by the Maoists planning their next move. 

But the change in the police strategy was being welcomed by the community at large. This Mahotsava was proposed to serve as a symbol of the yearning for change in the Sone Valley. It would also serve as a symbol of respect for the glory of the past and of the preparation for a promising future of the Sone Valley. It was decided to organize several programmes and community police camps in several areas to minimize the gaps between public and police. Police would serve as a medium for uniting people of various classes and ideas. Thus began the Sone Mahotsava with an encouraging beginning at Rohtas.
