There have been several examples during any leader s political reign that show how often history and even the present are manipulated and manufactured to influence people in the country All of it is presented well designed so that you would be left with nothing but instead believe Manipulation is a key to forcing people to do things they would not do otherwise To make it somewhat more apparent we know how long Americans have been manipulated by the idea of getting good governance but eventually getting nothing out of it Presidential elections are when candidates choose manipulation as a key to conquer Look at nothing but Donald Trump itself a man with no political experience who was mainly considered unfit for the presidency became the president because of the psychology he used in manipulating people The manipulation can induce fear in people that would make them think about the uncertainty and dark sides resulting in their change of behaviour which in this case is voting behaviour Leaders ignite the underlying fear and make fake promises to mend all the predicament Even social psychological research has found that we have an intrinsic and powerful motivation to believe that the socioeconomic and political systems in which they live are fair legitimate justifiable and unchanging Threatening this belief in any way makes us feel scared anxious and uncertain about the future System threat leaves us scrambling for a way to feel secure again an action event or person that will restore peace and stability
