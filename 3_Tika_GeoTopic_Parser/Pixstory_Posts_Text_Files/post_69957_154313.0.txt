World mental health day💚
Be the change you want to see✨
We are fortunate that times are changing and we are talking about mental health and there are so much awareness about mental distress now. We haveade little progress few years.
There's still so much to be learnt and so much to be told to the world.✨
Let's bring that change where people learn about mental health without suffering from it.
Let's at least start to take care of our minds. 
Let's become vocal.
Let's choose our mental health to be a priority.
Let's educate our coming generation.
Let's become part of this awareness our nation needs.
On this world mental health day Let's bring the change we wish to see🕊️💕✨💚
