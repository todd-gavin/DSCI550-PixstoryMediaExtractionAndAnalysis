Australia s Veterans Affairs boss warned against attempts to investigate her department s processing of claims telling the minister last year she would not support an approach that specifically focused on families who had lost a relative to suicide In October the recently installed Veterans Affairs Minister Andrew Gee announced private consultants McKinsey would overhaul the Department of Veterans Affairs claims processing system Announcing the move he described the backlog of claims at the Department of Veterans Affairs DVA as unacceptably high which is delaying veterans and their families access to vital services and funding Now documents released under freedom of information FOI have revealed concerns were formally raised by department secretary Liz Cosson about the proposed scope of the work being conducted by McKinsey consultants In a ministerial submission written in October she warned the minister I am concerned with your direction that a specific focus in the McKinsey Review into DVA claims processing be put on families who have lost a loved one to suicide I would of course be happy to facilitate a broader engagement with veterans and families with McKinsey and Co I am not able to support any approach where there is a specific focus on families who have lost a loved one to suicide or any connotation that there is a direct causal link between delays in claims processing and an individual s decision to take their own life It is understood the secretary was concerned about families being approached by private consultants just as a long awaited royal commission was about to begin public hearings where many of the same relatives were preparing to give evidence Last week the secretary gave evidence to the royal commission where she was asked if delays in claims processing at DVA were capable of raising the risks that veterans making those claims could take their own lives I believe that the claims backlog could be a contributing factor absolutely Ms Cosson told the royal commission hearing in Canberra Independent Senator Jacqui Lambie who obtained the FOI documents has attacked Ms Cosson accusing her of saying one thing to her minister but another to the royal commission Credit ABC
