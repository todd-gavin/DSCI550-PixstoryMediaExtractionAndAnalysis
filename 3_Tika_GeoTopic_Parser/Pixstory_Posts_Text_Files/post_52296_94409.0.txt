If you like Hollywood, this is the place to be. This is like a dream come true. Even if you are not one, you must have heard of or seen this location, so you should go there to fulfil that desire. It was enjoyable for my family and me.

This is undeniably true, but while Hollywood will always be known as the center of the entertainment industry, it is not the only reason why so many people flock to Tinseltown.

Hollywood and the surrounding area are more than just a haven for larger-than-life entertainment; they are also a breeding ground for cultural progress, a haven for artistic expression, and, more often than not, the guiding light of society as it enters an otherwise strange and frightening future.
