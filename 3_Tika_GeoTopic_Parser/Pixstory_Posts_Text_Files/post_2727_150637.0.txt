There was once an asura called Tarkasura who constantly fought with and harassed the gods. He was blessed with the boon that no one except only the offspring of Shiva would be able to defeat him. With the marriage of Shiva and Parvati, their energies combined and a powerful seed was created which would transform into their child. The seed was given to Agni dev to carry it safely to the Saravana forest. However, the heat from the seed was so much that even Agni himself was unable to bear it! It was then decided that Parvati, in the form of the river Ganga, would carry the seed to the forest.The child was then born there and taken care of by the six Krittikas. He therefore came to be known as Kartikeya (from Krittika). He grew up to become the commander-in-chief of the army of the gods and later also killed Tarkasura. Kartikeya is also known as Skanda, and therefore Parvati is also known as Skandamata (mother of Skanda).
