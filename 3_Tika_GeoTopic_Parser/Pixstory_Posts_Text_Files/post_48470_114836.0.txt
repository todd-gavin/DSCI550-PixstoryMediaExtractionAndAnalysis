The effects of sin are everywhere in our world. Everywhere we look, we see the consequences of a fallen world, as well as many people who are hopeless. Someone needs to give them hope. It's us, Jesus said. It's you and me.

Because the only road to salvation is through Jesus Christ. There's no getting around it. Salvation is a privilege reserved for a select few. There is only one path to take. In John 14:6, Jesus made it crystal clear: "Jesus told him, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life.'" 'There is no other way to the Father than through Me.' Jesus had an important message to deliver. He had a special message for you. We must be purveyors of a very specific kind of hope. There is a reason John 3:16 is the most familiar and most quoted verse in the history of humanity. Jesus died for the world. He is the only way, but He has provided a way for everyone. That is a message that is urgent and worth telling. Indeed itâ€™s the greatest message ever.

It is important for all Christians to engage in evangelism for our brothers and sisters. They deserve salvation and the only way to do it is Christianity. The Lord sent us to the Earth to spread across his gospel and we, as his subjects, must do it.
