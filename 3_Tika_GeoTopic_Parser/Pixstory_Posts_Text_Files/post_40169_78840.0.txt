Kpop is the only pop culture i could ever care about💅🏻. I mean from the relationship between the members, the instense stage performance, to fighting all the gender norms and racist minds there is. They've come so far and i couldn't ever be more proud of being a kpop stan. Yes true that i still have a lot of kpop artists to discover, but the obes i already did are so gooddd!! 😩
