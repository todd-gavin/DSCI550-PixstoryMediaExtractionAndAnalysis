The England international was denied the opportunity to say his goodbyes to the club, but he
believes it is not a right he is entitled to.

Jesse Lingard "didn't deserve" an Old Trafford send-off, according to Gary Neville, after the
Manchester United playmaker missed the club's last home game of the season against Brentford.

Lingard has had another tough season, as he has been unable to build on his loan transfer to
West Ham last season with greater minutes under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick,
while Manchester United have had a dismal season ahead of Erik ten Hag's arrival this summer.

On the Gary Neville Podcast, Neville claimed, "There was a lot of crap shouted about Lingard."

"He's been at the club for a long time and has performed admirably."

Bryan Robson and Steve Bruce, for example, did not play in their final games for the club and
did not receive a send-off in cup finals.

They were both outstanding captains, with one of them
being the best Manchester United captain ever.

I'm not sure why Lingard earned it since they didn't get the send-off they wanted. I was dumped
in a toilet in West Brom-sometimes things simply don't work out, Jesse! "

In a campaign that has seen the behind-the-scenes rot at Old Trafford bubble to the surface
compared to their major six competitors, the former Red Devils player has been among their
fiercest critics, and he confesses he can't wait for it to stop.

"The last several months have been terrible," he continued. "I'm looking forward to the season
ending so I can stop talking about them." I can't watch them because they don't reflect what a
football club, let alone Manchester United, should be.

The players are simply causing themselves irreparable harm that the fans will never forget.

They
were chanting "you're not fit to wear the shirt," something I have never heard a Man U supporter
say before.
