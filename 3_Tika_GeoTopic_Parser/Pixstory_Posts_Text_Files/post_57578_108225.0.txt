Pop superstars Adele and Harry Styles did not perform at the spectacular party at the palace, which was one of the highlights of the four-day celebration in honor of the Queen Elizabeth’s 70 years of service earlier this month.

A source told the Daily Mail, "They were told she [Adele] couldn’t do it. Scheduling issues, or something like that, were given as an excuse.”
"It caused a lot of surprise, particularly as she was awarded an MBE (in 2013). After all, how many chances will there be to perform in front of Buckingham Palace for the Queen?" source added.


While Adele and Styles missed the chance to perform for the global audience, a number of pop superstars entertained the crowd. Ed Sheeran, Sir Elton John, Sir Rod Stewart, Alicia Keys, Duran Duran, Diana Ross and Sam Ryder were among the performers at the two-and-a-half hour event.
