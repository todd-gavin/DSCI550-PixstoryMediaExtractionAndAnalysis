Major railways in Canada, alone among private sector corporations, have their own police forces with full investigative and jurisdictional powers over accidents on, or near, their property.These unique powers — a historic anomaly dating back to the 19th century when railways were being built across North America — have, until recently, escaped public scrutiny.Investigators answer to their own police chiefs at the railways, and ultimately to corporation executives, for whom profit and shareholder value are paramount.

Mark Tataryn told CBC’s The Fifth Estate that his superiors ordered him to stop investigating and prevented him from obtaining key records such as maintenance, safety and inspection reports. He alleged there was a coverup of potential negligence by the company.“There is enough to suspect there’s negligence here, and it needs to be investigated by the proper authority.”The TSB removed Crawford from the investigation on the grounds his statement was inappropriate since the TSB does not have the authority to determine criminality.TSB within its rightsHowever, a memorandum of understanding between the RCMP and the TSB signed in 2015 outlined a policy of referring to the RCMP “occurrences in which there are indications of possible criminal activity.”That means the TSB was within its rights to refer the case to an authority that could investigate criminal liability.
