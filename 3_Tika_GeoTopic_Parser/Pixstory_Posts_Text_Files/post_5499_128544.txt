Affirmative action in college programs is a policy which favors minorities over non minorities Despite the fact that affirmative action at schools is confined to the purpose of diversifying the student body i e there are no racial quotas these policies seem to continue to do more harm than good despite their altruistic intentions First the notion that a person would be given a better chance Because of one s ethnicity is vile Not only is it backwards but it is also the least effective approach to provide opportunity to those who need it the most If a black student and a white student had comparable grades affirmative action would provide the black student with an advantage and a greater probability of admission e ven if the black student came from the household of a superstar basketball player and the white student came from a family living below the poverty line Ultimately what factors place a student at a disadvantage Is it their ethnicity or their accessibility to resources The obvious answer is their access to resources Nevertheless it is also true that minorities often have less access to resources than their white peers However should this matter If a black kid and a white student are similarly disadvantaged they should be treated equally since they both lacked the resources to achieve excellent high school grades Lastly admitting students with lower test results to academically more challenging institutions might result in their dropping out In reality the dropout rates of affirmative action students are much higher than those of non affirmative action students As a result minorities are placed at an even greater disadvantage due to their race as a consequence ofaffirmative action
