People from some decade back, especially the Bollywood bugs, would remember the film booklets that accompanied a film's release. These poorly printed booklets, available for perhaps 50 paise or so, contained the complete dialogues of the film, and generated much interest in the film. 

This practice started much earlier in the 1940s. Films produced by Bombay Talkies (later owned by Ashok Kumar) had booklets that contained shots of the studio as well as information about forthcoming releases. 

These booklets, to begin with, captured the story of the film, and talked about the actors and then detailed out the songs. 

Till 1970 or so, songs and actors remained the highlight of the film, but then gradually they were replaced by the dialogues. 

These booklets were produced and sold at least till the mid-1980s. 

And then they disappeared, after a glorious run of 50 odd years, just like good taste disappeared from popular Hindi cinema.
