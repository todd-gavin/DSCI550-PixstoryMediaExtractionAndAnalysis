The woman who was murdered and then dismembered by an 83-year-old Brooklyn serial killer was beaten and died from a blow to the head, the city’s Medical Examiner’s office said Saturday.

An autopsy of Susan Leyden’s scattered remains showed that she died of “homicidal violence including blunt force trauma to the head,” a spokeswoman for the Medical Examiner’s office said.

Leyden, 68, was reported missing March 2. The next day, her headless, limbless torso was discovered stuffed in a shopping cart on Pennsylvania and Atlantic Aves. in East New York.

On March 10, police released video of Leyden’s accused killer, Harvey Marcelin, shopping in a 99 cent store in Brooklyn with Leyden’s severed leg, cut from the knee down, wrapped in a garbage bag.

Marcelin, 83, served two stints in prison for killing two girlfriends in Manhattan and now identifies as a transgender woman, police said.
