Nuno Espirito Santo's exit at the end of the 2020–21 season marked the end of an era at
Wolverhampton Wanderers, a risk for all parties involved considering their previous success.

Wolves have sought to make significant steps under Bruno Lage, the man long designated as
Nuno's eventual replacement, at a time when Nuno has spent much of the season on the
sidelines owing to his terrible period at Tottenham Hotspur.

Review of the Season:

Despite the turmoil in the dugout, Wolves had a relatively quiet summer transfer window, with
the loan signings of Francisco Trincao and Hwang Hee-chan generating interest, but questions
lingered over whether Jose Sa was a suitable successor to Rui Patricio.

That discussion did not last long—more on that later—and the overarching critique of Wolves in
the early weeks was their failure to capitalize on opportunities, with the club losing 1-0 to Leicester City, Tottenham Hotspur, and Manchester United.

The following defeat at home to Brentford felt disastrous at the time, but it served as the catalyst
for a run of 13 points from a possible 15, with Wolves completing one of the Premier League's
great comebacks by scoring three times from the 80th minute onwards to defeat rivals Aston
Villa on away territory.

Wolves were in sixth place at the start of December, ahead of a
double-header with Liverpool and Manchester City, the first of which was lost in a painful
manner as Divock Origi added another late winning goal to his tally in the last seconds at
Molineux.

However, losing late in the rematch against Arsenal had a long-term impact, with Wolves
collecting just 11 points from their last 14 games. Nine of those points came in a four-game span
between March 10 and April 2, illustrating the Wolves' disappointing finish to the season.

After failing to score against Newcastle United, Burnley, and Brighton & Hove Albion, and only
drawing with Norwich City in their penultimate home game, finishing just seven points behind
sixth-placed Manchester United will hurt Wolves, as will the £4.4m in prize money they missed
by slipping from eighth to tenth place due to a final-day defeat at Liverpool.
