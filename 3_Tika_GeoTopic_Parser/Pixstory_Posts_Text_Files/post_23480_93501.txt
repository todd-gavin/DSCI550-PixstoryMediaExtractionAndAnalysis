Just this beautiful silence deep darkness broken at sunrise by birdsong the oohs aahs of an appreciative crowd braving the morning chill on the terrace to see dawn breaking over the mighty peaks on the skyline The days are spent exploring the various trails through the lush moist silver oak forest sighting birds the occasional deer So after two days of detoxifying disconnecting intermittently one bar less at a time with the world outside we get out of the sanctuary set off for Shaama The drive is leisurely as the roads are surprisingly empty almost The mystery is solved when we are told that Holi which is a round the corner is not a one day affair in the hills is celebrated in all serious fervor so most people come home for it We witness a few scenes on the way back of the seriousness of the affair when we cross motley groups of men carrying their local deities around in palanquins full of merriment colour The stragglers in the groups happily lurching around high on colour whatever else trying to keep up as God men make their way to greet other Gods in this colourful carnival Thank god mountain folks still walk instead of driving around everywhere After Bageshwar we climb up away on this gentle winding road through a pine forest cross the crest to the other side more or less maintaining altitude now getting a close view of the Nanda Devi massif peaks enveloped in pristine white snow at this time of the year We leave our vehicle at a hamlet trek the last three odd kms on a narrow path around this precarious vertigo inducing corner The one speed breaker enroute to paradise which slows down my steps ups the heartbeat rate all for the wrong reasons behold Camp Shaama at the far end of the narrow spur that falls down dramatically on three sides into a sea of nothingness To be continued
