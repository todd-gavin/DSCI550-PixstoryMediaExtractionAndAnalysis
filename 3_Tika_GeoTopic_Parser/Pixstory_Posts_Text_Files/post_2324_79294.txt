Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu is going all guns blazing not only against his opponents but own party colleagues too Ahead of the assembly elections on February Sidhu has upped the ante over the naming of the Congress party s chief Ministers candidate for the upcoming polls Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi is expected to announce the party s CM face at a virtual rally on February The race is mainly between Sidhu and Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi Ahead of the announcement Sidhu said he was not a supporting actor which means that he will not accept any other person as the CM candidate There is a strong buzz that the Congress high command has almost decided to name Channi as the CM face given that he just got five months in office and has brought the party back in the game after the exit of Captain Amarinder Singh who was asked to quit in September last year Channi s popularity has grown significantly in the past few months and he is widely been seen as a common people s Chief Minister due to his decision to shun the VIP culture This has visibly angered Sidhu who had himself asked Rahul Gandhi to name the party s Chief Ministerial candidate ahead of the polls so that the people have a clear idea whom they voting for Only people can choose the Chief Minister If you don t choose someone with moral authority and sincerity then people have an alternative Sidhu told NDTV Going a step further he added Your destiny depends on what you choose It is choice not chance that determines your destiny A mafia type person cannot implement your programmes A person who himself is mafia protector in chief how can he crack down on the mafia Who is he calling the mafia protector in chief The Aam Aadmi Party AAP has stepped up its attack on Channi calling him a sand mafia AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal who is also Delhi Chief Minister and other leaders had alleged illegal sand mining is being carried out under the patronage of the Punjab Chief Minister in his own constituency Chamkaur Sahib Is Channi then Sidhu s target Well
