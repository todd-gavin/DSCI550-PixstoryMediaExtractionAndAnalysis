Take some deep sapphire the kind that costs a fortune Take some emerald Add a dash of coral Crush it Toss it all in the air what you see shimmer glint in the sun is what you should expect at Pangong Tso The colours hues shifting altering lightening or deepening depending on where the sun catches them The water so clear yet the colour so intense that the stones in the water are barely discernible The narrow winding valley from Tangsey which opens into the expanse of Pangong Tso is like a collection of short stories itself The first one starts with a grassy vale a winding stream To complete the picture there is a family of fat Chukars There seem to be no other kind On the far side we spy an orangish silver fur ball hopping Its a fox With a magnificent tail The kind I can imagine draped around my shoulder with the PETA kind baying for my head for just having such a sinful thought Oh well You keep your tail fox I my head trying to coax it s evening snack out of the ground We can t make out in the end whether it trots off in disgust or triumph Then after a short drive there are some ponies with gorgeous manes swishing tails No sinful thoughts now We d been told that there are some herds of wild ponies still left But sadly these are not those A few huts nearby confirms their tame status Then we hit upon a patch which seems lumpy there are these tiny mounds in the boggy looking ground We see one toothy marmot sunning itself It has to be a crazy animal It lives underground in damp looking places in that cold Our driver does t let us share our parathas with it We sound like Those Terrible Tourist Type Don t spoil his habits we are told by the environmentally enlightened driver To be continued Picture by Mandvi
