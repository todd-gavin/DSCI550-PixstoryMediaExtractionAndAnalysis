With Ruben Dias out, the road to this year's tournament appears to be difficult.

After Pepe tested positive for Covid-19 at the start of the March international break, Cristiano Ronaldo and Portugal will be without both of their first-choice centre-backs for their Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifier against Turkey.

Fernando Santos' side will be forced to fight in their semi-final play-off without its presumptive starting pair at the back, as Ruben Dias was also ruled out. This is a big setback for the nation's hopes of qualifying for this year's tournament.

Ronaldo is hoping to make it to what will almost certainly be his final World Cup after failing to win on the grandest stage of all for his country - but his aspirations could be destroyed before the tournament even starts if Portugal fails to qualify in the coming weeks.

What's been said so far?
"Pepe tested positive for Covid-19 and will fulfill the scheduled isolation days," said an official FPF statement.

"Fernando Santos, National Coach, [has] called up Tiago Djalo, defender of Lille, who was at the service of the U21 National Team.

"The National Team trains this afternoon, at Cidade do Futebol, in the first session of preparation for the game with Turkey, in the play-off [for] the 2022 World Cup."

Despite being favourites going into the first stage of UEFA qualification, Portugal struggled to a second-place finish in Group A, finishing behind Serbia, who qualified automatically.

As a result, Ronaldo and his teammates advanced to the second round of qualification, where they were pitted against Turkey in Path C.

If they win their semi-final, they will face either Euro 2020 winners Italy or North Macedonia in a winner-take-all match.
