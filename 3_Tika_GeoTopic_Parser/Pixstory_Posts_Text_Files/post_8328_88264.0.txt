In what was nothing less than a nerve-wracking match, Lakshya Sen progressed to the final of All England Open 2022, beating defending champion and World No. 7 Lee Zii Jia 21-13, 12-21, 21-19 in the semi-finals.

At one time, the Indian was trailing 16-18 and looked like he was out of the contest. However, Sen won four straight points from that point to reach two match points before converting the second. With this result, he reaches the finals of All England and has a chance to emulate the feat of Gopichand (2001).

World Championships bronze medallist Lakshya had advanced to the semis after his opponent Lu Guang Zu of China gave a walkover. Sen had earlier stunned World No 3 and two-time medallist at World Championships, Anders Antonsen of Denmark, 21-16 21-18 on Thursday to reach the quarter-finals. 

The 20-year-old young shuttler would be looking to continue his stellar form as he enters the final of the prestigious tournament. 

Prakash Padukone and Pullela Gopichand were previously the only Indians to have reached the semifinals of the competition.

⤵️
Axelsen: Olympic champion 🥇
LKY: World champion 🥇
LZJ: All England champion 🇬🇧🥇
Antonsen: World bronze 🥉

It wouldn't be wrong to say that this guy is a giant slayer and could be India's next twinkling star in the game.

Will he be able to win the prestigious All England title for India after 21 years?

Well, we will have to wait till tomorrow to find this out. Let's cheer for India tomorrow for this historic game!! 🇮🇳
