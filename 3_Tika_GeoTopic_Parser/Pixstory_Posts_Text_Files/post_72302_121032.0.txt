After announcing that he’ll be quitting Monaco last season, it was pretty unsure where the Spaniard was looking to play his trades this season. Como has spilt the beans by announcing the playmaker’s arrival at the club through their official website. They made it official by posting a video with the caption “The wait is (almost) over cesc4official”, where the midfielder was seen signing autographs and acknowledging fans outside Como’s home pitch.

The 2010 World Cup winner was unhappy in France as he was not getting enough play time and had not played for Monaco’s first team since September. The former Barcelona and Chelsea player was adamant about playing for a team that valued him and respected his pedigree as a footballer. 

“On an individual level, it’s ending badly, that’s for sure. Every professional wants to play and feel important,” the 35-year-old told AFP in May, saying he wanted to join a club where he was sure he will play and where people believed in him. He also claimed to have experienced the worst season of his career and added “I still want to play. I don’t want to end like this. The year has been too bad to end like this. I want to have fun, end with good feelings.”

To the world, Fabregas’ glorious career might look like nearing dusk but according to the man himself, he is “looking to build a long-term future” on and off the pitch at his new club. Former Chelsea player and now Como’s chief executive, Dennis Wise, was a key figure in roping in the veteran for two years.

Como finished 13th in Italy’s second division last season and will begin its season on Saturday in the Italian Cup playing away against Spezia.
