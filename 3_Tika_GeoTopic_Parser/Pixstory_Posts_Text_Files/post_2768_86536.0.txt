After weeks of calls by the opposition and civil society in the United Kingdom calling on the government to take action against Russian oligarchs residing in the country after Russia invaded Ukraine, the Boris Johnson government has announced a slew of measures.

The government has announced “a full asset freeze” and travel ban on seven of Russia’s wealthiest and most influential oligarchs. The government has said that these oligarchs’ business empires, “wealth and connections are closely associated” with the Kremlin.

The Chelsea football club owner, Roman Abramovich, is among seven oligarchs who have been hit with the sanctions. It is the first time that the UK has placed sanctions on Abramovich. The other Russian oligarchs who have been with sanctions include Igor Sechin, Oleg Deripaska, Andrey Kostin, Alexei Miller, Nikolai Tokarev and Dmitri Lebedev.

HOWEVER, the UK government has said that sanctions on Abramovich, whose net worth is estimated at over $12 bn, will have little effect on the Chelsea Football Club as it will continue to operate as before. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/10/uk-freezes-assets-of-abramovich-six-other-russian-oligarchs 

What does the sanctions mean?

The asset freeze means it prevents any UK citizen, or any business in the UK, from dealing with any funds or economic resources owned by the designated person. It also prevents funds or financial resources being provided to or for the benefit of the designated person.

Travel ban means that the oligarchs will be refused to leave or enter the country. Transport sanctions mean it will be a criminal offence for any Russian aircraft to fly or land in the UK,. Russian ships are also banned from UK ports.
