Cristiano Ronaldo could be on his way out of Manchester United with the Glazer family attempting to reduce their pay bill following talk about a move to the MLS Despite scoring goals for a struggling team this season the year old has been chastised by fans and the mainstream media Ronaldo s troubles have been exaggerated by the fans but they haven t gone as planned It s like building a mountain out of a molehill However it appears that the Glazers intend to end Ronaldo s time at United after only a year on the job Ronaldo s contract will be extended for another year at the conclusion of the season but given United s chances of losing out on Champions League participation a move might be on the cards Calciomercato journalist Stefano Benzi said on CMIT TV From my American correspondence I learned that there s already the replacement of Gonzalo Higuain who could be none other than Cristiano Ronaldo There s a lot of negotiations underway to bring him to MLS it would be a welcome destination not only for the player who would have been convinced to leave Europe There s an important possibility of going to Miami with David Beckham who has preferential channels with Manchester United The Americans who manage the Red Devils would gladly get rid of Ronaldo s salary Even though Ronaldo is still one of the finest attackers in the world and would find the MLS to be a stroll in the park it s a telling hint that the Glazers are developing cold feet over his massive compensation deal It will be intriguing to watch if the next manager tries to keep Ronaldo for another season at the club
