Stop Plunk down Evaluate what is going on Attempt to sort out how you veered off track On the off chance that you can decide precisely how you veered off track you can backtrack to that point In the event that you can t decide wait And I mean it stay put Do not lose yourself further if you have literally no idea Somebody will find you eventually Make yourself some shelter What you need the most is fire Not only for warmth and safety but also because the smoke will attract someone Try to save some water and food for later Do not stress eat Not only will it slow you down but also lessen your supply Find some weapon just in case Most of the times you have these things on you already considering you went out for hiking but if you don t nature is helpful Always learn about navigation before going to a place like that Stars sun moon trees mosses They will all help you If there s a stream walk step by step down slope towards it That stream would hopefully lead you to a river There are generally human settlements around riverbanks usually In the woods pay special attention to straight lines Straight lines seldom happen naturally So there s a big chance it s a human made trail A straight column of trees frequently implies that they are planted and that region is overseen for work The worst thing you could do to yourself in such a situation is panicking and losing hope Someone WILL find you eventually All you have to do is survive till then Always remember do not get into an area like that without knowing what s ahead Have some prior information Keep enough supply with you Learn basic survival skills Do not get into dangerous areas knowingly Keep a weapon with you always should you need to protect yourself hunt or make shelter
