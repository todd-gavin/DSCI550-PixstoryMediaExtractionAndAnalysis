Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari announced that a 75-kilometer stretch of the Amravati-Akola highway in Maharashtra was laid in 105 hours and 33 minutes, breaking the Guinness World Record for the longest continuously laid bituminous lane of 75 kilometres in 105 hours and 33 minutes on the national highway between Amravati and Akola districts in Maharashtra.

Nitin Gadkari, Minister of Road Transport and Highways, stated on Wednesday that the project was carried out by 720 people, including a team of independent consultants who worked around the clock.

The 75 kilometres of single lane continuous bituminous concrete road is equivalent to 37.5 kilometres of two-lane paved shoulder road, and the work began on June 3 at 7:27 a.m. and ended on June 7 at 5 p.m., according to a video message from the minister.
The previous Guinness World Record for the longest continuously laid bituminous road was set in February 2019 in Doha, Qatar, for constructing 25.275 kilometres of road in ten days.

The segment between Amravati and Akola is part of NH 53, an important east-west route that connects major towns such as Kolkata, Raipur, Nagpur, and Surat.

This length, according to Mr. Gadkari, would play a significant role in alleviating traffic and freight movement on this route once completed.

He also complimented all of the engineers, contractors, consultants, and workers from NHAI and Raj Path Infracon Pvt Ltd on the project's excellent execution, which aided in the achievement of this world record.
