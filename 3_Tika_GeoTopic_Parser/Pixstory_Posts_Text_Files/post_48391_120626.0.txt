Please understand it's okay to seek help and don't have to do everything on your own. 
Ask someone to come over and hang out and help you.

Set manageable. small goals and be kind to yourself.

Remember that it's okay for things not to be perfectly tidy when you are feeling low.

Motivate yourself by remembering how nice it feels when things are cleaner

Try to get in the habit of cleaning up as you go to minimize the mess.

Start with throwing out trash and picking things up off the floor.

Set a short alarm and do as much as you can in that time, starting with the room you spend the most time in.

Keep wipes and sprays near the kitchen, put your laundry hamper where you get undressed, etc.

Assign a place. for things so you know where they should go
