The Philadelphia ers don t want to part with additional pieces in a potential swap of guard Ben Simmons for Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal According to David Aldridge and Josh Robbins of The Athletic the Sixers have held firm in their stance that they specifically don t want to make guard Tyrese Maxey or wing Matisse Thybulle part of a package for Beal Despite that the ers have made no secret that Beal is among the players they would be willing to take in exchange for Simmons Despite not having Simmons available the Sixers are currently second in the Eastern Conference just one game behind the first place Chicago Bulls Superstar center and MVP candidate Joel Embiid has undoubtedly been the driving force behind Philly s success but he is far from alone Maxey who is in his second NBA season after going st overall in the NBA draft has taken a huge leap forward in The year old guard is third on the team in scoring with points per game and he s averaging assists rebounds and three pointers made while shooting percent from the field and percent from beyond the arc Meanwhile Thybulle is one of the NBA s best young defenders and he is a key part of the Sixers rotation averaging minutes per game His averages of points rebounds steals assists and blocks per game don t necessarily leap off the page but he is the type of player that winning teams need At the same time the Sixers likely need a player of Beal s caliber to become true championship contenders The year old Beal is a three time All Star who averaged over points per game in both the and seasons His scoring average is down to points per game this season but he is averaging a career high assists per game Washington would likely want more than just Simmons in return for Beal though If the Sixers are unwilling to part with any of their other young pieces a trade may not be in the cards
