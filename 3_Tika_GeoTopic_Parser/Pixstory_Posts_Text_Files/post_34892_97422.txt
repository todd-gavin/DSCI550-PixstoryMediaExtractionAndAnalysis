Tech KTM rider Raul Fernandez will not take part in the upcoming Spanish grand prix The Spaniard has not yet recovered from the right hand injury sustained in Portimao during qualifying which caused him to miss the race in Portugal He will not be riding his bike but not until next time because he was declared unfit by the doctors and therefore he will have to postpone his return to the track In the best case scenario Fernandez will return to compete in two weeks when the grand prix will be held in France
