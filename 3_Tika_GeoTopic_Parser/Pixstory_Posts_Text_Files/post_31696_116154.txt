Juno Sospita or propitious savior was the goddess venerated in Roman mythology known as Uni in Etruria She was easily recognizable thanks to the attributes with which she was represented goat skin on the head and spear always at hand The goat skin and the snake give her a connotation of Goddess Earth, she who gives life, nourishes and kills. The goddess Sospita was asked for forecasts about the harvest. The Latin author Propertius tells us that in spring the maze, i.e. a group of virgin girls, went to the temple of the goddess to offer them in gift of cakes if the gift was accepted the harvest would be fruitful otherwise an impure woman would be sacrificed to ward off famine
