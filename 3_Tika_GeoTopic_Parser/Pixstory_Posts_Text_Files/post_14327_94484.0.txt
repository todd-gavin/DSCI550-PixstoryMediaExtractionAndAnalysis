Today the Juventus number one celebrates his 32nd birthday. 

The giant between the sticks has been a massive presence as the last line of the Juventus defence this season. In his 30 Serie A appearances he’s collected 12 clean sheets, to which can be added three matches without conceding in his seven Champions League games.

What’s more, the Warsaw-born shot-stopper rewrote recent history books in Serie A with three consecutive penalty saves. The first keeper to do so since season 2017/18. 

And in his heart of hearts he knows he made it four spot-kick stops out of four in the recent Derby d’Italia until factors beyond his control intervened to dampen his celebrations. 

Celebrations that he is entitled to enjoy on this, his special day.

Many happy returns, Tek!
