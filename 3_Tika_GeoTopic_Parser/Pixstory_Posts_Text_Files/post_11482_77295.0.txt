The Dukan Diet is a high-protein, low-carb weight loss diet that is split into four phases. It was created by Dr. Pierre Dukan, a French general practitioner who specialises in weight management. Dr. Dukan created the diet in the 1970s, inspired by an obese patient who said he could give up eating any food in order to lose weight, with the exception of meat.

➖HOW DOES IT WORK?
The Dukan Diet starts by calculating your goal weight — called your “true” weight — based on your age, weight loss history, and other factors. How long you stay in each phase depends on how much weight you need to lose to reach your “true” weight.

These are the four phases of the Dukan diet:

▪️Attack Phase (1–7 days): You start the diet by eating unlimited lean protein plus 1.5 tablespoons of oat bran per day.

▪️Cruise Phase (1–12 months): Alternate lean protein one day with lean protein and non-starchy veggies the next, plus 2 tablespoons of oat bran every day.

▪️Consolidation Phase (5 days for every pound lost in phases 1 and 2): Unlimited lean protein and veggies, some carbs and fats, one day of lean protein weekly, 2.5 tablespoons of oat bran daily.

▪️Stabilisation Phase (indefinite): Follow the Consolidation Phase guidelines but loosen the rules as long as your weight remains stable. Oat bran is increased to 3 tablespoons per day.

As shown above, the diet is divided into two weight loss phases and two maintenance phases.
