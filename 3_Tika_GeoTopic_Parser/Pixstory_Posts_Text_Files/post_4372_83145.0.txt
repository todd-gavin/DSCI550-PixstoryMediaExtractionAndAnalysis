I feel it’s common for anyone to ignore all the red flags when they are madly in love. This is exactly what happens with all the girls in the Netflix documentary called Tinder Swindler. The love and affection these men give make the girls feel that they are worth the trouble they get along with them. 

What I feel is, ignoring red flags just because you want to see the good in people will cost you later. 
In fact, I strongly believe that planning and plotting such a big game as Simon Leviev did in Tinder Swindler is nearly impossible for any girl to do. Not that they can’t, but I think they will never do it to someone they claim they are in love with.  

No matter how smart you are, once you are in love, you get foolish in love. To an extent that you literally are ready to give all your money, give up on your friends and leave everything just to be with that one person. 

But imagine, if the person who you are in love with is actually worthy of you. How beautiful the world will be and how amazing your life will get. Having someone by your side and working on your goals together with the love of your life. Wouldn’t it be just perfect?
