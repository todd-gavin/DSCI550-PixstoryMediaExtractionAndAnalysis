Anais Nin Risk And then the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom When was the day you stopped fulfilling and started leading your own life For me it came right after high school Seeking the permission of others whilst forfeiting my own identity Yeah that wasn t going to cut it anymore It was time to take the plunge aka blossom and remove any remnants of external expectations As clich as it sounds it s a crucial life lesson that comes with time and few have interpreted this realisation as powerfully as Nin Little information is given about what led to this change and there is also no evidence as to whether or not this change proved a good thing By cutting off the poem at these beginning and ending points Nin has made this ruling to change the focal point or the thing of importance within the poem That change as a theme for the poem is treated like something to strive toward Seemingly to the author when we must push against conflicts we should always aspire to grow to be our best versions
