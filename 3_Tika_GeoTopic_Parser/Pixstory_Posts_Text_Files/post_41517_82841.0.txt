Fox News reported Saturday that the USA men's hockey team was the target of a noise complaint in the athletes' Olympic Village at the Winter Games in Beijing. 

Although no property damage was recorded and no one was ejected, the event triggered a discussion between the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) and USA Hockey, according to an Olympic official.

â€œWe hold Team USA athletes to very high standards of personal conduct," the USOPC said in a statement. "We have spoken to USA Hockey leadership, affirmed those expectations and can confirm that athletes will remain in the village until their scheduled departures."

Due to an increase in coronavirus cases ahead of the Olympics, the United States men's hockey team in 2022 will be devoid of NHL players. The team included of 15 college players as well as a few professionals who primarily compete in European and North American minor leagues.

The Americans had gone undefeated in the preliminary round and appeared to be on the rise heading into the knockout play. Despite having the top seed, the team was ousted in a shootout by Slovakia. 

The noise situation did not appear to be similar to what occurred during the Nagano Games in 1998. 

The Los Angeles Times reported that after being eliminated from medal contention, men's hockey players trashed almost a dozen seats and set off fire extinguishers. At the time, NHL players were on the squad and minimised the incident. Damage estimates ranged from $1,000 to $3,000.
