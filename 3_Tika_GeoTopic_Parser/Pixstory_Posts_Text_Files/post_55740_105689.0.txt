Fish and chips, like BBQ, aren't native to the sun-drenched country; they're merely a local favourite. If you want a true Aussie fish and chips experience, go for Australian fish like barramundi or John Dory. 

However, the Chinese dim sim, which is usually added to fish and chips, is a distinctive addition. As per NP, the dim sim (a type of pork mince dumpling) was initially introduced to the Australian palate in the 1850s, when gold rushes across Victoria drew large crowds of natives and immigrants, including many Chinese. 

There was no turning back after the long-suffering gold miners got a taste for the dim sim. Today they can be found deep fried, not steamed, in almost all fish and chip shops across the country.
