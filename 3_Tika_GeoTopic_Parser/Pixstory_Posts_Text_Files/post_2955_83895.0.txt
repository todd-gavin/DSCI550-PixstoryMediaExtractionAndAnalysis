Russia’s Ukraine invasion is going to affect Europe immediately, but there will be an impact all over the world. In a globalised world, the US will surely feel the heat. Here are 5 possible impacts:

#Oil and energy prices: Whenever there is a war, or an invasion, oil and natural gas prices rise sharply as armies consume enormous amounts of oil and gas. Russia is one of the major exporters of crude oil, accounting nearly 12% of the total world supply. It also supplies 40% natural gas to Europe. As Russia cuts down its supply the ripple effect will spread to energy prices everywhere. Immediately, after the Russian troops invaded, oil price touched $100 per barrel. Now it is expected to shoot further up.  

#Food prices: Both Russia and Ukraine are also large producers of agricultural commodities, such as wheat, rye, barley and other food grains supplied to several countries. Natural gas and crude oil shortage could disrupt production of fertilisers, required for food production everywhere. If there is a disruption in the supply of the commodities, food prices will go up across the world, putting pressure on consumers in Europe.

#Semiconductor shortage: Russia is also a leading producer of some metals, like palladium, platinum and nickel – vital elements required in complex semiconductor microchips that run a whole lot of electronic gadgets, cars and motor vehicles.

#Challenge to America’s global supremacy: Many experts say Putin’s attack on Ukraine is also aimed at the US, challenging it as a global superpower. The US, a country believed to be a protector of liberal democracy, needs to stand firm to save Europe with its NATO allies.

#National Unity: While President Biden is ready with a barrage of sanctions, the former President Trump has showered praise on the “genius” Putin. And, he is not alone. All those US citizens who rally behind him and believe Biden won in a “rigged election” support an autocrat like Putin. Biden has to unify his own countrymen to launch a robust attack on Russia.
