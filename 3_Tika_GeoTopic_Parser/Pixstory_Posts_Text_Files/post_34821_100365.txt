Lorenzo Insigne says goodbye to Napoli after ten years He will go to play for Toronto leaving the club on a free transfer due to not being able to reach an agreement with the club to continue the relationship There were many emotions from the last one at Maradona wearing the blue shirt Thank you all fans who came to the stadium today to cheer me on as a Neapolitan an immense joy Over time the first thing to bring back my home and you never forget home he said immediately after the match won against Genoa The choice was to leave Naples was difficult and suffered and it didn&#39;t even seem like it could happen Instead like this The love for the city and the shirt is too strong Insigne said again There are times when choices have to be made Unfortunately the club and I made this choice We are both happy I gave everything I have no regrets The fans have always shown me their affection towards me I will always bring him in On ending his career at Napoli the number said Now I don&#39;t feel like saying these things I made my choice and the club is yours We are fine like this I just want to enjoy this moment Even if I go far my heart is here I will come to see Napoli in the stands or in the corner as soon as possible because this is my home
