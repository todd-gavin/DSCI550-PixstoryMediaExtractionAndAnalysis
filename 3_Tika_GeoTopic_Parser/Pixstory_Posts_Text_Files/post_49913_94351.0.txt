The term Euthanasia was first used by Francis Bacon and then expanded by Karl Marx. For many people, it is related to dying with dignity. When terminally ill they need the suffering to end in one way or other and hence in cases where there is no hope for recovery. In 1828, the first anti-euthanasia law in the U.S. was passed in New York state. The campaign first took place in the US in 1906, as an attempt to legalise Euthanasia.

‌Euthanasia becomes a more complex issue when it comes to mental health. Many people with mental illness request euthanasia as they have unbearable suffering. But the problem exists because of the definition of unbearable pain. Unlike motor neurone diseases and cancer, mental illnesses like depression and anxiety don’t show up on a scan or an X-ray. Therefore, when granting assisted dying to a person undergoing from mental illnesses, it can be difficult to know when the threshold of unbearable suffering with no hope of improvement is met. Maybe there is a chance of improvement. We cannot lose hope.
‌
‌Patients may feel they are a burden on resources and are psychologically pressured into consenting. They may feel that the financial, emotional, and mental responsibility of their family is too great. Even if the costs of treatment are provided by the state, there is a risk that hospital personnel may have an economic incentive to encourage euthanasia consent.
‌
‌Moreover, regulations are not very strict. Even if a law is passed it should be under high regulations as it is a matter of life.
