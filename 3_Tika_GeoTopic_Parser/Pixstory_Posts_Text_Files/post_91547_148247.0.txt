Likes and Dislikes about Social Media 
1. Meeting new people
     Likes: Social media platform can  prove to be an amazing place for meeting new people. It widens our circle of friends and builds great online community. For an introvert or who faces anxiety issues in public can learn to get comfortable around people here.
    Dislikes: Sometimes social media   can become toxic also. It happens that we meet someone who seems good to us at first but later we realize that he/she is not like what we thought about him/her.
2. Entertaining 
  Likes: Nowadays, social media has become the best place for entertainment and interestingly its usage does not charge us anything!! We see lots of stuffs like memes, songs , mimicry , fashion and many more. 
Dislikes: But the very feature of entertaining can turn into a bane in the long run. If we fail to draw the line, we may get addicted to it that brings lot of problems like less attention span, low academic grades, stunted physical development etc.
