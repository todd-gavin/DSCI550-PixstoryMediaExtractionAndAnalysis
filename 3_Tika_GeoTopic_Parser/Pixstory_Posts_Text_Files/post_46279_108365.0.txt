✅ To Every Father Who Acts like they care about nothing , but still pays attention to everything about his children .

✅ To every Father who walks for miles just to save 10 Rupees for his child's daily pocket money .

✅ To every Father who pays 100 rupees to auto when comes out with his children , and walk for miles when he came alone or with his wife .

✅ To Every Father who raises his voice everytime when his children do something wrong and Praises his own children in their absence when they do something good .

✅ To every Father who lacks sleep for many nights to see his children sleep peacefully .

Happy Father's Day To each and Every Father ! You all are best and You all are Appreciated ❤️🌏
