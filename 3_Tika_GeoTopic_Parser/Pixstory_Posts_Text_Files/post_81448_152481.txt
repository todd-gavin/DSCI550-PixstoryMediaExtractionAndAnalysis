Mikel Arteta faced the gathered media from the UK and Norway this afternoon to preview tomorrow s Europa League group game against Bodo Glimt The boss was asked his thoughts about our opponents opportunities for some of the squad and contract renewals among other things Here is everything he had to say We ve done our homework Obviously we have made the players aware of the team that we are facing tomorrow the history and what they ve done in the last few years and we have Martin in the squad who knows them really well and he s done his homework in the dressing room to understand that tomorrow is going to be a tough game That s what we have to try and do keep our momentum going The best way to do that is how we prepare every single day keep focused on the task and on everything that we re doing well and keep being humble There are a lot of things that we still need to improve and keep that willingness every time to become better every single day and to raise the competition between the members of the squad because now everyone wants to play the game tomorrow It s a competition that is really important for us we know how important it is to be on top of that group We have tough competition and the home advantage so we have to use it That s why tomorrow s game is really important for us There are a few really good players and it s a really good coach as well and they have a clear identity with how they play You can see straight away what they are trying to do and again I ve been impressed with them
