The kissing Booth I loved how the film makers were able to understand or be able to put in perfect picture a lot of real life situations that best friends Relationships and friendships deal with in real life but more importantly everyone Just like me alot of you can relate to this movie I absolutely adore this movie and totally recommend everyone to watch it What I learned From it Sometimes love comes with an expiry date No matter how hard you try to hold on to a person you have to let them go eventually i remember as a kid when i used to play with sand and hold it tightly in my fist a little swing was all it took for it to slip away from my hand People are like that too There was a time when we used to be each other s go to Every time my phone buzzed with a notification a part of me wished that it was a message from you we went from talking all day and night till the sun would rise to barely a few distant texts a day Even with our busy schedule we would make time for each other and now you forget to reply to my rescue texts at times It s very evident that sometimes with time it just doesn t work out There is no explanation good enough to console my heart though You have to let people go even when you know that they are worth a fight Even when they are your home It breaks your heart and every atom of your body longs to hold on but you know that your home has found a new destination You can t really hold on to someone because the tighter you hold onto them the more they want to slip away So you let go because if you don t it hurts so much more
