Trump criticising someone or mocking him is not something new He has the audacity to do so He has been using Twitter as a medium to abuse or mock people publicly So there won t be any appropriate reason why Twitter chose to ban him He has called Sadiq Khan a stone cold loser and very dumb In in one of his tweets he wrote addressing Sadiq Khan Sadiq Khan who has done a terrible job as Mayor of London has been foolishly nasty to the visiting President of the United States by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London not me Kahn sic reminds me very much of our dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC de Blasio who has also done a terrible job only half his height In any event I look forward to being a great friend to the United Kingdom and am looking very much forward to my visit Landing now There have always been cruel remarks made by Trump to traduce Sadiq Khan had also spoken about how in the year when Twitter banned Trump the abuse directed towards him was lessened I think there s no other way anyone can say it so lucidly the way Sadiq has done it
