If you ve ever seen a photo of people riding camels silhouetted against a fiery sunset on an Aussie Beach you can bet it s Cable Beach It s one of the most popular things to do along this kilometer stretch of creamy white sand and turquoise sea Cable Beach skirts the coast of Broome in Western Australia It was named for the communications cable laid between here and Java across the Indian Ocean in You can drive WD vehicles along the shore and stake out your own private patch of sand but it s a good idea to bring shade protection if you re planning to visit during the heat of the day
