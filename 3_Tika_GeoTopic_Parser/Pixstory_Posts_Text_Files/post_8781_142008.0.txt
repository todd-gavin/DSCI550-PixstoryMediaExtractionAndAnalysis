In Retirement continues....
â€œMy purpose in writing this letter, is, however, not to admire you but 
to draw your attention to a problem which in my humble opinion should be 
solved by you when you are at the zenith of your power and influence and 
which effects the destiny of our motherland. From my tours throughout the length and breadth of Bharat I have reached the conclusion that there is a 
clear unity of culture and ideas amongst the people of the country irrespective 
of the territory they live in, but there is one aspect of its political life that 
makes me unhappy and that is its political disunity. Groups, factions, parties 
and individuals hungry for power, anxious to rule over other people are 
found in abundance everywhere. They fight on nothings. Even jealousies and 
rivalries and the spirit to rule over their fellow beings is predominant and 
selfish desire for personal advancement is in the forefront under guise of 
service to the country. 
No one knows more on this point than yourself. Countless memoranda submitted to the State Reorganization Commission are ample proof of this tendency. Everyone wants to carve out a state for himself. 
Apart from this, provincial and parochial spirit is getting a strong foothold 
everywhere. Andhra for Andhras, Bengal for Bengalees, Bihar for Biharees 
and so on is the cry. This tendency in spite of your strong disapproval is 
gaining ground. In the South there is a separatist movement. My fear is that 
after you, the country may get disunited and India go back to Mahabharat 
and Pre-Mahahharat period. Whatever little knowledge I have of Indian 
History, our country has always been split up into small States and sub divided amongst Rajas and Maharajas of all kinds and they always fought for supremacy by performing yagnas of different varieties.
