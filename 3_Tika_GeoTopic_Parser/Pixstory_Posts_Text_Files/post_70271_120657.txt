I got sufficient experience about the college during this one year After that I joined a college that was a little away from my place The college was near to my eldest sister s place So I stayed with her and started going to college Again it was a new experience You would see young boys and girls everywhere like new flowers It was almost like a garden and one felt like the spring season had started In fact it is a never ending spring season in college I enjoyed the company of boys and girls thoroughly We used to mix and talk to each other freely and that was also a new experience in a sense that earlier you were slightly restrained and shy Now we were also away from our homes We felt totally free And then little love affairs These are normal things in colleges When I left college I was very sad We would write autographs and letters to our friends Whatever they would think of us they would write in an autograph and pass it around I used to keep all these autographs in my house occasionally to go through it and enjoy those times One gets transported back to that period and becomes very nostalgic These are wonderful memories of my early life After that I left for Madhya Pradesh for higher studies Since some of my friends were already there I thought let me also go there That was also the place where I came fully in contact with the Hindi language I mean spoken Hindi accent etc etc I was in the middle of the country s Hindi heartland Then I went back to Kerala and started looking for a job One offer came from State Bank of India SBI but I didn t go I had no interest in banking My interest was in becoming a lecturer in a college so that I would always see the spring season I have a fascination for flowers and the spring season To be continued P S The picture is for representation purposes only
