Research has found the presence of C.T.E. in the brains of more than 320 former N.F.L. ( National Football League)  players.
So what is C.T.E.? C.T.E. stands for Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, "a progressive brain condition that's thought to be caused by repeated blows to the head and repeated episodes of concussion."

C.T.E. has affected boxers since the 1920s, but it came to light in 2007 when a report found that the football player Andre Waters "sustained brain damage from playing football, which led to his depression and ultimate death by suicide." 
Although the first player who died of C.T.E. was Mike Webster.
Despite several deaths caused due to C.T.E. in Football players, N.F.L. didn't acknowledge it until 2016, when a league official spoke for the first time about the connection between football and the disease.

The strange part about the disease is that it can only be diagnosed after the person's death, and that's one of the reasons it doesn't have any cure. However, medications and therapies could help manage the symptoms.
Loss of memory, confusion, flawed judgement, and changes in the mood, personality, and behaviour can include depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts and actions, and aggression; dementia is the disease's stages.
CT.E. Symptoms often begin long after the person with the disease last had a blow to the head.
