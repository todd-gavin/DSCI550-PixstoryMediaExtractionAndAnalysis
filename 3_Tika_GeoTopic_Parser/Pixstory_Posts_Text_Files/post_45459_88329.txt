Barcelona has shifted away from their prior transfer model in the recent year or so It appears that the days of paying hundreds of millions of dollars for a celebrity name are over They re now concentrating on completing the job with the help of free agents and lower league transfers This second strategy is quite intriguing They scout young players with a lot of promise from the lower levels and sign them for a pittance They frequently register them with their subsidiary team Barca B rather than having them in the squad Pablo Torre is an year old Spanish rd division player who currently plays for Racing Santander He is from Cantabria Spain and is largely regarded as the best talent to emerge from Racing Santander s academy since Sergio Canales of Real Betis Torre has been a member of Racing s academy since and for the season he was called into pre season training with the first squad He made a strong impression and was named to the first team squad Pablo Torre scored four goals and added five assists in his rookie season He has goals and assists this season averaging a goal contribution every minutes He has played for Spain at the U U and U levels in recent years We ve seen players like Pedri and Demir who were signed for Barca B but then impressed so much in pre season that they were promoted right away Pablo Torre could wind himself in the similar situation especially if Riqui Puig is scheduled to move on loan next season When asked about it Sergi Barjuan the manager of Barca B stated that Torre was indeed a first team signing It will be interesting to see what occurs If you re good enough you re old enough at FC Barcelona these days Could Pablo Torre like Pedri have an early impact in the first team Even if he doesn t this appears to be a positive step forward
