•While thinning hair in older men has been “normalized,” few women are prepared for it, experts say.

📍Menopause isn’t just about hot flashes and night sweats. More than half of women over age 50 will experience thinning hair, a new study showed. The result can be a blow to their self-esteem.

•Thai researchers, scrutinizing the scalps of nearly 200 postmenopausal women, found that 52.2% had some hair thinning, a condition called female pattern hair loss, according to a report published Wednesday in Menopause. Low self-esteem was found in 60% of participants and increased with severity of hair loss.

•Researchers, led by Dr. Sukanya Chaikittisilpa of Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, recruited 178 women who were already being seen at a menopause clinic. They measured the women’s hormone levels, as well as the density of hair in the middle of the scalp, where female pattern hair loss generally begins.

📍What are treatments for female hair loss?

•While it’s unclear exactly why menopausal women’s hair starts to thin, the new research suggested declining estrogen levels.

•“Estrogen receptors are present in the hair follicles, which hints at its association with the withdrawal of estrogen at menopause that may affect hair growth,” the researchers wrote. Other hormonal changes may affect scalp hair and accelerate the change from the growth phase to the resting phase of hair growth.

•While thinning hair in an aging man has been “normalized,” few women are prepared for it, said Dr. Mary Rosser, director of integrated women’s health at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York. Mothers rarely, if ever, talk to their daughters about menopause symptoms, so, for many, menopause-related hair thinning can be a shock, said Rosser, who sends her patients with hair loss to a dermatologist.

•Hair loss in women may be traced to a number of factors, of which menopause may be one, said Dr. Emma Guttman, chair of dermatology for the Mount Sinai Health System.
