Mollie O'Callaghan has taken her week's individual haul of world swimming championship medals to six but the Dolphins star couldn't quite deliver Australia one final golden flourish in Budapest. 

Triple champion O'Callaghan produced one last searing freestyle leg to conclude the program on Saturday but the Australian women's 4x100m medley team just missed out on victory, less than half a second behind a quartet from the all-conquering US team.

Earlier at the Duna Arena, Meg Harris had produced a brilliant finish in the 50m freestyle, clocking 24.38 seconds to snatch a tie for third and grab Australia's last individual medal of the week.

Then after a podium near-miss from the men's fourth-placed 4x100m medley outfit, the equivalent women's quartet of Kaylee McKeown, Jenna Strauch, Brianna Throssell and O'Callaghan took silver in 3 minutes 54.25 seconds.

It was the team's 17th medal of the week as a new-look Dolphins, without some of Australia's biggest Olympic names, finished with six gold, nine silver and two bronze.

They finished third in the medal table behind Italy, who struck double gold on the final day to take their tally to seven, and the Americans, who were in a league of their own, collecting 17 gold among a record-breaking collection of 45 medals in all.
