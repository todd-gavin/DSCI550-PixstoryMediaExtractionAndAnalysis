The summer box office has returned after a two-year hiatus due to the coronavirus outbreak. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, from Marvel Studios, begins its worldwide release this weekend. 

So far, everything has gone well. But are we really surprised?

According to Disney, the Marvel Studios film grossed $27.2 million from 20 material markets on Wednesday. The total excludes Latin American and Australian preview grosses. 

Hollywood Reporter said that the sequel, directed by Sam Raimi and starring Benedict Cumberbatch, will be released in North America on Thursday night. According to tracking, the latest instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe will earn between $160 and $180 million in its home launch and more over $300 million worldwide.

While overall attendance is still lower than pre-pandemic levels, moviegoer optimism is at an all-time high. Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, superhero films made the best business, led by Spider-Man: No Way Home. 

Doctor Strange 2 opened 4 percent behind the current Spider-Man film and 210 percent ahead of rival DC's The Batman on the international box office. It was 153 percent ahead of the 2016 release of the original Doctor Strange. Stephen Strange has since made appearances in other MCU films, notably a critical role in No Way Home.
