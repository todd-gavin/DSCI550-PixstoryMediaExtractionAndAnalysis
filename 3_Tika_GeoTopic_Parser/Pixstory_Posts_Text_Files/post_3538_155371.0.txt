The fortunes of Hindi general entertainment channels are at stake after they have been consistently shown trailing behind Hindi news channel News18 India in reach.
Barring a few special events, GECs were traditional leaders both in terms of reach and viewership.
For the first time in the history of television audience measurement, a news channel has challenged the leadership of GECs.
As per BARC data shared by the channel, News18 India has claimed to outperform top general entertainment channels such as Star Plus, Sony and Zee TV with a cumulative reach of 8.7 crore (BARC; Cume reach ‘000: HSM; All 15+; Avg. Wk 37-40’22). 
According to BARC data, the cumulative reach of Star Plus stood at 7.6 crore, whereas the cumulative reach of Sony and Zee TV stood at 6.56 crore and 6.52 crore respectively. 
Commenting on the viewership data, Karan Abhishek Singh, CEO, Hindi News at Network18, said, “News18 India has a reach significantly better than all the major GECs. Our reach and viewership numbers show the kind of audience trust we enjoy. For advertisers, it’s a great opportunity to use news genre as their preferred vehicle and to take their brand to audiences in a much more efficient and impactful way.”
