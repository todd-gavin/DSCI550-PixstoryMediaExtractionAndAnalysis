Because of its strong multiculturalism, Australia's cuisine is diverse - lamb roast is as frequent as fettuccine, pho, or falafel. However, according to culture trip, there is one peculiar element of Australian cuisine: kangaroo frequently appears on the menu. Australia's national icon is a common dish, in the shape of steak or sausages (known as 'kanga bangers') with 50 million roos bouncing throughout the country – double the population of humans. 

Moreover, Australia is the third booziest country outside of Europe (and 19th overall) on the World Health Organization's list of the thirstiest countries, consuming 12.2L of alcohol per capita each year. And, with a plethora of fantastic vineyards dotting the countryside and a burgeoning beer industry in our towns, it's easy to see why.
