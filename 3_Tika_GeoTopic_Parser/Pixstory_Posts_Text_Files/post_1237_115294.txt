If Lewis Hamilton doesn t win a race this year it ll be the ONLY year he hasn t won a single race since the very beginning of his F career Even with the recent win in Austria I don t think Ferrari s Charles Leclerc will be able to win the championship this year and that s the hard truth Ferrari have dropped the ball once again
