The debut at the Juventus Stadium was positive At least for the result and for the performance of several players Vlahovic and Di Maria above all The Argentine had to leave after a sumptuous match due to injury and the grimaces made for the remaining minutes promptly caught by the cameras worried the fans and the coach Max Allegri Angel always has a little face like this he said at the end of the match then he had that little problem with his left adductor a week ago It would have been better if I had taken it off but these things happen I&#39;m not worried tomorrow we will see the results of the exams but these are things that happen during this type of match with a lot of heat and a lot of tension I was happy about the match even if he would have liked more attention on some occasions It was not easy but we started well Then we lost two three balls on the way out and we are still fragile in that situation in which we should have been serene to let the moment pass and continue playing In addition to Di Maria, Vlahovic is certainly among the best The striker scored a brace but above all he proved to be on track Having Di Maria certainly helps him said Allegri He is happy when he scores goals but like everyone else he has to improve in certain situations such as passing choices and understanding where the ball can end up I am happy for him anyway because he needed to score and he was really good in the second goal
