I wanted to share what I learned from this Covid experience and things that you need to take care:

1. Do not panic at all. 😎

2. Wear mask and gloves. It's our responsibility to take care of ourselves instead of blaming the other people for not taking precautions. 😷

3. Take shower before sleeping and change clothes regularly. 🌧🚿🛀🧼

4. Many people advised for disposable utencils, but I washed it properly and served and I used disposables too. 🍽

5. When you touch any object in their room just sanitize your hands. 🤚

6. Spray sanitizer in the house everyday. Also, try to get sunlight if possible. 🌤

7. Drink hot or warm water everytime and milk with turmeric before sleep. 🥛

8. Make sure to make steam regularly and take food and medicine on time. ♨️

9. To increase your immune system- Vitamin C and Zinc intake is important. Above all eat regularly. Do not keep your stomach empty (virus loves empty stomach) and if you dont feel like eating anything, drink lots of water, tea, coffee or juice (avoid cold). ☕️🫖

10. Take good Amount of sleep, it will help the body to rest, sleeping is the best medicine! 🛌

11. Keep yourself Motivated and diverted. Don’t feel that you are in this all alone. 🤍

12.Keep yourself entertained, watch your favourite movies, TV shows, talk to your family, friends over video calls. 🎶🎬

13.Read your favourite books to keep yourself busy and productive. 📖

14. Do some breathing yoga and Exercises. 🧘‍♀️
