Our culture bombards us with directives to boost our cognitive skills and train our brains to retain information, and mental slip ups can be alarming. We worry if we have some health problems!

As per Columbia Psychiatry, Scott A. Small, MD, director of the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at Columbia University and author of a newly published book, Forgetting: The Benefits of Not Remembering, has a message: For most people, not only are memory lapses normal, they’re necessary for the functioning of a healthy brain—just as important as the ability to remember.

He talked about how in a world buzzing with information, it is essential to be able to turn down the noise and discard useless details, so they don’t interfere with access to new learning or ideas. 

Without our awareness, and particularly during sleep, the brain is constantly sorting out which memories to keep and which can be purged and forgotten. 

The ability to forget helps us prioritize, think better, make decisions, and be more creative. Normal forgetting, in balance with memory, gives us the mental flexibility to grasp abstract concepts from a morass of stored information, allowing us to see the forest through the trees.

He added that the importance of forgetting is a relatively new concept for science. Until about a decade ago, normal forgetting—in contrast to ‘pathological’ forgetting that occurs in disease and with aging—was seen a passive process that served no useful purpose.
