Rohit in an exclusive interview with Pinkvilla informs that the prep work for Singham 3 has already begun.🤩🤩
"We have already started working on Singham 3. It has been a long time since I made an out and out Singham film. We start the shoot next year in April. Ajay Sir is busy with his commitments and I am also busy with Cirkus. So, by April, we will start Singham 3. It is going to be the biggest cop universe ever that we have made till date," says Rohit, without divulging into any other details. Pulling off a multi-starrer in today's time is difficult and Rohit insists that for him, it isn't as difficult a task as his actors have complete faith in his skill set.🤠🤠

Ajay sir and Akshay sir  come from an old school, where they believe in doing multiple hero films. Ranveer has the faith that I will present him in the right way. I never face the problem in making such cinema, but the young guys should not listen to their managers and start working on two hero films. They should leave their insecurity behind, otherwise, it will be difficult for the producers to make big scale films. After 2 years, again the content films will work. But for the next 2 to 3 years, it's going to be the thing to make big scale films in the right way with multiple heroes. Big scale is what the audience will come and watch," 🤑🤑🤑🤑
