The Taliban on Thursday (June 19th ) confirmed the death of a pregnant woman who had fallen into a well in the Khakriz district of Kandahar province.

 Residents of the district tried to save the woman for two days in a row, but were unable to do so due to lack of facilities and skills.

There are also reports that the woman's father suffered a stroke after hearing the news of his daughter's death.
The deputy head of the Taliban's information and culture department in Kandahar said the woman had died on Thursday, 19 June.

The Taliban official claimed that the woman had left the house after the domestic violence and had thrown herself into a well.

Another version, quoted by locals, says that the woman was left standing while drinking water.
In the past 10 months, reports from Kandahar, Zabul and Helmand provinces have shown that children in these provinces have lost their lives after falling into a well.
