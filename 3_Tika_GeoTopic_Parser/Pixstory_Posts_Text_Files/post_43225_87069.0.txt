Best known to superhero fans as General Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross in Marvel’s The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers Infinity War/Endgame, and Black Widow, William Hurt has died just shy of his 72nd birthday. Hurt also received an Oscar-nomination for his role in the graphic novel adaptation A History of Violence, one of four nominations in his career. (He won Best Actor for 1985’s Kiss of the Spider-Woman, which despite the title is not a comics-related film.) The actor revealed in 2018 that he had terminal prostate cancer and was taking an experimental treatment to minimize side effects.

Hurt made his debut in the sci-fi/horror hybrid Altered States, about a scientist who regresses himself first back to caveman form,  and then a pure energy being. Other sci-fi and fantasy related projects included roles in Lost in Space, The Village, Until the End of the World, Michael, AI: Artificial Intelligence, and Winter’s Tale. On TV, he played Duke Leto Atreides in the Dune miniseries and King Hrothgar in a Beowulf adaptation.
