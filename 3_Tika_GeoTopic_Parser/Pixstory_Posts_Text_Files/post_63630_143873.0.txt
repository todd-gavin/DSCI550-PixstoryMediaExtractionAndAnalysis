After the highly controversial TV series ‘The Lord Of The Rings: Rings of Power’, it would seem that Amazon is keen to cash in on yet another classic franchise as the multi billion dollar company has now turned its gaze to the legendary science fiction Blade Runner franchise. 
With all that said, Amazon has announced a new live-action TV sequel to the sci-fi classic titled ‘Blade Runner:2099’ which is set 50 years after the events of the 2017 ‘Blade Runner: 2049’. No details for the plot are currently available though theories are circulating that the show may be a direct continuation of Denis Villeneuve’s 2017 sequel as suggested by the name.
"The original Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott, is considered one of the greatest and most influential science-fiction movies of all time, and we're excited to introduce Blade Runner 2099 to our global Prime Video customers," said Vernon Sanders, head of global television, Amazon Studios. 
"We are honored to be able to present this continuation of the Blade Runner franchise, and are confident that by teaming up with Ridley, Alcon Entertainment, Scott Free Productions, and the remarkably talented Silka Luisa, Blade Runner 2099 will uphold the intellect, themes, and spirit of its film predecessors."
Denis Villeneuve’s Blade Runner 2049 is one of the best sequels ever created so Amazon has a very high bar set ahead for them. But this also poses the question if Amazon is capable of handling a story as complex, dark and layered as Blade Runner, particularly since ‘The Lord Of The Rings: Rings of Power’ has by and large been a highly boring affair with nothing substantive to offer or possessing even a shade of the spirit of either the Tolkien books or the Peter Jackson movies.
