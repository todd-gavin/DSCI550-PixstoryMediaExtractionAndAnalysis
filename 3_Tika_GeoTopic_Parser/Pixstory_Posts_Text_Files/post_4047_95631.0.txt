She walked with her ear pods on full volume 
With the charge of 14 on her phone 
Without bothering the stares 
Looking at the stars and the beautiful sky
Without fear ?
Maybe with a little fear 
She kept this at bay
Enjoyed the moment 
Clicked few photos of the night 
She walked as if she achieved the medal of freedom 
It was 8:15 PM.
