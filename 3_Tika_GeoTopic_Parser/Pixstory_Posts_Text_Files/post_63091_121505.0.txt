Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday changed the display picture (DP) of his social media pages to the national flag of India and encouraged all the countrymen to use 'tiranga' as their social media profile pictures between August 2 and August 15 as part of the 'Har Ghar Tiranga' campaign.
"It is a special 2nd August today! At a time when we are marking Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, our country is all set for #HarGharTiranga, a collective movement to celebrate our Tricolour," he tweeted.
