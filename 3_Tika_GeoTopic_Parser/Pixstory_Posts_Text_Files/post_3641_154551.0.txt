With festive fervour bringing families together, card games find prominence in modern customers’ lives, but what troubles the real money gamers is the central government’s plan of bringing a regulatory change to classify online games into skill-based and chance-based.
As of now, some states like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have already passed laws to prohibit all real money games in the respective regions. Industry players are hopeful that the new move will bring a positive ray of hope and will lead the online gaming industry into a whole new era of growth.
According to Krishnendu Guha, Chief Revenue Officer, Adda52, it is extremely important to catalogue the gaming category into skill-based and chance-based, because when it comes to real money games, it is crucial for people to be aware as to which games require skills and which do not.
“There are games like Poker, Rummy, Fantasy etc., that require a certain skill and study for creating strategies and thus come under skill-based games,” he added.
Furthermore, he also suggested that the biggest challenge for any emerging market, especially when it concerns money, is the absence of a centralised law or regulatory body recognised by the Government of India.
However, it is to be noted that the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology had issued advisory guidelines to media platforms, advising TV channels and digital news publishers to refrain from broadcasting ads pertinent to betting platforms.
The advisory further stated that several online offshore betting platforms have also resorted to using news websites as surrogate products to advertise the betting platforms on digital media and the violation of the earlier guidelines may also invite penal action for the broadcasters.
As of now, the laws are primarily driven by the states and thus with each state having its own understanding of gaming platforms, all real money games are prohibited in some states, irrespective of skill or chance, he said.
