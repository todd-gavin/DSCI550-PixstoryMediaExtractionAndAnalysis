Earlier this week, Droupadi Murmu was sworn in as the 15th President of India. Hailing from a humble background, she is the first tribal woman to become India’s head of state.

Against this backdrop, more than 50 handles on Twitter are claiming to be of Droupadi Murmu. However, it is worth noting that none of these accounts are verified. Twitter often verifies accounts belonging to prominent individuals, as indicated by the blue ticks visible on the display name. In this article, we will be investigating some of the handles claiming to be that of Murmu’s. 

1. ‘@draupadimurmupr’

We noticed that this account was created in June 2022. As per the bio, this handle claims to be the official account of ‘President Draupadi Murmu’. It currently has a follower count of close to 50,000.

On July 21, the handle shared a Twitter thread thanking ministers, MLAs and MPs for their support in her election to the post of President.

Several leaders including Prime Minister Modi, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Home Minister Amit Shah, and Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu shared congratulatory messages to Murmu for being elected as the President. However, it is worth noting that these leaders did not tag any of the handles claiming to be Droupadi Murmu’s. Yet, this account quote-tweeted all of the posts adding a note of thanks, as if it belonged to the President herself.

On the other hand, Vineet Kumar founder of Cyberbeace Foundation and the official handle of Jamia Millia Islamia University tagged the handle ‘@draupadimurmupr’ while issuing their congratulatory wishes to Droupadi Murmu on becoming the President.

Taking a closer look at this account, we noticed several spelling mistakes and grammatical errors in many places. It is highly unlikely that tweets with such glaring errors would be posted by an official handle.
