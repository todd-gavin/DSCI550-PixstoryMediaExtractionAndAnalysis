Amidst the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, several countries have decided to not take part in competitions hosted by Russia. Poland are one such country, their football team’s captain, Robert Lewandowski came to their support. 

“It is the right decision! I can't imagine playing a match with the Russian National Team in a situation when armed aggression in Ukraine continues. Russian footballers and fans are not responsible for this, but we can't pretend that nothing is happening."
