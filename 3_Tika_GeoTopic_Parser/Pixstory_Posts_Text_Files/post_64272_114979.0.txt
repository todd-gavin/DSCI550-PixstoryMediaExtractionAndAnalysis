Traveling, music, dance, complete strangers and scenic views that are indescribably mesmerizing.

Thatâ€™s how I celebrated my eid.

This is to cherish one of the most memorable trips I had the chance to go to and a pocket full of the most beautiful memories I shall ever have.

Happy eid to everyone celebrating.
