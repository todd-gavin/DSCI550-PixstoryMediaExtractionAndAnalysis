Last week, I had the pleasure to travel to Denver, Colorado and do some hiking and outdoor adventures. Here are some of the outdoor excursions I did 🚶‍♂️🥾🎒... 

Mon, 21st) Garden of The Gods 🪨🐚 and The Incline Trail 📶
Tue, 22nd) The Royal Arch 👑🪨
Wed, 23rd) Chief Mountain 🏔
Thu, 24th) Dream Lake  Rocky Mountain National Park 💧🏔
Fri, 25th) The Red Rocks Amphitheater 🎭 

A lot of fun despite the freezing weather, occasional snow, and bone chilling winds. It wasn't uncommon for the temperature to get down to single digits (or even zero on most nights 🥶). Definitely planning on going back when the weather is less intense. Lot's of great hikes worth doing!
