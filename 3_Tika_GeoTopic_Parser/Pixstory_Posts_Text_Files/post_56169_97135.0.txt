‌Animal rights are not a joke. This applies to all animals. There shouldn't be a distinction between certain animals we care about. For example, most people don't care if a pig is used for animal testing but care if a dog or a rabbit is used. It was estimated in 2010 that the annual use of vertebrate animals—from zebrafish to non-human primates—ranges from tens to over 100 million. In the European Union, vertebrate species represent 93% of animals used in research, and 11.5 million animals were used there in 2011. By one estimate, the number of mice and rats used in the United States alone in 2001 was 80 million. In 2013 it was reported that mammals (mice and rats), fish, amphibians, and reptiles together accounted for over 85% of research animals. 
‌
‌Many animals are caught by dealers it is a business for many to sell animals in auctions for research. PETA and BUAV questioned the need for and legitimacy of animal testing. They argued that it is cruel and poorly regulated, that some of the tests are outdated, that the costs outweigh the benefits, or that animals have the basic right not to be used or harmed in experimentation. 
‌
‌Organ chips are an alternative here, The chips can be used instead of animals in vitro disease research, drug testing, and toxicity testing. Researchers have also begun using 3-D bioprinters to create human tissues for in vitro testing. 
‌
‌Mostly euthanasia is done for the animals tested in labs. Trust me the suffering, pain and death of animals are not worth the possible human benefits. This test is intensely painful for the animal, and blindness, scarring, and death are generally the results.
