Using the pill is easy: just swallow a tiny pill every day. Here’s the info on how to start birth control pills, the different types of pills, and what to do if you miss a birth control pill.


What are the different types of birth control pills?
There are 2 types of birth control pills (combination pills and progestin-only pills), and many different brands.

1 Combination Pills (COCs):
Combination pills have 2 hormones: estrogen and progestin. Combination pills are the most common type of birth control pill.

As long as you take 1 pill every day, you’ll be protected from pregnancy. You don’t have to take your combination pill at the exact same time every day. But taking it at the same time is a good idea because it helps keep you in the habit of remembering your pill.

2 Progestin-Only Pills (aka POPs or Mini Pills):
Progestin-only pills have 1 kind of hormone (progestin) — these pills don’t have any estrogen. You must take your progestin-only pill within the same 3 hours every day to be protected from pregnancy.

The one exception is Slynd (a different type of progestin-only pill): you don’t need to take Slynd within the same 3-hour window every day, but it’s best to take it around the same time if you can to help keep you on schedule.


How to use the different types of birth control pills ?

Combination Pills (COCs):
As long as you take 1 pill every day, you’ll be protected from pregnancy. You don’t have to take your combination pill at the exact same time every day. But taking it at the same time is a good idea because it helps keep you in the habit of remembering your pill. You can also use an alarm, calendar reminder, or our birth control app to help you remember. Most combination pills come in 28-day or 21-day packs.

If you have 28-day packs:
Take 1 pill every day for 28 days (four weeks) in a row, and then start a new pack on day 29.
