Match group is the company behind dating apps comprising Tinder and Hinge, has split off with the political lobbying after arriving under fire for funding a republican group that works to undermine abortion rights.

Bernard Kim, the company's chief executive said the company has stopped funding the Republican Attorneys General Association after Popular Information indicated that it had made a $137,000 donation to the group.

 It said it was also stopping donations to the Democratic equivalent, the Democratic Attorneys General Association.
“It’s my responsibility to understand how these donations fit into our larger lobbying activity and determine what we will do moving forward,” said Kim in an internal memo to company employees attained by the New York Times on Thursday.

Match group was always an advocate of abortion rights. The company declared on Tuesday that it would add a “pro-choice” badge to users’ profile options. 

Match Group also funds Planned Parenthood and Bansoff.org through in-app promotions. The company announced it would give reproductive care coverage, which covers travel and lodging costs for full and part-time employees, contractors, and their eligible dependents, plus a companion, who need to travel out of state to receive abortion care, in September, when Texas passed a bill to ban abortions after six weeks.

There has been a division among the companies too after the abortion rights were overturned. There have been always two sides since the overturning of abortion rights.
