Have you ever wondered who prey on Komodo Dragons? Every predator has a predator, right? Everyone is defeatable.

Except if you're a Komodo Dragon.

Komodo Dragons are an apex predator. Meaning, they are the top predator in the natural food chain. On their home islands, they are the largest land mammal; nothing hunts or eats them, and they will eat just about anything that crosses their path. Lizards, snakes, deer, small rats, big buffaloes. And if given a chance, a human. Just about ANYTHING, any kind of meat. Other than hunters, they are also scavengers and roam around looking for carcasses.

But there's a catch. There's one natural predator they have and that's... themselves. Komodo Dragons aren't only deadly to other species but also their own. They are cannibalistic in nature and will feast on the young ones of their own community. That's the reason most juveniles spend their growing years up on the trees. In fact, 10% of this big lizard's diet consists of its own kind.
