The Spanish centre-contract back's at Emirates Stadium is up in two years, but he prefers to
stay in Italy. Pablo Mari, an Arsenal loanee, has stated that he is "very pleased" at Udinese and
that he wants to continue in Serie A beyond the season's end.

Mari joined Arsenal for £14 million from Flamengo in July 2020 following a brief loan spell at
Emirates Stadium, but has only appeared in 19 appearances for the club in all competitions
since then. In the first half of the 2021-22 season, the Spanish defender was reduced to a
bit-part role in Mikel Arteta's squad, and the Gunners sent him out on loan to Udinese in
January, where he has found a fresh lease on life.

Mari will return to north London this summer to finish out the final two years of his contract,
which was not included in the transaction between the two teams.

The 28-year-old, though, prefers to stay at Dacia Arena, telling Gazzetta dello Sport:
“I'd like to stay in Serie A next season. I'm under contract until June 2024 with Arsenal – but I'm
so happy here at Udinese."

Pressed on why he enjoys living in Italy more than in England, Mari replied: "I have already
seen Porto Cervo in the summer and Venice since I have been in Udine. Beautiful. Then in
England, everything closes at five."

Mari has made eight Serie A appearances for Udinese, all as a starter, as head coach Gabriele
Cioffi has taken a shine to the centre-back. In that period, the Italians have only achieved three
victories, three draws, and two losses, dropping to 13th place in the table as a result.
