Zee Entertainment Enterprises may draw Rs 130.7 billion in revenue for the TV rights of International Cricket Council (ICC) matches, at an annual ROI of 2.2% over four years, according to a report by Elara Capital.
This revenue is basis the assumption that it has paid 50% of the total value for TV. The annual ROI dynamics may change favourably to 9% if it has paid 40% of the total rights value.
ICC rights for marquee international tournaments were bought by Disney for $3 billion (CY24-27). Last month, Disney Star announced that they have entered into a strategic licensing agreement by way of which Disney Star will license the television broadcasting rights of the ICC Men’s and Under 19 (U-19) global events for a period of four years to ZEE.
TV rights accounted for 49% of the total value in the recent IPL auctions. Based on the assumption that the cost of acquisition in the TV segment is at 50%, Zee has paid a cost of around Rs 436 million/match, around 22% lower than that for IPL TV rights. 
According to Elara Capital, “This is a big premium (discount of a mere 22%), as pricing is high only for India- based matches. And if India does not qualify for the later stages, the pricing may converge sharply (down 40-50%). As per our assessment, India matches contribute 9-17% of the total matches in marquee tournaments based on performance. Thus, it is important for India to perform well to recover the hefty content cost.”
Elara Capital expects this deal to be earnings-dilutive in the near term and FY25E earnings to be cut 14%/8% (standalone ZEE/Consolidated merged entity). Although, Elara's analysis added that this deal also has the potential for a 61% upgrade (standalone ZEE) in FY28E helped by Cricket World Cup.
