If almost a decade of celebrities in tracksuits and flip flops and two years of the pandemic haven&#39;t served to remind us of the importance of wearing comfortable and cute clothes inside and outside the home, GANNI and Juicy Couture will with their new collection The two brands have joined forces to give a new contemporary and sustainable twist to the chenille jumpsuit symbol of a historic moment The American company decides to give new life to the historic item by reproposing it in different shades from classic black to blue-violet with details covered in rhinestones up to brown with allover logo The version of the jumpsuit much loved by Paris Hilton over the years now also sustainable made with a mix of certified organic and recycled pre-consumer cotton together with recycled polyester The Juicy Couture velvet jumpsuit is such a strong symbol of the aesthetics of the years and is based on a cultural reference powerful To be able to rework a classic YK of this caliber was a lot of fun Also to be able to bring it back in a more responsible version is a real dream When I walk the streets of Copenhagen it gives me so much energy and inspiration to see the new and super stylish generation of Gen Z playing with elements of 1960s style in such a personal and fresh way I hope our tribute to the iconic tracksuits is a fun style piece that makes our community feel confident and fabulous Said about the collaboration Ditte Reffstrup director creative by GANNI
