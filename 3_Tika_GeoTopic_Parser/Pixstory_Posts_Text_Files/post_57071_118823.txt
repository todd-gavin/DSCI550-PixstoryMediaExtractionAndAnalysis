Laura Mulvey s essay Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema can be taken as one of the best archetypes for understanding the atrocities of the male gaze Mulvey in her essay spoke about the perspective of the heterosexual male fantasy In her writing she explains how a male is a strong and confident protagonist while female characters are just present to serve his story His gaze the vicious gaze portrays the story Mulvey took the full power of her work to say it all and chose psychoanalysis as her language to talk about how traditional Hollywood films respond to scopophilia which is the sexual pleasure involved in looking She wanted to talk about how the movies were constructed to satisfy the masculine scopophilia which she calls the male gaze Our society is made for the benefit of heterosexual men or patriarchal society where the idea of objectifying women s bodies is often overlooked or ignored by naming it as a means of entertainment and not acknowledged In filming the male gaze is represented by the camera It lingers over the female body in ways meant to titillate both the male protagonist and the audience It frames the female body in sections and dehumanises her Furthermore her profound relationship with cinema took a keen observation and interest to observe what wrong is being done to women through movies as she was also involved in Women s Movement
