You would ve probably seen the movie Jhund in which Amitabh Bachchan potrays the life of Vijay Barse Now lets read about the life of Vijay Barse from the man himself I was born in Nagpur and my father worked as a head constable in police before India s Independence He was from Nagpur but was always being transferred He looked after a big family of ten kids My father used to be transferred to far off places a lot I studied at the Municipality school at Bhandara which is kms away from Nagpur I studied there till th class and after that I pursued my higher studies in Nagpur In college I pursued phsycial education and became a sports teacher at the Hilsop College in Nagpur I started working there in s and retired in One thing that I prominently remember about my child is that how my father used to help other people a lot and that did lead to get him into trouble He always talked to us about helping others My father was talking to a friend his friend told him shouldn t spend all the money on his family at once but save it for rainy days He had an interesting response saying if he manages to save rupees and distributes it among his children they might fight for the remaining He doesn t want that and he said that he just wants to keep his teachings for them They should become good humans He gave him an example of how animals don t help even their children but how my mother would herself not eat anything if we had nothing to eat This has left a long lasting impact on my mind and its ons of the reasons from which I derive the strength to help people
