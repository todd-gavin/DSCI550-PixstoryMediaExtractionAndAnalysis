1.Tolerances
Certain acts and words which feel uncomfortable or beyond tolerance level should be clearly stated and the boundaries set up shouldn’ be violated even by a loved one.

2.Privacy
"Your life is yours. Their life is theirs." Couples and family members often share a lot. But they needn’t share everything if they don’t want to.

3.Decision-making
A couple should reach a decision only after both the partners agree. It is reasonable to expect to be consulted on decisions that affect their life in a meaningful way.

4.Emotions
It is important to try to not allow the inner world of one’s partner to affect one’s own inner world. The key here is not to take on responsibility for things that aren’t within one's circle of influence. 

5.Differences
This encompasses all types of beliefs. Expecting the partner to follow and practice the same beliefs as yours is unreasonable. Differences need to be respected and valued from both ends.
