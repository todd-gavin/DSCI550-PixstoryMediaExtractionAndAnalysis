The US intelligence got it right. It had reports that Russia would invade Ukraine. In an unusual move, the White House publicized several of them too. As Putin finally acts on his intentions, the US intelligence should be credited for getting it right. But, then, the question is, why it could not be prevented when they knew what was in the offing?

In the propaganda war before the actual war, the US had, for example, released in December a map of showing positions of 175,000 Russian troops in readiness for a massive military offensive against Ukraine: https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/russia-ukraine-invasion/2021/12/03/98a3760e-546b-11ec-8769-2f4ecdf7a2ad_story.html In these “prebuttals”, the US sought to expose Russia’s “false-flag” operations to create an excuse for action against Ukraine. Britain too released similar intelligence inputs: https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-accuses-kremlin-trying-install-pro-russian-leader-ukraine-2022-01-22/ 

The West also alerted Ukraine with these intel inputs. (It did not act on them in time: more below.)

Moscow ridiculed the US intelligence, also reminding of its failure over Iraq’s supposed WMDs: https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-russia-media-vladimir-putin-ecba20c81181c028b06109cf8620426a

This time, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby proved right in calling inputs “credible”. On Thursday, lawmakers from both parties on the US House and Senate intelligence committees appreciated the intelligence work. They said new inputs – that the Russian forces are planning to decapitate the government in Kyiv – too should continue to be shared with Ukraine: https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/02/24/world/russia-attacks-ukraine?campaign_id=249&emc=edit_ruwb_20220224&instance_id=54184&nl=russia-ukraine-war-briefing&regi_id=71575760&segment_id=83860&te=1&user_id=47cab2c84267654b69f64da2c3662730#accurate-us-intelligence-did-not-stop-putin-but-it-gave-biden-new-leverage

But what did intelligence achieve other than, possibly, making Putin change his timelines? The next step should have been diplomacy. Yes, the unusual White House campaign of airing and sharing intelligence helped build a western alliance. Beyond that, diplomacy could not avert the military action. There were plans of a Biden-Putin summit, brokered by French president Macron, but that won’t happen now. 

One reason the action could not be prevented is also that Ukraine chose to downplay the US warnings, even accusing it of drumming up a war: https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/1/28/ukraine-accuses-us-of-hurting-economy-by-stoking-panic-over-war President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had not called up military reservists until Wednesday, when he also announced a 30-day state of emergency: https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-business-europe-95fa30a288ee262388dfd1392442d33b

Predicting a conflict is difficult. It involves too many factors that are changing too. Preventing one is even more difficult. Why?: https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/2/16/22935927/russia-ukraine-great-power-conflict
