Today we saw the release of the first batch of images taken by the James Webb Space Telescope This is something we have both been waiting on for nearly years Back in those days we were analysing the first Hubble images of the distant universe and the details they revealed were shocking compared to anything we d seen in ground based images It seems the bar has been raised once again and Webb is set to herald a new age for astronomy and space research Its large mirror helps it produce images that are two to three times sharper than Hubble s and which go much deeper into space which means it can see fainter sources Webb can also see far redder infrared wavelengths opening up a new view on the universe This is especially important to study the early universe due to cosmological redshift a process which refers to the stretching of light with the expansion of the universe as it travels across cosmic space It s also useful for studying fascinating sources such as planets going around nearby stars and the regions where stars form We ve written before about the tremendous technical challenges involved in the construction of Webb and its journey into orbit Now with the long awaited first images in our hands let s take a look at what they show Intense clarity In a sneak peak US President Joe Biden yesterday presented the very first image of Webb s deep field This is the massive galaxy cluster SMACS that contains thousands of galaxies clustered around a central super bright galaxy squatting at the centre You ll immediately notice the many elongates arcs representing background galaxies which have been gravitationally lensed as a result of the cluster s mass In other words the huge forces of gravity at play have resulted in the light from the galaxies becoming distorted stretched and amplified providing a highly enhanced image of the distant universe Read more
