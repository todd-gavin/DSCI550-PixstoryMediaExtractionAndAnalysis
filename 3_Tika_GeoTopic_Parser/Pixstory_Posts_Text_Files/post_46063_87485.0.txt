Itâ€™s high time that this happened. This was a necessary change and I am glad that violence against Native American women is finally being addressed in the mainstream legislature. 

The women of Native American tribes of Maine have been waiting for this for a long time now. The newly reauthorized Violence Against Women Act has wording that ensures Maine's Native American tribes are protected. 

U.S News reported that Maine's tribes, like other nationally recognised tribes, are now subject to the jurisdictional provisions of the Violence Against Women Act, according to Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree, who campaigned for the addition of the phrase.

According to Pingree, the tribes "lost out on protections that have been provided to every other federally recognised tribe in the country" due to their previous lack of participation. 

Native American women residing in Wabanaki lands in Maine formerly lacked access to the same protections and resources as their counterparts elsewhere, according to Penobscot Nation Chief Kirk Francis.

I am glad that finally the tribes will now have access to all available resources to protect Native women, children, and public safety officers on our territories.
