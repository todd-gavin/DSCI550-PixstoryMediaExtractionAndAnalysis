Riya Roy class DPS Vasant Kunj Group The fashion industry is the second biggest consumer of water and accounts for per cent of global carbon emissions Sometimes it is very difficult to understand why one must keep replacing clothes that are perfectly fine just to keep up with what is in fashion currently It is quite impossible to keep up with ever changing fashion trends in the first place All over the world major fashion events like the Paris or Milan Fashion weeks are held every year only to prove that what was presented last year with the same pomp and show can no longer be worn and it must be replaced with what the models are presently wearing while being paraded up and down flashy runways The concept merely reeks of consumerism and meaningless dictates by an industry that can only sustain itself by telling us whatever we are wearing is somehow wrong We were taught from a young age to donate rather than throw away and that is what we must do any time we feel that we ve outgrown something in our closet physically or mentally Be it household help or a nearby shelter donating your older clothes is a cathartic experience knowing that you will be clothing someone less fortunate with the choice you have made Another great way to make our fashion needs much more sustainable is by repurposing old clothes which might have a slight tear or worn out fabric Recently actress Sonali Bendre appeared as a judge on a popular children s dance show wearing a two decade old Rohit Bal jacket Not only did she look stunning but she also paved the way for sustainable fashion to become the future of fashion In a world where you can shop until your card is maxed out let us redefine being a fashionista by rehashing our outfit using smart styling hacks and making them look as amazing as they were when we first got them home Certainly sustainable fashion has the potential to become the largest movement behind a sustainable planet and a sustainable future
