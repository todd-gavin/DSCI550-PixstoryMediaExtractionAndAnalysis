Indeed Delhi summer heat is JUST unbearable but we can t stop enjoying and living our life due to that only So to make my summer time memorable some of the activities which I love to do are Swimming Swimming in the summer is a no brainer What better way to keep cool on those long hot days than going to the pool or the beach Eat Ice creams Call me crazy but I love to eat ice cream even during cold season So ice creams are definitely like heaven to me in hot weather Visiting aesthetic indoor cafes Delhi is quite famous for cafes Hanging out at cool and aesthetic indoor cafes with friends is definitely a good option for me in summer time Visiting water park Do this subheading even needs an explanation I mean who would not love to visit water park during summer time Wearing cool and cute summer clothes Best thing about summer season is summer clothes for me Variety of things which we can wear in summer is absolutely endless
