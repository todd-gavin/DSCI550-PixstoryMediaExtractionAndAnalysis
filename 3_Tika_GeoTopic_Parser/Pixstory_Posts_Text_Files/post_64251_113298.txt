Since the inception of civilization on earth humans have been believed to exist through networking We have established relations with everyone In fact we might not know people outside our circle but have an unspoken relationship with the community that we live in And when there s a relation there are specific laws that people are meant to follow From time immemorial we have been dictated by these laws on how we are expected to behave our choices and our freedom to make decisions all of these in some ways are influenced by the society we live in Decriminalizing same sex marriages divorces happy remarriages intercaste or interfaith marriages and conversion to a different religion a lot has changed since we gained independence almost eight decades ago All these laws somewhat define our relationships with each other navigating us on how to live and love in this society However the transition has never been smooth Still some people are trapped in their intolerant families I have seen people calling homosexuality a mental illness People are living in unhappy marriages only because marriage is a pious institution that works on the principle of compromise and understanding even today women are mocked for their potentiality and individuals are compared with others only because they fizzled out at what pados wale uncle ya door ki chachi wanted from them But what I fail to understand is that until when personal happiness will be sacrificed at the altar of the shackles of what people think and what s expected from us Is personal freedom absolute this question has always troubled me Albeit we say that we want to live our life on our terms but every time we bow down either because of our loved ones or because of the unprecedented situations that surround us Image Source Cartoon Movement
