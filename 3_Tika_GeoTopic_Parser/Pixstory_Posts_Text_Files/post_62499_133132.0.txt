An apex predator is a species of animal that dominates its environment and feeds on other animals that are much smaller or weaker than it. They play an important role in the ecosystem by keeping populations of weaker animals in check, and their deaths can cause widespread chaos in the ecosystem.
Apex predators are typically big, strong, and fast predators like lions, tigers, and bears. They're able to hunt down prey much larger than themselves and generally have a very high tolerance for risk. This makes them some of the most successful animals on earth â€“ because they're able to sustain themselves at a higher level than any other species.
Without an apex predator to keep things in check, ecosystems would quickly become out of balance and would be subject to drastic changes.
