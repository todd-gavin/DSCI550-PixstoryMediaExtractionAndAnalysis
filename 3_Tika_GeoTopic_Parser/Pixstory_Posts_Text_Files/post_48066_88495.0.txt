The mountains are the last place where man can feel truly wild. The great thing about reaching the top of the mountain is realising that thereâ€™s space for more than one person. And youâ€™re now in the prime position to help others up. I see every person as a mountain of sorts; we can see how they look from afar, but will never know them until we explore. ðŸ¥‚
