The specialists of the Paediatrics facility of Borgo Mantovano, the director Paola Accorsi with colleagues Luca Pecoraro and Alessia Norato have published together with other doctors of the University of Verona an article based on the analysis of the data collected during the educational initiative in the field of asthma which took place last summer from to June in Borgo Mantovano There were seven patients involved and they took part in three days of teaching, practical tests, recreational activities carried out, all carried out with the aim of learning the correct technique for administering inhalation therapy. The data collected will be confirmed on a larger sample of patients but this is the first preliminary prospective study to demonstrate that an intensive school camp correlates with an improvement in the administration of therapy in children with asthma. Based on this result and other evidence in the literature, the work consolidates the evidence that the initiative in question represents a fundamental tool for the education and management of asthma in children and adolescents. The project entitled Asmanatura was subsidized by the Municipality of Borgo Mantovano and the Rotary Club Mantova Sud and provided for the free participation of children aged between hey years The ASD La Rotta sports association also collaborated with the specialized psychotherapist psychologist Elena Bellini the National Carabinieri Biodiversity Center Boscofontana the volunteers of the Ai Confini social cooperative the volunteers of the ABEO Mantova association The proposal based on scientific evidence children and adolescents suffering from asthma can refuse to continue the therapy for the necessary period of time they can easily forget the treatment or use it only on demand as is typical practice with bronchodilators in the presence of acute or more troublesome symptoms therefore good information on the nature of the disease its causes and the consequences Further important aspects are the correct use of the inhalers of drugs on request and the need to go to the pediatrician, pneumo-allergologist or to the Emergency Department in urgent cases based on the intensity of the symptoms, avoiding self-medication in more intense asthma exacerbations
