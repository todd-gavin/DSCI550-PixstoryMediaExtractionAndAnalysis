When Bachchan Pandey got released in theatres on th March and didn t work at the box office at that time everybody thought that because of the great success of the movie The Kashmir Files people didn t go to the cinema halls to watch Bachchan Pandey On th April Bachchan Pandey got released on Amazon Prime Video and I watched it yesterday and realized that movie didn t work because there is nothing in the movie to like about and after the pandemic no fan want to spend money on the bad movie because they know after a month or two the movie will release on OTT platforms Bachchan Pandey is a movie about an aspiring filmmaker Myra played by Kriti Sanon who is searching for a great personality on which she can make a movie While searching she came to know about a gangster named Bachchan Pandey played by Akshay Kumar and Bachchan Pandey is fierce and it showed on screen very brilliantly Myra tried to get all the details of Bachchan Pandey s past life but failed all the time but because of one incident their paths crossed and Bachchan Pandey agreed to the idea of making a movie about his life The rest of the movie is based on this plot only and the movie also focuses on how Bachchan Pandey became a gangster The movie will not offer anything new to all the viewers but if you are a super fan of Akshay Kumar then you will like this movie otherwise this movie is cringe The runtime of the movie is hours and minutes and is available on Amazon Prime Video
