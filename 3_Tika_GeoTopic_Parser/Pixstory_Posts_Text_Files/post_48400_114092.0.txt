Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is a United States immigration policy that allows some individuals with unlawful presence in the United States after being brought to the country as children to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for an employment authorization document (work permit) in the U.S. 

Immigrant advocates lead to a federal interest court in hope of saving an Obama-era program that prevents the deportation of thousands of people brought into the U.S. as children.

A federal judge in Texas last year declared the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program illicit — although he decided to leave the program intact for those already aiding from it while his order is appealed.

The U.S. Justice Department is upholding the program, allied with the state of New Jersey, advocacy organizations such as the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, and a union of dozens of powerful corporations — including Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft — which argue that DACA recipients are “employees, consumers and job creators.” states argues that they are damaged financially by allowing immigrants to remain in the country illegally.
They also argue the state ignores proof that DACA recipients decrease Texas’ costs because many of them hold jobs with health insurance advantages and many own homes and pay property taxes that support them.
