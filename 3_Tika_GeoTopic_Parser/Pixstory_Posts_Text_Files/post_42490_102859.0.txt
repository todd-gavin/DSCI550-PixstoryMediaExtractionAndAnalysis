Another weekend is here and if you are not going anywhere to chill then make prepare popcorn and sit in front of the television and binge new web series or you can go out to watch new movies in cinemas too.

Four new titles are releasing today and there is everything for everyone,

2. Top Gun Maverick

Top Gun Maverick is a sequel to Top Gun which was released way back in 1986 and lead actors in both movies are the same and name of the actor is Tom Cruise. Playing the same character after 36 years tells you how fit and dedicated Tom Cruise is to his profession which is, acting.

I think Obi-Wan Kenobi needs no introduction if you are a Star Wars fan.

Obi-Wan Kenobi is the story about the Jedi master who contends with the consequences of his greatest defeat. The downfall and corruption of his one-time friend and apprentice, Anakin Skywalker, who turned to the dark side as evil Sith Lord Darth Vader.
