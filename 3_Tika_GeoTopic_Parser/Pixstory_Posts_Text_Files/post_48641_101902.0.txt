“They asked me what would be my ‘wild’ moment,’’ Davis said when he was asked a question he didn't see coning about his personal life during the NBA Draft Combine interviews in Chicago. “It’s realizing I’m in the NBA. And playing against anybody who’s been there. I just made sure I go through interviews with my head on straight.’’

Davis said meeting coach Tom Thibodeau, was an honor. He called him the former Bulls coach who can't walk along Chicago streets without being stopped,

“It went really well,’’ Davis said. “It was nice to see familiar face [in Thibodeau] and somebody who’s been part of the game for a while. It was amazing to talk to him after seeing what he’s done with a lot of teams. He’s a very recognized coach in the league.
“I heard from people he likes guys like [me],’’ Davis added. “So hopefully I can fit in with them and they’ll be invested in me enough to draft me.’’

As part of agent Jeff Schwartz's Excel Management stable, Davis held his pro day on Saturday, albeit he didn't do any shooting or drills. He was also interviewed by the Knicks on Thursday. With the No. 11 overall pick, Davis is in the Knicks' range, but he has interviews with clubs ahead of them, including the Spurs at No. 9.
