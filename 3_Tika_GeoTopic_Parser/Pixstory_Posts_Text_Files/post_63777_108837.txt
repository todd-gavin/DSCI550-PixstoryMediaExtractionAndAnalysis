Feminism and promoting the LGBTQ community is a positive step in the growth of society Giving trans and homosexuals greater representation in the realm of comic books novels and cinematic universes as heroes support characters and villains is only expanding on the ever increasing potential growth of comic books novels or other universes But in advancing what is a noble cause creators have taken to spreading what I call The Rainbow Message message of the LGBTQ flag way too much Content creators who are looking forward to spread The Rainbow Message in their works rather than spreading the message with any sort of finesse or subtlety are instead shoving it in our face Making the message the narrative rather than using the story as the narrative to spread the message only makes the person care less and less about the whole thing The only effective way to convey your message is to make your story and your characters relatable Spreading The Rainbow Message in such a pathetic and unimaginative way does disservice to everyone the creator the audience the pen and paper and most of all the LGBTQ community whom they are so desperately trying to promote Movies serials and comic books are first of all tools of storytelling Even if the message forms the core of the narrative advancing the story and its characters should always be the prime focus of creators Well for Western particularly US media these days it seems that the entire narrative is the message and that ideology is slowly poisoning the whole US entertainment industry with Netflix and Disney being the worst victims of this mentality though Prime Video is also not far behind Whether it is Ms Marvel She Hulk or the upcoming Rings of Power it all showcases the problem of Western obsession of seeing all things as a sort of social marketable trend and trying to force the world to adopt the trend even if it has no attraction from poverty to sexual orientation to forced diversity This obsession with forced feminism and diversity is killing Western specifically US entertainment
