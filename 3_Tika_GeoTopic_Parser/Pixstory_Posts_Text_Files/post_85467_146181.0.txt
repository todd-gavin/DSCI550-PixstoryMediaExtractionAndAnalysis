My player ratings of the starting eleven. No ratings on the substitutes as they didn’t impact the game with the minutes available.Ramsdale - 6/10Not much to do, collected anything his way. Solid with his feet. It’s important to remember the modern goalkeeper will be kept busy on his feet to start moves. Distributed the ball well.White - 6/10Solid performance. Becoming very underrated in the side. The more he plays, the more comfortable he is partnering Saka down the right-hand side.Saliba - 9/10Wall at the back. Rio Ferdinand-esque performance, winning duels and smart with possession. His story continues.Gabriel - 8/10Better. Gabriel powered through a minor knock during the game and displayed his class. Tierney - 7/10He’s looking match fit, and he’s showing he can adapt to our system. Taking up central positions and very good on the ball. Outlet.Xhaka - 9/10Effective in both boxes. A complete performance, Xhaka is enjoying his new role and the fans are showing their support. Complete.Partey - 7/10Rolls-Royce, he does the simple things better than well. Most passes and most xG build-up passes in our passing network, Partey is too good at his job. Integral.Vieira - 6/10Busy, the Portuguese star started his first league match of the season and kept things ticking. Quality goal to introduce himself.Martinelli - 6/10Always a handful, very high work-rate going forward and back. Kept worrying Brentford in possession. Tireless.Jesus - 8/10Another complete centre-forward performance, lovely finish in the box. Winning ground duels and always keeping the Brentford backline busy.Saka - 7/10Effective. Saka continues to adapt to a slightly different role, making spaces for others. Two assists and always a threat.
