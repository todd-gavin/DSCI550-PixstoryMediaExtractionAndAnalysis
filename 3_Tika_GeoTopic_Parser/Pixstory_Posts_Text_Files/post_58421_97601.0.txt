While the whole world chases the moonlight to feel romantic, I always love the sun. A self declared sun-chaser, it immediately gives a sense of positivity and energises the dormant soul within. 

Sun is the source of all life. The precious vitamin- D comes from the sun. When the most happiest nation, was facing many suicides of its citizens, people were advised to take vitamin-d. Swedes and the people of Finland are known as the most happiest people, but they are affected by SAD. To come through that, the much needed elusive sun, is compensated with Vitamin-D. 

Supplements are important, but try to get it the natural way. And before basking in the sun, make sure to drink a glass of orange juice. Vitamin - C gets better absorbed, added to the vitamin-D. 

Staying indoors affects not just the mood, but also the bones. So move around. Move outside. Get in the sun- sweat it out and replenish with a glass of orange juice or electrolytes. 

Stories are born in many ways. Our #emotions #feelings #experiences and health help us to weave stories through all these areas of life. Every memory is a story. Hope you all like this and future stories are going to be awesome. Join me in this journey to celebrate - Life and soul.
