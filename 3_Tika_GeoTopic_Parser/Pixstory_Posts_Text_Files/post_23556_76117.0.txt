After almost ten months, PENTAGON returned with their latest album IN:VITE U and the lead track “Feelin’ Like.”

Yet, alongside a music video that is dark, sexy, and obviously sultry AF, showcasing the groups’ mature side
And just being a general bop that topped Korean domestic charts.

But One member particularly caught the attention of netizens for their statue-esque figures and visuals, and it was none other than Yanan.

They have noticed that this comeback, something has changed in Yanan… and his physique. The minute the concept photos were released, fans couldn’t get enough of his visuals and those arms!

When the music video was released, it was just as amazing, with Yanan’s proportions being off the chart with his tall physique and now toned arms.
There was even a bit of skin showing and really, it was the icing on top of the cake..

Korean media even compared him to a statue alongside Hongseok, who is known for sporting an impressive physique through his workouts.

- The duality is unreal gosh!!!! 😩👀❤️
