Kylian Mbappe's future can be decided in a matter of days from now. The young Frenchman's contract with Paris Saint Germain is set to expire in the summer. Following this, he would become a free agent and can sign for any club. 

Real Madrid have been the favourites to sign Mbappe for the last year. PSG did not allow the Frenchman to leave the club last summer even though Real Madrid made a bid of â‚¬200m. Mbappe himself has been a fan of Real Madrid and wants to join the Spanish giants. Hence a transfer looks likely.


What have PSG planned? 

However, PSG are keen to keep Kylian Mbappe at the club. For this, they are ready to offer him a massive signing on fee and a "humungous salary". However, the Parisians have now crossed another line. 

As per reports, Paris Saint Germain are ready to let Kylian Mbappe take full control of the sporting operations. Something like this has not even been given to the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in their esteemed careers. 

 As per El Chiringuito TV,  "A desperate PSG has offered to give complete control of the sporting project to Mbappe from next season. The 23-year-old will reportedly have a say in changing the manager and who his teammates are going forward."

Hence Kylian Mbappe will basically have a sat in everything the club does moving forward. This is certainly not a healthy contract to give. However, this is a "last-ditch attempt" to make him sign a new contract. 

Real Madrid on the other hand are still confident about the situation. Hence it has to be seen how the Kylian Mbappe transfer saga unfolds in the next couple of days.
