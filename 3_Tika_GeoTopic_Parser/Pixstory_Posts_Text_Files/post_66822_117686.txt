Remus was a sweetheart in the books as well as movies I loved every bit of him I wished I could have had professors like him but alas He was certainly one of my favorite characters But by no means was he the best The best character of the series was Hermoine Granger She was the best she was sweet and caring and certainly not afraid to be the smartest person in the room She didn t dumb down herself for the sake of Harry and Ron and that was the best part about the characters She was a perfect role model for kids around the world
