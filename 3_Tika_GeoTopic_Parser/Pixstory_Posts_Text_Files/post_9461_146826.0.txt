Peace becomes a temporary entity in our interiors when dishonesty and faking guard it. Original selves are all disturbed. Each moment bruises surface and giggle at you. Putting your heart builds close connections. But anything could rot or die halfway. It takes microseconds to denounce the other. Nobody is emotionally safe in this bogus world. So, insure yourself first to live on other’s emotions. It’s all in you. Protect your peace for you. Don’t feed beautiful lies long enough to break your roofs. Faking peace is not peace.
