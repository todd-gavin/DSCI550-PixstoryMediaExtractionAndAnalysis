To confirm the accession formally, the Accession Council is formed.
It comprises senior officials that assemble only when a monarch has died.
The accession council is divided into two parts. In Part I, the Privy Council, without The King present, will proclaim the Sovereign and formally approve various consequential Orders, including the arrangements for the Proclamation.
Part II is the holding by The King of His Majestyâ€™s first Privy Council.
