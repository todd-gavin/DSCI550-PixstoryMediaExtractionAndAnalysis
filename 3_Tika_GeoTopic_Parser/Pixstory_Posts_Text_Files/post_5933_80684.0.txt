Science City Celebrates International Day for Women & Girls in Science 

Moderating the conversation, Dr Neelima Jerath, Director General, Science City said that International Day of Women and Girls in Science celebrates the achievements of women scientists and innovators and reminds us to work towards creating an enabling environment for female Scientists and Technologists. She informed that though 43% of women enrolled in STEM at undergraduate level in India, only 14% move to higher jobs in S & T with only 3% enrolling in PhD. She further informed that S & T needs to be taken to rural women also. Hence, PGSC has set up ‘Women Technology Park’ to empower the rural women and make them ‘Atma Nirbhar’. 

The Panelist at the occasion were luminaries listed in “Lilavati’s Daughters”, i.e. Prof. Manju Bansal, Professor of Theoretical Biophysics, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore; Dr. Tanusri Saha Dasgupta, Director, S.N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences, Kolkata and Dr. Sudesh Kaur Khanduja, INSA Sr. Scientist & Professor Mathematical Sciences, IISER Mohali who shared their success stories. Prof. Manju Bansal who is a Fulbright Fellow and visiting Professor at Rutgers Univ, USA shared her work on DNA structure and how she developed new computational tools for analysis and modeling nucleic acid and protein structure. She urged the need to encourage and inspire girls and women to achieve their full potential as scientific researchers and innovators.
