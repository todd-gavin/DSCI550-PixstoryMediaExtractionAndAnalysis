Spoilers Ahead The One Punch Man manga differs from its webcomic version in more ways than just the difference in art style While initially it was believed that Saitama was someone whose strength had hit its utmost limit with chapter of One Punch Man manga Saitama in his fight with Garou has reached an explosive level of growth whereby his strength is no longer an absolute value During the fight between Saitama and Garou the Hero Hunter notices that after he initially copied Saitama s strength with his own technique which made him able to compete with the Caped Baldy he is now being completely overwhelmed by him Saitama is now undergoing explosive growth in strength The reason for his massive strength growth had been described as an upsurge of emotions like he had never experienced This is due to Saitama failing to save Genos s life which for the first time causes Saitama to fight seriously and even furiously The very idea that Saitama can actually improve and become stronger is a total surprise showcasing that he is a different character than what readers were led to believe The chapter also reveals that Saitama s strength is now more than a plot device If the hero is improving it means that his power has an actual definable amount even if it s on such a grand scale that quantifying it is impossible This is an important fact for the future of the series as the showdown between Saitama and the mysterious villain God is getting closer and closer Evolving from a parody shounen character Saitama has since then become a much more layered and nuanced character Ultimately undoing all the damage that Garou did by going back in time with the help of a repentant Garou after he sees the dead body of his friend Tareo Saitama has forgotten all the events of chapter but the chapter has shown that despite of his monstrous strength Saitama is more than capable of growing with his true strength being unquantifiable by an standard measure
