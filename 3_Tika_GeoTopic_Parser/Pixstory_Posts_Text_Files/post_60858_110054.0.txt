I am multilingual and I love learning languages. I am so glad that I had the opportunity to learn Korean because my University had offered it as an open elective.

I have to admit that initially it was difficult to keep up and it requires a lot of practice to learn any language. Handling college academics and language classes was difficult. However, if you develop a routine, then learning any language for that matter, becomes easier. Here are a few things I tried (and some my professor suggested) that you could use to learn a language too ⬇️

1) Maintain a separate notebook for practice
2) Practice the script, grammar and vocabulary daily (set aside at least an hour each day)
3) Try reading children's books/picture books of that language (simple sentences+ develops vocabulary)
4) Watch native dramas/movies or listen to native music (I watch k-dramas and I also read a lot of manwhas)
5) Practice speaking simple sentences to yourself in the mirror.
6) Read a passage daily so that your pronounciation improves
7) Try using sentences of the language you're trying to learn when you're performing everyday tasks (having dinner, complimenting food, reading, expressing gratitude, etc.,)
8) Maintain a small pocket notebook for noting down new words you learn.

The last one would be practice. Practice maketh everyone perfect. I managed to pass my exams and get those credits but it certainly wasn't easy. More than the academic value, I cherished the learnings I received from my Korean professor. I'll forever be grateful for the experience and introduction to the culture she gave us.
