She wore an eagle feather beaded onto her cap that her mother had given her as she walked along a red carpet and crossed a stage to earn her diploma. Amryn Tom, a senior at Cedar City High School in southern Utah, graduated this week. Her relatives applauded. 

US News reported that eagle feathers of the type Tom wore are sacred items for the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah and other Native Americans. They are passed down through generations and used at ceremonies to signify achievement and connection to the community.

“This is from your ancestors,” Tom said her mother, Charie, told her.

Students in Tom's school district would have been prohibited from wearing tribal regalia in addition to their typical cardinal-colored hats and robes a year ago. 

This isn't the year. 

Utah became the latest state to enshrine Native American students' ability to wear tribal regalia during graduation ceremonies in March. 

Last year, Tom and other Native American students in Iron County celebrated the hard-won privilege to wear regalia at graduation ceremonies, which had been denied by the school district.
