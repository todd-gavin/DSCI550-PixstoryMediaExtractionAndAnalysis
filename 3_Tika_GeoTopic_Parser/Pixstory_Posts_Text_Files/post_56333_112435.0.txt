Yesterday, in response to the Supreme Court’s ruling in West Virginia v. EPA, President Biden issued a statement on his unwavering commitment to “continue using lawful executive authority, including the EPA’s legally-upheld authorities, to keep our air clean, protect public health, and tackle the climate crisis” and “tackle environmental injustice, create good-paying jobs, and lower costs for families building the clean energy economy.”

Vice President Harris emphasized that while “the Supreme Court’s misguided ruling aims to take our country backward,” through “executive authority, legislation, and state and local action, we must charge forward.” National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy stressed that even though the Supreme Court is “siding with extreme special interests that want to dismantle our right to clean air,” President Biden will “keep moving us forward, using every tool we can to tackle the climate crisis,” and EPA Administrator Michael Regan made clear that the agency “will move forward using our Clean Air Act authority, consistent with the law, to set greenhouse gas standards for power plants.”
