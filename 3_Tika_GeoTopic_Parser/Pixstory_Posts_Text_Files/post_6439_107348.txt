We all look and pray for someone to holds us down when times get really challenging I sat here and thought about how everyone wants a relationship but my question is could you really handle what all comes with being with someone through it all Could you if they got sick stand by their side without complaints Could you hold them down if they fall on hardship Could you take on what they could no longer do Could you help heal them if they got injured I see a lot of people wanting someone to have but do they understand what it really takes to hold a relationship It s not just about physical looks or what they can do finically I feel it s about longevity with your divine soulmate it s having the spiritual background to fight the battles that comes towards your partner or spouse These topics aren t as relevant as you can see how high health crisis has been and I ve been thinking how can we change the dynamic of what a relationship truly means Still pondering but I thought as I wrote in my journal how I could share the simplest thoughts that breeze through lol I love you
