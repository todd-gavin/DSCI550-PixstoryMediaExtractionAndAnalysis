Even before birth, mothers and their children have a connection. Every relationship involves a give-and-take mechanism. However, a mother-child connection is one in which the mother strives to provide for the wellbeing of their child without having any other goals in mind.

According to Islamic belief, the recollections of Safa and Marwa are connected to Hajar, Ibrahim's wife, searching for water for their son Ismail. According to popular belief, Allah commands Ibrahim to leave his wife Hajar and their infant son Ismail alone in the desert between these little hills when they arrived in Makkah with him. Hajar was first apprehensive about spending time alone in the desert, but after learning that it was God's will, she put her faith in Allah and consented to the arrangement. Prior to abandoning them both in the desert with some supplies, such as the water skin and some dates

They quickly ran out of food, and Hajar, who was still nursing Ismail, was unable to make any more milk. Ismail consequently began to feel thirsty. When his mother saw this, she frantically began looking for water nearby so that she could feed her child. In her haste to obtain water, she first scaled the nearest hill, Safa, to get a view of the area. She looked about when she didn't see anything in an effort to find someone or a water source before running toward Marwa. In order to expedite her search, she sprinted back and forth between the two hills a total of seven times before returning to her kid, who she had left on the ground.

Hajar, distraught and anxious when she couldn't discover anything, begged Allah to save her son. In accordance with Islamic belief, it was at this point that Allah heard her pleas and sent the rescuer Angel Jibril (Gabriel), who struck the ground with his wing and caused the water to appear. Hajar nursed her kid after consuming the holy water, saving his life. Around the water source, she also dug what is known as the ZamZam Well.
