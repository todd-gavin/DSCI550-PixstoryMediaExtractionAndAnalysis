The election strategist and businessman Lynton Crosby has been attending Boris Johnson's 8.30 a.m. meetings in No 10, demonstrating that he is more involved in the prime minister's decision-making than previously thought. 

The Guardian reported that the Australian political strategist, whose consultancy business has represented tobacco as well as oil and gas industries, is known to have been remotely assisting Johnson with his leadership issues, but his attendance at the regular meetings implies he has taken on a considerably larger role than before. 

Crosby is the founder and CEO of CT Group, a government affairs, polling, and research firm that also advises political leaders on election strategy. His return to advising Johnson has coincided with the prime minister's tilt to the right, as he strives to improve his credibility with that sector of the party.

A No 10 source confirmed that Crosby had attended some morning meetings, but insisted these were party political rather than official government ones.

A government spokesperson said: “Lynton Crosby is not a government employee. Any assistance to the prime minister would be party political and in his capacity as leader of the Conservative party.”

Let’s see what happens next!
