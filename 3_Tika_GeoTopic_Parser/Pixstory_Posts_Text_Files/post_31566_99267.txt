The visual census of fish species envisaged within the BIOSEA project has just been completed Protection and safeguarding of BIOdiversity and ecosystem services of transitional environments in two Sicilian areas belonging to the Natura network on the northern coast of the island The transitional environments are habitats coasts of great importance for fish, birds and other organisms as well as being areas of high diversity and productivity explains Valentina Esposito, researcher of the National Institute of Oceanography and Experimental Geophysics OGS and coordinator of the BIOSEA project, underlining that they represent in fact staging and nesting areas for avifauna and spawning and spawning grounds for numerous fish species These characteristics make them very important from a commercial point of view and therefore highly exposed to anthropic impacts in particular as regards fishing and aquaculture activities The BIOSEA project has precisely the objective of assessing the state of health and conservation of two transition environments of the northern coast of Sicily Capo Peloro Ganzirri lakes and Oliveri Tindari Lagoon In particular, the aim is to determine the diversity of fish species of commercial importance and the presence and diffusion of introduced alien species from human activities, paying particular attention to the conservation of ecosystem services provided by these environments. A further objective is also to evaluate the effectiveness of the restrictions imposed by local management plans and their impact on the ecosystem level in terms of biodiversity
