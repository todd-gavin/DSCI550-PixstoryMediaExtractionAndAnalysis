‌This week two men were arrested for impersonating federal agents to infiltrate the U.S. Secret Service creating a potential national security risk as per government. 
‌
‌That’s according to U.S. Assistant District Attorney Joshua Rothstein, who said the defendants "tricked people whose job it is to be suspicious of others," alleged who was eventually "shocked" the two were not who the federal officers they claimed to be. He said that the facts that every day they discover makes things worse. 
‌
‌In addition, Rothstein said, Ali (one of them) “made claims to witnesses that he had connections to the ISI, which is the Pakistani intelligence service”. 
‌
‌The intentions of the two men were not known, but at one point they recruited a third person, assigning him “to research an individual that provided support to the Department of Defense and intelligence community”.
‌
‌One of them carried handguns that are used by US federal law enforcement and indicated to others that he had secure access to what seemed to be homeland security computer systems.
‌
‌This infiltration is a threat to national security. It's not a very good time for the US and needs to be extra careful because the country has enemies inside and outside. This intrusion into the US posses a very hard question of security.
