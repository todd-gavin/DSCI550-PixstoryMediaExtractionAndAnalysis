One thing is for certain as the countdown starts in earnest for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. This year’s global soccer spectacle will be unlike any other.
For the first time in the quadrennial tournament’s 92-year history, it will be staged in November and December instead of the mid-year months.
The Qatar World Cup is one of the biggest events as strong government support and growing commercial maturity are helping to raise the Gulf’s profile in the sporting world.
It will also be the biggest sporting event ever held in the Middle East, and one of the world’s biggest post-Covid-19 events.
The 2022 FIFA World Cup will attract an estimated 1.5 million visitors to Qatar during the four-week celebration, continuing the sport’s longstanding tradition of being one of the most popular worldwide sporting competitions.
Qatar has invested hundreds of billions of dollars in developing infrastructure and building stadiums to host the event. One key organiser estimated that the event could spur a $20 billion boost to the economy, Bloomberg previously reported, but risks of new coronavirus variants could upset projections.
