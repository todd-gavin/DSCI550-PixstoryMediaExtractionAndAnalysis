Fitness is another trend these days; everyone wants to become fit and healthy by not indulging in long hours of workouts. As a result, keeping track of health habits becomes difficult, but studies have found that even short activities can make someone fitter and healthier.

Jenna Gillen is an exercise psychologist at the University of Toronto. She claims that even one minute of exercise done correctly can have impressive health effects.
Gillen’s team randomly assigned participants to three groups. One pedalled an exercise bike at a moderate level of effort for 45 minutes, three times per week. A second group did thrice-weekly the 10-minute workouts that included three segments of 20 seconds of all-out sprint cycling for one high-intensity minute for each exercise. (The rest of the time was easy spinning.) Finally, a third group served as a control and did nothing.

After 12 weeks of observance, it was seen that both the workouts were effective. So this experiment proved that intensity was the key; an exercise with more intensity can be effective even if it is done for a short period.

A basic workout regime that can be added to your routine can follow these steps, 
• Four minutes of high-energy cardio, like 30 seconds of light marching followed by 30 seconds of fast jumping jacks—then repeat.
• Three minutes of upper and lower body resistance training, like a squat followed by a reverse push-up.
• Two minutes of core strengthening. (Plank)
• And finally, one minute of deep breathing and stretching to cool down
