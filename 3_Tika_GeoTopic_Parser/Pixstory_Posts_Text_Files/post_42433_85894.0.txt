“It’s not about the skin, it is about the territory,” this one line pretty much sums up the story of the “West Side Story.” 
West Side Story is helmed by the director who needs no introduction and he is none other than Steven Spielberg. 
West side story (based in the 1950s) is a story of two groups (Jets and Sharks), Jets are the Americans and Sharks are from Puerto Rico and the American government just bought their land to build high-rise buildings. 
Jet and sharks can do two things very well which are dancing and fighting. Sharks fight when Jets racially abused them or tell them that they do not belong here. 
And if there is a conflict in one place, love will always be there to balance the tense situation in the movie, and lovers put their loved ones in big trouble. So do happens in this movie. 
Will, this couple can change the mentality of two gangs or will they face the consequences of being in love?
To get the answer to these questions, you have to watch the movie. 
There are many things that I liked about the movie and all credit goes to the creative thinking of the director. Some of them are as follows:- 
All the characters of the movie do the talking mostly by singing and dancing and you will enjoy that.
Directors use the color of clothes to tell the difference between rich and poor that felt very impressive.
Some scenes of the movie will leave you in awe just because of the amazing cinematography. 
Last but not the least, all the actors performed very well, either they are singing, dancing or speaking in Spanish, the audience will always get to know what they are trying to say. 
The runtime of the movie is 2 hours 36 minutes and you can watch it on Disney+ Hotstar.

Recommendation - If you fall in love with the genre of musical drama after watching this movie then I recommend you another movie named “In the Heights” and you can watch it on Amazon Prime Video.
