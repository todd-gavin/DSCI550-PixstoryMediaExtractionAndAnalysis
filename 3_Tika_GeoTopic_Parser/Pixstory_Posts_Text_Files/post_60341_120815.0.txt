The Lok Sabha began debating price hikes this afternoon as soon as Parliament's session resumed after both Houses were adjourned till 2:00 p.m.

A number of opposition leaders spoke out during a discussion on price increases, including Manish Tewari of the Congress, Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar of the Trinamool Congress, and Kanimozhi of the DMK. They criticised the central government for raising prices for fuel, food, and GST.

On Monday, the Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla lifted the suspension of four Congress members after receiving assurances from the opposition members that they wouldn't carry placards into the house. The Speaker further threatened the leaders with harsh punishment if they again carried placards within the House. Pralhad Joshi, a minister for the Union, made the move.
