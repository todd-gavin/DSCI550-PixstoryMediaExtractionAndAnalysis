ðŸ‘‰Know the Law About Public Breastfeeding.
Carry a copy of your state's law on the topic of public breastfeeding. You can find all state laws at the National Conference of State Legislatures website. 

ðŸ‘‰Clarify Communication.
Clarify what you hear from the other person. Ask questions like, "Are you asking me to leave because I'm nursing?" This will help avoid miscommunication and ensure a conflict doesn't arise from a simple misunderstanding.

ðŸ‘‰Consider a Nursing Cover(totally your choice and sense of comfort).
If you don't choose to use a cover, it may help to share your reasons with people who ask. 

These might include that it makes the baby uncomfortable, that you don't like to carry the extra item in your diaper bag, or any other reason you feel applies.

ðŸ‘‰Be Confident.
Be confident in your choice. Many people respect confidence, even if they disagree with your actions

ðŸ‘‰It's Your Choice.
Whether you choose to nurse in public, it's important to understand both sides of this issue. That way, you can know and protect your rights or, if you choose, take actions that will prevent conflict with those who don't support public nursing.
