One of the world’s topmost movie events, Cannes Film Festival has kickstarted. And, Bollywood’s brightest star Deepika Padukone has returned to the red carpet again, but this time, she is not attending the prestigious film festival as an attendee but as a jury member. The actress has already blessed her fans with her first look on Day 1 and since then, it took the internet by storm. However, it seems like the treat for the eyes isn’t over yet as DP has presented another majestic look.
