Blonde, the NC-17 biopic starring Ana de Armas as Hollywood legend Marilyn Monroe, has just released its beautiful first trailer.

The film is based on Joyce Carol Oates' blockbuster novel and covers Marilyn's life from her youth as Norma Jean to the blonde beauty on screen, as well as her love affiliations.

Bobby Cannavale, Adrien Brody, Julianne Nicholson, Xavier Samuel, and Evan Williams are among the supporting actors.

The film follows her emotions and her experiences. "There are moments when we are inside her body and head, and the viewer will be able to experience what it was like to be Norma and Marilyn at the same time," Ana said of the film.

On September 28, 2022, the film will be accessible on Netflix.
