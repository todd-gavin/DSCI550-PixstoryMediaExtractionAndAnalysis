Just as Russia was launching its assault against Ukraine from different directions, cyber experts say it had unleashed an attack from the cyber world on its neighbor’s computer systems.

Ukrainian banks and other institutions were hit with wave of distributed-denial-of-service attacks taking websites offline. Experts say that Russia launched ‘data wiper’ malware that can destroy data on a device to wipe the data from the systems. The Ukrainian government announced that various departments of the government were affected by the virus. Symantec, the cyber security software maker, has been said that these attacks were launched in Ukraine and Latvia and Lithuania.

Officials were expecting such attacks just before the Russian invasion, but the ferocity has surprised many. But these attacks are seen as not very long-lasting. These attacks came on the heels of another episode that had happened a little over a week back when DDoS attacks led to central banks going offline. The malware attacks in Ukraine have been manually activated, as opposed to others, which can spread out across borders easily.

But this was not the most serious cyberattack against Ukraine was in 2017. The attack most probably launched by Russia’s intelligence agency GRU was against companies doing business in Ukraine. The virus called ‘NotPetya’ resulted in a loss of over $10 billion worldwide.
