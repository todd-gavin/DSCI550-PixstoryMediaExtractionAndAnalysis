Native Americans from Utah's sovereign tribes and the administration of Governor Spencer Cox gathered to talk about problems and solutions to work together. 

The Governor's Native American Summit, which brought together governmental organisations, neighbourhood associations, and tribal members, was held on Thursday at the University of Utah. 

According to Larry Cespooch, a spiritual figurehead in the Ute Tribe, "it is incredibly nice to see all the people gather together, especially after COVID here." 

A Hopi butterfly dance that prayed for rain during the prolonged drought opened the top. Tribal members are very aware of the problem.

“The drought situation is a huge concern. Lake Powell is losing a huge amount of water," said Mark Freeland, a member of the 24th Navajo Nation Council.

Leaders of the state's many tribes met privately with Lt. Governor Deidre Henderson to discuss issues and ways they can work together to find solutions. Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah Chair Corrina Bow told FOX 13 News she discussed the Indian Child Welfare Act, among other things.

“We really need to make sure that’s passed. Our water rights is another," she said.

Lt. Gov. Henderson, who has been traveling the state and visiting tribal lands, said every tribe has different issues.

"There are some issues we’re not going to agree on. There’s going to be some contention on issues. But I'm hopeful it can be contention on issues, not a contentious relationship in general," she told FOX 13 News.
