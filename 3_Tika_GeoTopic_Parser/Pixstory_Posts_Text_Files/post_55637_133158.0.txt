I know you are laughing! But donâ€™t write off bats without knowing them!

According to various sources, after all, the only flying animals are bats. Additionally, they employ echolocation to navigate at night. As you are probably aware, bats spend the most of their time living when it is dark and difficult for them to see. They must therefore rely on methods other than sight for navigating. In order to locate themselves and navigate efficiently, they beep and listen for differences in the echoes that return. 

Over the years, bats have developed a bit of a bad reputation. The majority of this, though, is unfounded. Many people believe that Bats, particularly those in North America, are notorious for spreading rabies and a wide range of other toxins and diseases to humans. This is merely a rumour that has spread due to television and motion pictures. In actuality, bats stay away from people, and in the past 50 years, only 10 people in North America have contracted rabies from bats.

Also, thanks to TV, many people associate bats with dark things like vampires and dark magic which is so not the case! 

So, have I convinced you yet to make bats your favourite animal?
