Mozzarella is such a versatile cheese. The delightfully stringy cheese blankets our pizzas, or maybe you prefer it coated with breadcrumbs and fried with a tangy sauce. Watching the melted cheese stretch as you pull it is a sight that everyone enjoys. Mozzarella can be used in salads, sandwiches, pasta, and even desserts! But did you know this cheese can be made at home? 

That's right! You can have your favorite cheese right at home. And you don't even have to use rennet. All you need are 2 ingredients: milk and vinegar! 

To make fresh homemade mozzarella: 
1. Heat up 2 litres of non-homogenized milk to 48°C. 
2. Remove from the heat and add 1/2 a cup of white vinegar. 
3. Stir for 5 seconds, then cover. Let the milk sit for 15 minutes undisturbed. 
4. Using a large slotted spoon or a strainer, gently remove the formed milk curds into a microwave safe bowl. Press gently to remove as much whey as possible. 
5. Don't throw the whey away! You can use it in your baking or in curries for a protein boost! 
6. Microwave the milk curds for about 30 seconds, or until it reaches about 70°C. 
7. It gets hot here, so be careful! Using tongs or heat-safe gloves, stretch and fold the cheese gently. 
8. Repeat the heating and stretching process 2 more times, until the cheese is smooth. 
9. Form the cheese into a ball and place a bowl with the whey. There should be enough whey to cover the mozzarella. 
10. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before cutting. 

And you're done! You can now use your fresh mozzarella any way you like!
