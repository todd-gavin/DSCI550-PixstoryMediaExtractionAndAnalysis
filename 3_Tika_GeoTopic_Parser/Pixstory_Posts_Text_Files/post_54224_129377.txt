Astronomers at Western Sydney University have discovered one of the biggest black hole jets in the sky Spanning more than a million light years from end to end the jet shoots away from a black hole with enormous energy and at almost the speed of light But in the vast expanses of space between galaxies it doesn t always get its own way Taking a closer look At a mere million light years away the galaxy NGC is in our neighbourhood cosmically speaking If our galaxy were a house NGC would be a suburb or two away Looking at its starlight with an ordinary telescope we see the familiar oval shape of a typical elliptical galaxy with about ten times as many stars as our own Milky Way Typical that is until we observed NGC with CSIRO s Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder ASKAP in Western Australia a network of linked radio dishes forming a single super telescope The radio waves reveal a jet of matter shot out of the galaxy by a central black hole This high powered stream of material is about times larger than the galaxy if our eyes could see it in the night sky it would be bigger than the Moon While astronomers have found such jets before the immense size more than a million light years across and relative closeness of NGC make these some of the biggest known jets in the sky Shock diamonds So what did we see when the precision and power of ASKAP got a close up astronomically speaking view of an extragalactic jet This research is led by doctoral student Velibor Velovi of Western Sydney University and has been accepted for publication in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society preprint available here Our Evolutionary Map of the Universe EMU survey sees evidence of the matter between galaxies pushing back on the sides of the jet Read more
