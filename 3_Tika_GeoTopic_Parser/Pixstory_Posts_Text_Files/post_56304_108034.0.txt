The Los Angeles Lakers are looking to make an impact this offseason to get back to championship contention. One way to do that is by making a big trade involving the expiring contract of point guard Russell Westbrook. That will be a challenge because of Westbrook’s massive deal and it also is unclear which star players are available, although one that has been mentioned as someone who could be on the move is Washington Wizards star Bradley Beal.

The guard is coming off a disappointing season in which he played just 40 games, had surgery on his left wrist that ended his season, and shot a career-low 30% from 3-point range. But before then, Beal had been one of the most prolific scorers in the league, averaging over 30 points per game in consecutive seasons.

Apparently Beal could be on the Lakers’ radar, as Kevin O’Connor of The Ringer reports that the Lakers are interested in acquiring him this summer, though there are other teams who may have a better chance of acquiring the guard from the Wizards:

“The one name that I’ve heard recently is Bradley Beal as another guy that they want,. I’m not sure if the interest is as mutual. You know Beal, it seems like Miami would be more of the threat to take him away from Washington. I don’t think you can also rule out Boston either because of his relationship with Jayson Tatum, but the Lakers are trying to angle for some moves like that using the Russ expiring and the ’27 and the ’29 firsts.”

Getting a player of Beal’s caliber would be an amazing accomplishment for Rob Pelinka and the Lakers front office if they were able to pull it off. Turning Westbrook’s contract into someone like Beal, who is an All-Star level player capable of creating his own shot and would seem to fit well with LeBron James and Anthony Davis, would truly be amazing.
