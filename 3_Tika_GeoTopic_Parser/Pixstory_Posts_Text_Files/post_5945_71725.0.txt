Remembering the greatest - late Muhammad Ali on his birthday January 17 (He was born in 1942), I am sharing my article written on the day he left for heavenly abode - June 3, 2016. 
The article is about how ‘Ali’s knockout punch proved to be a life changer’ for an upcoming Indian boxer. 

Muhammad Ali’s first visit to India in 1980 proved to be life-changing for Rocky Brass, an upcoming boxer from Chennai (then Madras).

“Ali was in Chennai with American great Jimmy Ellis and I got an opportunity to box with him. The bout lasted less than a minute and his punch was enough to knock me out, but I lived my greatest moments in those 50-55 seconds,” told Brass.

“After the bout, Ali mentioned me in his speech and said I had potential. The words of appreciation changed my life and I was offered a job in the Railways,” he added.

The exhibition bout took place on January 31, and on April 7, Rocky was appointed a khalasi in Southern Railways. In 2016 Brass was working as a mail express guard at Perambur station.

“The Nehru stadium was filled to capacity and everybody had bought tickets, which is unusual for a sport like boxing in India,” said Brass, whose official name is Rochester Cloves.

Ali visited Delhi, Bombay (Mumbai), Madras and Calcutta (Kolkata). “His visit was related to the boycott of the Moscow Olympics by America and he wanted India to join in,” said Brass, who runs a boxing club ‘Crusader’.

Brass became the Tamil Nadu state champion in 1978 and was one of the best amateurs when Ali visited the city. Initially, he was chosen for a bout with Ali’s sparring partner Ellis.

“As per the programme, Ali was to give tips to kids, but (then Tamil Nadu) Chief Minister MG Ramachandran, who was the chief guest, was keen to watch Ali box, so there was a change in the schedule & Jimmy had an exhibition fight with Ali. As I was wearing gloves, after the bout I asked Ali if I could fight him,” recalled Brass.
