For the expansive Marvel Cinematic Universe Kamala Khan aka Ms Marvel is a ground breaking figure It s what she stands for a Pakistani American high school student from New Jersey who transforms into a superhero in stark contrast to the original Avengers which made its debut with a cast made up entirely of white people The producers of Ms Marvel took the opportunity to educate a large swath of the audience on the tragic partition of India and Pakistan in The Indian Independence Act of drew geographical boundaries on a map but the real life effects were dominated by a separation of religion Numerous millions of people were relocated lost their homes or were forcibly torn from from their families as a result of the widespread violence some estimates put the death toll at high to two million The partition of India and partition was front and center on Disney s new show Ms Marvel It was a significant part of Kamala Khan s origin story Sana Amanat the show s co creator talked about what it was like to center this important history in the show Many Marvel employees were unaware of partition Their curiosity in its existence led them to ask Why don t we know about this I believe they were genuinely fascinated by the fact that it existed Just a few days before the th anniversary of partition which is observed on August Amanat declared in an Instagram Live interview This is ridiculous So there was undoubtedly a lot of education that needed to be obtained We came to the conclusion that this story needed to be shared The mere fact that we completed it is a triumph in and of itself Parts of the movie Partition were shot in Thailand and Atlanta and more was shot in Pakistan Hundreds of extras can be seen in the scenes searching for their families or a spot on a train as they head to their new homes Kamala says everyone pulled on great resources to ensure the story was authentic and historically accurate
