A topic with question mark? Must be an answer to something, of course that comes to mind. I won't think of it as an answer. Rather it is more of an exploration. How can I explain myself without actual facts of my existence? We'll know!

Let's see,

1) Am I an emotional person?

Won't my family and friends answer that better? They get this privilege cause they are there to lend the very shoulder I cry my eyes out on. So, to sum it up, am an emotional person.

2) Am I an empathetic person?

Once upon a time, there happened a fight, being the spectator and related to both involved, I was the one to cry. If that's not empathy, I don't know what is!

3) Am I a selfish person?

Yes I am. I don't think "selflessness" can appear in the purest forms. That's of course my opinion. This is the opinion that leads me to believe, I am selfish. I am selfish for my family, friends and everyone or evrything that matters to me. 

4) Am I an honest person?

I am. No matter how much I try to run from truth, it is never a good idea. I have learnt that the hard way. I am never forgetting that lesson. I have always been truthful to others. Only lies I made up were for me. And that's not good. Been there did it. Never again.  

Apart from the very basics above. I am also an avid reader. I love reading autobiographies, biographies, philosophy, deep-rooted romance etc. Among many of my cherished hobbies is singing. This is the newest of the additions into my life's caravan. That's all I can come up with currently and this exploration was fruitful definitely!
