World Poetry Day, which takes place every year on March 21, honours one of humanity's most cherished forms of cultural and linguistic expression and identity. Poetry, which has been practised throughout history in every culture and on every continent, appeals to our common humanity and shared values, transforming even the most simple poems into potent catalysts for debate and peace. 

UNESCO designated March 21 as World Poetry Day at its 30th General Conference in Paris in 1999, with the goal of promoting linguistic diversity via poetic expression and enhancing the visibility of endangered languages. 

World Poetry Day is an opportunity to honour poets, revive oral poetry recital traditions, encourage poetry reading, writing, and teaching, stimulate the confluence of poetry with other arts such as theatre, dance, music, and painting, and increase poetry's presence in the media. Everyone is welcome to participate as poetry continues to bring people together across continents.
