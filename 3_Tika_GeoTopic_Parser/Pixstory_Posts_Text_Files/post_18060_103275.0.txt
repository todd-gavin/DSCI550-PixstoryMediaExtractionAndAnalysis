She’s one of Hollywood’s leading funny ladies, but in her personal life, Bell has battled depression and anxiety — and she has no qualms talking about it. She penned her own essay on her experiences with mental health disorders for Motto, a platform from the editors of Time magazine. Her words made headlines across the globe, shattering the stigma about mental health and showing how mental illness can take many forms.

In her essay, Bell wrote: “There is such an extreme stigma about mental health issues, and I can’t make heads or tails of why it exists. Anxiety and depression are impervious to accolades or achievements. Anyone can be affected, despite their level of success or their place on the food chain. In fact, there is a good chance you know someone who is struggling with it since nearly 20 percent of American adults face some form of mental illness in their lifetime. So why aren’t we talking about it?”
