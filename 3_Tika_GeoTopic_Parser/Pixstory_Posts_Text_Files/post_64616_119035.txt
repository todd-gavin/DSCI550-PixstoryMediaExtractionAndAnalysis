Ranbir kapoor starrer Shamshera released on july estimates Rs crore at the end of its theatrical run Shamshera was released across screens in the hope it could garner a handsome opening I feel that content needs to be blamed instead of actors or co actors The movie is heading toward the flop tag which is very upset thing to directors actors and ranbir lovers Shamshera is the second widest release of the post pandemic era and is playing in over theatres which means that occupancy on day one has been very low The film has a tough road ahead But it s totally okay because we learn from our failures and our drawbacks Definitely it is going to give ranbir a good lesson that would help him in his future As we all know comebacks are better than the setbacks Ranbir kapoor surely is going to comeback strongerr
