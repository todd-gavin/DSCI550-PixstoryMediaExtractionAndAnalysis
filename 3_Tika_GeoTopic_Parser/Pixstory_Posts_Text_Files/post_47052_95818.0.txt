After being accused of being "disrespectful" to women's football, the organizers of this summer's
European Championship defended their decision to hold some matches in smaller stadiums.

Sara Björk Gunnarsdóttir, an Iceland international, has criticized the fact that three group
matches will be held at Manchester City Academy Stadium, which seats only 4,700 people. 

She
has referred to the venue—where City's women play their WSL home games—as a "training
ground."

Ticket sales for the tournament have been strong, with Uefa revealing earlier this week that
eight matches have already sold out, prompting criticism that the organizers should have
chosen larger venues.

The opening match between England and Austria at Old Trafford and the final at Wembley are
both sold-out, as are both of Iceland's group games at the Manchester City Academy Stadium,
the tournament's smallest venue, prompting Gunnarsdottir to call the situation "just
embarrassing" in an interview with the Their Pitch podcast.

A spokeswoman for Euro 2022 said that Manchester City Academy is not a training ground. It is
Manchester City Women's Football Club's official home stadium.

Iceland's two opening matches, as well as six other Euro 2022 matches, have already sold out,
demonstrating the tournament's strong level of interest.

"We believe that the right mix of stadiums has been chosen to provide the tournament with a
platform to fulfill its potential, with two of England's largest football stadiums (Old Trafford and
Wembley), four venues with a capacity of 30,000 or more, two venues over 10,000, and two
stadiums under 10,000."

"We are certain that many matches will be sold out, and we are looking forward to more than
tripling the total attendance of UEFA Women's Euro 2017 in the Netherlands and delivering the
best UEFA Women's Euro ever," said the UEFA Women's Euro 2017 organizing committee.
