The word "sushi" means "sour taste" referring to the vinegar rice used in this delicacy. 
Sushi's origins can be traced back to paddy fields where fish was fermented with rice, vinegar, salt, and other ingredients before being eaten. Around the Yayoi period (early Neolithic–early Iron Age), the dish was developed in Japan and is now known as narezushi. During the Muromachi era (1336–1573), people started eating both rice and fish. Vinegar started to replace fermented rice during the Edo era (1603–1867). The dish has grown to be a type of cuisine closely linked to Japanese culture. 
 Hanaya Yohei popularised nigiri-zushi, which is a style of sushi in which seafood is served over hand-pressed vinegared rice.
