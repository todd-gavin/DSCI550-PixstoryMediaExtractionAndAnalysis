As far as Crystal Palace is concerned, their French gaffer did a notable job in helping the red and blue outfit finish 12 th with 48 points in the bag.

Manchester United vs Crystal Palace:Prediction

The side hailing from Old Trafford will be heading into the game as favorites while Crystal Palace will look to bounce back from their 2-0 defeat to Liverpool on Friday. However, United emerged as 4-0 winners in their game against Klopp’s men and followed it up with a win against Melbourne Victory.

With Anthony Martial in fine goal-scoring form in pre-season and the likes of Jadon Sancho and Fred impressing their Dutch gaffer, United have looked threatening from the word go. On theother hand, Palace are missing key players due to injury but have a decent enough squad to give their opponents a run for their money.

Prediction: Manchester United 4 - 1 Crystal Palace
