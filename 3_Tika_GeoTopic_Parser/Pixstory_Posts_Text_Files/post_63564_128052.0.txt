WB Games Montreal’s upcoming action RPG multiplayer game, Gotham Knights is all the rage right now. After the massive success of the Arkham games it seemed impossible for WB to make any DC game that could be as good. While the game is still not out yet, it looks good.
 
Featuring a new storyline, Gotham Knights is set in a different world where the Dark Knight is dead and the Bat Family : Nightwing – Dick Grayson, Robin – Tim Drake, Batgirl – Barbara Gordon and Red Hood – Jason Todd must take care of the crime infested city in his absence.
 
The player gets to pick one of Batman’s proteges and go ham smashing on the criminals of Gotham city. Going under the Red Hood, WB Games recently unveiled the gameplay for Red Hood, breaking down his gameplay mechanics.
 
While Todd is known as the rogue of the family who decided to use lethal force on his enemies, he since then agreed to adhere to Batman’s one rule about killing, and as a result of that, he’ll be brutal but won’t kill anyone. The guns you wield in the game are filled with non lethal rounds, while Todd's other  gear will break the bones of his enemies, but will not kill them.
 
 
 For the video in question Game Director Geoff Ellenor explained, that by using the different skill trees available in the game for a single character, players can create a wide range of gameplay loops for their selected superhero.
 
We see Red Hood in co-op wielding two skills, one of them is on Red Hood’s Marksman skill tree, while the other one is using the Brawler skill tree. The Marksman skill tree focuses mainly on Red Hood’s ranged combat giving them monstrous long range abilities whereas the Brawler mode focuses more on hand-to-hand combat making the Red Hood a force to reckon with in close quarters combat.
 
Gotham Knights will give the players freedom to upgrade both trees at the same time, or just follow one path– whatever path they choose is entirely up to the player.
