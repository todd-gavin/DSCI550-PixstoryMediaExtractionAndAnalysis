There are times in life when we find ourselves in the midst of nowhere and don't find anything worthwhile ! This chaos doesn't solve any of our problems but just goes on increasing them . With numerous questions , we keep juggling between making things better for ourselves and settling for what we have after failing to make them better . We keep looking for answers because we wonder what all we could have done to make things work out the way we had expected . But , in this process , we forget how normal it is to not know every answer and fetch them with patience instead !
Giving up is always an easy option but it is never worth it . Failing at finding answers might make you feel to give up or stop trying . But you have to ensure that you keep looking for them until you find them ! And by finding these answers , you will be able to find your lost self back ! 
Once you patiently think about things that have happened to you , you will realize how important it is to get lost at times only to find ourselves back . Of course , there is no reason to locate something positive in every terrible thing but knowing why it happened the way it did is important . 
So , bear patience and keep finding answers to all your questions . You don't have to know everything beforehand because that's how we learn but you have to ensure that you don't give up on yourself ever ! ❤️✨
