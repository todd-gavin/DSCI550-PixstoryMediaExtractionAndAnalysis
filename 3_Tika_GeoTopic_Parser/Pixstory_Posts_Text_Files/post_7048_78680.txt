The Probe Investigation continues There is no point in just having the law in place In law you have to give evidence and strong proof before a court of law We need to prove and back it up with evidence that the breach has happened along with the details related to the source of the breach It is very longwinded and very difficult to prove in many cases because of the limited scope of the existing laws that we have Because of which most of the time the case goes in favour of the people who have carried out these data breaches The public health infrastructure security systems in India are vulnerable to data breaches and cyber attacks India still does not have any dedicated cyber security law in place We still have the Information Technology Act of which is the main law and there are small binary provisions for cyber security under this main law and these provisions only contain cosmetic laws which in reality is not suited for the entire gamut of cyber security related problems that we face today The Guidelines for Indian Government Websites GIGW Compliance a document that lists compliance matrices has clear rules on the quality control security audit maintenance checks that have to be performed on government websites It is clear from the data leak that happened recently that these compliance matrices were not diligently followed Nevertheless after the data leak was flagged by IT security experts and reported by the media some measures were put in place by removing a few pages and denying unauthorised access to a few other pages However it is far from being fully rectified since much of the sensitive data is still accessible and with such massive amounts of data being now indexed by google removing all the data from the internet is going to be a gargantuan task To be continued
