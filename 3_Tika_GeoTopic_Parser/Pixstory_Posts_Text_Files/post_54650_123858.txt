Climate change can exacerbate a full of the infectious diseases that humans come in contact with worldwide from common waterborne viruses to deadly diseases like plague our new research shows Our team of environment and health scientists reviewed decades of scientific papers on all known pathogenic disease pathogens to create a map of the human risks aggravated by climate related hazards The numbers were jarring Of human diseases we found that of them well over half can be affected by climate change Flooding for example can spread hepatitis Rising temperatures can expand the life of mosquitoes carrying malaria Droughts can bring rodents infected with hantavirus into communities as they search for food With climate change influencing more than transmission pathways like those and climate hazards increasingly globally we concluded that expecting societies to successfully adapt to all of them isn t a realistic option The world will need to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving climate change to reduce these risks Mapping climate health hazards To be able to prevent global health crises humanity needs a comprehensive understanding of the pathways and the magnitude with which climate change might affect pathogenic diseases We focused on climate related hazards linked to rising greenhouse gas emissions atmospheric warming heat waves drought wildfires heavy precipitation flooding storms sea level rise ocean warming and land cover change Then we looked for studies discussing specific and quantifiable observations of human disease occurrences linked to those hazards In total we reviewed over scientific papers Of those papers had a climatic hazard affecting a specific disease in an explicit place and or time allowing us to create a database of climatic hazards transmission pathways pathogens and diseases An interactive map of every pathway between hazard and pathogen is available online Resd more
