Kieran Tierney's 2021-22 season has likely come to a dismal and unexpected end, confirms boss Mikel Arteta. The Spaniard saw his team lose 3-0 at Selhurst Park on Monday night, and broke the news about the left-back's injury soon after the defeat.

This long term injury doesn't look good, and is the first such injury in his professional career so far. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta confirms the same.

"He is seeing the specialist tomorrow and we will know more the extent of the injury," said Arteta.

"But the feeling that he had it wasn't really positive and what the scans showed either, but we have to wait and see what happens."

This is not good news, especially in this part of the season. Tierney has mastered the art of overlapping on the left flank and functioning almost as a fourth midfielder sometimes in Arteta's formations. Nuno Tavares, the young Portuguese played 45 minutes against Palace but lacked confidence, match fitness and was error prone.

Tierney on the other hand, started 15 straight games for the North Londoners prior to injury whilst on International duty, managing the full 90 in 12 of those matches. He's truly developed into one of the more mature, direct and capable full backs in the country.

With Tierney in the Starting Eleven:

P: 60 - W: 31 - D: 11 - L: 18

Points per game: 1.48 
Win rate: 40% | Loss rate: 31.1%

Arsenal's record with and without the Scotsman since his 2019 arrival is indicative of just how important his presence is.
