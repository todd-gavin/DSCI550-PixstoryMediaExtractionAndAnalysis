Free kick goals add color to the beautiful game of football. Those curving balls falling slowly into the net beyond the reach of the stretching goalkeeper is a sight to watch, which fills any fan's heart. To score such goals, players need to be precise and need the right technique and skills along with practice. Direct goal scoring depends on a few other aspects too, like position , distance from goal etc. 

As the count of direct free kicks are coming low from season to season, one player stands out and goes up in the list of legendary free kick goal scorers in Premier League history. Southampton's James Ward Prowse is in second position with 12 goals, along with Thierry Henry(258 Matches), Gianfranco Zola(229 Matches ). David Bekham leads the list with 18 free kick goals(265 matches). 

The English player who has featured only for Southampton in his entire career has the best free kick conversion rate since 2003. Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola has praised him as the "best free kick taker I have seen". The Southampton captain has achieved this from 293 league matches. The 27 year old player celebrated his 26th birthday with 2 amazing free kick goals, similar to the first, against Aston Villa at Villa Park. 

Also, Ward Prowse is the first ever player to play every minute of two consecutive seasons in the Premier league. He has also scored 2 goals for England from 9 matches. He has scored 1 or more free kick goals consistently since the 2015/16 season. He is the only player to score more than 1 in multiple seasons -

2018/19 -2
