President JOE BIDEN has stated that he would seek reelection in 2024. If he doesn't, Vice President KAMALA HARRIS is in the best position to lead the party. 

Politico reported that that isn't only because she is the first in line for the presidency at the moment. It's because, despite a first year marred by poor news and a few unforced blunders, she has built a big early lead among Black voters, who have been the crucial constituency in Democratic primary battles through 2008, 2016, and 2020. 

A poll released last month by the Republican firm Echelon Insights put Harris' support among Black voters at 53%, with challenger STACEY ABRAMS coming in second. A spokesman for Abrams directed us to previous campaign statements denying that she will run for president in 2024.

It's a stark contrast to Harris' difficulty to win over Black people during her own presidential race in 2019, and it gives the VP a solid Democratic constituency at a time when there's growing concern about the Democratic Party's leadership's future. 

Following the release of these polls, Democratic pollster CORNELL BELCHER predicted that Biden would run for re-election. He also warned that polls obtained this early should be regarded with "a large grain of salt." "I am shocked at how she is running away from the field with African American voters this early on, because I have not seen it," Belcher, author of "A Black Man in the White House," said.
