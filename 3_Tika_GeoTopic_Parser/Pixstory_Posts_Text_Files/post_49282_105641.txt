I was scrolling through my socials just because and came through this thread that aas discussing The Beatles and one of those said that Hey Jude is too long I personally never felt like that It is a long song definitely But not too long The Beatles have always been like that they like pushing boundaries Hey Jude s melody and arrangement are strong enough to carry the song for seven minutes and more I d say the length is just right because it remains concise It for me is like an anthem It was is and always will be exactly where it should have been Yes as previously said they frequently stretched the boundaries But I don t believe they were doing it intentionally in this case They were simply saying what they intended to say and it took them SEVEN MINUTES to do it That s how they pushed the envelope in and of itself
