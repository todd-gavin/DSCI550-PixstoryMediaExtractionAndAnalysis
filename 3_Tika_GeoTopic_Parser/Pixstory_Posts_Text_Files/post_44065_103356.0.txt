Legendary Arsenal striker Thierry Henry believes that Karim Benzema is set to win the Ballon d’Or after a stellar 2021-22 campaign for the French striker. The legendary duo of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have shared the awards between themselves 13 times out of the last 14 years. 

Benzema has enjoyed an amazing season individually and collectively. With 27 goals & 12 assists in La Liga, and 15 goals & 2 assists in the Champions League, he guided Real Madrid to success in both competitions. The former Arsenal striker said that the Ballon d’Or voting should be closed - and no one comes close to the season Benzema has had this year. While covering the final for CBS Sports, Henry had to say, “I just wanted to say something for France Football or whoever is voting. Close the votes, Benzema won it. Bye”

France National team manager Didier Deschamps has also expressed support for the idea. On being asked if Benzema should be awared the Ballon d’Or, Deschamps had to say, “The answer is simple: yes. This new title and the sporting season achieved with his team, and what he was able to do, he was so decisive.

Obviously, he was already one of the favourites and he deserves amply this reward."

Talking to Canal Plus about the extraordinary season and prospect of winning the Ballon D’Or, Benzema had to say, “Obviously, I finished my season, now I will join up with the national team. I think at club level I can't do better. We'll see what happens but in any case I'm proud of what I've achieved."

If he were to be snubbed again, Benzema said that would not slow him down. Benzema became one of the eight Real Madrid players to win the Champions League 5 times, beating Liverpool 1-0 in the final. The Frenchmen would be ready to do it all over next season.
