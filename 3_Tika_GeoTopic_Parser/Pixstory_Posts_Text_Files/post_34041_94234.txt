Aurelio Andreazzoli analyzes the bad defeat against Udinese Today we lost, we missed the result, this weighs this We had other expectations for today We faced a team in confidence and strong both physically and tactically We paid for this Ultimately if we look at the numbers in the match, they are in balance but it&#39;s not the numbers that indicate the result it&#39;s the various moments the duels We have to look at the next game not at the next season many think so it&#39;s not just you asking the question I&#39;m very attentive to details we haven&#39;t done anything yet we&#39;ve lost so many opportunities to close the talks
