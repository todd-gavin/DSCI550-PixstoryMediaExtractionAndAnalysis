Sepak takraw
This new sport is similar to volleyball because it involves passing a ball between two teams and scoring points when it touches the opponent’s ground. Three contacts are allowed between the 3 teammates of each team who take place at the same time on the ground which is, itself, separated by a net. The major difference between the two sports is that the arms and hands are totally forbidden, so you have to use the feet, head, knees or other to play. Also, the same player can make 2 contacts in a row without being penalized so it leads to different plays. It’s definitely a strange sport that promises.
