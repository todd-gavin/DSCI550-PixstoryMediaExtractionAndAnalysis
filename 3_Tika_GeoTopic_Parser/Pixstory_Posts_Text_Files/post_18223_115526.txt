Earlier this week Kim Kardashian and daughter North West sat front row at the Jean Paul Gaultier Fall Winter fashion show North went viral after she was snapped holding up a handwritten sign that said STOP to the people taking her pictures Recently North has also gone viral for confronting paparazzi for always waiting for her and her mom outside places The super meme able moment was everywhere so much that Kim tweeted about the backstory For anyone who knows North knows how funny she finds this video Kim said North I guess had it with the people taking pictures of her so she wrote on her invite STOP and held it up and wanted them to just focus on the show People were basically like OK then why bring her somewhere she s clearly not comfortable Kim hasn t responded to these critiques
