Football fans gather please I have always believed that sports is apolitical and bringing any diplomacy to the game is a disrespect to it The core values of any sports are teamwork and dignity and any iota of politics taints these virtues However it seems that this is not the conventional way of thinking The most politically heated of confrontations on the field in Qatar has been conjured up by a World Cup buildup loaded with controversy and geopolitical connotations US News reported that the United States will face Iran just as it did in the FIFA World Cup final despite the fact that diplomatic relations between the two countries have yet to be restored since they were cut in Part II of The Mother of All Games A political group but I m not political Iran s Croatian coach Dragan Skocic said I focus on football I think this is the best way in sport and also we should give people the chance to make the situation better The hope is for a replication of the calm surrounding the match in France when the Iranians presented their American opponents with white roses before prevailing It s years later from and further removed from the s and both nations have evolved tremendously since then U S coach Gregg Berhalter said For us it s a soccer game Let s see what happens next
