Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk buys Twitter for $44 billion. 
Twitter which has been a platform for online discourse and free speech for more than 16 years, is now in the hands of a new owner.
The only question that evokes in everyone's mind is what justice would Mr Musk do to eradicate this platform's problems that have repeatedly come into controversies for its prejudices. 

Twitter has many problems, including the spread of fake news, misleading information and other prejudices; dealing with all of that would need someone who indiscriminately thinks in favour of people rather than being biased for his benefit.

But Mr Musk also has many problems, either for putting out misleading financial information or his racial issues, which was seen when some Tesla workers complained to the press of racialised degradation. Nevertheless, there has never been a time when he was not surrounded by subjects that did not portray him as a hero.

Well, the new deal would lay its results in just some years where it could be seen how Twitter has been made a space free of prejudices and problems or rather is turned into a more chaotic social media platform.
