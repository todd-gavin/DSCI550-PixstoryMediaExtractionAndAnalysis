Last week a study from UCLA found that long term meditators had better preserved brains than non meditators as they aged Participants who d been meditating for an average of years had more grey matter volume throughout the brain although older meditators still had some volume loss compared to younger meditators it wasn t as pronounced as the non meditators We expected rather small and distinct effects located in some of the regions that had previously been associated with meditating said study author Florian Kurth Instead what we actually observed was a widespread effect of meditation that encompassed regions throughout the entire brain There you have it kids if you don t want to forget important things of your life you better start meditating
