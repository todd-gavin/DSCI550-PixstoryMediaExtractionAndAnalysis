Roger Federer made a long-awaited return to Centre Court to celebrate its 100th anniversary on Sunday, receiving a standing ovation from the crowd in what was already a legend-studded affair.

Emceed by Sue Barker and John McEnroe, Centre Court’s Centennial featured a parade of former champions, from Rafael Nadal and Rod Laver to Venus Williams and Bjorn Borg. 

Six-time winners Billie Jean King and Novak Djokovic emerged as a pair before Federer took his unexpected stroll into the stadium. 

The former world No. 1 was last on Centre Court when he reached the quarterfinals of the 2021 Championships and endured a three-set defeat to Hubert Hurkacz.

We can all agree that it was absolutely amazing to see Federer back on court
