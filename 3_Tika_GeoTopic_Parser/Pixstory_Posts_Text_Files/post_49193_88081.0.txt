The operator of Burger King's 800 outlets in Russia has "refused" to close them, despite the company's desire to halt operations following the invasion of Ukraine, according to the company's owner.

Restaurant Brands International (RBI), which owns Burger King, announced last week that it has halted all supply chain, operational, and marketing support for the Russian operation.

RBI, the parent business, is unable to do so due to a complex legal agreement with the key partner.

"We contacted the main operator of the business and demanded the suspension of Burger King restaurant operations in Russia,” RBI President David Shear issued a statement and a letter to staff, "He has refused to do so. Would we like to suspend all Burger King operations immediately in Russia? Yes. Are we able to enforce a suspension of operations today? No."

Any attempt to impose termination now, according to Shears, would require the approval of Russian officials.

“There are no legal clauses that allow us to unilaterally change the contract or allow any one of the partners to simply walk away or overturn the entire agreement,” he said, "No serious investor in any industry in the world would agree to a long-term business relationship with flimsy termination clauses. This is exactly why we say it’s a complicated legal process. We know that will not practically happen any time soon. This is also why you may see other brands in Russia with similar structures continue to operate in the market."

The question now is how much of this assertion is true. Is it an attempt to conceal the obvious, or the beginning of a new Russian Revolution?
