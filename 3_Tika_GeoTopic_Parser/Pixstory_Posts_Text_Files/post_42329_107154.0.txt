Today, the whole world is celebrating World Blood Donor Day and spreading awareness about how important it is to donate blood and why you should donate blood at least once in your lifetime.

So, if I talk about myself,  I got inspiration from Cristiano Ronaldo and after watching his interview, I realised that as a responsible citizen I should donate blood at least once a year.

To date, I donated blood three times and every time it was so random because the first time I donated blood in Connaught Place while having a walk with friends, and the second time I donated blood on my college premises on the occasion of Womenâ€™s Day and third time I went to Gurudwara Bangla Sahib and donated the blood there as Rotary Event was going on.

After donating the blood, I felt proud because deep inside my mind I thought that my blood will come into use for people who are facing medical difficulties in their life.

So, at last, I want to say that please donate blood once in your lifetime and I guarantee you one thing that you will feel proud of yourself.
