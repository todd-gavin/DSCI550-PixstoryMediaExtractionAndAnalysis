1 - It takes a long time to donate blood.
The whole process from start to finish only takes about an hour and involves three easy steps: registration, a health check and the blood donation itself. 

2 - It will hurt to donate blood.
Only for a moment, and only a tiny bit (at least, that’s what our donors tell us). You’ll feel the first stick of the needle, but you shouldn’t feel any pain after that. Some frequent blood donors even tell us they’ve gotten so used to the feeling that they barely notice the needle anymore.

3. I have a tattoo, so I can’t give blood
Tattoo has no such relation in this. It is no where will cause the harm to anyone.In the majority of states, you may give blood immediately after getting a tattoo if you got it in a shop that is state-regulated.

4 - I don't have a rare blood type, so my blood donation isn't really needed
Only 7% of the population has O negative blood, but 38% of the population has O positive blood. No matter what your blood type is, it is needed and valuable. Every two seconds someone in our country needs blood. Every single blood type is vital to saving lives.

5 - I'm too old to donate
There is no maximum age limit for donating blood. You can donate starting at age 17 or 16 and can then donate for the rest of your life as long as you are eligible otherwise. 

6 - I’m on medication, so I can’t give blood
The reason that you were prescribed the medication could disqualify you, but if the condition is under control and you are healthy, donations are usually allowed. There are a handful of drugs that may involve a waiting period to donate after the last dose is taken, however. 

7 - I have high blood pressure, so it’s too dangerous for me to donate blood
You can donate blood as long as your blood pressure is below 180 systolic (top number) and below 100 diastolic (bottom number) at the time of donation.
