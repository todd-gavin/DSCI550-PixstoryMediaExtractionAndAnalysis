Being a GenZ student and an intern I would deny the fact that I practically dwell in the world in the world of internet. While my grandmother and parents though enjoy the reels and the Whatsapp socialising, television still remains a major part of their lives for absorbing information. I am an OTT viewer but I usually do get to watch some snippets of some daily soaps and ads that run during the break that my grandmother watches. Here are 5  ads that made me glad as they featured women equality

Witnessing his daughter under so much load he delves into his past behaviour and feels guilty that he never helped his wife and set a wrong example for his daughter.
