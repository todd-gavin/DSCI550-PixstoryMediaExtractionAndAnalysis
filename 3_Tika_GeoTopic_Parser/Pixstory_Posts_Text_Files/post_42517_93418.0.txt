Just watched the match between Real Madrid and Chelsea where Chelsea won the match by a 2-3 scoreline but Real Madrid qualify for the semifinals on 5-4 aggregate and after watching this match I must say that WHAT.A.GAME of football it was.

First 70 minutes of the match, Real Madrid was chasing the shadows and don’t have any clue what to do. Madrid Players were trying everything on the pitch but Chelsea players came prepared.

Till the 80th minute of the match, Chelsea was on the brink to reach into semifinal on an aggregate of 3-4 but after that, we all saw the magical assist from Luka Modric, and Rodrygo scored the first goal for Real Madrid, and equalize the aggregate score to 4-4.

After that, the match went to extra time and Real Madrid saw the linkup between Vinicius and Karim Benzema which where they expecting (of course) and because of that link-up, Benzema scored the goal in the 96th minute and increase the aggregate score to 5-4.

The last 24 minutes of the match were a roller coaster ride for both the team fans because players from both the teams are fighting to secure the win and players were attacking relentlessly.

Chelsea’s clinicality in front of the goal became the major difference in the game because if they would have converted those chances, Real Madrid fans aren’t celebrating right now.

Neutral fans will be happy after watching this match was full of entertainment, full of emotions, full of ups and downs, and full of goals.

Chelsea fans will be thinking that they were this close to eliminating Real Madrid but Chelsea players went to sleep for 26 minutes and when they woke up, the game was already over.

As a Real Madrid, I am thinking that anyhow we reached the semifinals but we are far away from playing the best football as compared to Manchester City, which can be the team which we will face in the semifinals.
