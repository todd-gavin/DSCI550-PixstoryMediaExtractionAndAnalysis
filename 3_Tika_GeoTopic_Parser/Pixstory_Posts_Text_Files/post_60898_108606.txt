Yet another best show disney gave us Such an amazing show and actors were so natural especially i love Rohan singh character it was crazy show but they showed how time flies and how you need to handle from child to teenage and being an adult you grow you learn you figure out things and most importantly to live the life of your age in your age because its never going to comeback This show is relatable sometimes too I m just really wishing that th season of this show will be made
