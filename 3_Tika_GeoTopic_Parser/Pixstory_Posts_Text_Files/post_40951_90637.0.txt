Lusia Harris' storey keeps getting better: it's now won an Oscar. Shaquille O'Neal can now brag about being an Oscar winner, just like his former Los Angeles Lakers colleague Kobe Bryant did four years ago in a different category. 

"The Queen of Basketball" received the Academy Award for short subject documentary on Sunday, with two basketball legends, Shaquille O'Neal and Stephen Curry, serving as executive producers and main marketers of the 22-minute film. 

US News reported that it comes just two months after the passing of Harris, who was the first woman to be drafted by an NBA franchise and made the first basket in Olympic women's basketball history. The short, directed by Ben Proudfoot, taught even the most devoted basketball fans about the storey of the trailblazer.

“If there is anyone out there that still doubts whether there's an audience for female athletes and questions whether their stories are valuable or entertaining or important … let this Academy Award be the answer,” Proudfoot said at the award ceremony in Los Angeles.

Harris, like O'Neal, is a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. But even the four-time NBA champion, widely regarded as one of the game's all-time greats, had never heard of her. 

"At first, I had no idea who she was," O'Neal admitted earlier this month. 

Only a few did. 

However, the film and O'Neal and Curry's involvement — Curry wore sneakers with the slogan "Queen Lucy" imprinted on them earlier this month — helped her storey be shared more and more.
