For one night it seemed to relive Tokyo After Marcell Jacobs Gianmarco Tamberi also won gold in the high jump A non-trivial victory given that he came from a fourth place in the world championships and a forced rest period due to Covid Instead Tamberi was stronger than everything and all jumping at the second attempt after four perfect jumps up to what moment Another difficulty was the rain but the German Potye and the Ukrainian Protsenko second and third respectively could not do better than him What a very difficult race he said at the end of the awards ceremony When I saw it starting to rain I knew it wasn&#39;t the best conditions for me I&#39;m a speed jumper and a slide in the wet But I said to myself today or never I have to give everything after what I&#39;ve been through I&#39;m very happy Through the obstacles I push myself to jump I made them more beautiful with Italy this blue gives me an impressive charge
