By education Pragnya Mohan is a qualified CA By passion a triathlete We can t stop admiring her glorious win in triathlon in national games She said some of the inspiring lines post her win The sport has taught me that one must be consistent in training My best performances have come only when I have trained for long spells I see the results when I am dedicated to the sport over time It does not work for me when I try and have intensive training over just a month or two
