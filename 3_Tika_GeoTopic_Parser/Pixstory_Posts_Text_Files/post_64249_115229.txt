My mother always tells me the only constant thing in our lives is change And parting with people is the change which we all experience at every stage of our life Letting people go from your life isn t easy but it is inevitable I know that when someone leaves you it isn t the end of the world but saying goodbye to someone is challenging In all my past experiences it has been hard for me to let people go which is a big problem because even today I have this constant fear of how that person will just go away and I won t be able to do anything but just sit there and accept the reality because apparently REALITY CAN T BE CHANGED I remember that when I changed states due to my father s job it was so tough for me to get separated from my grandparents and school friends Although their memories were with me and it was just a provisional partition just getting accustomed to the fact that they are no longer with me was a hard task Also leaving the safety and security of the environment I lived in and I d come to rely on for such a long time didn t seem a great idea didn t it Even though saying goodbyes is not my cup of tea but I think that goodbyes have garnered a rather negative connotation in our society over the course of time people hate it but there can be another way a more positive way to perceive them too Looking at it from a different perspective it also makes us realize just how blessed our lives have been TO THE JOURNEYS WE HAVE SHARED WITH SOME WONDERFUL PEOPLE THE MEMORIES WE MADE THE INVALUABLE EXPERIENCES WHICH WE ALL TAKE FOR GRANTED WE OFTEN IGNORE THESE MOMENTS HOWEVER IT HAS TAUGHT US HOW OUR LIFE DOESN T JUST WAIT FOR ANYONE AND TO MOVE ON WITH OUR LIFE WITH THOSE FOND MEMORIES The finality associated with saying goodbyes is challenging for sure yet it is an empowering word which has given us the life lessons of achieving closure and moving on with our lives
