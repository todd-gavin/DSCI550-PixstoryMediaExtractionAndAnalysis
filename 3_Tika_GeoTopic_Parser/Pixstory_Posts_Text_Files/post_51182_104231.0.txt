What are the drawbacks to napping?

Napping isn't for everyone. Some people simply can't sleep during the day or have trouble sleeping in places other than their own beds, which napping sometimes requires.

Napping can also have negative effects, such as:

-Sleep inertia. You might feel groggy and disoriented after waking up from a nap.
-Nighttime sleep problems. Short naps generally don't affect nighttime sleep quality for most people. 

So itâ€™s important to take nap accordingly.
