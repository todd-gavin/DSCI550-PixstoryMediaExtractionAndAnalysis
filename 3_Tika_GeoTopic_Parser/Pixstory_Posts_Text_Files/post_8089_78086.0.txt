Bi Bi Nasimah, who served in the air force of the former government, says that after the political change in the country she lost her job and poverty and unemployment have forced her to beg in the streets of Kabul.

“I served in the air force of the previous government for a year and a half, my husband also served in the government for 15 years, but now, unfortunately, he has lost his job and has become mentally ill,” she said.

According to Nasima, her children were at school last year, but now they are deprived of an education and beg for food with her in the streets of Kabul.

“There is no one to work for us, we are the ones who work, my mother and father are sick and we are begging, “said Asma, Nasima’s little daughter.

“My dad is ill, I want to study, we have no one to bring us food and I am begging,” said Shazia, Nasima’s small daughter.

Shahbaz Khan, Nasima’s husband, is also begging.

He was a soldier in the former Afghanistan National Army (ANA), and said that the hardship over time has left him mentally ill.

“I served in the ANA for 15 years as an officer. I served in Kandahar, Paktia, Takhar and Kunduz. Now I can’t work and there is no opportunity for work,” he said.

Most of these former force members say that they face many economic challenges and they ask the Islamic Emirate to recruit them to the security forces.
