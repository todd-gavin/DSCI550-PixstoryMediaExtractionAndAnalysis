Post exercise recovery for the endurance athlete with type diabetes a consensus statement Sam N Scott PhD Federico Y Fontana PhD Matt Cocks PhD Prof James P Morton PhD Prof Asker Jeukendrup PhD Radu Dragulin MD ProfJ rgen F P Wojtaszewski PhD Prof J rgen Jensen PhD Rafael Castol MD Prof Michael C Riddell PhD Prof Christoph Stettler MD Summary There has been substantial progress in the knowledge of exercise and type diabetes with the development of guidelines for optimal glucose management In addition an increasing number of people living with type diabetes are pushing their physical limits to compete at the highest level of sport However the post exercise recovery routine particularly with a focus on sporting performance has received little attention within the scientific literature with most of the focus being placed on insulin or nutritional adaptations to manage glycaemia before and during the exercise bout The post exercise recovery period presents an opportunity for maximising training adaption and recovery and the clinical management of glycaemia through the rest of the day and overnight The absence of clear guidance for the post exercise period means that people with type diabetes should either develop their own recovery strategies on the basis of individual trial and error or adhere to guidelines that have been developed for people without diabetes This Review provides an up to date consensus on post exercise recovery and glucose management for individuals living with type diabetes We aim to outline the principles and time course of post exercise recovery highlighting the implications and challenges for endurance athletes living with type diabetes provide an overview of potential strategies for post exercise recovery that could be used by athletes with type diabetes to optimise recovery and adaptation alongside improved glycaemic monitoring and management and highlight the potential for technology to ease the burden of managing glycaemia in the post exercise recovery period Sources
