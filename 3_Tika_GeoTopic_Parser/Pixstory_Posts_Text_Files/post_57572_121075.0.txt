Wine etiquette is an art that is instead learnt over time to master its integrities proficiently. Drinking wine is common in social gatherings or while meeting with friends and sharing quality time with family. These etiquette help an individual to handle oneself with confidence in such groups. The act of consuming wine, though infamously overwhelming, is quite simple and easy.

See - To check for colour and clarity, ensure the bowl doesnâ€™t contain any unnecessary residues that may interfere with the overall taste of the beverage. Also, suppose the intensity of the colour is amiss. In that case, it may reflect staleness.

Swirl - You need to swirl the wine in your glass to increase its contact with the air, releasing its aroma and allowing the vino to blend.

Sniff - You may place your nose just above the wine glass and inhale its aroma to identify the complex notes that seamlessly blend to give the vino its distinctive taste and character.

Sip - Last but not least, sip, savour and relish your wine!
