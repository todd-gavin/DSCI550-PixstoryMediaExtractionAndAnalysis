Social butterfly and proud of it? Why should you limit the fun moments on your Instagram just to the digital world? Make a Polaroid garland by choosing your favourite Polaroid prints and hanging them on your walls using wall hooks, some string and cloth pegs. String it alongside glowing fairy lights to create an eye-catching “gallery” when the sun goes down.
