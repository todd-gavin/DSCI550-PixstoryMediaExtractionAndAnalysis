At the ripe old age of it is fair to wonder what kind of food Queen Elizabeth eats to maintain her health But just what does Queen Elizabeth eat on a day to day basis Well according to Darren McGrady a former chef in the Royal kitchens the Queen sticks to the same foods most days This may come as a surprise to many but the Queen is clearly a creature of habit Tea first As most people know Queen Elizabeth is impartial to an Earl Gray tea Her favorite brand of tea is apparently Twinnings a well known English company that supplies tea around the world Breakfast Queen Elizabeth prefers to keep it simple when it comes to breakfast A bowl of Special K with some assorted fruits is apparently her go to meal to get the day started the right way On special occasions she allegedly will treat herself to some scrambled eggs and smoked salmon if she feels like it Lunch It is worth noting that the Queen is particularly fond of a gin and Dubonnet cocktail before she tucks into her lunch Following this it is reported that Queen Elizabeth is fond of some grilled fish or chicken and tends to stay away from starch for her meal at lunch It s clearly the simple things that Queen Elizabeth prefers when it comes to food For fish the Queen loves some Dover Sole with wilted spinach or courgettes As regards chicken grilled with a salad Dinner Queen might enjoy some chocolate biscuit cake for her afternoon tea before tucking into dinner Queen s love of chocolate cake is certainly well documented at this point Simply cooked meat and vegetables lead the way with space for pheasant or venison should the Queen wish Of course she loves a Sunday roast just as much as anyone else Along with chocolate the Queen enjoys some strawberries or peaches for dessert And to finish Queen Elizabeth will wash the food down with a glass of the best champagne money can buy The good life
