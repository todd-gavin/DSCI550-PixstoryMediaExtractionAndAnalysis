Legendary artist late MF Hussain stirred controversies over his paintings on Hindu deities which forced him to take a self imposed exile in He kept on hopping between Dubai Qatar and London He spent his last years outside India In Dubai I got an ample opportunity to interact with the legendary artist Whenever he was in Dubai we would meet at least once in a fortnight I grew a special bond with him says photojournalist Pankaj Sharma who was then working in Dubai for Gulf News Once I requested him that I need some exclusive shots As I had already clicked him at almost all the possible locations so he took me to his personal museum inside his house At that time he told me that I am the only person whom he had taken to his personal museum What all I could recall it had paintings which were never displayed in public Ferrari s number Hussain had a red Ferrari with number in Dubai I told him that I too had a car in Chandigarh which had a number The only difference was that mine was a small car and Ferrari is a super rich man s car But he immediately changed the track and told me that what counts more than the brand or cost of the car is the number This shows his humbleness recalls Sharma who is now based in Chandigarh Walking barefoot On being asked about walking barefoot He smiled and said that it s giving him added popularity So initially whatever was the reason behind it but now he is enjoying walking barefoot Good health s secret Whenever I had met him at his house he offered me kichadi and if it was outside then it s a coffee He used to had Kichadi in all three meals Kichadi and long walk was his secret behind good health Last unfulfilled wish Hussain on a couple of occasions had told me that he wanted to visit India for once and this was his last wish But somehow it remained unfulfilled Hussain had gifted me his painting it s a prized possession for me
