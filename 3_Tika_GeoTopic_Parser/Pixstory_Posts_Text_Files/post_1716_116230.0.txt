was a mysterious intruder, “unkempt, barefooted, and slightly tipsy,” who had wrenched back the canopy surrounding her bed with a bloody hand. The intruder was 32-year-old Michael Fagan, an unemployed tradesman who had a bone to pick with Her Majesty. What transpired between the Queen and Fagan has since gone down in history as one of the most dramatic royal security breaches on record.

When Michael got to the palace, he scaled the 20-foot wall, which is an achievement in itself given the man had a belly full of Guinness. He went straight for the palace, totally undetected — the biggest breach of security in the 800-year-old history of the English royal family. He pulled himself up a drainpipe and came to a balcony of a bedroom. According to the Royal Family's website, there are over 200 bedrooms in the palace. Michael Fagan managed to pick the right one! Luck of the Irish.

According to Michael Fagan the Queen sleeps sitting up in a four-poster bed. She wears the eye patches, so she couldn't see who he was.

He sat on her bed. She woke up and said, "Is that you, Philip?" He put on a posh English accent and said, "No it's me, Michael." She was terrified and thought he was going to kill her. He could see that she was very frightened. He said, "Relax, sister. You don't have to worry. I'm Irish." The Queen surely thought, "I'm definitely dead now." Michael very gently calmed her down. She said, "What do you want from me?" He said, "All I want is a kiss."

The head of the empire upright in her bed and a drunk Irishman leaning toward her! She asked, "Do you know who I am? I am the Queen of England." And he said, "I don't care who you are. I'm Michael Fagan from Ireland. and I'm here for a kiss."

Michael was sentenced to two years in jail. He served a few months and was let out early for good behavior. It's said the Queen actually sent him a couple of letters while he was in prison.
