Romelu Lukaku is all set to rejoin Inter Milan for the 2022/23 season. This just comes one year after Chelsea splashed a huge amount of money for the Belgian striker. Lukaku will be on loan at the Italian club, agreeing to a 7 million pounds fee. It is known that the Belgian has taken a substantial pay cut to mark an emotional return to Inter Milan.

Romelu Lukaku was a key architect in guiding Inter to the league title in the 20-21 season, ending Juventus’ domination. The striker has expressed his dissatisfaction regarding the way he left the Italian club last summer. Previously, Lukaku also vowed to return to Inter Milan at some time in the future.

Hence, it was an emotional return for Romelu Lukaku when he touched down in Milan. "I’m very happy to be back!,” said Lukaku to the reporters in Milan, as reported by Metro. 

Romelu Lukaku could not quite impress in his second stint at Chelsea. The 29-year-old striker managed to score just eight goals in 26 outings in the Premier League last campaign. His role was reduced to appearances from the bench in the latter half of the season.

Inter Milan would be tempted to keep Lukaku at the club beyond 2023. The Belgian scored 64 times during his first stint in Milan. Inter finished second on the points tally last season, coming up short against cross-town rivals, AC Milan. They will look to get their hands on the Scudetto once again in the upcoming campaign.
