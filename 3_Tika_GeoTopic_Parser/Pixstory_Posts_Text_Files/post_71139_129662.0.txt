Traditional stove of Kashmiri kitchen called as Daan or Dambar was a pre eminent feature of kashmiri kitchens in the past. 
With the growth of technology, many households items has been replaced and same is the case with in Kashmir. Modern kitchen gadgets like gas stove, electric heaters replaced the traditional Daan. 
Today one can hardly find Daan in a Kashmiri house. Now these traditional Daans are only used by people in forest areas with access to firewood. 
It was only a decades ago, when these clay made stoves were a mandatory feature of Kashmiri kitchens. 
It is said that the taste and quality of food cooked over Daan surpass the meals made with modern tools. The reason for this can be that, on this traditional stove whole of the pot is hot at the same time and food is heated all over, which is not the case with new stoves where only the base of utensils gets heat. 
With the contraction of new houses, this traditional Daan has slowly disappeared. 
According to the experts, food made on Daan is healthy in every possible way. The one thing that one needs to care of is to use cow dung instead of wood or coal, as the latter two are not good for the respiratory system of human body
