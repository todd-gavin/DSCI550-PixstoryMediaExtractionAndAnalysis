The final weekend of March coincides with the last international break of the season, when the final remaining place for qualification to FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 in December will be decided.

One of those countries is Italy, and coach Roberto Mancini has called on Leonardo Bonucci, Giorgio Chiellini and Mattia De Sciglio from the Bianconeri ranks, as well as Manuel Locatelli, still self-isolating after being found positive for Covid-19. There is no calcio-passionate Italian that doesn’t know that the first date with destiny is Thursday 24th, when the Azzurri face North Macedonia. If successful, Italy will then play for qualification on Tuesday 29th. 

Wojciech Szczesny's Poland will not play on Thursday against Russia. Instead, they have arranged a friendly against Scotland, whose match with Ukraine has been postponed, before playing the decisive match for a ticket to the World Cup next Tuesday.

Staying in Europe, there are friendly matches for Dusan Vlahovic's Serbia on Thursday 24th in Hungary, on Tuesday 29th in Denmark; for Adrien Rabiot's France, versus Ivory Coast and South Africa on 25th and 29th respectively; for Matthijs de Ligt’s Netherlands against Denmark and Germany on 26th and 29th; and for Alvaro Morata's Spain on 26th against Albania and 29th against Iceland.

As for crucial World Cup qualifiers in South America, Juan Cuadrado's Colombia will see it out on the night between Thursday and Friday against Bolivia at home, and the night between Sunday and Monday against Venezuela away. Meanwhile Brazil, one of two countries that have already qualified, are busy with Arthur and Danilo involved, at more or less the same time, against Chile at home and Bolivia away.

It will not only be an intense period for the First Team players. There are also many Academy players called up by their national teams.
