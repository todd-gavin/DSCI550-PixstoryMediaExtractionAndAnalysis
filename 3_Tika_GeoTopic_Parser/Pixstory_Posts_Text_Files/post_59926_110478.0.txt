In order to better keep to social division laws with the epidemic, Airbnb announced a temporary ban on house parties and activities in 2020. The organization claims that the restriction's results have delighted them so much that they are now codifying and making the ban permanent. 

The restriction forbids "any obstructive parties and activities," with a focus on open-invite events (those promoted on social media) and "party house" locations. The main definition of disruptive parties and activities is those that draw complaints from neighbours.

 According to Airbnb, it has terminated the accounts of almost 6,600 visitors who disobeyed the party restriction in 2021. In spite of the fact that the corporation has more than 150 million users, this is a very small number. Who knows if this results from infrequent breaches or inadequate enforcement. 

Airbnb is eliminating its 16-person occupancy limit in addition to permanently banning parties. This restriction was also implemented in 2020. The reason, according to the firm, is that there are numerous homes that can accommodate larger groups than 16 people, with many of these being used for "multi-generational family trips and larger groups." According to Airbnb, this specific policy modification will become effective "in the coming months."
