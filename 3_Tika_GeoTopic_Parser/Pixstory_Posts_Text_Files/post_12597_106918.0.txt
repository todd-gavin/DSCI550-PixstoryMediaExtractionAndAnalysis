Sending children off to college or into the real world is usually a proud time for parents. But there also can be sadness, especially when it’s the last child to leave home. Empty nest syndrome isn’t a clinical diagnosis. Instead, it’s a phenomenon in which parents experience feelings of sadness and loss when the last child leaves home.

It’s common for parents to find letting go to be a painful experience even though they actively encourage their children to be independent.

Parents might find it difficult to suddenly have no children at home who need their care. They might miss being a part of their children’s daily lives and their constant companionship.

Parents with only one child or those who strongly identify with their role as a parent might have a particularly difficult time adjusting.

Having an empty nest also gives parents a new opportunity to reconnect with each other, improve the quality of their marriage and rekindle interests for which they previously might not have had time.
