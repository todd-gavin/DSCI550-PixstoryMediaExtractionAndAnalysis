To the one who has lost hope The struggle of anything isn t easy Life isn t a fictional story and won t happen as you ve dreamed or planned It happens as it is meant to be You carry grief in your heart for your failures imperfections You try to stitch your broken pieces and just end up with pain You are longing for love peace You just don t need to be perfect for everything Have you ever noticed that even the rose looks so perfect despite its thorns something that all of us admire So why do you hesitate to accept yourself Why do you always question your worth You don t need to be afraid of anyone Don t let your fears consume you Be a brave warm soul Be vulnerable Be the one who believes in seeing the light in the darkest days Be the one who refuses to give up no matter what the circumstances are Give the ability to live love yourself a little bit more Do more things that make you alive talk to your favourite person scribble down your thoughts take a sip of warm coffee weave the happiness with little moments listen to old music dance in the rain and share your sadness with the sky tell your secret to the stars just feel the beauty of everything Take it easy on yourself Make yourself whole again All you need is to adore yourself a little more every time
