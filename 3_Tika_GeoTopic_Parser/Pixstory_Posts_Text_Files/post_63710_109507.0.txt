Watching Anakin/Vader with a blue and red hue on his face, as he says “I am not your failure Obi Wan. You did not kill...Anakin Skywalker. I did.” with the voices of Hayden and James Earl Jones merging was utterly heartbreaking. It is as if Anakin surfaced for a brief moment and tried to console his master that he is the product of his own choice, and he should not blame himself for it, while Vader takes credit with a smirk to torment him. After that, the hue turns completely red and he says “Just like, I will destroy you.” showing that the brief conflict is done, Anakin is truly gone and the Vader persona has fully taken over.

For the first time in live action, do we actually get to see Anakin and Vader being shown as both different and yet the same entity. In the end, you really get the chills as a broken hearted Obi Wan walks away from his defeated foe and says, “Then my friend is truly dead. Goodbye, Darth.” This truly shows that Obi Wan has found closure and is finally at peace with all those years of guilt and trauma, and how he truly believed that Anakin is now actually dead, and Vader is all that remains, thus showing why he told Luke to kill Vader. This was not true from a certain point of view, this was the truth.

The only actual mistake in this duel was the lack of John Williams. Themes are an important part of all Star Wars duels, they are more than just music, they are a big chunk of the emotion behind that fight and while the new theme was pretty slick, Disney not using Battle Of The Heroes, Duel Of The Fates or Anakin’s Betrayal really did stick out considering how important this moment was. Nonetheless, this was really an incredible bout where the two warriors fought each other with nothing held back, before their final battle upon the Death Star.
