Australia was hardly threatened as they breezed through the ICC Women s Cricket World Cup group stage and they have no obvious flaws heading as far as their recent performances go Previous Australian teams may have had as much star power as the class but recently their game appears to have more depth and is on track to repeat the feats of the team which went undefeated throughout any tournament According to me the credit goes to the backbone of Australia s batting line up is Alyssa Healy Rachael Haynes and Meg Lanning who work incredibly well together Whether it s the right hand left hand opening combination that confuses opposition bowlers or the fact that each member of the top three has their own strengths to bring to the table each member of the top three has something to offer Healy is the runner while Haynes is the more steady opener but Lanning is comfortable in both roles and can modify her game depending on who she s batting with and the situation Let s see what these wonderful women have in store next for us
