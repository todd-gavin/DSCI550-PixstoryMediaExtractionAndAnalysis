The Blues boss was responding to a tweet by the American’s father. Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel insisted that he has ‘zero problems’ with Cristian Pulisic after the American winger’s father expressed frustration at his son’s regular starts at Stamford Bridge. 


Mark Pulisic posted a message on Twitter last weekend expressing his ‘sadness’ at his son’s situation at Chelsea, though it was later deleted. 

The USMNT international has made 34 appearances in all competitions for Chelsea this season, but half of those have been as a substitute. 

What did Tuchel say about Pulisic?

Tuchel was asked about his relationship with Pulisic and his father’s tweet during a Friday news conference previewing Chelsea’s weekend match with Wolves. 

“I am not concerned if the player’s father says he does not love me.” says the German. 

“As ever we have our reasons to choose our line-up and at this level, you will never see happy faces when not selected. Between me and Cristian, we have zero problems.”



Does Pulisic have a future at Chelsea?

Mark Pulisic’s tweet was posted just hours after Chelsea’s defeat at Everton last Sunday, where Cristian Pulisic was only a second-half substitute despite scoring the winner off the bench against West Ham the previous weekend. 

The 23-year-old has just made 10 appearances off the start and further 8 appearances off the bench. 

That is in sharp contrast to his experience at the international level, where he is a captain and one of the first names on the team sheet. 

Pulisic has previously expressed his desire for more regular starts and his father’s tweet suggests some frustration remains, though the fact it was swiftly deleted suggests it is not certain whether the winger will push for a move this summer.
