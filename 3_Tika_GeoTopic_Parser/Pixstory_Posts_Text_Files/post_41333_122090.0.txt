Enjoying a beloved summer delicacy like raw oysters, which is especially well-liked by Hispanic families, goes hand in hand with the pleasant weather. 

However, the FDA says that they would like you to be aware that there may be a substantial risk for those with medical conditions to become extremely ill and die after consuming raw oysters contaminated with a naturally occurring bacteria. These high-risk individuals are advised to only consume cooked oysters since cooking eliminates bacteria. 

Eating raw oysters contaminated with Vibrio vulnificus, a bacteria frequently present in seas where oysters are produced, such as the Gulf of Mexico, can cause serious illness and even death. Due to the increased surface area of the water during the summer, Vibrio vulnificus is more prevalent.

As FDA states, â€œYou can't tell if an oyster is contaminated by Vibrio vulnificus by looking at it or by smelling it," said a spokesperson. "Nor does the freshness of the oyster mean it is safe from bacteria because it is present in the water where live oysters feed."
