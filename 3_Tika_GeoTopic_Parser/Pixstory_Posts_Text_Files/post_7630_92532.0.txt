Lucknow Super Giants bowled first, David Warner and Powell disappointed scoring 4 and 3, Prithvi Shaw managed to make 61 of 34 balls. Rishabh Pant and Sarfaraz Khan managed to make 39 and 36 but they just took much time both of them scored at a strike rate of not more than 130 and that just gave Delhi Capitals a low total. DC managed to put 149 up on the board. The LSG bowlers managed to do a good job to keep the total down to 149 given that DC could not capitalise in the final three overs.

Lucknow Super Giants on the other hand managed to get a good opening partnership, K.L. Rahul played the anchor role scoring 24 from 25 balls where as Quinton de Kock took the initiative, he scored 80 of 52 balls, he hit nine fours and two sixes. Kuldeep Yadav managed to take the two openers out of the game and then a collapse happened. Lewis and Hooda just didn't get in at the crucial moments and left LSG in a bind. Krunal Pandya and Badoni managed to get LSG over the rope in the end. LSG won by 6 wickets, Quinton de Kock was named the man of the match.
