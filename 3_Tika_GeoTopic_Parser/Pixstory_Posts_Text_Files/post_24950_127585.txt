Portuguese talisman Cristiano Ronaldo has been looking for ways to get out of Manchester United for quite some time now The year old is nearing the end of his career and he craves Champions League football We all know how competitive the forward is and he hates the possibility of his immediate rival Lionel Messi overtaking his Champions League goals tally in his absence However Ronaldo s search for Champions League clubs in this transfer window has led to nothing but humiliation for him so far His agent Jorge Mendes approached elite clubs like Bayern Munich Chelsea and even FC Barcelona at the beginning of the transfer window Unfortunately all three of these clubs rejected him straightaway and Bayern in particular rejected him twice This was definitely a big blow to Ronaldo s reputation and a big let down for his fans According to journalist Tancredi Palmeri Jorge Mendes recently offered his client to Serie A clubs Inter and AC Milan as well but even they rejected the chance to buy the player It does not seem like he would have to stay at Manchester United after all the saga despite his wish to play elsewhere and thus for the first time ever Cristiano Ronaldo would have to play in the Europa League Meanwhile the condition of Manchester United is seemingly deteriorating every single matchday They suffered a tragic defeat against Brighton at home in their opening match of the season and this week they lost to Brentford Cristiano Ronaldo has been unable to find a single goal or assist so far in these two matches and looking at the low number of chances created by Manchester United it will be very difficult for him to find goals this season Image Credits acmilan
