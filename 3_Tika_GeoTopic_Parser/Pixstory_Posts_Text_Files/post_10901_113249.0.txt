🎙 « I came to the club when I was 12, I was a little girl. I've grown up a lot since, and I've experienced a lot of things. I started with the basics, and that has enabled me to be where I am today. I still have to improve, I'm not done with that yet, and I have another three years to do that here. » ❤️💙
