Look at these figures 
*2,183 new cases reported in the last 24 hours*

*Recovery Rate currently stands at 98.76%*

*Weekly Positivity Rate is presently at 0.32%*

This is the data shared by ministry of health and family welfare , although the cases are increasing, the positivity rate remains around 0.3, which means we have no reasons to be scared so far. However with increasing cases among school children parents are getting wary of sending children to schools . Should we or shouldn’t we is the question ? We know children are enjoying school, we don’t want them to be sitting home.
So I decided to ask a prominent paediatrician and Director Apollo Hospitals , Dr Anupam Sibal. I asked him whether we should worry , he said no. 
About the cases among children, he had this to say 
“Cases will go up and down as life goes back to normal”. 
Let’s keep fingers crossed and hope that is the cases 

Covid cases are increasing again,
