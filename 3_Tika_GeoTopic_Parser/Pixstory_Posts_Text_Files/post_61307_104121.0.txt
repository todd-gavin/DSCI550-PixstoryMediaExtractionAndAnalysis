It always felt like it was meant to be.
Right from the spectacular turnaround against PSG to this incredible win in the final over one of the greatest Liverpool teams of all time,it felt like the Big Ears were destined to come back to Madrid once again. Real wrre by no means the best team of this competition, but they managed to conjure up resilience and moments of brilliance which make even their staunchest of rivals admire them for a minute. The relationship between this club and the Champions League is beautiful beyond belief. Some things are just meant to be, and Real Madrid winning the Champions League for the FOURTEENTH time felt just right.
