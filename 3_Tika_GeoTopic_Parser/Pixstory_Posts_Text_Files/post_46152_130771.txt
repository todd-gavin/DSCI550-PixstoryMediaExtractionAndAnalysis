I know it hurts doesn t it Planning a future with someone relationship goals dates tours and what not and seeing them shatter in front of your eyes and all you can do is nothing You simply feel like this is the end of your life or you might not be able to love someone from now onwards but trust me you ll get out of this And not to mention that time is the best healer and all you have to do is Love Yourself Breakups hurt We believe they are so perfect that we ignore all the harm they do to us because we are too much in love and no less than a blind And between all this we forget that we do possess the right to be happy too We forget to love ourselves and most importantly prioritise ourselves more than anyone else And once you ve learned to love yourself alone once you ve realised that there s nobody better to rely on than yourself when you re finally ready to meet someone else and believe me you will meet someone else you ll be in a better place to fall in love again because you d have fallen in love with yourself first So just walk away with your head held high and do not give him another second of your time I know you love him so much that each and every step will kill you but this is for the moment when you will look back to the day you put yourself first Go and make something beautiful outta this life and I promise you that one day you will forget he was ever there Okay So now just get up wash your face wear your favorite outfit and go on a date with yourself PS I hope you find strength to walk away cuz my darling you are worth it all All the love from a stranger
