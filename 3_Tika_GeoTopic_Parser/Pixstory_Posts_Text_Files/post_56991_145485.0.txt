I would disagree, the criticism might have the ability to encourage someone to perform better, but honestly, most critics criticise considering their critique to be greater than the work itself; they aim to find flaws in every piece of work, whether it needs improvement or not and that creates an unnecessary conversation and rumours around the work.
Like in literature, critiques are more read than the work itself because the person analysing the work is considered more relevant than the artist.
This is unfair for both work and artists.
Criticism, at times like these, kills creativity. However, it is essential to have a good and bad side to something; every performance needs judgement. Still, there should be more work done to practice constructive criticism and to learn how to speak of something by keeping the dignity of that work.
It can't be denied entirely or neglected to form views and critiques.
