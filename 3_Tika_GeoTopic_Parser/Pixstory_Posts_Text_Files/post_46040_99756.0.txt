Over the span of 150 years, more than 500 Native American children died at government and church-run boarding schools, with many of them buried in unmarked graves on campus grounds, according to a new federal analysis. 

Daily Mail reported that an Interior Department analysis released on Wednesday revealed that over 500 Native American students died at 408 US-operated boarding schools across 37 states and territories between 1819 and 1969, with many of them in Oklahoma, Arizona, and New Mexico. 

The government has identified at least 53 burial sites at or near boarding schools, with 33 marked burial sites, six unmarked burial sites, and 14 both marked and unmarked burial sites located at a school location, a number that is projected to expand exponentially as study continues.

The Interior Department has stated that they will not publish the exact locations of burial sites in order to prevent 'well-documented' grave robbery and damage at Indian burial sites. 

Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, who is from Laguna, commissioned the investigation last June to look into the terrible history of boarding schools and get the truth about the government's role in them.

â€˜It is my priority to not only give voice to the survivors and descendants of federal Indian boarding school policies, but also to address the lasting legacies of these policies so Indigenous Peoples can continue to grow and heal,' she said.
