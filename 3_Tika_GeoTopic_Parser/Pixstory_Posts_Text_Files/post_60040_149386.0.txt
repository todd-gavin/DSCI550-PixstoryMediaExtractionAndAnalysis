Ninety-two MLAs in Rajasthan threatened to resign yesterday, saying they want Ashok Gehlot—the front-runner for the position of Congress national president—to retain the post of Chief Minister. Veteran Congress leader and former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Kamal Nath will meet party chief Sonia Gandhi in Delhi. Rahul Gandhi ruled off the prospect, stating that the party will uphold the "One man, one post" principle.
The MLAs aim to prevent Mr. Gehlot's arch opponent Sachin Pilot and his 21 devoted lawmakers from holding the top position.
Team Gehlot had a meeting the day before the legislature party meeting and passed a resolution stating that a Chief Minister should only be picked from the group of 102 legislators who supported the government when Sachin Pilot's uprising brought it to the verge of collapse in 2020.
