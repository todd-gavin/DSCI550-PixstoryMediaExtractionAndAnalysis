India scripts history, wins Thomas Cup for the first time in the 73-years old championship history by beating the defending and 14-time champions Indonesia 3-0.

Kidambi Srikanth beat Jonatan Christie 21-15 23-21 in the decider to bring the Thomas cup home for the first time.

It was cut short an inspirational victory. Making fighting comebacks, winning nerve-racking points, phenomenal performance from the young guns. Well done Lakshya Sen, Satwik, Chirag, Kidambi Srikanth & HS Prannoy. This team has done wonders and will do more ahead.

First time into the finals and winning it 3-0 is no mean feat but the young Indian shuttlers dominated the finals and did it for the pride of their nation.

It's a red-letter day in Indian sporting history.

Congratulations to the Indian Badminton team and every Indian on this historic victory. Let's hope we keep doing wonders in the world of sports in the times to come!! ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ 

Keep the flag flying high ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³
