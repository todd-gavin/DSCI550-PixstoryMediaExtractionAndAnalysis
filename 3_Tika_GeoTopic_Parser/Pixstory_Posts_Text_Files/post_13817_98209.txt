Paris Saint Germain coach Mauricio Pochettino has come out strongly in favour of Lionel Messi and said the legendary Argentine would bounce back the next season Pochettino has even gone to the extent of saying Messi is of the same level as Maradona There is nothing wrong in coach backing his player but some suspect there is another reason why Pochettino has suddenly decided to heap praise on Messi who was heckled by the club supporters after Champions League exit The year old has only scored nine times in all competitions just four of those goals coming in Ligue appearances and he was among a number of players booed by supporters after PSG s Champions League last exit at the hands of Real Madrid But Pochettino it seems desperately wants Messi to stay in next season but it could be a ploy to stop keep Kylian Mbappe from moving to Real Madrid The French striker was key to PSG s attacks this season and scored in almost all key matches Messi on the other and played a different role and contributed assists in the season It did help Mbappe and to have Messi on his side next season against would definitely be an added attraction for Mbappe to stay on in the old club But does that mean Messi is no more the number one footballer or PSG something that never happened in the Argentine s career since his childhood Pochettino said I have no doubts about his Messi s quality Messi has enough talent to do what he has to do He will do it Next season will be completely different for him Messi said it was always difficult to play the French league for the first time It s a more physical league where games are hotly contested where there is a lot of back and forth The players are strong and fast Physically it changed a lot is what Messi had to say in an interview Now it is to be seen whether both Messi and Mbappe move on or stay with the same club
