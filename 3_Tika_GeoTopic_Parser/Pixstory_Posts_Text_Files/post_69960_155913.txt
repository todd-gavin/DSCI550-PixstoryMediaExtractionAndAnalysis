PAAS IT ALONG As part of today s open mic event we participated in the mental health exercise known as paas it along I really enjoyed this activity In this exercise we first meditate and consider every aspect of our bodies from head to toe as well as any parts of our bodies that we feel anxious about Following that each person was given a blank sheet and instructed to draw that portion or something related to it All the sheets were then shuffled while everyone participated and after that it was instructed to draw something to make the drawing good or positive Finally the sheets were rotated among everyone and we had to pick the drawing that we had drawn first From this activity I draw the conclusion that we all shared our fears with one another without actually disclosing them to anyone and that we all assured one another that everything was good and that we were all perfect in our own ways If I talk about my experience recently I ve gained a lot of weight and I ve been feeling very insecure about my body figure Following the activity s instructions I tried to draw my unfit body When I got my drawing back I saw someone draw me as a warrior It was so sweet and it made me feel so overwhelmed As a result my confidence has been slightly boosted You can do this with your friends or coworkers it will definitely make you feel better about yourself It was a really great activity to do to boost your self esteem
