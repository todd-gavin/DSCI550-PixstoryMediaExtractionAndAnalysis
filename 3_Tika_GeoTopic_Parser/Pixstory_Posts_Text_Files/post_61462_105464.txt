You can t change how someone feels You can influence their emotions for the better or worse but ultimately they decide their emotions and behaviour I struggled for a very long time until I realized this It took a while and it was hard to change a belief I have had my whole life I believed other people s emotions were my responsibility As if the world revolved around me I was doing something wrong I wasn t enough I needed to try harder to love harder to give more I was wrong Every person is responsible for their own emotions And they are the only person responsible for their emotions Just as we are the only one responsible for our actions We cannot expect to change how somebody else feels or change how or what they think The only person who can do that is themselves People choose to act and feel based on their personalities and moods and education and family and how they grew up There are many factors that contribute to how someone feels and acts But you are not responsible for how someone else feels Same goes the other way You and you alone are responsible for your emotions No one is going to make you happy You choose to be happy It is a choice and not one made by other people but one made by yourself It is not up to you to ensure someone else s happiness just like no one can make you happy except yourself
