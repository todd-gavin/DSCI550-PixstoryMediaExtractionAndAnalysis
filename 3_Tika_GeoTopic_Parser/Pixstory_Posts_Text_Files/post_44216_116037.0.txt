This summer, Oleksandr Zinchenko has resurfaced as a target for Arsenal. According to David Ornstein of The Athletic, the Gunners are in discussion with Manchester City about a potential deal, and the Premier League champions are open to selling if their asking price is fulfilled.

After Arsenal missed out on Ajax's Lisandro Martnez, who appears destined to join Manchester United, Mikel Arteta is thought to have made the recruitment of the Ukraine international a priority. The two worked together while they were teammates at City.

Zinchenko, who joined City from FC Ufa in 2016, has played 127 times for the team, contributing to 12 goals and two himself. However, the adaptable left-back is allegedly eager to seek out more first-team action abroad after having trouble getting into games last season. If City decides to sell, they might move to replace Zinchenko with Marc Cucurella of Brighton.

Zinchenko, though, found it difficult to earn a starting spot in Pep Guardiola's lineup over City's starting left-back Joao Cancelo. According to MEN, Brighton & Hove Albion left-back Marc Cucurella has been linked to City, which would likely result in even less playing time for the Ukrainian.

Following a successful Â£50 million deal from Premier League rivals Manchester City, Sterling was introduced as a Chelsea player on Wednesday. To accompany his new colleagues on their US tour, the winger has flown out to Los Angeles, and Mount was obviously thrilled to welcome his international comrade on board.

Although the new owners are also interested in defensive reinforcements like Nathan Ake of Napoli and Kalidou Koulibaly of City, Sterling is the first player to be signed by the Todd Boehly era at Stamford Bridge.
