Look who sees himself at the wheel of a Ferrari Ok it won&#39;t be a Formula single-seater but the Cavallino fans will certainly have a certain effect seeing Rubens Barrichello once again dressed in red The opportunity to find Rubinho arrived years after his farewell to Maranello thanks to what at least for the moment was a simple test on the Vallelunga track where the fifty-year-old Brazilian sat behind the wheel of the Scuderia Baldini Ferrari GT Evo alternating on the seat with his son Dudu and with Giancarlo Fisichella At the moment there is no news on a possible debut of father and son in the Italian GT championship but certainly the images can only make nostalgic fans happy by recalling an era of sensational victories ever more distant in memory Photo Aci Sport
