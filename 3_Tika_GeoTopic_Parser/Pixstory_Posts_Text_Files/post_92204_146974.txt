Where is peace In the deep silent forests there is peace In the soft flowing rivers and still ponds there is peace In the woods where a tree is nbsp home of countless creatures there is peace In the azure sky when clouds sprinkle freely there is peace In the small hutments of straw and hay there is peace In the dim light of cities at night time there is peace In the rainy evenings and warm nights there is peace In the snowy winter and the fireplaces there is peace In the morning when the sun rises there is peace In the mind full of thoughts there is peace In the emotions full of love there is peace Everywhere there is peace in the towns and in the villages
