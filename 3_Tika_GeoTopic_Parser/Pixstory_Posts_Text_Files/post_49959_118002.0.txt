‌The January 6 House select committee is anticipated to make the case at its hearing that Donald Trump potentially violated the law when he declined entreaties to take action to stop the 2021 attack on the US Capitol according to two sources.

The panel will imply that the former Republican president was “derelict in his duty” to protect the US Congress and might have also broken the federal law that restricts obstructing an official proceeding before Congress, which had assembled to certify Democrat Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election.

Trump had multiple options on his side-he could have called on national guard troops to reclaim order when he saw on TV the melee unfolding at the Capitol, the panel is expected to argue, or he could have called off the rioters via a live broadcast from the White House press briefing room, but he did not. Or he could have sent a tweet trying to stop the violence far earlier than he actually did, during the 187-minute duration of the Capitol attack.

The former president instead was disinterested and posted a tweet in the afternoon of January 6, hours after his top advisors at the White House and Republican allies in Congress repeatedly asked him to intervene, the select committee will show.

And the panel is expected to bolster that Trump’s inaction directly provided to the extended battle between the US Capitol Police and rioters, who outnumbered them since many rioters scattered after he tweeted the now-infamous video asking them to leave the Capitol.

He could have done a lot more than what he actually did-but he didn't which itself shows that he is guilty.
