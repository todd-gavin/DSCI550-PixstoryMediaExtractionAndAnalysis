Recently seen in the H&M's new Campaign video that portrays a fictional resort, Hotel Hennes, dedicated to madcap adventures. Hadid is a concierge at the hotel, and she's the host to a who's who talent and guides Jill Korteleve, Previous Lee, and Devyn Garcia with humour and affordable fashion.


Bardia Zeinali has directed the film, and it focuses on the joy of travel. This enchanted Hadid to choose the campaign. She says, “I knew whatever world Bardia was taking us to would be incredible,” she shared on the phone from New York. “[There’s] this message that everyone can be motivated to get back out in the world and find those moments that make life magical and unexpected.” 

Besides the idea of the video and the fun associated with travelling, there are other things too that encouraged her to become a part of the campaign.

At the beginning of her career, she used the brand’s many stores in New York City to discover her tastes. She always liked the brand and used to pick buy basics  " or something louder that I thought I could wear to a fabulous party," she shares in a vogue article.
