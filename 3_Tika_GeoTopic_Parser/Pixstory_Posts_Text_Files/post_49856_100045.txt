 Here we see the court promoting guns A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that California s ban on the sale of semiautomatic rifles to adults younger than was unconstitutional So the judge is promoting children to go out and buy guns A panel of the U S th Circuit Court of Appeals found that the nd Amendment protects the right of young adults to keep and bear arms which includes the right to purchase them They call the law a legal error See the jingoist statement the judge made America would not exist without the heroism of the young adults who fought and died in our revolutionary army Judge Ryan D Nelson an appointee of President Trump wrote for the appeals court Today we reaffirm that our Constitution still protects the right that enabled their sacrifice the right of young adults to keep and bear arms This is not the revolutionary period in America we have a democracy and people are supposed to live peacefully not revolt or evoke violence The court let stand a separate state requirement that younger adults obtain hunting licenses before buying long guns Federal law bars the sale of handguns to adults younger than by federally licensed dealers but not by private parties Trump appointed judges are supposedly causing harm to the country The decision is against modern gun control measures in California which has some of the strictest gun laws in the country Cases in recent years have questioned the state s ban on assault weapons and its ban on high capacity magazines We live in a harsh world yet weapons are not an answer Despite overturning laws the judge is pointing out the history and spurring violence in the minds of youth When something happens everyone from gun manufacturers to lawmakers should be responsible
