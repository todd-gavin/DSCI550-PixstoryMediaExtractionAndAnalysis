With the first half finishing at 4-0 it just seemed that there was more carnage to come in the remaining half of the game. However United showed a bit of resurgence of their Lin up play into the second half. This soon paid off as Antony scored an outrageous goal to pull one back for United. The Brazilian received a long ball from the midfield region and curled the ball into the far post for his second Manchester United goal. This however turned out to be just a moment's relief for United as city burst out again to brilliantly execute their counter attacking runs. Regular attempts with crosses finally saw Haaland cling onto one and find his third goal of the match. With this the Norwegian became the first player in the history of the Premier League to score three consecutive hat tricks at home. Foden too didnt waste any bit of time and followed Haaland to complete his hat-trick too after being assisted by the latter. 
United were already 6-1 down with around 20 minutes left to play and it seemed as if a bigger humiliation awaited in the remaining minutes of the game. However the reds just redeemed themselves a bit first with Martial finding a second goal for his side in the 84th minute and then smashing home a penalty in the stoppage time to make it 6-3. 
This late revival did neither change the result nor the wounds for Ten Hag's men though as they are now once again in a spot of bother struggling at the 6th position in the table. City on the other hand had a plenty of positives to bank on after the game. Two hat-tricks in a game was a huge achievement for the side in itself. The victory made them sit even firmly at the 2nd position in the table.
