The sound which a V10 engine made was absolutely sublime. It’s too bad that Formula 1 has now switched to V6’s. 
The sound has become significantly lower. Although it now is better in terms of noise pollution, the cry of the V10 or even the V8 engine is deeply missed by the entire Motorsport community!
