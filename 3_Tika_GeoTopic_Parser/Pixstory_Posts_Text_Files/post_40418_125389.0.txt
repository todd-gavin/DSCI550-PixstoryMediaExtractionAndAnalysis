Salt water crocodiles, or what we call them 'affectionately', saltie is possibly the most aggressive (towards humans) reptile to exist. They will eat you. It's that simple. Basically anything with meat on it that weighs less than 14 hundred pounds is fair game for the saltwater crocodile. They are also the largest of all crocodilians. 

Crocodile attacks have historically been 100 times deadlier than shark attacks and much more common, ranging from terrifying one-on-one encounters to a mass attack on World War II soldiers. 3,700 pounds per square inch of force are exerted on the victim by a crocodile's jaw. 

A 17-foot saltwater crocodile's biting force might reach 3,700 pounds and its tooth pressure could reach 350,000 pounds per square inch. That's the worst bite you'd ever come across. That's the highest bite force ever recorded -- beating a 2,980-pound value for a 13-foot wild American alligator Erickson's lab measured in 2005. 

As Erickson describes it: "I have to admit, the first time I placed our meter into the maw of an adult crocodile, I was nervous. It was all over in the blink of an eye. When it struck, it nearly wrested my grip from the handle. The noise of the jaws coming together was like a gunshot. The power of the animal was astounding, and the violence of the event frightening."

So, you know better than to go near crocodile infested water. Right?
