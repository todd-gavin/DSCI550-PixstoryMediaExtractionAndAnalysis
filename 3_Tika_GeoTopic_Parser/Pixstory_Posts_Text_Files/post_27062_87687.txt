This is a tricky review to do primarily because I feel that this movie was bashed by the critics a little too much I mean no one going into this movie was expecting out of the world logic flick where everything falls into place and everything makes sense They treated this movie as if they went in with expectations of watching a Scorcese gangster flick and I will say it here if you are going in with high expectations then you are bound for a disappointment underground is weak at its core it has a little too much of action film kind of filming technique yes a little too much You don t need to zoom in and zoom out constantly while Ryan Reynolds is saying a dialogue leave him be Too many cuts and a little too much of haywire kind of shooting is the downfall of the movie according to me The plot isn t too bad definitely not as bad as Red Notice it is decent and something that will make you wonder at times For me this movie is good a good stars as it just settles itself towards the end you don t end up feeling like you have watched a masterpiece but you also don t end up getting disappointed thinking that it was an utter waste of time The action scenes are well directed the humour is decent the effort to put emotion is praiseworthy All in all I prefer Underground in the list of good action flicks with a slightly compelling plot it is not as bad as recent Fast and Furious movies while also not being as enjoyable as a Free Guy It is just a decent cover of time
