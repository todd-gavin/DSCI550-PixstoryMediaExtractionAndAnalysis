#4.  Gabriel Milito

In 2007, he was signed for €20 million from Real Zaragoza.

In 2003, Real Madrid agreed to pay Independiente €3.5 million for Gabriel Milito if he passed his physical.

He didn't, and Real Madrid issued a statement to clarify the situation:

"After the medical tests, our staff considers that, bearing in mind the intensity and high frequency of the efforts required by the club, they cannot guarantee the fitness of the player for the next four seasons."

Real Madrid's medical department was vindicated after cruciate knee injuries, hamstring injuries, thigh injuries, and torn calf muscle injuries.

Even if Barcelona had reservations about Real Madrid's medical department, they should have exploited the failed test at Real Madrid to force Zaragoza to cut the €20 million transfer fee in half.


#3.  Philippe Christanval

In 2001, he was signed from Monaco for €17 million.

Philippe Christanval's appearance does not imply that he will play like a €17 million centre-back.

David Luiz's troubles for Chelsea as center-back are reminiscent to Christanval: he lacks positional understanding, is uncoordinated, and inconsistent.


#2.  Gerard

In 2000, he was signed from Valencia for €24 million.

There was Gerard before Cesc Fàbregas.

He went to Valencia after leaving La Masia, and Barcelona was devastated by his performances for Los Che.

If you've never seen Gerard play, imagine a less talented Borja Valero.

Gerard, in retrospect, didn't even come close to living up to a quarter of his transfer fee.


#1.  Geovanni

In 2001, he was signed from Cruzeiro for €21 million.

Because Geovanni is a mercurial player, I wouldn't place too much responsibility on the scout who recommended him.

On some days, he's world-class, and on others, he's nowhere to be seen.

For Barcelona, he went missing a lot.

During a purple patch, the scout most likely assumed he had found the next Ronaldo by watching Geovanni.
