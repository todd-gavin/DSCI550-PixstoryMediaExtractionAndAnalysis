The devastation the Yellowstone flood has created would take years to repair The most affected were the people living near the devastation where disaster hit them hard and now they re left with picking their lives back In and around the agricultural community of Fromberg the Clarks Fork River flooded almost homes and badly damaged a significant irrigation ditch that serves many farms The town s mayor says about a third of the flooded homes are too far gone to be repaired Not far from the riverbank Lindi O Brien s trailer home was raised high enough to avoid significant damage But she got water in her barns and sheds lost some of her poultry and saw her recently deceased parents home get swamped with several feet of water Elected officials who showed up to tour the damage in Red Lodge and Gardiner Montana tourist towns that serve as gateways to Yellowstone haven t made it to Fromberg to see its devastation O Brien said the lack of attention is no surprise given the town s location away from major tourist routes
