The so called Fairness in Women s Sports Act by Republican Senator Elaine Morgan attempts to ban trans girls and femme athletes from sports in Rhode Island by re imposing patriarchal concepts of femininity that uphold the women as inferior pitiful subjects in need of men s protection The legislature finds that there are inherent differences between men and women and that these differences remain cause for celebration but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial constraints on an individual s opportunity the proposed act states in a clumsy attempt to defend a gender binary that has never existed The bill proceeds to dismiss women athletes claiming that their talent commitment and grit will never match up to men Boys and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition it argues In line with bills this year that attempt to ban or have already banned trans youth from sports Rhode Island s bill attempts to reduce all student athletes to their bodies through a white supremicist suggestion on how there are certain ways to look like a man or woman If a student s gender is disputed and they want to participate in sports the act would need them to provide an invasive physician s statement based on an analysis of the student s anatomy hormone levels and genetic make up Excluding trans girls and femme youth from participating in sports has negative outcomes for all youth It reproduces white supremicist patriarchal concepts of toxic masculinity that associate femininity with fragility through a practice of systemic transmisogyny and anti Black racism These anti trans sports bills disguise themselves as saviours of women but are practising the exact opposite they create a violent cisgender gaze that would police all athletes through invasive procedures and tests that have been used against Black athletes like Caster Semenya You don t need to read in between the lines the bill is quite clear about its gender essentialist intent This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth it states RI S was introduced and referred to committee on March st
