Have you ever had noodle waffles? I'm always on the lookout for new ways to use my waffle maker, so when I saw these noodle waffles on the Internet, I just KNEW I had to try it! 

It was really simple to make. I used maggi. Cook the maggi as usual, make it a little drier than usual, and cook it in the waffle maker until crispy, about 2 minutes. 

I'll admit, I was a little sceptical about this dish, but it was delightfully interesting! 

Final verdict: 3 stars. 

Did I enjoy it? Yes. Would I make it again? Probably not. 
Cleaning the waffle maker after just one waffle wasn't worth it.
