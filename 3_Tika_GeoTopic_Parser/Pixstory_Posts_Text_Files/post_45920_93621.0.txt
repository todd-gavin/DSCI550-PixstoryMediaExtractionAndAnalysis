Happy Anniversary to the beautiful couple! Every milestone in a marriage deserves to be celebrated. Especially in this day and age, where people are so engrossed in materialistic things, it is important to dwell over little joys in life. 

Many people in my friend circle say that it is futile to celebrate anniversaries but I disagree.

Celebrating your anniversary can be a lovely opportunity for you and your partner to reconnect. If life has been hectic and you're struggling to keep your head above water, taking time to celebrate as a couple might provide you with a respite to reconnect and speak with your partner. 

Anniversary is a time to reflect on the previous year â€“ or perhaps a few years. Looking back allows us to realise how far we have progressed. 
When we examine some of the hurdles we've faced as a relationship, it gives us hope for the future. 
Looking back isn't always a terrible thing; by reflecting and remembering, we can be reminded of our marriage's strength and motivated to keep going.
