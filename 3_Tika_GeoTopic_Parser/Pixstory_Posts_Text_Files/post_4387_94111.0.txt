Stop trying to do ‘just one more thing, ‘oh it will make this person happy’, ‘this will make them like me’, to prove you are worthy. Whatever you’re doing is JUST ENOUGH. 

Do what you feel like doing, don’t do things to make others feel good about you. I know it’s a weird phase. Not knowing what to do, where to start from, no goals, nothing to look upon. But YOU GOT THIS. 

I promise you, two years from now, you will be proud of yourself. Don’t be so hard on yourself. You are worthy. You are loved. You are important and you’ll make it big. 

Stop taking everything so personally, none of this will matter in the next two years. Stop being so hopeless. In the next two years, YOU WILL BE DOING EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED and YOU WILL BE THE HAPPIEST. 

You will be this proud, happy, confident person. You will be the girl who is going to do big things,so do not let small things get you right now. Trust me, you will be so busy working on yourself that you’ll have no time for all this. 

JUST HOLD ON TIGHT. YOU ARE DOING FAR BETTER THAN YOU THINK YOU ARE
