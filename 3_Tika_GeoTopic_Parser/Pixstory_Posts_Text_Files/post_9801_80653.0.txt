The few months I spent in Afghanistan 12 years ago consisted of becoming familiar with family I didn’t know I had, playing with children who shared my blood, swimming in rivers that were in my land, speaking in a language that my ancestors spoke before me. It felt like home. It felt completely right, and I knew that was where my soul belonged.

The 12 year old me didn’t realize it, but those interactions impacted me in every way for the rest of my life. I had found a sense of belonging; something I could never claim in the foreign country I grew up in. I had found my people, my place, and my home. And then I had to leave.

It is that connection to my motherland which inspires me to create the art that I do today, and it is the faces of my people that give me strength to never give up trying to do my part to make Afghanistan a peaceful place to live again.
