F R I E N D S is a fantastic television show Possibly one of the most popular shows in television history Even after years it is still considered the best show of all time Though I believe it is a little overrated it is a terrific show that you can watch at any moment and enjoy a good chuckle For a light laugh I still occasionally watch the Friends marathon on Comedy Central Overall buddies is an excellent show to watch if you want to have a good time Friends on the other hand is not for those looking for a terrific engaging plot You will not be disappointed if you watch it for entertainment
