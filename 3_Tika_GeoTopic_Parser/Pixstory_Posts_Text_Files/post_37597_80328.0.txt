India won the second ODI and now lead the 3 match series 2-0. 

West Indies won the toss and opted to bowl first at the Narendra Modi stadium. 
Suryakumar Yadav and KL Rahul's knocks of  64 and 49 respectively helped India put 237 runs on board as West Indies managed to get the Indian openers out in quick succession. 

Prasidh Krishna was the star performer for the Indian bowling unit as he picked up 4 wickets in 9 overs while conceding only 12 runs and bowled 3 maiden overs. 

West Indies lost by 44 runs as their top order succumbed under the pressure of the Indian bowling unit once again. Shamarh Brooks 44(64) and Akeal Hosein	34(52) were the standout performers when it was West Indies' turn to bat but their efforts were just not enough. 

This match also saw a few changes in the Indian unit with Rishab Pant opening with Rohit Sharma as opposed to the usual opening duo. Although the idea of Rishab Pant opening excited the fans, the plan did not work out well enough as Rishab Pant only managed to score 18 runs off 34 balls.

Virat Kohli continued his recent dull form scoring only 18 runs off 30 balls, fans still await his 71st century a feat he has been scrambling to get to.
