Today Etruscan can be read and deciphered very well because it is written with characters also used by the Greeks However it is one thing to be able to read a language and another to understand it Etruscan in fact is not a fully understood and interpreted language There are short formulas that linguists have managed to understand because they can put in parallel with other Greek and Latin formulas However, the great Etruscan texts still remain complicated and extremely difficult to interpret. During an excavation at the Etruscan site of Pyrgi Lazio directed by Massimo Pallottino, three gold plates called Lamine di Pyrgi were found. This discovery had given the illusion of being the key to understanding the Etruscan language, this is because the three slabs were written two in Etruscan and one in Phoenician, a language that we are able to read and understand. Therefore, we immediately thought of a bilingual that would finally allow scholars to understand the Etruscan language However, the Etruscan slabs and the one in Phoenician have a similar content but not literally it is not a real literal translation So the Etruscan language still remains largely a mystery for us today especially as regards the texts an example is the Sarcophagus of the Magistrate depicting the deceased holding a long unrolled papyrus in his hand containing the story of his life of which we are able to understand only certain passages Source Giulia Civita
