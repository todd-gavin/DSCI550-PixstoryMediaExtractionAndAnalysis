23-year-old French International Jules Kounde has reportedly caught the eye of Chelsea football club. The centre back currently plies his trade at Sevilla and has put in some clutch performances throughout the season. Owing to this, Sevilla finished fourth in LaLiga and have qualified for the UEFA Champions League for next season. 

Chelsea are in search of centreback's after both Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen have reportedly signalled their departure. Both the players were integral parts of Thomas Tuchel's set up. However, their contracts have expired and they have decided not to renew with Chelsea.

Owing to this, the Blues are in the market for a centre back with Jules Kounde high on their transfer shortlist. But signing the French star would certainly not be cheap. Sevilla have reportedly demanded around £67m for the players' services. This is also supposedly the release clause for Kounde. 

Sevilla would also be reluctant to let Jules Kounde leave as they would need the player in the UCL. However, Chelsea have prioritized the defender's signing. Hence they would go all out for the centre back. Owner Todd Boehly has reportedly granted the Blues a £200m transfer fee to rebuild in the summer. Hence it has to be seen if Jules Kounde would be their marquee signing before next season!
