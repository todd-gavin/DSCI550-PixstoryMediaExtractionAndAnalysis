All of our traumas, struggles are valid. Just because someone have it worse doesn't mean yours is less or something invalid. 

Everyone have their own unique struggles, we can only understand them to an extend and the rest is unexplainable as words fail to put those struggles into a logical phrase. 

Also those who are struggling quietly, those who don't have a support system, or scared to open up, those dealing with suicidal thoughts, just know that this is going to get better and its just the time. 

Maybe you could drive your thoughts to those days when you laughed your lungs out, when you fixed that one memory in your mind and said you will never forget that day, go through those videos with your friends who you might or might not be in touch with and maybe this could bring you a smile and a relief.
