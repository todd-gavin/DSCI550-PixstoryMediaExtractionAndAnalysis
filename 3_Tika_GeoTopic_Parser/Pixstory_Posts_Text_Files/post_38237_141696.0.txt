Brazil's heartbeat Neymar jr did not have the best of time with PSG in the 2021/22 season. Injuries and a loss of form almost even led to the winger's exit from the club in the 2022 summer transfer window. But fast forward to early September, Neymar is arguably the best player for the Parisians at the moment. 
The Media, Football pundits, and even the PSG management supposedly targeted Neymar's lack of form for PSG's early exit in knockout competitions. However, the Brazilian has not let these talks affect him. Instead, Neymar has hit a new gear in the lead-up to the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
The Brazilian maestro has already scored 8 goals and provided 6 assists in just 7 Ligue 1 games this season. In comparison, Neymar netted 13 goals and 6 assists in 22 Ligue 1 games last season. This crucial upturn of form has helped PSG to gain 19 out of a possible 21 points in the first seven league games of the season. 
Outperforming Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe, Neymar has proven his worth in PSG's attack as the club is on the hunt to win all possible trophies including their maiden UEFA Champions League this season. The Brazilian's best Ligue 1 showing for PSG came in his debut season (17/18) when he netted 19 goals and provided 13 assists. Can Neymar overhaul his previous record? Only time will tell...
