Racial prejudice is a rigid and unfair generalisation and assessment done by certain people toward other people without knowing clearly about them. Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird tries to talk about racial prejudice from some angles. Due to their different skin colour, African Americans have constantly faced racial inequality, discrimination, and prejudice throughout history. They were segregated and were unwanted and uncivilised individuals. Racial segregation was considered a vast veil that concealed the humanity of African Americans and disallowed their good nature to be realised by white people, a reason why they were accused of any illegal or criminal accidents that took place in the environment of the white without investigating their innocence. The impact of blacks’ lives in To Kill a Mockingbird. Lee's attempts to eliminate segregation, racial prejudice and injustice are almost perceptible. The novel’s moral message is to offer a letter to the world that they should live together in peace through cooperation, kindness, and respect.

On the one hand, Lee makes the children who are still innocent and unaware of such prejudices ask directly pointed questions. But on the other hand, adults who have already been accustomed to taking racial prejudices have to rethink them while responding to the children.
