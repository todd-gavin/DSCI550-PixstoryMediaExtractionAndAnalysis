The US and much of th Europe are under the heat wages and the democratic politicians and climate activists are growing increasingly disheartened by GOP disregard and legislative inaction But the continued petitions for bold climate action aren t affecting th ideological approach of many GOP lawmakers including Sen Lindsey Graham of South Carolina according to The New York Times I don t want to be lectured about what we need to do to destroy our economy in the name of climate change he told the newspaper Many Republicans have straightforwardly dismissed the idea of climate change yet some have recently agreed to the contribution of some industries in the production of greenhouse gases causing higher temperatures But that hasn t particularly led to Republicans playing a crucial role in working with Democrats on climate legislation Most Republicans have continued to push for more domestic drilling in the face of higher gasoline prices despite the Biden administration seeking to shift to wind and other low carbon energy sources as well as the production of more electric vehicles The Democratic Party has made climate change a religion and their solutions are draconian Graham told The Times despite his past support for legislation that would reduce carbon emissions In this unwavering heat many think that climate change isn t real Isn t it simply because the comfort of the homes and offices with weather conditioning devices have made them blind to the people who actually have to get out of their homes and work for a living Source Business Insider
