This man gets cooler by the minute! 

Barack Obama Presidential Library files contain chilling details of unknown vessels. Yep, you heard it right! 

The Pentagon conceded a few months ago that unusual aircraft phenomena actually occur after the broadcast of the tic-tac UFO clip. The Pentagon has stated that it is working on a top-secret initiative called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) to solve the puzzles surrounding UFO sightings. 

Now, the Barack Obama Presidential Library claims to have tens of thousands of files indicating the existence of UFOs, potentially of extraterrestrial origin. 

IBT times reported that the Presidential Library reported that it possesses over 3000 papers and over 26,000 electronic data that could point to the presence of unidentified flying objects in answer to a Freedom of Information Act request.

Also, even Obama thinks aliens are real! 

Obama remarked a few months ago that predicting the course of UFOs is impossible. 

"We have no idea how they travel or what their trajectory is. They lacked a clearly discernible pattern. As a result, I believe that people continue to take it seriously, attempting to figure out what it is "Obama stated. 

Obama also prophesied that if aliens were discovered in the future, new religions will emerge. 

"But, without a doubt, there would be quick talks about how, in order to defend ourselves, we need to spend a lot more money on weapons systems. And new religions would emerge, leading to who knows what kinds of debates "Obama added.
