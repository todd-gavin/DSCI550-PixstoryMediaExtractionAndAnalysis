The old Bombay cinema, full of over-the-hill big stars and baying-for-boycott public is in its death throes. 
The new Bombay cinema, shorn of glamour, and high on quality content, is slowly creating its own space on the OTT platforms, that offer a relatively freer and unconstrained space to the filmmakers. 
'Delhi Crime Season 2' on Netflix is a great example. 
Its a riveting crime series based on true events. It starts slowly but then a combination of great writing & equally good performances take a grip on you that never slackens. You keep getting drawn into it deeper & deeper & can't let go till you have seen all 5 episodes. 
The cast led by Shefali Shah and Rajesh Tailang is first rate. Shefali Shah is outstanding, as usual. She makes you experience all the emotions with her effortless acting. Rasika Duggal, another very talented actor, has a small role in season 2, but she essays it nicely. Anurag Arora, Gopal Dutt and Sidharth Bhardwaj are as good as ever. 
A special mention must be made of the cinematography and background music that lend the webseries a realistic touch. You feel a sense of doom running through. 
So if popular Hindi cinema means films like 'Dhaakad', 'Bachchan Pandey', and 'Samrat Prithviraj', then I would say, "No, thank you". 
But if it means something like 'Delhi Crime', I am always up for it.
