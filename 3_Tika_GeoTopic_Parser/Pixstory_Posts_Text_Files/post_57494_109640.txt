The failure of Roe V Wade became evident because it was considered a women s issue and not everyone s issue Well it of course is a women s issue as it is related to her body and choice but the people making decisions on their rights are probably not the women Most of the political power lies in the hands of men and their understanding of women s rights is insufficient to compel them to decide in their favour It would all come from their point of making it more difficult for women Nevertheless the most ironic part is that it is men who put women in this situation the unwanted pregnancy so for every woman ranting or protesting against her rights there s a man who is apparently responsible for her condition fighting right now This pragmatically justifies the idea why it is not a women s movement but instead a men s movement too Therefore they need to enter the movement more actively and fiercely There should also be banners and posters portraying what men have to say about abortion how relieved they ll feel not being a father at the time they don t want to how different circumstances don t allow them to have a baby with their partners so that abortions rights would be equally beneficial for those men the men who are responsible can still make a voice and hold hands of women who have been fighting alone for their autonomy and rights The movement should be for both of them and should affect them equally This could have brought a political change or maybe it can get now
