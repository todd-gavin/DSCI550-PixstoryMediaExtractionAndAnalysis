A covid booster dose different than what you have taken previously seems to work better . 
This was shown in a Brazilian study published in BRitish Medical journal . 

A booster dose of a covid-19 jab other than CoronaVac significantly increased antibodies in those who had received two doses of the Chinese vaccine, a study funded by Brazil's Ministry of Health has found.

A booster dose of Pfizer Biontech’s mRNA vaccine boosted antibody levels the most, followed by Oxford AstraZeneca, Janssen, and a third dose of CoronaVac. All booster vaccines were effective and safe, concluded the researchers at the University of Oxford, who co-led the study published in the Lancet. 
CoronaVac is manufactured by Chinese pharmaceutical Sinovac and is the world’s most administered coronavirus vaccine, making up two of the 10 billion vaccine doses given globally. 

“The new data presented here show the extraordinary response to a third dose of coronavirus vaccines in a heterologous vaccine schedule,” said Sue Ann Costa Clemens at the Oxford Vaccine Group and the study’s lead author in Brazil.

The findings support Brazil’s decision to use mRNA and viral vector vaccines as covid-19 boosters and “will also guide other low and middle income countries in setting up the most optimal and affordable vaccines ,” she added 

To test the impact of the different boosters, 1240 participants who had received their second dose of CoronaVac six months prior in Sao Paulo and Salvador, Brazil, were given a randomised third dose of Oxford AstraZeneca, Pfizer BioNTech, Janssen, or CoronaVac.

Blood tests of the participants 28 days later showed that Pfizer increased their antibody levels 152 fold, Astrazeneca 90 fold, Janssen 77 fold, and CoronaVac 12-fold.

Neutralising antibodies, which bind to a virus in order to block infection, were detectable in 100% of those who received an Oxford AstraZeneca, Pfizer BioNTech, or Janssen booster, and in 83% of those who received a third dose of CoronaVac.

Only 20% of adults aged 18 to 60 and 9% of those over 60 had detectable levels of neutralising antibodies before the boosters.
