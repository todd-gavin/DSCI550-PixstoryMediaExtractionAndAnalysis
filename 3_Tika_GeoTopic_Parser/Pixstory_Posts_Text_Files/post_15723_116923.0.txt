In pic: The tranquil Fälensee lake in the Alpstein range of the Appenzell Alps, Appenzell Innerrhoden, Switzerland.

A jewel of a lake, embedded between the steep rock cliffs of Widderalpstöcke, and the peaks of the Hundstein in the north, the Altmann, Saxerfirst and the Kreuzberge mountains in the east, Lake Fälen's nearly black water and its constantly changing kaleidoscope of reflections never fails to fascinate its tourists.
