Specially-abled people already face barriers to contraception and abortion. For them, Sex-ed is not accessible. 

Sometimes they are not able to comprehend or defend themselves or even understand what is happening to them.

 Health care is not accessible, and transportation and telehealth are not accessible. Most of them suffer in poverty and they mostly rely on the government for health care. 

There are multiply marginalized and hence face discrimination and oppression.

Some of them have complex medical conditions and hence pregnancy is dangerous. Abortion is an essential factor for specially-abled people too. Overturning Roe v/a Wade has put them in threat as unlike others who at least have a possibility to travel to other states for abortion-it is extremely difficult for many specially-abled people.
