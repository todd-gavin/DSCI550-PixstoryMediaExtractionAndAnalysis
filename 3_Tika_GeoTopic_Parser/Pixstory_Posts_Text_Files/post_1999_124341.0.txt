Emmett Till, a 14-year-old black boy from Mississippi, was killed by a mob of lynchers in August of 1955 after a white woman, Carolyn Bryant Donham, accused him of sexual assault. Emmitt Till was reportedly so severely beaten that he could only be identified by the ring he wore.

In June of this year, the revelation of a warrant for Donham's arrest issued in 1955 prompted fresh efforts to punish her for her participation in the lynching. Donham is still alive and in her late eighties; however, her family has concealed her whereabouts.

Very recently, a grand jury in Leflore County, Mississippi, decided not to indict Donham for her involvement in the lynching. She was charged with kidnapping and manslaughter. This is a disappointing conclusion given that the police had probable cause to arrest her at the time of the incident and that no one involved in his case was ever brought to justice.

The case of Emmett Till is often considered as the spark that ignited the civil rights movement. This most recent failure to prosecute Donham demonstrates why this movement has acquired so much traction, as prosecutors, police, and the people of the communities permitted their bigotry to turn to a lust for blood.
