Oftentimes we see that there are less than a least people who would tend to do things that portray a carefree attitude otherwise all else are following the conventional paths to doing the right thing in their life By conformities I don t mean very strict conventional behaviours but conformities like doing just mundane regular work the way it should be done There s nothing unique about your behaviour or what you do This way people repress their inner nature in the struggle to conform bringing them stress I mean dining etiquettes are essential but why not just have your food in the most carefree manner Let s not think about what and why others would judge you for not adhering to the set rules and do it freely as every time we are not a part of any professional meeting it could be a family dinner or outings with friends But instead you ll do it to saddle yourself with things you don t want to do Attending a family wedding or any occasion where everyone is enjoying by dancing or vibing with the song but since you have different moves to show which deviates from what others are doing you decide to sit quietly or do it the way all others do are doing to look perfect These are some mere events and habits thousands of them exist where people avoid doing what they like or repress their nonchalance to conform to some set rules and standards of living Unfortunately this behaviour of always doing the right stresses them and they live an unhappy life most of the time they yearn for the next time when they can be just themselves the real people the non conformists
