International Monetary Fund's (IMF's) Deputy Director, Fiscal Affairs Department Paolo Mauro lauded India's digital cash transfer schemes to help people with low income levels as a "logistical marvel".
In case India, the use of UIDAI-- the Aadhaar in identifying beneficiaries for the implementation of social programmes is striking, he added.
"India's case is quite impressive. The sheer size of country makes it a logistical marvel how these programs, seeking to help people at low-income levels, reach hundreds of millions of people," said Mauro.
Mauro was responding to a question on direct cash transfer schemes being implemented by the government.
Mauro said IMF monitors how countries deploy cash transfers with respect to social programmes.
"There is a lot to learn from India. There is a lot to learn from some other examples around the world. We have examples from pretty much every continent and every level of income. If I look at the case of India, it is actually quite impressive," Mauro responded to the query from PTI.
