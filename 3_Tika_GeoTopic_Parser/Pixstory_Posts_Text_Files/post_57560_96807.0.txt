Brandon Ingram's outstanding performance called for a win for his team, The New Orleans Pelicans. He became the first player to score 30- plus points in the Pelicans franchise hence making history.

In the third quarter, Ingram flipped the game in the Pelicans' favour, scoring 16 of the team's 35 points, including this emphatic one-handed jam that had the Smoothie King Center crowd on their feet.

Pelicans head coach had a lot to say about this game-changer; he said, "Brandon is playing some of his best basketball of the season. He’s doing it on the biggest stage. It’s great to see. Brandon is capable. I’ve said it before. He’s the real deal, and he goes out on the floor and puts the work in at practice, and we’re seeing it on display."

Brandon believes their time has arrived, which he has proved with his fantastic performance in the game.

Indeed the win is appreciated and calls for celebration, but they still have to face the actual game, as they look to take the lead in the series in Game 5 on Tuesday, April 26 in Phoenix.
