Adele fans got a major treat this weekend, when the British singer headlined the American Express Presents BST Hyde Park festival for two nightsâ€”her first public concert in five years. For the first time, the star performed songs from her album 30 live to a crowd of over 65,000 fans during her two-hour sets. (In October, however, she did play a small secret show at the L.A. Griffith Observatory, which was televised).

It was only natural that the always-glamorous Adele pulled out all the fashion stops for the stage. F0r night one, Adele chose a chic Schiaparelli look. It included a floor-length velvet gown, complete with long sleeves and a halter neckline. She accessorized it with gold jewelry such as a thin belt and statement earrings (one of her signatures, after all). For night two, Adele then changed into a black, off-the-shoulder Louis Vuitton dress with sequin-embroidered ruffles, which shimmered in the stage lights.
