 Bananas Bananas need room temperature for two reasons The warm temperatures help the fruit finish ripening and the light and air slow down decay Garlic Garlic deteriorates at a quicker pace when stored in the refrigerator due to the added moisture unless already peeled and prepared It s best kept in a dry place with good air circulation at room temperature and away from the light Nuts While lower temperatures may help to preserve the natural oils in nuts the cold can also impair their flavour If you plan to use them in the next few weeks it s best to store nuts in an airtight container in the pantry Honey Ever forget a jar of honey in the back of the pantry for oh a really long time The low temperatures cause it to crystallise and solidify it so better to avoid it Onions Whole onions should ideally be kept in a cool dark place They contain starch so they ll become damp and soggy and ultimately spoil if left in the fridge for too long Potatoes Cold temperatures mean a potato s starch turns into sugar which can make it discoloured and tasteless Potatoes should be stored unwashed in a spot well away from any sunlight Coffee Coffee naturally takes on the smell of the ingredients around it and moisture so the fridge can damage its flavour It should be kept in an airtight container so it stays fresh until the time comes to brew it Dried spices The refrigerator is the enemy of dried spices as unwanted condensation is likely to get in every time you remove them To maximise shelf life keep in a dark dry place and keep them away from extreme heat too Oil Much like honey vegetable olive coconut and other cooking oils will quickly solidify in the fridge Keep them on a cool dark shelf in the pantry instead Eggs You may be surprised to see eggs on the list as they are supposed to be kept in the fridge Eggs should not be put in the fridge They are not sterilised and their shell is a good barrier
