 Saawariya Rocket Singh Besharam Roy Bombay Velvet Tamasha And now Shamshera However it is depressing to see a terrific film like Rocket Singh in the list of flops I think Tamasha is also a good movie Ranbir is a talented actor Some of his films didn t work out at the Box Office not because he failed to deliver but the scripts were awful Hopefully he will do more successful movies in future Let see that Brahmastra is going to be hit or flop
