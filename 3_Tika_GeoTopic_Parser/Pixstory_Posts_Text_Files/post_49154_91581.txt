When we were kids our families were more structured than what they are today I remember helping my father fix faucets and tires while my sister and mother took up less laborious tasks like making meals and cleaning It was a pretty simple arrangement and everyone was happy at the end of the day Today it seems like everyone especially women is too aggressive about all little things Why can t we stick to the traditional ways It s odd to see little girls playing with toy guns and boys playing with dolls It looks so unnatural and makes the situation worse because it feels like the character traits of women and men are being forcibly swapped I don t understand why girls today are so angry And angry over little things that is What the youngsters call toxic gender roles today are in fact disciplined structures that are the secret to happy families Men are supposed to be making decisions since they re capable of protecting the families and thus men should be raised like that It is unfortunate that society is so keen on feminizing masculinity Men are not supposed to be in the kitchen While it s great when they help their wives out on a holiday it s still a fact that they re supposed to be providing for their families They re not supposed to play dress up they re supposed to be taught finances Don t get me wrong I m not against women rights and equality but it s also a fact that traditional gender roles play a major part in society Trying to change that is dismantling an already existing system I ask what s the need The system is not flawless but nothing is However it s working as it has for hundreds of years Let men be masculine and stop forcing girls into work that s not for them Let people do what they re supposed to do
