A pro abortion group known as Rise Up Abortion Rights recently descended upon the home of Justice Amy Coney Barrett wearing all white with period blood stains between their legs and carrying baby doll toys in protest of the potential overturn of Roe v Wade According to a tweet they are there to STOP SCOTUS from overturning Roe This conduct is unworthy of any American who supports a democratic form of governance Justices of the Supreme Court are independent and base their judgements on their interpretation of the Constitution not their policy preferences Unfortunately the media and politicians have made extraordinarily unintelligent people more aware of the importance of the judicial branch and as a result these same people have been led to utterly misunderstand the role of the judicial branch in our form of government seeing them as policymakers rather than judges People and politicians only seek to persuade judges to make their desired verdicts in underdeveloped countries In Russia for instance there have been several accounts of judges laughing at the prosecution s lack of evidence in criminal while upholding life sentences In a similar way these demonstrators are seeking to coerce the judges into altering their judgements by using intimidation tactics such as making them fear for their lives
