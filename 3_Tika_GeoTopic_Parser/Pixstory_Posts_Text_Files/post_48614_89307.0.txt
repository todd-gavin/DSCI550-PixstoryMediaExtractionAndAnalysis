His hallmark motion, a left-handed jump shot with his feet kicking up behind him, is what he is best remembered for. Chick Hearn, the legendary Laker announcer, gave him the nickname Fall Back Baby because of his shooting style (Barnett was also known as "the Skull").

With a 23.1 average, Barnett led New York in scoring in the first of his nine seasons with the team, and he made his sole NBA All-Star appearance in 1968.

All of the components were in place for the Knicks' first-ever championship in the 1969-70 season. With rising-star Frazier in the backcourt, Barnett was the team's "old man" at 34 years old. However, he played in every game that season, including the playoffs, where he averaged 16.9 points per game.

He was also an important part of the defensive puzzle in the finals, assisting in the guarding of Jerry West. The Knicks, of course, came out on top, thanks to Reed's heroics. Barnett's victory in the finals was his sixth in three different collegiate and professional leagues. In 1973, he would add another.

After the 1973-74 season, Barnett, Reed, and DeBusschere all retired, bringing the most successful era in Knicks history to a close.

The Knick GM who traded for Barnett, Eddie Donovan, said of his guard: “He’s got one of the best basketball minds of any player I’ve ever known. Everything he does is for a purpose.”

Other than being an incredible player, he was also great at chess. 

He was also known for his dry wit and sense of humour. "Don't worry coach, you just come and check my room," Barnett said to his coach, who was reminding the players of a bed check, while playing for the Lakers, "There will be a bed there."
