I m on the train to the game right now so here s some pre match thoughts ahead of Arsenal s Europa League tie against Bodo Glimt Firstly from some of the stuff I ve seen they re actually not that bad With all due respect I can t say I ve ever watched them nor had I heard of them prior to the groups being drawn but they will not be awful That being said I d still like to see a thoroughly rotated Arsenal side Here s how I want Arteta to set the team up GK TurnerLB TierneyCB TomiyasuCB HoldingRB CedricDM Lokonga Xhaka c VieiraLW NelsonST NketiahRW MarquinhosCompletely rotated side from the North London Derby bar Granit Xhaka With Cedric now fit and available to play we can play Tomiyasu left centre back where he plays for Japan allowing all four of our main defenders to rest Unfortunately there s no back up to Xhaka right now With Elneny out Lokonga has to play at the though I would prefer to see him in the left half space It will be great to see more of Marquinhos and also to give Nelson a chance Feels like make it break for Reiss now Really hoping he can have an impact Hard to judge without a confirmed lineup but I m expecting a comfortable win tonight Come on you Gunners
