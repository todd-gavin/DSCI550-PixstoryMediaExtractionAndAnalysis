The Embankment
BY T. E. HULME

(The fantasia of a fallen gentleman on a cold, bitter night.)
Once, in the finesse of fiddles found I ecstasy,
In the flash of gold heels on the hard pavement.
Now see I
That warmth’s the very stuff of poesy.
Oh, God, make small
The old star-eaten blanket of the sky,
That I may fold it round me and in comfort lie.

Thomas Ernest Hulme was an English critic and poet who, through his writings on art, literature and politics, had a notable influence upon modernism. He was an aesthetic philosopher and the 'father of imagism'.

We often tend to forget how the earth is all we need when we have got so many things wanted and unwanted in life. The poet explores the subtlety of life. How the sky is enough for him to comfort him and how the warmth the world provides is enough. It also gives hope that the world will give reasons to live on even if everything is lost.
