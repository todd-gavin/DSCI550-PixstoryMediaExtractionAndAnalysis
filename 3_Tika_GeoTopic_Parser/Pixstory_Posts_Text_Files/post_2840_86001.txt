Can you have women s rights as the Christian Science Monitor asks without abortion rights During the last couple of years that fundamental right is taking priority in one after another country in Latin America whereas in the US it is being curtailed in a number of states prompting some men to opt for vasectomy as a gesture of support for the women s cause First South America where the tide is turning Until early only Cuba Uruguay Guyana and some regions of Mexico used to allow elective abortion Since then Mexico Argentina and last month Colombia have joined the list Pro choice activists have reasons to feel that the momentum is gathering and more countries would join the trend They are particularly looking at seven countries than ban abortion even under special conditions like rape or when the health or life of the pregnant woman is at risk They are El Salvador Honduras the Dominican Republic Nicaragua Jamaica Suriname and Haiti In the US the tide is turning the other way Since several Republic ruled states led by Texas are restricting the time limit within which abortion is allowed to the extent of making it next to impossible The Supreme Court judgment of known as Roe vs Wade which equated abortion with the fundamental rights of women is itself under legal challenge Global comparisons To stand in support of women some men have turned to vasectomy Data on this would be difficult to gather but a Texas urologist said he had a increase in scheduled vasectomies after the state s abortion ban went into effect on September The gesture is promoted on bumper stickers and social media with catchy lines Against abortion Have a Vasectomy One small snip for man one giant leap for Humankind ness In Pennsylvania a Democrat representative even introduced a legislation parodying the Texas law His proposal would require men to get vasectomies after the birth of third child or when they turn whichever comes first Of course vasectomy cannot be a replacement for the right to abortion but it s an act of love
