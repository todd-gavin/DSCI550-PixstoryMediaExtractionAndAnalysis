The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has apologised to Sacheen Littlefeather, nearly 50 years after she was booed off the Oscars stage for declining Marlon Brando's medal on his behalf in protest of the film industry's treatment of Native Americans. 

MC reported that at the 1973 Academy Awards, Littlefeather, an Apache and Yaqui, received jeers as he attempted to explain why Brando, who was not present, could not accept the best actor award for "The Godfather" because of his absence.

“The abuse you endured because of this statement was unwarranted and unjustified," said the apology letter sent in June from then-Academy president David Rubin.

"The emotional burden you have lived through and the cost to your own career in our industry are irreparable.”

"For too long the courage you showed has been unacknowledged. For this, we offer both our deepest apologies and our sincere admiration."
