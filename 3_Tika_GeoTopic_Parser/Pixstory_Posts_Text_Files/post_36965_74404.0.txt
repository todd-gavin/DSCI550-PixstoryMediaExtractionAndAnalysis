We are all just like a flower in someone's life .
A flower grows day by day and blossoms in its own unique color , we all adore that flower , we clik pictures , we pluck em , we use them , and then ...when the flower losts its fragrance , when it losts its color , when it gets old , we leave them , we throw them away . Thats what humans are doing with other humans .
