A woman is struggling to survive after she was knocked to the ground, punched and kicked by an assailant who then dragged her between two parked cars and tried to rape her, police said Sunday.

The NYPD released surveillance images of the suspect walking down the street pulling on a pair of blue surgical gloves moments before the sick attack.

The 43-year-old victim was walking down W. 123rd St. when the assailant socked her in the head, knocking her to the ground, near Adam Clayton Powell Blvd. about 11:30 p.m. Friday, according to the NYPD.

The attacker kicked her repeatedly in the head and body while she was down.

The fiend dragged her between two parked cars on the leafy Harlem street, stripped her clothes off and tried to rape her. It’s unclear why the man halted his attack but he eventually left her for dead.

The woman suffered severe head trauma and was taken to Harlem Hospital, where she’s in critical condition, according to police.

Authorities are considering the crime an attempted murder.

Cops are asking the public’s help identifying the suspect and tracking him down. He is described as in his 40s and 5-foot-8 with a dark complexion and stocky build. He was wearing a dark green camouflage-pattern Yankees baseball hat, a black face mask, a white hoodie with colorful designs and red lettering on the front, black pants and black shoes.

Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-8477. All calls will be kept confidential.
