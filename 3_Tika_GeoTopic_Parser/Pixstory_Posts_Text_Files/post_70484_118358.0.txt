There are two things that people need to realise about the National Herald case. First is that The Gandhis intervened when an iconic newspaper, National Herald, founded by Jawaharlal Nehru, was going down under because of debts, that the shares were transferred to a Not for Profit Trust, and not to a for profit Conglomerate. The second thing is that the allegation that Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi or Sam Petroda did this for their profit isn’t true. They have not sold a single asset of National Herald, it all remains as it is. 

In short it is obvious that this is a pathetic attempt to divert attention from the sharp rise in prices, inflation, religious divide & animosity perpetrated by those in power currently to steer away attention from their total mismanagement of the Country and its affairs. What better way to divert attention than to accuse the leaders of the leading opposition party of corruption and use the ED to question a frail old Widow who lost her husband (in the service of this Nation) in a Bomb Blast by terrorists. What better diversion than to keep the Principle Opposition under a scanner of doubt. And that’s why the entire party stands by Sonia Gandhi! 

I am sure that Sonia Gandhi and the Congress Party will overcome this vendetta politics engineered by devious fanatics for the sake of attention diversion from the ills that plague this country because of pure mismanagement of the current Government. Also wish that they are able to revive the rich heritage that National Herald stood for, guided by the strong cultural & patriotic influence of Nehru.
