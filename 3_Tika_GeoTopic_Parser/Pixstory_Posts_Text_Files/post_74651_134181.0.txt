The latest update in the Sonali Phogat murder case suggests the BJP leader was force-fed a ‘deadly’ concoction of synthetic drugs by two of her associates, Sudhir Sangwan and Sukhwinder Singh, which led to her death, as reported by news✅✅

The senior police official said on Sonali Phogat death case: “When one of the accused was confronted with the video that shows him forcefully feeding her the drink, both Sudhir and Sukhwinder confessed that they intentionally mixed her drinks with an obnoxious concoction of chemicals. 😳😳They gave it to her and after that, the victim was unable to remain in control of herself. Around 4 am, when she was still unable to control herself, the victim is seen running towards the bathroom and stays inside for two hours. The accused has not given us an explanation as to what happened then.”💔😳
