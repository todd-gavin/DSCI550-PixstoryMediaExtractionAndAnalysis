 Switch of Shape hurts both teams Chelsea s loss at the weekend wasn t exactly the way Chelsea had been playing recently having won six in a row prior to that Brentford smashed a weakened but complacent team at the Bridge and it highlighted the need for Thomas Tuchel to stick to the man defence Having not played this way since the days of Antonio Conte even some of the more experienced players at the club took time to fit into the system Tuchel introduced when he arrived With time the has become synonymous with the way Chelsea play Their compactness in structure fluidity in build up play and defensive cover down the centre all comes thanks to their ability to master the shape The down sides of a back four are too many to name for Chelsea Real Madrid too suffered a similar quite disastrous fate when they were decimated at the Bernab u last month courtesy of Xavi s Bar a Karim Benzema s injury forced Ancelotti to switch shapes and to introduce strategies that d probably never been tried and tested before on the training pitch Or so it seemed from the way they performed that way With Kroos and Modri pressing Casemiro almost as a third centre back both wingers pinned back in their defensive positions at all time it was a total mess By the time Real could regain any sense of what they were doing Barcelona had put four past them and Ancelotti had played around with his system a few more times The point I m trying to make here isn t just that both Chelsea and Madrid are comfortable playing one way in one shape which should be the case really for any team Rather simply that change can overwhelm a team when they play a certain way for so long Which is why I expect both Tuchel and Ancelotti to make pragmatic decisions tonight in line with what s happened in their recent experimental games
