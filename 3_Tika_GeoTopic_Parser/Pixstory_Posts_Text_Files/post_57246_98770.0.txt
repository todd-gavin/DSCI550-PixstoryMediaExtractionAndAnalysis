Emotions like grief and sorrow cannot be explained by someone who hasn't endured them and saying anything would be an understatement.
But grief is a response to losing a loved one and mourning their death.
People have different ways to bear the pain that comes with grief. Some are able to forget it easily while for others it is an indelible mark and they don't leave the sight of constant bereavement.
And this is what the American Psychiatric Association terms prolonged grief disorder. Prolonged grief happens after losing someone close and is characterized by a persistent and debilitating grief response lasting at least 12 months for adults or six months for children and adolescents. The research around prolonged grief began in the 1980s when doctors noticed that some people in mourning did not respond to antidepressants or interpersonal psychotherapy for depression. 
In this disorder, a grieving person is imbued with the feeling of darkness where he is not able to accept the loss at least for some months.

This prolonged grief can cause serious health disorders, even heart disease. Dr Holly Prigerson, professor of geriatrics and co-director of Cornell’s Center for Research on End-of-Life Care in New York City says,
“We have also seen a significant risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours so it’s critical to recognize this condition to help avoid these physical and mental effects."
The signs that show a person is suffering from this disorder may include, Avoiding reminders that the loved one passed away, feeling detached from others, difficulty moving on with life, problems engaging with friends, pursuing interests and planning for the future, emotional pain, including anger, bitterness and sorrow, extreme loneliness, feeling that life is meaningless.

Prolonged Grief disorder can be treated by a psychotherapy or by practicing self care.
