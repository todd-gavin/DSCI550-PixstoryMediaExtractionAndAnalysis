In a terrible goof-up in Japan, high school girl athletes in a 5,000 km walking race were given a hand sanitiser to drink instead of water which resulted in three of them being hospitalised.

One athlete is reported to have vomited and collapsed after drinking the sanitiser, while the two others spat it out.

The three athletes were reported to be recovering and a government inquiry has been ordered into the incident.
