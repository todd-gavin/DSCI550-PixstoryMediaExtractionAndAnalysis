The Painter BY JOHN ASHBERY Sitting between the sea and the buildings He enjoyed painting the sea s portrait But just as children imagine a prayer Is merely silence he expected his subject To rush up the sand and seizing a brush Plaster its portrait on the canvas So there was never any paint on his canvas Until the people who lived in the buildings Put him to work Try using the brush As a means to an end Select for a portrait Something less angry and large and more subject To a painter s moods or perhaps to a prayer How could he explain to them his prayer That nature not art might usurp the canvas He chose his wife for a new subject Making her vast like ruined buildings As if forgetting itself the portrait Had expressed itself without a brush Slightly encouraged he dipped his brush In the sea murmuring a heartfelt prayer My soul when I paint this next portrait Let it be you who wrecks the canvas The news spread like wildfire through the buildings He had gone back to the sea for his subject Imagine a painter crucified by his subject Too exhausted even to lift his brush He provoked some artists leaning from the buildings To malicious mirth We haven t a prayer Now of putting ourselves on canvas Or getting the sea to sit for a portrait Others declared it a self portrait Finally all indications of a subject Began to fade leaving the canvas Perfectly white He put down the brush At once a howl that was also a prayer Arose from the overcrowded buildings They tossed him the portrait from the tallest of the buildings And the sea devoured the canvas and the brush As though his subject had decided to remain a prayer The poem describes the communal and traditional beliefs of the society because of which they cannot accept change and have put restrictions on the freedom of art The poet is not just talking about painting but is talking about art in all its forms Writers are stuck between their ideas and the norms and values of society
