The world has been a tizzy ever since Russia amassed more than 100,000 troops on its border with Ukraine. President Joe Biden has said that the invasion could most likely happen in February. And the Western countries have been warning Russian President Vladimir Putin of serious consequences if it goes ahead and attacks its neighbour.

But Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been asking the West to stand-up for his country, wants a favor from the U.S. and others.  "We don't need panic," he has told a news conference in Kyiv.

Zelensky has a reason. His country’s is facing an unprecedented exodus of capital and the Ukrainian economy could be in deep crisis and his own government could be in trouble even if the much-feared Russian invasion doesn’t take place.  “I’m the president of Ukraine, I’m based here and I think I know the details deeper than any other president,” Zelensky said to journalists of international media recently.

Zelensky should know. Ukraine’s economy is in dire straits with its currency hyrvnia dropping by well over 8 percent ever since the panic over Russia started and Zelensky says that his country needs $5 billion to stabilize the economy because of the exodus of capital and other reasons. Inflation is high and the economic growth figures may tank, Ukranians fear. Tourism has suffered too forcing the the government tourism body to adopted the slogan: “Keep calm and visit Ukraine’.

According to media reports, a recent call between President Biden and Zelenskiy didn’t go well after Biden told Zelensky “that there is a distinct possibility that the Russians could invade Ukraine in February.” (https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/27/politics/biden-zelensky-call/index.html)

Citing security concerns, Russia has been demanding that the US and NATO rule out Ukraine from ever joining the Atlantic alliance. While the U.S. and NATO have rebuffed the Russian demand, U.S. has been involved in intense negotiations with Russia on the same.
