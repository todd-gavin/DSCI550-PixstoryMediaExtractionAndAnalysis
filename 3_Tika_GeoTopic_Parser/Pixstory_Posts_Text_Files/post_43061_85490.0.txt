Vladimir Putin cut one solitary figure. 
Thats how it is mostly described as Putin goes about doing his business, now the war in Ukraine. 

He really looks more isolated than in some two recent, choreographed appearances with his inner circle. Then he sits at a distance from his closest advisers. Always.  Almost.
