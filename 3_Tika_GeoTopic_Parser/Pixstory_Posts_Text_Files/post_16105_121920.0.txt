To which, pat comes a cheeky reply from Aamir: "Your mother doesn't mind you talking about other people's sex life".😂😂💬💬

In a segment, Aamir asks Kareena what do you tolerate about me that you wouldn't tolerate in others.🤔🤔🤔

Kareena says: "Taking 100-200 days (to make a film) - Akshay Kumar finishes in 30 days."😜😜
