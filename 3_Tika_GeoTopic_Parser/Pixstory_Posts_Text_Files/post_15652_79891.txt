A smartphone to measure environmental noise on the national territory and associate it with the subjective assessment of acoustic well-being at the moment of measurement To design an experimental protocol capable of measuring noise in a simple and anonymous way and at the same time analyzing the data collected by a team of researchers and science communication experts from the Nano Nanoscience Institute and the GI Unit for Communications Relations with the Public UCRP of the National Research Council CNR of the Maugeri Clinical Scientific Institutes and Arpa Piemonte The results of the study were recently published in PlosOne The initiative which constitutes the second participatory science experiment after the one carried out on the measurement of intrusive light is part of the scientific activities linked to the project curated by the Cnr Scienzasulbalcone Also for this study on environmental noise pollution, the Communication and Public Relations Unit of the Cnr coordinated the communication campaign and the subsequent phase of data collection through the implementation of a dedicated website while a calibration campaign of some models had previously been carried out at the Arpa Piemonte laboratories For this Citizen Science project we received measurements made by the participants in the own homes and with their personal smartphones explains the research coordinator Carlo Andrea Rozzi of the Cnr Nano of Modena The procedure made it possible to collect the data anonymously and to introduce elements of cross-verification of the quality of the collected data such as the measure of silence, i.e. the measure of the sound level in the quietest place and moment with windows closed able to calibrate the raw noise measurements for each device model thanks to the work previously carried out in the laboratory
