Liverpool became the third Premier League Club to score nine goals in a single game after Manchester United and Leicester City following their 9-0 rout of Bournemouth at Anfield on Saturday. 

Liverpool overcame their early struggles to the new campaign as they cruised past a shambolic Bournemouth side thanks to a goal-ladden contest that features a host of goal scorers. 

Roberto Firmino got an hat-trick of assists and netted a brace while Harvey Elliot scored a net burster to claim his first Premier League goal for Liverpool. 

Luiz Diaz found the back of the net twice with defenders Alexander Arnold, Virgil Van Dijk and Fabio Carvalho also got on the scoresheet. Chris Mepham also contributed to his team’s misfortune as he put the ball in his own net just after the restart of the half. Mohammed Salah could not register his name on the scoreboard inspite of Liverpool’s dominant performance.
