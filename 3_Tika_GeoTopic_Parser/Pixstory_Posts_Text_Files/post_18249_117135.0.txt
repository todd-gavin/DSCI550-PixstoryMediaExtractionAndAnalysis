Emilia Clarke is sharing more details about the health scares that almost ended her life. 

The Game of Thrones star, 35, said that she went through the "most excruciating pain" while suffering from two separate aneurysms in 2011 and 2013.

"The amount of my brain that is no longer usableâ€”it's remarkable that I am able to speak, sometimes articulately, and live my life completely normally with absolutely no repercussions," Clarke shared during an interview on BBC's Sunday Morning. "I am in the really, really, really small minority of people that can survive that."
