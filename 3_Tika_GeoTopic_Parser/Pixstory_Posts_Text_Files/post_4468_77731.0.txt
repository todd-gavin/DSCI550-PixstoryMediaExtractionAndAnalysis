‘Tujhse Naraz nhin Zindagi’ from the movie ‘Masoom’ is my most favourite song sang by The Lagend Lata Mangeshkar.
The song is so so beautiful, it gives me immense peace Whenever i listen to this. 

Yes, i’m an old school girl, who likes to listen and enjoy 80’s and 90’s songs with my mom and dad. 🥰

My mom has a really beautiful voice, trust me. She likes to sing, she wanted to pursue her career in singing but for some reason she couldn’t , she made me listen to these old songs.

I know how to make her happy, i just play her favourite old songs on my Alexa, or whenever we are travelling somewhere, we listen to these old songs, and trust me that’s the best family time one could ever have. 

☺️I’m sharing my top most favourite list from Lata Mangeshkar, the songs i love listening… 

♥️ ‘Ajeeb dastaan hain ye, Kaha shuru kaha khatam’
