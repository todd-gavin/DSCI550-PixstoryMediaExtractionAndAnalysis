Brisbane is set to welcome the Socceroos and Matildas for friendlies in the month of September as both of Australia's national teams prepare for upcoming World Cup campaigns.

The Matildas will play Canada at Lang Park on September 3, before the Socceroos play New Zealand at the same ground on September 22.

That game will be the first for Australia's men's team in Brisbane since November 2018.

Brisbane Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner said "there has never been a more exciting time for football fans in Brisbane".

"The blockbuster matches are expected to attract 25,000 fans to our city, providing a $10 million boost to our local economy by filling hotel rooms, cafes, restaurants and more," Mr Schrinner said.

The game against New Zealand is set to be the Socceroos' farewell match before the World Cup in Qatar in November.

The Matildas have a second game against Canada on September 6 in Sydney as they continue the build up to next year's Women's World Cup on home soil.
