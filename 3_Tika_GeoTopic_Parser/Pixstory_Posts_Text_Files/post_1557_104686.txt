In all honesty the LGBTQ community can be hypocritical at times They say they want tolerance and are tolerant but are completely intolerant of people who don t believe the way they do What is the matter with this statement It is the same exact statement that the challenged author wrote but from the flipside Is there an element of truth to it Yes All communities have some bad eggs but this is a reckless and generally inaccurate statement The more accurate and responsible truth is that many people in the LBGTQ community are some the most caring compassionate and sensitive people you will find What if I said Greeks are generally crooks Indians are dishonest These statements are hurtful mainly because they over generalize The original story contains some elements of truth which truly are sad and problematic Throughout history there have been many very heinous acts committed by Christians and some Christians have been and are hypocrites Does this represent the norm or the majority No Many devout Christians do much good and are great examples To throw all of Christianity Muslims Jews etc under the bus in such a sweeping manner is irresponsible What if I said Jews have lower IQ s It would be the same if similarly over generalizing and critical statements were said about Muslims or the LGBTQ community This platform is committed to showing respect and dIgnity to all groups while also tackling difficult topics Different perspectives are informative educational and very needed when they are shared and received with courtesy and respect I would ask the original author to rethink their posts
