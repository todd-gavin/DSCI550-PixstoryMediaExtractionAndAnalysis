First election in India were held in the year 1951 post independence and the election commission of India preponed  elections 6 months  earlier in  Himachal Pradesh, due to the forecast of harsh weather and heavy snowfall  in the month of Feb and March which would have make it impossible for citizens to reach the polling stations. Residents of Kinnaur district of (Himachal Pradesh) were the first to vote in India’s first general elections. Rest of the India voted six months later in the year 1952. Shyam Saran Negi  born on July 1st 1917,in Kalpa  village in district Kinnaur (Himachal Pradesh)  at that time was working as a government primary school teacher and was assigned poll duty In the first elections. He had requested the polling party at his village to allow him to cast his vote and then move to the polling station where he was assigned duty.The officer on duty acceded to his request and allowed him to vote .He then got opportunity to cast his vote on October 25, 1951 in the  first polling booth which was set up inside a primary school building under the chini assembly constituency ,later renamed the Kinnaur Vidhan Sabha constituency. Far away from the urban settlement Negi inadvertently earned a place for himself in the electoral history of independent India. But he remained in oblivion for 45years till the election commission tracked him and he was officially given the tag of being the First voter in the year 2007.During the 2014 elections Google made a video  featuring Negi  for its #Pledge to vote campaign#. The First voter  has also made a debut at the age of 97  in the movie  Sanam re.Negi has not missed even a single election whether it was a Panchayat election or Assembly without any absentism.Decades have passed ,but the ceneterian retired school teacher’s enthusiasm to vote remains  undiminished even at the age of 105 years.
