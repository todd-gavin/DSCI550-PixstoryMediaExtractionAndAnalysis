One of Australia s top national security figures denies there was a failure by intelligence agencies to stop a military pact being signed between Solomon Islands and China The head of the Office of National Intelligence ONI Andrew Shearer also warned that Chinese police officers who have already arrived in the Pacific nation could incite further violence and instability In early April Mr Shearer joined his counterpart from Australia s overseas spy agency ASIS in an unsuccessful last ditch mission to Honiara to urge Solomon Islands to scrap its deal with Beijing Three weeks on from his talks with Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare the ONI boss has been questioned about whether Australian intelligence agencies had failed to stop China s move It wasn t an intelligence failure this strategy has been unfolding for a number of years Mr Shearer declared while appearing at the Raisina Dialogue in New Delhi I think for those of us watching closely there were signs of this well over a decade ago and we ve seen this building this building Chinese presence across the Indo Pacific After last November s civil unrest in the Solomon capital Australia quickly dispatched dozens of defence force personnel and federal police to help restore law and order They were soon followed by Chinese anti riot police trainers but Mr Shearer fears their presence could eventually lead to a confrontation in Honiara Unity of command is always desirable in any security operation and confusion around unity of command is an issue he warned In such a fragile volatile country Chinese policing techniques and tactics that we ve seen deployed so ruthlessly in Hong Kong for example are completely inconsistent with the Pacific way of resolving issues and could incite further instability and violence While conceding Australia was not a perfect partner for Pacific nations Mr Shearer insisted China s motives were particularly unhelpful for the region We ve made a big investment I think our motives are pure and have been pure for decades But we accept these countries making their own choices What we can t accept is an outside power influencing the choices of these countries
