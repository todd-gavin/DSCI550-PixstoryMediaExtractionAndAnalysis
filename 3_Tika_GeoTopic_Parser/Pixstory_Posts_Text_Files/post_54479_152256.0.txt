With a new Alberta premier taking office in October and a general election required by the end of May 2023, fiscal policy may become a wedge issue between Alberta’s United Conservative Party and the NDP.A key issue for analysts who study Alberta’s finances is the erratic behaviour of the province’s revenue stream, which is heavily tied to the price of oil. In the past year, Alberta’s finances have gone from a projected $18.2 billion deficit to a $3.9 billion surplus. This happy result is almost entirely due to surging bitumen royalties as oil prices have risen dramatically.This is not an anomaly. Since 1965, all of Alberta’s surpluses have been attributed to resource royalties. This effectively means that, since oil royalties make up a significant amount of government revenues, Albertans have only been paying 50 to 95 per cent of the full cost of public services. Albertans have become so used to these royalties keeping taxes down that they oppose any and all mentions of a provincial sales tax.The ‘Alberta tax advantage’Alberta prides itself on being the only Canadian province without a provincial sales tax, relying instead on its bitumen revenues. Known as the “Alberta tax advantage,” this attitude can be traced back to 1936 when a new Social Credit government introduced a two per cent sales tax recommended by a taxation commission.Albertans were not happy with the new tax, and the government backed off collecting the tax after a year and a half. Shortly after the tax was introduced, Alberta defaulted on its debt — a default that lasted nearly a decade. The default exposed huge fissures in the structure of provincial finances.Albertans, overly dependent on the fortunes of wheat prices in the 1920s and 1930s, wanted all types of public infrastructure — roads, telephone systems, irrigation channels — but even in financially good times, would resist any efforts to raise taxes to pay for public works.Read more: https://theconversation.com/a-provincial-sales-tax-is-the-solution-to-albertas-fiscal-roller-coaster-191147
