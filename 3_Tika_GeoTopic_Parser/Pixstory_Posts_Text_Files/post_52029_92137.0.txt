Captain Aaron Finch snapped out of his form funk to ensure a depleted Australian side featuring three debutants ended their historic tour of Pakistan on a high with a three-wicket victory in the one-off T20 International in Lahore.

The dominant form of his counterpart Babar Azam (66 off 46) continued as Pakistan reached a competitive 8-162, but the hosts were stopped from going bigger by paceman Nathan Ellis (4-28) who struck consistently through the final overs of their innings.

Finch (55 off 44) then saw off an impressive spell from Usman Qadir, the former Perth Scorchers leg-spinner featuring in his first matchÂ against the country he once expressed a hope of playing for, to post his first half-century in 14 T20I innings.

The 35-year-old, fresh off two consecutive ducks coming into the match, was caught on the boundary attempting to win the game with a six to precipitate a jittery finish, but Ben McDermott (22 off 19 from an unfamiliar No.7 spot) hit a boundary from the first ball of the final over to seal the win.

"I knew I could play a bit," Finch told reporters post-match. "It's just been the last few innings particularly against Pakistan that I didn't really get through that initial period.

"I always had confidence, I always had faith. It's one of those things that you go through some lean patches at times and everyone can seem to panic, and as people get older people panic a little bit quicker.

"But the support I've had from the players and the coaching staff has been fantastic."

Australia handed maiden T20I caps to Cameron Green, Marnus Labuschagne and Ben Dwarshuis, while Josh Inglis (who recovered from COVID-19 after being sidelined from the preceding ODI campaign) took the gloves for the first time.

Inglis (24 off 25), along with Travis Head (26 off 14) and Marcus Stoinis (23 off nine), all played important cameos as Finch held anchor down the other end.
