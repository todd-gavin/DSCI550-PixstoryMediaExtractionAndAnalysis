Exile is not your typical pop song it s something more than transcends the music and pop industry Bon Iver and Taylor Swift s amazing vocals paves way for a very heartwrenching tale of two people who have fallen out of a relationship and how they are dealing with it While Taylor s take is a more mature and nurturing one Iver s take seems a bit dark and toxic but not in a crude and absurd way Iver s mannerisms throughout the song signify that he is trying to make sense of the hurt that this falling our has caused him The vocals paired with the background music makes this song flawless and something that I m looking forward to
