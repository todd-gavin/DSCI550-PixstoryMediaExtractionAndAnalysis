This small bay is located near Portofino, whose access to boats is strictly prohibited. Dior has chosen this exclusive place to furnish it with its new Dioriviera collection. The bathrooms are thus enriched with bamboo decorations, beach cabins and sunbeds, cushions and parasols in a green version of the characteristic Dioriviera toile de Jouy motif The makeover does not concern only the design because the fashion house will also create a temporary spa overlooking the sea where you can enjoy exclusive treatments immersed in an atmosphere of pure beauty
