Snakes aren't domestic animals and absolutely do not need to be kept as pets. Snakes necessitate particular care and environments. The majority of people are unwilling to learn how to care for a snake. Those who do so are frequently unaware of the dangers it poses to themselves and our snake buddies. On top of that, they suffer in captivity and may pose a danger to everyone around them. At least 75% of reptiles, including snakes, perish within a year after being captured by humans. That is not good. The fascination of humans with keeping every animal they see in captivity is concerning and more likely than not, projection. The west's obsession with wanting an exotic pet translates to a weird complex of superiority which they earlier, and still continue to, projected on other humans. And the savior complex where apparently they're "protecting" them from the wild conditions â€“ an excuse they used to use to defend and continue colonization. You are not in the position to protect a wild animal from the wild. It is a flawed logic. Let the nature stay natural. The animal marketing is unnecessarily cruel to all its animals, we don't need to add to the list.
