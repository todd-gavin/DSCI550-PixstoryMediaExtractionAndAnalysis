Apollo Beach Florida is a maze of canals lined with hundreds of houses perched right near the water s edge The whole community just south of Tampa is only about feet above sea level meaning it s at risk from storm surge as sea levels rise Homebuyers along the U S coasts can check each property s flood risk as easily as they check the size of the bedrooms most coastal real estate listings now include future flood risk details that take climate change into account In Apollo Beach for example many of the properties are at least out of on the flood risk scale That knowledge isn t stopping homebuyers though Waterfront homes are selling within days of going on the market and the same story is playing out all along the South Florida coast at a time when scientific reports are warning about the rising risks of coastal flooding as the planet warms We are professors of urban geography and American politics who follow the real estate industry To understand why people are ignoring a risk that could lead to expensive damage and eventually lower their property value we talked to hundreds of Florida real estate agents about their clients motivations and concerns Here s what we learned Nothing pushes buyers to consider long term risk We surveyed licensed Florida Realtors in late Their responses suggest that prospective homebuyers by and large are not taking elevation or flood vulnerability into account when searching for new homes and the availability of detailed flood risk maps has had little or no impact on them Part of the problem may be that mortgage lenders and appraisers aren t accounting for properties vulnerability to sea level rise so homebuyers aren t immediately feeling the risk in their pocketbooks Wealthier buyers who don t need a mortgage aren t required to purchase flood insurance and Congress has a history of rolling back flood insurance rate increases In short nothing is forcing buyers to consider the long term risks Read full story at The Conversation Image courtesy
