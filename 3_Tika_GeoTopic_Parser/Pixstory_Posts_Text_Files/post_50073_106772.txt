Dust of Snow BY ROBERT FROST The way a crow Shook down on me The dust of snow From a hemlock tree Has given my heart A change of mood And saved some part Of a day I had rued Dust of Snow is a beautiful short poem written by Robert Frost This poem tells that even a simple moment has large importance The poet has spoken of crow and hemlock trees in this poem Crow implies his depressive and awful mood and hemlock tree is a poisonous tree Both these signs that the poet was not in a good mood and so he describes the dark depressive and bitter side of nature to illustrate his similar mood The poet says that once he was in a sad depressive mood and was sitting under a hemlock tree A crow sitting on the same tree shook off the dust of snow i e small particles of snow that remain on the surface after the snowfall on the poet This simple action changed the poet s mood He realized that he had just wasted a part of his day repenting and being lost in sorrow But the change in his mood made him realize that he should utilize the rest of the day for some useful activity His sorrow was washed away by the light shower of snow dust His spirit was revived and he got ready to utilize the rest of the day
