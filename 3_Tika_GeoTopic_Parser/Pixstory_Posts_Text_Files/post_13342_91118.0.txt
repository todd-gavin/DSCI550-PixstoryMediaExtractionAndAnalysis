Even if the whole world is your room one meter by one, do not miss the opportunity to dance and exercise in it, do not let the depression caused by the memory of the vast world and the despair of a narrow and dark tomorrow deprive you of possible moments in that limited world. Of course, this never means that there is no need for Shabrozi to try to break the walls of that prison
When all the windows are closed, do not let anger cause you to ignore the narrow light that enters your room through a small opening.
If you can not shout your melodies, whisper your lyric poems and songs, if it is not possible to whisper, live this life under your lips and in your throat, lexically and musically.
If there is nothing else, write your poems on toilet paper like Shahid Balkhi, if not, write them on the wall with blood like Rabia.
Why? Because every moment and breath of life is unique and unrepeatable, you can never make up for a moment. Hence, the best fight for life and the most effective fight for life is to overflow from living, to flow and express our life, as much as we can and as much as possible. When people become so full of life, it will not be possible for any petrified force or mortal to suppress it. When we are driven by the force of life, the force of death recedes. Remember that death is nothing but the absence of life.
