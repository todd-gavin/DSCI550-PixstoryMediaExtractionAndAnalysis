Here's a bit of advice if you're afraid of being rejected. Be rejected so many times that it no longer matters. The problem with rejection is that most of us put all of our eggs in one basket, which means we are devastated when it doesn't work out. It's as if we've run out of options. And what has always worked for me does not have to work for you: if I'm afraid of rejection, I'll apply to so many different things that I don't mind getting rejected. Because here's something most people won't tell you. Success isn't defined by the absence of rejection; it's defined by being rejected so many times that you finally succeed.
It's like Confucius Maxim, where he says, "It doesn't matter if you go slow, as long as you keep going," and I believe that's the problem for many people. They want to get it done quickly. They want a shortcut.
However, there is no shortcut. To achieve success, you must be willing to face rejection. Success is not the absence of rejection; it is the process of going through rejection.
