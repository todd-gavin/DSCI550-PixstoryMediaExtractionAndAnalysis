#1) Freshen the Liverpool attack

Liverpool had an aging attack last term with Divock Origi and Roberto Firmino having fewer
appearances. Though they had a versatile set of players and signed Luis Diaz, they were
unable to have a cutting-edge attacking three.

Darwin Nunez can directly get into the playing XI
not only because of his hefty price tag but also due to his ability to score the goals left, right and
center.

#2) An additional dimension

Though Liverpool is well-oiled machinery, most of their attacks came from the flanks compared
to the center of the pitch. They relied on Mane and Salah to score the goals. With Mane leaving
and Salah not looking to sign the contract extension, the club will look to change the approach.

Darwin Nunez has played in all formations including 3-4-3 and 3-5-2 which adds versatility to
the attack.

#3) Provide a direct competition to Manchester City

Manchester City won the league not only because of their consistency but also because of their
bench strength. They lacked a striker but didnâ€™t miss Erling Haaland at the start of the transfer
window.

Signing Darwin Nunez would also assist Liverpool to take Manchester City head-on. It
will be interesting to see how the Premier League title race pans out in 2022/23.
