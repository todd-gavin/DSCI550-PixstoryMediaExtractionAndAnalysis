Social media is no less to blame for this propaganda of manipulating people and mass.
Instead, social media manipulation threatens the country and the whole world.
Being the most used and recognised platform for welcoming all sorts of opinions, it is often used as a tool to spread misinformation.
And misleading people wouldn't be done by any other people correctly than the artist themselves; those are politicians.
Government and political parties use social media algorithms, automation and big data to manipulate public opinion at a scale that could harm the democratic system of any country.

Spreading irrelevant news and fake narratives is so skillfully done that people forget to research more about what they have been shown. But, of course, spreading political propaganda wouldn't have been so easy without social media platforms.

There are complete fallacies presented to the public through Twitter, where there is a set of people who provoke a debate of clashing opinions, which is one of the other reasons for disharmony in a democratic nation.

Research has found that In 45 democracies, politicians and political parties “have used computational propaganda tools by amassing fake followers or spreading manipulated media to garner voter support.”

The work has not stopped and will continue to manipulate and influence the public in future unless it is addressed and acknowledged with a motto to eradicate it.
