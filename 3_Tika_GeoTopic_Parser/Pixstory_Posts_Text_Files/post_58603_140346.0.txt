Mahadev Bhai Desai, a Writer ,Thinker, Great Freedom Fighter and a close associate of Mahatma Gandhi during freedom struggle, was borne on January 1, 1892 in an elite family of Surat in Gujrat.He died on August 15, 1947 .It is a matter of serious concern,  How many people of us , know such a patriot Karma Yogi today? 
         Mahadev Bhai started his profession after studying law.  As time wanted to put him to contribute in to the independence,struggle.  He was practicing as a lowyer in South Africa and later came back from South Africa to Gandhi ji .  Mahadev ji was much  impressed by Gandhi ji and became his PA . He was called as a shadow of Gandhi ji, living round the clock woth him.
      He was entrusted with responsibility of managing things smoothly in Ashram. How many letters have come, whose answers have to be sent , was decided by him after consulting Gandhiji, everything was his responsibility, which he continued to fulfill throughout his life.
 While living in the company of Gandhiji, Mahadev Bhai used to write a diary in which everyday events were recorded.  Later this diary was published from Banaras as Mahadebhai's diary.  Good information on Mahatma Gandhi can be obtained after reading this book (diary).
         Gandhiji and Kastubaji loved him like their own son.  He was imprisoned along with Gandhiji in Aga Kha palace in Pune after the slogan of Quit India in Bombay - I where he died of a heart attack on 15th August 1942 which was a great shock for Gandhiji.  After his death, Gandhi himself bathed and cremated his dead body / Thus ended the twenty-five years of his life, a shining star of freedom who walked like a shadow with Gandhiji.  It is said that if Mahadev Bhai had not been with Gandhiji, he might not have been able to do as much as he did.
       It is our duty not to forget at least our ancestors who sacrificed everything for our country.
            Best regards
