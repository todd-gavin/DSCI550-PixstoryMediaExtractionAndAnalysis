Many Kings fans have asked if they should trade their first round pick along with another player for a proven veteran. The below detail will explain why the answer to that question is a resounding “No”. 

What then do the Kings need/hope to get in the NBA draft? 

A long, off-ball wing or a front court player to pair with Sabonis. 

Where will the Kings pick? 

The Kings have about a 30% chance to land a top 4 pick and a 70% chance to land 7-9. 

Will these types of players be available in the top 9? 

Yes, 7 of the top 9 players are long wings or PF/C. Here is a list of the top 9 players.

1. Chet Holmgren - 7-0 PF/C
2. Jabari Smith - 6-10 PF 
3. Paolo Banchero - 6-10 PF 
4. Jaden Ivey - 6-4 SG
5. Keegan Murray - 6-8 PF 
6. AJ Griffin - 6-6 SF 
7. Shaedon Sharpe- 6-6 SG
8. Benedict Mathurin - 6-6 SG 
9. Johnny Davis - 6-5 SG 

Only Johnny Davis and Jaden Ivey play the same/similar position (PG) as the Kings two best players. 

The other good news for the Kings is the top 8 players all project to have All-star upside according to experts. For example, Sharpe was projected as the top pick but hasn’t played a college game which makes him a bit of a risk but also has him potentially falling to #7. #8 Mathurin is an electric athlete with a game that experts feel should translate well in the NBA. It is not difficult imagining him winning the ROY. Murray, Smith and Holmgren have all-star potential and would be great fits alongside Sabonis should the Kings land a higher pick or if one of them falls. Each provides length, defense and outside shooting which are strengths Sabonis lacks. 

So, Monte McNair, if you are listening, don’t trade the pick. Do your homework.
