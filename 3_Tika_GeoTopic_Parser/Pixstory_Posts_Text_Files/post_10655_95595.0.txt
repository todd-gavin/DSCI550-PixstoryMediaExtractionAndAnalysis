Amardeep Malik, playing at his home course, signed for a brilliant five-under 67 to build a two-shot lead at 12-under 132 at the halfway stage of the Prometheus School presents Delhi-NCR Open 2022, a Rs. 40 lakh event, being played at the Noida Golf Course.

Bengaluru’s Mari Muthu R shot the day’s lowest score of eight-under 64 to be placed tied second at 10-under 134 along with Manu Gandas (69) of Gurugram.

The cut went at one-over 145. Fifty-one professionals made the cut.

Noida-based Amardeep Malik (65-67) began the day with a birdie on the first and then added three more birdies on the sixth, eighth and ninth for a strong front-nine. Malik landed his approach within two feet on the ninth.

The 36-year-old Amardeep, the overnight joint leader, had a turbulent start to the back-nine stumbling with bogeys on the 11th and 13th where he missed up and downs. However, Malik came roaring back with an eagle on the par-4 15th where he holed his second shot from the rough from a distance of 95 yards. He picked up another shot on the 16th with a 25-feet conversion to close the day with a two-shot lead.              

Malik, who has won both his previous titles at Noida Golf Course, said, “It was good to carry the momentum from round one. I’m feeling good about my game. I hit some good shots to begin with which landed close. I lost momentum on the 11th and 13th and was not expecting much after that but got lucky with the hole out on the 16th. The course is playing tough due to the wind therefore it’s not easy to score low. So I’m glad that I’m in this position.”
