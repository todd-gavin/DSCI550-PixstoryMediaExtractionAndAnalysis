There is a certain topic about a sensation and generational player in Kylian Mbappe doing rounds around the football world. The most anticipated transfer in the market's recent history has taken a huge huge tide towards something which was least expected. The Frenchman was heavily tipped to join Spanish giants Real Madrid since the last two transfer markets but has chosen to stay at his current club (PSG) who have almost fulfilled each of the demands put up by him and a lucrative package over the next 3 years.
The world knew how highly Mbappe rated Real Madrid, it was his dream club but things never work like you want them to and definitely not in football. This has become a sad reality now, that players prefer billions of dollars rather than dream and loyalty. Only a few can be adjudged in the latter category.
This Mbappe deal has a lot of background story to it mainly revolving around the World Cup at the end of this year based in Qatar (owners of PSG) and that shows us why they did not want to let go a football superstar and thereby fulfilling the needs of their main man making him take this turn.
I recently did a survey and put up a poll where I asked the football fans what would one do had they been in Kylian Mbappe's place and I am nothing but glad to let you know that the majority of fans prefer completing their dream move over money, really really loved that bit after watching every bit of such stories in modern football. We can only hope that this stays the same at least in the hearts and minds of the fans as loyalty and dream will always take you a long way when there occurs trouble with money. The former lasts longer while the latter, one can not be so sure about it.
