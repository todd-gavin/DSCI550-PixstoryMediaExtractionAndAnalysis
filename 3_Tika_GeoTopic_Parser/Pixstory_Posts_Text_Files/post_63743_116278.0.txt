While most songs feature vocals to communicate, some instrumentalists possess the skill to speak with their listener without the need for words, letting their instruments do the talking. These are dime a dozen and their skill is such that it leaves most people in awe, shaking their heads in wonder. The instrumentalist, be it the guitarist or drummer need not necessarily go too technical, sometimes one note conveys more than a hundred words. Because even though lyrics can add a massive layer of emotion to a song, sometimes the story and message can be conveyed with absolutely no words at all. Just a combination of pummeling guitars and drums, focus on creating atmosphere and a big emphasis on texture and dynamics. And when there’s no concern about matching lyrics to music, the artist can feel free to stretch out, let loose and experiment purely with sound, talking to the listener wordless.
