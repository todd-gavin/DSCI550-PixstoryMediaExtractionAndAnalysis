When Ms. Marvel was first announced, lot of fans didn't know how to feel about this series. And now the show has scored a near perfect score, as it currently sits at 95% on Rotten Tomatoes. 

Ms. Marvel is a pakistani origin superhero who has most of her idols from the sub-continent region such as The King of Bollywood Shahrukh Khan. The representation of the sub continent with this character is going to be one of the biggest attraction for all the viewers of the show. 

Ms. Marvel is also a fan of comic lore of Marvel and is unapologetically one of the biggest geeks of the superheroes. It will be interesting to see this dynamic being played out on the big screen. 

Marvel has put a lot of efforts in the Disney+ shows, as Moon Knight earlier this year and now Ms. Marvel will surely jam up the ratings for the shows. 

Ms. Marvel promises a show with some unique guest appearances and show spots of the world that has never been explored before. 

Ms. Marvel debuts on Disney Plus tomorrow with brand new episodes that are guaranteed to make you have a good time and explore a new superhero
