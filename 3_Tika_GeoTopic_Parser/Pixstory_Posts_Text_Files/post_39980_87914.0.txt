Ryan Reynolds reunites with Shawn Levy, the director of Free Guy, for a time-traveling adventure that matches their previous partnership in terms of exhilarating intensity and outperforms it in terms of likability. To play Adam, a rogue pilot who crash-lands in 2022 and is forced to partner up with his 12-year-old self (a star-making turn from newcomer Walker Scobell) to preserve the future, Reynolds dials down his punchable smirk but keeps the swagger.
The smart-alec banter between the two Adams, large and small, fails to hide the fact that they are irritated by one another. But it soon becomes evident that both are still grieving the untimely death of their father (Mark Ruffalo), a scientist whose brilliance may hold the key to both unravelling and triggering the impending turmoil. The high-concept plot is held together more by willpower (and some fine visual effects) than logic, but at its heart, this engaging, family-friendly Netflix production is a big-hearted storey of damaged families turned good.
Reynolds is in the greatest shape he's been in in a long time. The retro-futuristic feel is completed by Rob Simonsen's victorious, sweeping score, which punctuates this feel-good trip with huge crescendos and highlights the increasing lit-by-flashlight suspense with vintage '80s synth vibes. The Adam Project appears to be yet another attempt to entice us with nostalgia. The action-packed sci-fi adventure is reminiscent of our childhoods, and it will undoubtedly appeal to audiences of a specific generation. Fortunately, it goes far deeper than that. The Adam Project is also a storey about coming to terms with our past and coming to grips with the life we've lived and the decisions we've made.
