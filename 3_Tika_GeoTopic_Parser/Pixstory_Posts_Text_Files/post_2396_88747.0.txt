Is weight loss all about calorie count or is there more to it. I will try to explain why loosing weight is not only about calorie count and eating more food, but the air and water retained by body plays a major role.

Working in hospitals, we would laugh at patients who said “gas has gone to my head “. We would say headache is a headache and it has nothing to do with acidity.
We would say patients dont understand the science hence say anything.
Hence this whole concept of gas moving out of your GI tract into some other part of the body was so alien to a Western trained practitioners of medicine. 
II didn't know that till I got a patient who was burping all the time- she would even burp if her hand was pressed-even while getting a massage done she would constantly burp. She was my first such patient, after that there were multiple such cases. 
There is a correlation-people eat wrong, and they get a headache. People have acidity they get headache.
Similarly there is extra water in the body if there is inflammation. We understand person has not eaten that much but has still gains weight. 
Although there is nothing wrong in the calorie definition but to say that you're eating excess calories and that's why you're obese is not true. And we again as practitioners would always believe that the patient is not telling the truth and no one gains weight without eating.
If there is inflammation there is water retention. We need to recognize that being overweight is not and making fat, it's also about a lot of water. It causes puffiness, your extremities feel puffy. It is because of a lot of things, it’s water and also air .
In most cases you don’t even feel muscles because of retention of water and air. So simple
calorie counting doesn’t even work we have to address these issues.
