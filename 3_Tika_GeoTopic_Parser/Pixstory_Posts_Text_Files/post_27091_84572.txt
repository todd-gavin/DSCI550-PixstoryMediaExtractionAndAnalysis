Perhaps the truest form of an onscreen batman has been portrayed by Ben Affleck only While Christian Bale had a great charismatic and strong Bruce Wayne portrayal his screentime with the suit was something that puts a blip on his legacy Keaton was good at both but did not leave that strong an impact on the audience as a Batman should Batfleck has to be considered as the most intimidating Bruce Wayne portrayal as every scene with Ben Affleck donning any suit was worth your watch If anything Ben Affleck s batman has to be compared with Andrew Gardield s Spiderman as both perhaps had the most potential to be the best but were the most ill treated ones after all Ben Affleck s portrayal of the iconic character is painful and brilliant Affleck puts his heart and soul into the amount of times he is asked to be on screen and becomes the most integral part of all movies he is the Batman He is without a doubt the most unnecessarily hated batman as he has the most potential to be the best Batman but he has not had the right script or the right director yet a movie with a story close to the Dark Knight trilogy and a director like Christopher Nolan or Matt Reeves Batfleck would get you hooked to the screen with something of an oscar worthy portrayal coming from him In my opinion Batfleck has to be the best Batman yet
