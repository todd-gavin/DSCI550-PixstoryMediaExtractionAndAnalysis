The match between Rome and Verona played at the Stadio Olimpico ends Against a largely remodeled formation the guests took the lead during the first half thanks to goals from Barak and Tameze Two teenagers saved Roma Christian Volpato classy and Edoardo Bove enter and they score in the second half allowing the Giallorossi to at least avoid defeat A lot of nervousness on the part of Jos Mourinho who was sent off by referee Pairetto in the final minutes and was then held back by his collaborators while he was trying to go towards the referee in a threatening manner A bad ending to the end of a negative performance underlined by the boos of the fans present in the stands
