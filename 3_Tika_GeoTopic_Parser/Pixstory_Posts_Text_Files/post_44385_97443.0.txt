West Ham United will look into reports that home fans assaulted German broadcasters during
the first leg of their Europa League semi-final against Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday.

Ansgar Knauff scored in the first minute to put the Hammers behind, but Michail Antonio
equalised midway through the first half, and Daichi Kamada's tap-in after the break gave the
Bundesliga side a vital away win.

However, after Antonio's equaliser, rumours emerged that home fans had attacked Tim
Brockmeier and Philipp Hofmeister, commentators from German radio station ARD, and West
Ham are investigating the incident, which could result in a UEFA sanction.

"The club is aware of the incident and will be working to identify the offender,‚Äù West Ham's
statement read. "In line with our zero-tolerance approach, anyone identified will have their
details passed to the police. They will be given an indefinite ban and be unable to enter London
Stadium and travel with the club. There is no place for this kind of behaviour."

Following Knauff's opening, Bundesliga analyst Derek Rae tweeted on Twitter that Brockmeier
had been'struck on the neck,' and the criticism escalated from there. Both commentators were
asked about their experiences on air once more.

They were taken aback by the proximity to the
fans. They were in the press area's last row, with supporters behind them. They thought the
crowd were caught aback by their emotional outbursts in response to Knauff's goal. Then, when
the equaliser kicked in, he got multiple blows and his headphones came loose.

Speaking on air during the match, Hofmeister said:

"We are being attacked here. They threw the
headset down on my colleague Tim. I have to sort myself out a bit. We have to see that we can
get some security personnel here."

At halftime, Brockmeier and Hofmeister were transferred to a more secure position, as the
London Stadium's media zones are notorious for being widely accessible to match-goers.
