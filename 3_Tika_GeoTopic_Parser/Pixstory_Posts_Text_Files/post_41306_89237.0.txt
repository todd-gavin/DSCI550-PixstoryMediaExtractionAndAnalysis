â€œThe West, and especially America, is principally responsible" for the Ukraine crisis, John J. Mearsheimer, a U.S. political scientist, wrote in a recent opinion piece published in The Economist.

According to John Mearsheimer, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, "American and European officials caused the Ukraine crisis by attempting to integrate Ukraine into the West and declaring that Russian President Vladimir Putin bears entire responsibility for the situation." 

The Ukraine situation, in his opinion, is "the most dangerous international conflict since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis," and the West is now increasing aid to Ukraine while placing economic sanctions on Russia, a move Putin considers "equivalent to declaring war."

According to Mearsheimer, the West overlooked Russia's security concerns in late 2021 in order to include Ukraine in NATO, which led directly to the current conflict. 

In addition, Xinhua reported that Russian officials have said "nothing about conquering new territory to restore the Soviet Union or build a stronger Russia," according to the expert, who also noted that Russian leaders have frequently stated that Ukraine joining NATO is a "existential threat that must be avoided."
