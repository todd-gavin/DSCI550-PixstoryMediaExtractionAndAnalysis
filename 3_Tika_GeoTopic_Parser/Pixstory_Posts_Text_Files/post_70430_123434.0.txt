Alia Bhatt, Shefali Shah, and Vijay Varma starrer movie, presented by red chillies entertainment brings you Darlings- a 2022 Indian - Hindi language film. It's a black comedy drama released on 5th August only on Netflix. I watched this movie today and I would highly recommend everyone to watch this movie too. With a proper use of satire, darlings is an entertainer and at the same time also comes with hard hitting moments. Shattered hopes and dreams, domestic violence are the themes that you'll be experiencing while watching this movie. It's a must watch because of how amazingly the actors have performed in this, which makes it more convincing.
