Daredevil Season I read a comment somewhere that said This was peak Netflix and boy was that person right Netflix s content was at its highest and best during this time the performances the level of writing and the production design tells you how a good tv series is made From the word go Daredevil starts to win hearts in its narrative and writing the direction is top notch and Charlie Cox owns every single time he is on screen One of the most star point feature of Daredevil is the level of acting and intensity the show has there is not one actor in the series that does not do justice to their character The first season of Daredevil follows the story of Matt Murdock s making his journey against Wilson Fisk The Kingpin There can never be someone else who can play King pin better than our very own Vincent He is extremely intimidating and has become a role model for all the actors and characters who are supposed to be intimidating I don t want to color anyone s opinions but the first season of Daredevil Is indeed breathtaking and totally worth your time There is a level of brilliance in Marvel content but this is dark and gritty and brilliant in its own way and not the quintessential Marvel way
