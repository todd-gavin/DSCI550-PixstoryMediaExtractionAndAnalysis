Sustainable fashion is a term that’s increasingly used (and overused, often with little to back it up) these days, as we all become ever more aware of the serious environmental impact of our clothes —with the industry responsible for a shocking four to 10 per cent of global greenhouse-gas emissions every year. But what does sustainable fashion actually mean?

In short, it’s an umbrella term for clothes that are created and consumed in a way that can be, quite literally, sustained, while protecting both the environment and those producing garments. That’s why cutting CO2 emissions, addressing overproduction, reducing pollution and waste, supporting biodiversity, and ensuring that garment workers are paid a fair wage and have safe working conditions, are all crucial to the sustainability matrix.

Considering the number of factors involved, there are still too few brands out there currently tackling all of these complex issues, and even those that are will admit that there’s always room for improvement. This means simply shopping for items labelled ‘sustainable’ is not enough; we need to completely rethink our purchasing habits and the way we consume clothes.

So, if you want to ensure your wardrobe is as sustainable as possible moving forward, here’s everything you need to know.
1. Buy less and buy better.
2. Invest in sustainable fashion brands.
3. Shop secondhand and vintage.
4. Try renting.
5. Avoid greenwashing.
6. Know your materials.

10. Watch out for harmful chemicals.
11. Reduce your water footprint.
12. Be conscious about vegan fashion.
13. Take care of your clothes.

15. Ensure your clothes have a second life.
