Donald Trump is notorious for engaging in feuds with high profile figures I don t think he would be publicly lock horns with his closeted supporters Majority of Hollywood always has been and always will be against Trump for obvious reasons There are also celebrities who have supported Trump and yet it has not affected their career Being in his good books certainly has its benefits However some are might I say privileged enough to openly criticise him causing Trump to pick a fight with the Hollywood liberal elite The Independent has reported such incidents and Trump vs Meryl Streep is what comes to my mind Taking place between Trump s election and his inauguration the Golden Globe award ceremony saw multiple actors take aim at the president Among those was Streep who launched into a lengthy criticism of the president In response Trump dismissed the acclaimed actor as Hillary lover initially commenting that he was not surprised by liberal movie people attacking his character He later shared a series of tweets criticising the actor claiming that the time Oscar nominee was one of the most over rated actresses in Hollywood I wonder what would happen if he ever comes back to power
