The France National Football Team is managed by Didier Deschamps and they won the previous World Cup and are favourites to win this time around also Their team is packed with star players all over Their Captain is Hugo Lloris who is their GK Now when we come to the defensive line Didier Deschamps does like to employ the at back policy sometimes but this time around he ll mostly use the man at back Benjamin Pavard is mostly likely to play as RB and sometimes even Kounde can play the role The Centre Back pairing will most likely consist of Lucas Hernandez and Raphael Varane and Theo Hernandez will feature as the left back Now mostly Didier Deschamps used Kante as the sole CDM but due to his dip in recent form he might give the role to Tchouam ni Rabiot will feature alongside Camavinga as the other two midfielders as Pogba will most likely miss the World Cup due to injury The front three this time around will be a difficult choice for Deschamps as many of the French forwards have been in top form He will most likely play Griezmann Benzema and Mbappe as his three but he can also change it and bring on Dembele and Coman This will be the probable starting line up for France in this year s World Cup They are heavy favourites to lift the title again
