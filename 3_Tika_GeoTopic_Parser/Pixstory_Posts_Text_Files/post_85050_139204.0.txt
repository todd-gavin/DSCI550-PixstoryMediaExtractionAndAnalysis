Scoring goals at any football stage is usual for a player, but maintaining that consistency is the hard part to carry out, and this game has seen many players who somehow managed to carry out this form till their twilight years. 
Many old players remained active in World Cups until they realised their age was a stumbling block to playing football. Regardless of age, players have displayed that they still have that poacher instinct when playing, which has outlined their unwavering quality.
Scoring goals became part of their regimen, and age no longer described their effectiveness; in doing so, they broke football records, such as becoming the oldest players to score in a World Cup.
We look at the top 10 oldest players who scored at the World Cup. 
#10 John Aldridge, (Age: 35 years, 280 days)
The former Liverpool player would not have worn the Republic of Ireland jersey if it hadn't been for his maternal grandmother. The latter, along with Jack Charlton, played a major part in convincing Aldridge to play for Ireland.
However, the player would not be able to make his debut until he was in his late twenties. The player finally made his debut and was a member of the national team for ten years, but he only scored once, at the age of 36, in a World Cup in the United States against Mexico. Despite scoring only one goal in the World Cup, he became their oldest player to do so.
#9 Miroslav Klose (Age: 36 years, 29 days)
Klose was a terrific striker for Germany, breaking all records at the 2014 World Cup. The striker had a contrasting career with club and country, scoring all of his goals for Germany.
He evidenced all of his qualities in the 2014 World Cup, becoming the tournament's leading scorer with 16 goals and the competition's ninth oldest player to score a goal.
