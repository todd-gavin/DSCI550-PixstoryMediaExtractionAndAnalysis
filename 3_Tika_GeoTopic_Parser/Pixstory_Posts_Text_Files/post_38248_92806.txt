As per the Daily Mail Arsenal representatives met with Eden Hazard s agent last week The Gunners are looking to sign the Real Madrid outcast in the summer in order to add experience to their squad The Gunners are reportedly looking to sign Eden Hazard on loan initially But the North London club wants to include an option to buy if the Real Madrid winger returns to his best at the club Real Madrid though have been looking to sell Hazard outright Hence it has to be seen if they would be willing to let the year old leave on a loan to buy deal The Spanish giants signed the winger from Chelsea for million But the move has been a complete failure due to the Belgian s constant injury struggles Eden Hazard underwent ankle surgery in late March and will be out for the rest of the season Eden Hazard s stats have been quite poor since he joined Real Madrid in The Belgian star has just scored goals in appearances for the club over the three seasons But at the same time Eden Hazard s stats for Chelsea have been magnificent The year old had scored appearances in games for the Blues in all competitions Hence maybe a move back to the Premier League could revitalize the Belgian star s career Do the Gunners need Hazard Eden Hazard is far from his best due to his constant injuries Hence it is very likely that the transfer could backfire on the Gunners To add to this signing Eden Hazard would not be cheap and Arsenal have adequate talent on both the wings courtesy of Saka Martinelli and Smith Rowe Owing to this it is unlikely that Eden Hazard would be given enough chances in his current form Hence It could eventually turn out to be a costly mistake like the transfer of Nicolas Pepe Owing to this Arsenal need to be completely sure about Hazard s condition if they are to sign him in the summer
