When Vice President Kamala Harris was asked how long Americans might expect to pay record-high gas prices in a news conference on March 11, there was an uneasy silence. 

The reason for the pause, however, is not the one being promoted by those who are using an edited video footage of the event to condemn Vice President Biden. 

On March 13, Fox News' Maria Bartiromo said to her guest, former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, on "Sunday Morning Futures," "Here's Kamala Harris with really no answers regarding fuel prices." "Look at how she replies." 

A reporter asks Harris how long Americans might expect "record inflation and some unparalleled gas costs," which Bartiromo plays. Some said that “It is truly horrifying to think that the vice president of the United States lacks confidence so extremely on our domestic issues that she wants the president of Poland to discuss our gas prices and our inflation. And then she starts stammering about the Black Sea and reading her notes”

However Kamala Harris is not the villain here. The presidents of Romania and Poland are mixed up. The president of Poland, Andrzej Duda, met with Harris on March 10. Politi Fact tells us that the "Sunday Futures" section started with a video footage of that news conference, and Bartiromo and Miller chastised Harris for laughing following a question concerning refugees. 

Harris was having a joint press conference with Iohannis on March 11 in the second video clip Bartiromo played for Miller. Miller then refers to the Polish president instead of the Romanian president, as if the clip was from the first news conference.
