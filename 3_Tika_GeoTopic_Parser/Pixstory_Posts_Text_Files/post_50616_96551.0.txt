Just don't know how much more struggle we have to face!
This is the amount of salt used to come from the tap water and we just encounter it in the air cooler.
We threw out the entire remaining water and as since we have no choice we just pour tap water again ðŸ˜¥
And now I am just thinking that this water I am using daily to bath, to wash hair, to wash clothes and utensils. This is just so toxic!. Literally everday there is a new struggle!ðŸ˜¥
