The Toffees manager is more used to fighting on the other side of the table but concedes the stakes are higher this time Frank Lampard has revealed that the stakes of Everton s Premier League survival are higher for him than they were when he was competing for titles at the opposite end of the table at Chelsea The Toffees manager has fought back from a quick plummet to the bottom of the table with a fantastic five game run that has lifted the team out of the relegation zone with points from a possible keeping them just above the bottom three Everton s fate is now firmly in their own hands at Goodison Park with a game in hand to boot yet Lampard has said that the struggle seems larger than when he was competing for the Premier League title at Stamford Bridge during his younger years When you go through a relegation battle it consumes you and you want to do the right thing because you realize the stakes Lampard added Because of what this means to the club the stakes are higher for me now than when I won the Premier League as a player You understand that the economics are larger as well to a different degree and you understand what it means to the fans and employees Lampard s employment at Goodison Park appeared like a chance after a bumpy start having been out of work since being sacked by Chelsea perhaps with his status as a club great during his playing days still intact Players are being questioned the club is being questioned and I am being questioned In that position it s the most cutting edge component of the work I m having an unbelievable experience again I m not talking about it as if it s over we re still in the middle of it but I got here and they wanted to test me That was a fantastic challenge in a nice manner
