At the end of the match against Sassuolo which finished at the Arechi in Salerno, the ds of the grenade Walter Sabatini spoke like this to the microphones of DAZN I am very sorry for this match as for others a team that can&#39;t win and it&#39;s my responsibility I probably made some mistakes assessment I thought that certain players could find condition more quickly by respecting their values and their history because Perotti seen today can play at great levels. sensational both for us and for them and for they are full of strong players who are in the national team There could have been a bit of fear instead we gambled for the fact of not being able to overcome a responsibility that I have to assume towards the president who has given carte blanche and towards the people who support us I think back to the chance Bonazzoli had usually a sniper in those circumstances but failed to score a pity it would have been extraordinary to be able to get the three points in this match If you manage to score two goals Sassuolo and you have a sensational chance in the final it means that it is almost there We need luck but we have to go and get it too Sorry for Ederson today he was showing all his qualities This is my team I will never deny it I will always be with them both in victories and in defeats
