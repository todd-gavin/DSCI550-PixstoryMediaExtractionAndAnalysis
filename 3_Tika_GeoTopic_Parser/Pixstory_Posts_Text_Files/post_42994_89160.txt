When the AstroTurf was developed our team started to get better results in the Homeless World Cup before it we used to be in the Top but after its development we started to be in the Top a lot This is the development that comes when children are given the proper conditions to work on their skills We have a belief that if we do our work honestly more people will come to help us or volunteer with us to complete the different projects that we do If someone asks me what I want I d answer that my mission right now is to improve the situation of Football in India Here the conditions of football were very poor in India if we looked at it professionally No one was paying much attention to it but after the development of the ISL Indian Super League the conditions have improved but it they be can be improved much more There is a need of development of proper projects at the grassroot level I think the kids that play football through Slum Soccer can go on to represent the country at a senior International level The international level coaches that we have are sent to the underprivileged areas around the country so that the kids can get the best training to hone their skills We have also started a Under Academy The coaches select the kids from different areas of the country and there s a proper plan set for their development In the first year they should at least win the divisional level in the second they should win the state level and in the third year win at the national level Finally our ultimate goal is that some of the kids from this academy can go on to play in the ISL and then play for the Indian Football team This will be a great achievement for us at Slum Soccer
