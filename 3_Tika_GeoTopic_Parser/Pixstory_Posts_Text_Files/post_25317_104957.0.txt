Green energy is any energy type that is generated from natural resources, such as sunlight, wind or water. It often comes from renewable energy sources although there are some differences between renewable and green energy.

The key with these energy resources are that they don't harm the environment through factors such as releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
