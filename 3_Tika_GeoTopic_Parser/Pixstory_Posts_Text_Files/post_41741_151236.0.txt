On Saturday night, a historic Australia Cup final between Sydney United and Macarthur was marred by some disgusting crowd conduct. The Sporting News reported that before the game even started, CommBank Stadium fans came under fire on social media for booing during the Welcome to Country. Even worse, once the game started, some spectators were seen giving what appeared to be Nazi salutes in the stands. The far-right Ustase movement in Croatia during the 1930s and 1940s adopted the song "Za Dom Spremni," which was occasionally sung by a segment of Sydney United supporters.Macarthur would go on to win the match 2-0 courtesy of penalties from Al Hassan Toure and Ulises Davila with Football Australia (FA) confirming after the game that eight fans were evicted from the stadium due to bad behaviour. "Football Australia acknowledges that a very small minority of attendees engaged in behaviour that is not consistent with Football Australia's values and wider community expectations," FA said in a statement."Football Australia took steps during the match to address these isolated behaviours, including eight evictions.
