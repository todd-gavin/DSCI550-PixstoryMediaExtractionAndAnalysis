The North Africans believe the game's referee, a Gambian, made questionable judgments. The Algerian Football Federation has appealed Fifa's decision in their World Cup qualification playoff against Cameroon.

Algeria was defeated 2-1 at home by the Indomitable Lions on Tuesday, but they rallied to win the away match and earn a ticket to Qatar. The North Africans have expressed their dissatisfaction with the way the game was refereed by the Gambian referee, Bakary Gassama.

"Faf officially lodges an appeal with Fifa against the scandalous arbitration which distorted the result of the match," the federation said in its statement.

"We are determined to use all the legally permitted votes to have their rights restored and to replay the match under conditions guaranteeing the honesty and partiality of the arbitration."

Cameroon won the second leg in Blida, scoring the game-winning goal late in extra time.

Algeria has a 1-0 lead going into the second leg. Rigobert Song's team advanced on a 2-2 aggregate, benefiting from the away goals rule.

Algeria is the second side to announce their intention to file an appeal, following Egypt's announcement that they would ask Fifa to have their match against Senegal replayed.

"We asked for a replay of the match because the match was held in a strange atmosphere, and if we had lost in normal circumstances, we would have congratulated Senegal," said Gamal Allam, who is the head of the Egyptian FA.

"We will present what happened to the disciplinary committee in the federation and await a response. There are many things that happened with us in the match. Our players were attacked.

"Mohamed Salah had the most share of the Senegalese fans' attack on him, which tried to intimidate the players as well, and we asked that the board of directors be on the bench of the match, but they refused."
