Assam is a picturesque place often visited by tourists across the year. It's lively and a pleasant place to stay. However, in context of sports, it does not have as many facilities. In my time, there was barely anything which forced me to cross more hurdles than was necessary. Having the vision but not the required resources can be disheartening. Over time, there have been developments. The advent of synthetic courts has encouraged participation but then, training is still an issue. While the association is trying to make a difference, there's still a lot to do. I have been training students with whatever we have in hopes of better infrastructure soon!

One incident that still makes me immensely happy is getting the opportunity to play with Andy Murray from England and Juan Martin del Potro from Argentina. Both are extremely proficient in their fields and playing next to them was an absolute honor and a high point in my life. To reach such milestones, one has to really work hard. The journey isn't easy and one needs to be tenacious and focused. Once you're determined, it will all come together in ways you didnt imagine!
