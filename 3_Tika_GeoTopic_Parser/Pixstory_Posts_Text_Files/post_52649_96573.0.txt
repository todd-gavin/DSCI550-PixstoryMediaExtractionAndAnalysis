I personally prefer the movies created by Marvel (MCU). Being one of the biggest franchises in the world, it is also most of the movies top 15 top-grossing movies. Some people just consider these movies for kids and they don't value these movies, but let me tell you if you watch closely, you'll’ learn that these movies are deep, interesting, and fun. One of the best recreational activities is to watch these movies, they have created a world for themselves and it is fun to be part of that world.
They Include what any audience needs action, adventure, romance, music, suspense, and much more. These superhero movies are inspirational many times, learning from the qualities of the hero and learning why the villain is wrong and what is the right thing to do. It is the comfort zone for many, especially nerds. The movies have a huge fanbase and have the biggest Hollywood actors working for them. Although it may seem a lie, in each of the Marvel films situations are exposed through which the viewer can learn. In this way, the morals that his films hide also stand out. They are not simple or children’s morals, but they are solutions for adults and are current.
