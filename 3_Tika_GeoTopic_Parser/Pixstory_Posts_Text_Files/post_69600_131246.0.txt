Kolahoi Peak is a mountain in the Anantnag district of Jammu and Kashmir, close to Sonamarg, with a peak elevation of 17,799 ft (5,425 metres). The Himalaya Range's Kolahoi Peak is approximately 15 kilometres south of Sonamarg and 21 kilometres north of Arin Pahalgam. The Lidder River, which originates near Kashmir Valley on the Kolahoi Glacier, flows into the Sind River to the north. The Kolahoi Glacier gives rise to Kolahoi Mountain, a pyramid-shaped peak with ice fields and falls at its base. With aretes and ridges, the peak's rock formation is incredibly stable.
