Because crocodiles are ambush predators, you wouldn't know one was there until it bit you. To begin with, saltwater crocodiles slam their jaws shut with a bite force of 3,700 pounds per square inch or psi, of their teeth. In comparison, 150 to 200 psi might allow you to rip into a steak. Tigers, lions, and hyenas produce about 1,000 psi. The worst bite in the animal kingdom is the saltwater crocodile, closely followed by the Nile crocodile, being 10 times stronger than a lion's. The pain from a crocodile bite is unbearable; if you're lucky, you'll pass away from shock and a heart attack. If you're unlucky, you end yourself being dragged under water and drowning. All of this, after encountering several bone crushing bites from the beasty creature that currently has an upper hand (or upper claw? :P) on you. 
Many crocodile on human attacks have happened because we often tend to overestimate our swimming abilities and underestimate the croc's. Remember, many times a shark can't outswim a croc, you don't stand a chance. Before you know it, you'll be between two earth shattering jaws, being thrown around on the ground. So, when I say a crocodile is not an animal you'd like to mess with, I mean it by all of my being.
