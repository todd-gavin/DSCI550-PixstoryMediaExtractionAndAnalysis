It is ranked as one of the best Australian beaches as the the moonlight creates a special optical illusion which makes one think that there are steps leading up to the moon. Visit between the months of March to October to witness a special phenomenon called the Staircase to the Moon. So, are you planning to head to one of the best places to visit in Australia in March?
Things to do: Ride camels into the sunset, visit the Broome Crocodile Park, visit the Broome Historical Museum, Horizontal Waterfall, the Gibb River Road, Cape Leveque, Purnululu, Mitchell Falls and National Park.
How to reach: From Perth and Port Headland, tourists can take a four-wheel drive vehicle along the Great Northern Highway to reach Broome. This route is a well-maintained national highway, but will still demand two or three days of driving to reach the Kimberley. Another major port of entry into this region is Kununurra.
