Tottenham Hotspur have officially released a brand new neon-tinged home kit of the upcoming 2022-23 season. There are no special changes in the front colour of the jersey as expected. The front of the Jersey looks the same pristine Lilywhite as it has been for the last 124 years. 

The noticeable changes come in the Spurs' famous strip which showcases several subtle features. Beginning with the two-tone trim on the collars and cuffs which look very elegant. 

Moving on to the prominent semi circular seam design in the front of the jersey. The seam, although subtle, looks very eminent to the eye. 

The trim and collar follow the theme Nike have used for the upcoming 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. It is a modern, fitted template designed to allow more dynamic movement thanks to panel cuts inspired by base-layer compression wear.

In the official jersey there is also a fine mesh of wire-thin "ribs" knitted into the fabric that allows it to embrace their shapes as closely as possible.

The word "Spurs" is written numerous times in a variety of typefaces on the inside of both the collar and the cuffs, just in case you forget whose shirt you're wearing and need to double-check discreetly.
