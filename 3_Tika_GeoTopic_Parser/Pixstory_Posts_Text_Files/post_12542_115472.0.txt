Have you ever let your emotions get the best of you and reacted in a way you later regretted?

Well. We've all been there.

One of the main differences between reacting and
responding is the amount of time after someone says or does something to offend you.

Instantly firing back is a reaction and is often done
"Without thinking." 

Reacting doesn't consider long- term effects and can cause the issue to escalate.
Allowing yourself to pause and reflect on the
situation can help you replace impulsive reactions with
thoughtful responses. 

A response uses reason and considers the well-being of self and others. 

Responding can help resolve or calm an issue.
When you react, the situation controls you, and when you respond, you are in control of the situation.
