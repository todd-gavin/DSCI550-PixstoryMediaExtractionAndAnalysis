Positivity and toxicity - Two completely contrary terms. But yes they can go together sometimes. 
Remember when you were sad and angry about something  and  someone came to you and said “ just don’t worry “ and now then  it made you even angrier. We call that toxic positivity.  “Stay positive“ “don’t cry “ “no bad days” we have been hearing and saying these uplifting things since forever but it might be more harmful than helpful. 
It is mostly well-intentioned but it comes with a feeling of disconnection. 
According to a psychologist, 
“ “Toxic positivity is a way of responding to your own or someone else’s suffering that comes across as a lack of empathy. It dismisses emotions instead of affirming them and could come from a place of discomfort,” .

How is it dangerous?

•	Grief and sadness are normal in the face of loss. A person who repeatedly hears messages to move on or be happy might feel as though others do not care about their loss. A parent who has lost a child, for example, might feel that their child was unimportant to others, compounding their grief.
•	Studies of domestic violence found that a positive bias might cause people experiencing abuse to underestimate its severity and remain in abusive relationships. Optimism, hope, and forgiveness increased the risk of people staying with their abusers and being subject to escalating abuse.
•	People who feel pressure to smile in the face of adversity may be less likely to seek support.

Toxic positivity denies people the authentic support that they need to cope with what they are facing.
It doesn’t mean that one should be negative , toxic positivity is rooted in the belief that there are “negative emotions” that need to be ignored or repressed. No emotion is inherently negative or bad. We should validate our emotions , cry if necessary, talk about it and we should be able to feel and process our emotions because repressing emotions is truly dangerous for our mental health.
