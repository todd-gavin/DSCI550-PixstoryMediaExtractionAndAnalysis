In a recently leaked recording, Los Angeles City Council President Nury Martinez was heard saying, among other things, that a white councilmember treated his young Black kid as a "accessory" and referred to a councilman’s black son as "Parece changuito," which means "like a monkey." In addition to these remarks, she attacked Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón, claiming that "he's with the Blacks." Martinez has now resigned as Municipal Council President, however she still has her seat on the city council. It is fascinating to hear the behind-the-scenes conversations of politicians, especially democratic politicians in liberal cities who claim to be the most welcoming and non-racist individuals. Clearly, this incident demonstrates that there is more to politicians than meets the eye, and their words should always be treated with a big grain of salt, even when they tell you they are anti-racist.
