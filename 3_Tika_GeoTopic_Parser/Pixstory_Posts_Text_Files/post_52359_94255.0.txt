Arnott's Tim Tams are Australia's most popular chocolate biscuit. Following his attendance at the 1958 Kentucky Derby, confectionery company owner Ross Arnott named his new line of biscuits Tim Tam after that year's winning horse.

The biscuit, which was introduced in Australia in 1964, consists of a thin layer of chocolatey cream sandwiched between two wafer cookies and smothered in chocolate.

They're delicious on their own, but they're also frequently paired with a hot beverage in the time-honored tradition of the "Tim Tam Slam." This is when opposite corners of the Tim Tam are bitten off, and the Tim Tam is dunked and used to slurp up your hot drink, with the added bonus of eating your makeshift melted straw!
