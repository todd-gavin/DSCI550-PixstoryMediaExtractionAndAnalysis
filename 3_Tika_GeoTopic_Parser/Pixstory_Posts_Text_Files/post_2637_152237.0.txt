LAST of the 10 Day Events of Navratras and Vijay Dashmi.Mahishasura was a shape-shifting asura and son of Mahishi (buffalo). He was blessed with a boon that no man could kill him.Using that to his advantage, Mahishasura constantly harassed Indra and the other gods, and created havoc wherever he went. In order to defeat the asura, the Tridev i.e. Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva combined their energies together to create a female form that of Durga. The Tridev and the rest of the devas blessed the goddess with several of their own weapons, to help her defeat the asura. Durga fought the asura tooth and nail for a total of nine nights i.e. the Navratri. The battle culminated on the tenth day, with Durga killing Mahishasura. This day is known as Vijay Dashmi (vijay = victory, dashmi = tenth). For killing Mahishasura, Durga was given the moniker Mahishasuramardini (i.e. killer of Mahishasura). The Chamundi Hills in Mysuru, Karnataka is where Durga had killed Mahishasura, and the Chamundeshwari temple stands there today, in worship of the goddess. Interestingly, the name Mahishasura was anglicized to Mysore by the British, and today has been changed to Mysuru.
