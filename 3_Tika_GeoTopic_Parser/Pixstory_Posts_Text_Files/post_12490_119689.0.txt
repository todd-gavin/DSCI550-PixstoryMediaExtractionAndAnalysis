Feeling judged?

Most individuals deal with some kind of interpersonal
stress daily. Things like not seeing the situation the same way as others, not being liked by others, or not feeling included fully.

If you're a people pleaser, you probably notice this feeling of being judged even more than the average person. Not because you're actually being judged more, but because you're more sensitive to when others are not over-the-moon happy with you. People pleasers thrive on things being smooth and feeling good interpersonally - that's why you go to such great lengths to make sure other people are
happy (even at your own expense)!

Here are some ideas for how to tolerate it and get through when you're feeling judged (even if that's happening in minor ways).

The more you can tolerate the feeling of being judged
which is unavoidable for all of us, and often isn't even true, it's just a feeling - the better equipt you're going to be to stop people pleasing and start living the life you want.

How do you cope with feelings of being judged in day-to- day life?
