Heavy rains set off flash flooding in the mountains of southwestern Virginia and eastern Tennessee on July Rivers quickly inundated homes and a campground swept away cars and blocked access to damaged communities with mudslides and debris In June flooding had hit mountains in the Western U S where rain combined with melting snow can be particularly destructive Storms dumped up to inches of rain over three days in and around Yellowstone National Park rapidly melting snowpack As the rain and meltwater poured into creeks and then rivers it became a flood that damaged roads cabins and utilities and forced more than people to evacuate The Yellowstone River shattered its previous record and reached its highest water levels recorded since monitoring began almost years ago Although floods are a natural occurrence human caused climate change is making severe flooding events like these more common I study how climate change affects hydrology and flooding In mountainous regions three effects of climate change in particular are creating higher flood risks more intense precipitation shifting snow and rain patterns and the effects of wildfires on the landscape Warmer air leads to more intense precipitation One effect of climate change is that a warmer atmosphere creates more intense precipitation events This occurs because warmer air can hold more moisture The amount of water vapor that the atmosphere can contain increases by about for every degrees Fahrenheit degree Celsius of increase in atmospheric temperature Research has documented that this increase in extreme precipitation is already occurring not only in regions like Yellowstone but around the globe The fact that the world has experienced multiple record flooding events in recent years including catastrophic flooding in Australia Western Europe India and China is not a coincidence Climate change is making record breaking extreme precipitation more likely Read more
