Today's piece of news comes from the world of women's football, where the game is growing to new leaps and boundaries as it is. The likes of Football Club Barcelona and Real Madrid have all been in the news for their achievements in the field over the past year or so, but not much has been said about Paris Saint Germain's femeni team, who renew the contract of one of their most crucial players.

The club's women's team announced across social media and on It's various websites — "C'est une fierté. C'était dans mes objectifs de poursuivre avec mon club formateur."

"𝗦𝗮𝗻𝗱𝘆 𝗕𝗮𝗹𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 revient sur sa prolongation jusqu'en 2024 et vous donne rendez-vous ce samedi au Parc des Princes !"

PSG's left winger Sandy Baltimore will continue beyond her current deal. The new contract keeps her in the French capital till 2024, where she's been since her arrival at the U17 level. Having graduated through the club's prestigious academy, Baltimore is now a big part of the senior team. Regularly starring in this year's Uefa women's Champions League, Sandy put up performances of notable worth versus Bayern Munich — scoring in both legs of a tie that PSG women won.

Over the course of her time as a professional footballer, she's also recieved her international call up — first appearing for France's U19 in 2019. She won the U19 European championships that year and went onto make another 13 appearances for the French Unit. Her first goal however, came in December 2020 in a thorough 12-0 thrashing of Kazakhstan. Sandy Baltimore is an established footballer in a competent team, her renewal can only mean good things for Paris Saint Germain's women's side.
