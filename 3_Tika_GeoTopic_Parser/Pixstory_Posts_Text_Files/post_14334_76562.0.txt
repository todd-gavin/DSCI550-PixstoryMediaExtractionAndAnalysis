Alex Sandro celebrates his 31st birthday, his seventh with the Bianconeri, far from the chilly temperatures in Turin.

The full-back will blow out the candles on his birthday cake in the company of his Brazil teammates, enjoying the warmth of the South American summer.

No time to kick back and enjoy the day, however, as Alex’s birthday falls in between international fixtures, with the Seleçao taking on Ecuador and Paraguay in World Cup qualifying.

Sincere best wishes, Alex!
