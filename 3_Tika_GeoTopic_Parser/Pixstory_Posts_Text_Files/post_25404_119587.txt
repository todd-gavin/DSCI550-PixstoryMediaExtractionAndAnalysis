Attempted eye makeup for the first time recently Did a glittery look And a very jugaad sort of a makeup look but I think it looks good I used swiss beauty liquid eyeshadow in the Champagne shade its a rose gold colour on the back of my eyelid and used my Maybelline Creamy Matte lipstick in the front of my lid in the colour rouge No brushes I just blended everything with my finger and to set up everything nicely in the end I did a thin liner a thin line of kajal on my waterline and mascara to complete the eye look
