Tottenham Hotspur manager Antonio Conte has developed a reputation for taking unfancied players and turning them into formidable weapons Now according to Fabrizio Romano January th Spurs are keen on adding Wolverhampton Wanderers winger Adama Traore to their squad in this transfer window The Spanish international is one of the quickest players globally and has an incredible physique but he severely lacks end product So far this season in games he has scored just one goal in the Premier League and provided no assists Now assists can be a harsh way to judge a player because the player in question relies on his teammate to finish a chance off Therefore a much better way to judge a player s impact is to look at chance creation Here we can see that Traore has made crosses per game and key passes per game which for a player of his undoubted quality in a Wolves team playing well under Bruno Lage isn t good enough WhoScored However if Spurs were to make a suitable offer for Traore and bring him to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium I can see him becoming the new Victor Moses or Ashley Young Both became fantastic under Conte s guidance and Traore has all the raw attributes to become a world class right wing back Just imagine his searing pace combined with Heung min Son and Harry Kane he could become absolutely lethal Moses scored eight goals during Conte s time at Stamford Bridge and he scored some crucial goals during the season which ended in the Blues lifting the Premier League trophy Transfermarkt I would argue that Traore has more natural ability than Moses so Conte could finally be the one to unlock his potential However before we can think about that Spurs need to back their manager and add him to Conte s squad
