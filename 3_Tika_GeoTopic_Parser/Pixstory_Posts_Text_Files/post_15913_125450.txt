Abstract We review the application of artificial intelligence techniques AI in the screening diagnosis and classification of diabetic macular edema DME by searching six databases PubMed Scopus Web of Science Science Direct IEEE and ACM from st January to th July A total of articles were extracted and by applying inclusion and exclusion criteria articles were selected for more evaluation The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Quality Assessment for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies QUADAS We provide an overview of the current state of various AI techniques for DME screening diagnosis and classification using retinal imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography OCT and color fundus photography CFP Based on our findings deep learning models have an extraordinary capacity to provide an accurate and efficient system for DME screening and diagnosis Using these in the processing of modalities leads to a significant increase in sensitivity and specificity values The use of decision support systems and applications based on AI in processing retinal images provided by OCT and CFP increases the sensitivity and specificity in DME screening and detection Sources
