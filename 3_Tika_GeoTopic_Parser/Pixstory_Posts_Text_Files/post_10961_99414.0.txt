In March, while the Bharatiya Janata Party in Haryana was promoting The Kashmir Files, a movie that triggered unprecedented scenes of Islamophobia in cinema halls in the country, Kashmiri Pandits in the state were telling us that the government of Manohar Lal Khattar had ignored their pleas for financial assistance in the eight years since they came to power, amid worsening economic woes and little improvement in their quality of life.

Bahadurgarh, Haryana: In March 2022, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Haryana made The Kashmir Files tax free to promote a movie about the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits from the Muslim majority Kashmir Valley, triggering anti-Muslim sentiments across the country.

 
Away from those headlines, Kashmiri Pandits living in the state told Article 14 about running from pillar to post for financial assistance since India’s ruling party came to power in the state in October 2014, five months after Prime Minister Narendra Modi swept to power at the Centre.


Kashmiri Pandit families living in Haryana since the early 1990s said they have only received financial assistance for two years between 2010 and 2012 when a Congress Party government led by the chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda was in power. They have, they alleged, struggled to get monetary assistance from the BJP government over the past eight years.


Around 300 Kashmiri Pandit families live in Haryana today as per Kashmiri Pandit groups in Haryana that this reporter spoke with, but other sources put the figure at over 900.
