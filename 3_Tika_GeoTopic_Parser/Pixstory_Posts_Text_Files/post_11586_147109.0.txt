You can work towards creating peace with food by removing food labels and allowing yourself unconditional permission to eat the foods youâ€™ve restricted.
While this process may sound scary, what happens over time is that you learn to listen to how your body responds to you feeding it a certain way and you choose to eat in a way that makes you feel good. Ultimately, you can enjoy foods that you actually like while choosing not to eat other things.
If you have been restricting foods for a while, this process may take a while so start with foods that seem the least scary to you and work your way to other foods.
Contrary to popular belief, athletes can also make peace with food. If athletes restrict food they may end up in a guilt-deprivation cycle which can ultimately hinder performance long-term by negatively affecting their mental and physical well being.
