Repeatedly Democrats argue that we should increase taxes on the rich However is this policy rational or even intrinsically just The government need money to function and the money must originate from somewhere Governments must establish how each wealth class should bear these taxes regardless of whether the money originates from the affluent or the poor Although it makes sense that the poor be taxed less than the affluent some have called for a system that taxes the poor more than the wealthy or at the very least reduces the tax gap between the poor and the wealthy Indeed many of the wealthiest individuals are the ones who generate economic opportunity CEOs who are flush with cash for instance employ people who are not If the rich were required to turn up practically every dollar they earn beyond a particular threshold to the government they would be less motivated to pursue more opportunities and invest more money in the economy Certain Democrats have called imposing tax rates more than on every dollar earned beyond a certain threshold While it would be ideal if taxed money were utilized for a worthwhile cause it is often the case that government funds are spent inefficiently In this situation a higher tax rate would result in wealthy individuals not investing in the economy and therefore not exchanging their income for goods and services with other people who have less It is conceivable that it is preferable for the affluent to be motivated to privately utilize their money and contribute it to beneficial causes rather than handing it over to the government so that it might be squandered According to the proverb if you give a man a fish he ll eat for the day but if you teach him to fish he ll eat for the rest of his life the same might be said about welfare programs There are numerous organizations that educate individuals how to get back on their feet but there are many more that simply offer those in need money or services with not much else
