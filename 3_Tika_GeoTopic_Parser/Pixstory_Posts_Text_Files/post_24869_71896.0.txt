Don Winslow, an author and political activist, tweeted a photo of an obsessive reader's fantasy library on the first Tuesday of the year. Almost every surface of the room is covered in books, which are bathed in the buttery glow of three table lamps. There are books on the tables, books placed on mahogany ladders, and books heaped on even more books that line the room's shelves. "I hope you appreciate the beauty in this as much as I do," Winslow wrote in the tweet, which received 32,800 likes.


This image may look familiar if you spend enough time on Twitter's literary corners. It rises around once a year, and the library has been credited to authors such as Umberto Eco and buildings over the years.
