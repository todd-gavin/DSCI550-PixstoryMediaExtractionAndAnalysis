Kai Havertz provided Chelsea fans and staff a cause to forget about their troubles for a while after a week of unparalleled turmoil for the club.

U.S News reported that Havertz scored an 89th-minute winner to give Chelsea a 1-0 victory against Newcastle in the Premier League on Sunday, in a game that came to symbolise the Premier League's links to so-called "sportswashing" by unscrupulous owners.

Havertz controlled a cross into the box with a beautiful first touch before slotting a cool finish into the net, setting off wild celebrations among the Stamford Bridge fans. 

After the UK government placed penalties on Russian owner Roman Abramovich, it may be some time before Chelsea plays in front of a sold-out home stadium again.

Chelsea's tight grip on third place in the table was maintained with the win, which came after a 3-1 triumph over Norwich on Thursday. More importantly, it brought much-needed excitement to everyone associated with the club, with manager Thomas Tuchel dedicating the victory to the Chelsea employees who were worried about their employment. 

"They (players and coaches) are far more concerned right now than we (players and coaches) are because we are still fortunate," Tuchel remarked. "It's crucial for them that we display battling spirit like this." This is what we can do... and it may give us the opportunity to set it aside every three days and concentrate on the things we can control." 

It was Newcastle's first league defeat of the season, breaking a nine-game unbeaten streak.
