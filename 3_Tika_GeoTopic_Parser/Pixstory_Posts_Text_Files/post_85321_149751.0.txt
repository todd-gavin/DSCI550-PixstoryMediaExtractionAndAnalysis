Leeds United have enjoyed a steady start to their Premier League season and currently sit in 11th place. They are still in transition under new manager Jesse Marsch but have adapted well to the coach’s plans as it was always going to be a tough transition as Leeds playedsuch an extravagant brand of attacking football under former manager Marcelo Bielsa, which ultimately led to his sacking. One cannot dispute how exciting Leeds were to watch under Bielsa however the number of goals they were conceding proved to be detrimental and theclub narrowly survived relegation as they finished 17th last season. Marsch must be given credit for how he led the side to avoid relegation, but Leeds fans will be expecting a much improved season under the American. We will look at the SWOT of their squad for thisseason.
Strengths
Leeds’s biggest strength is their attacking players. When they enjoyed success under Bielsathey would outscore sides to compensate for the goals they would naturally concede and they would produce winning results. The likes of Patrick Bamford, Rodrygo, and Jack Harrison are talented players who have done well playing this brand of football. Under Marsch, the attacking players have continued showing their quality and have contributed with good performances so far this season. Leeds’s fans will hope that their attacking impotence continues throughout the season and so far this looks to be the case which is why their attacking department is their biggest strength.
