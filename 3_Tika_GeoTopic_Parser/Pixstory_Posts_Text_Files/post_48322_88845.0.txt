The delimitation commission constituted by the Narendra Modi government has proposed six additional seats for Jammu and only one more seat for Kashmir, leading to widespread criticism from political leaders in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The proposal has set alarm bells ringing in as the population of people living in Kashmir is 15 lakhs more than that of people living in Jammu as per the last census. The move is being seen as a blatant political ploy of the BJP by the major political leaders in Kashmir. 45%).Delimitation in J&K has been a longstanding plan for the BJP, and the party has often raised the bogey of underrepresentation of the Jammu region even though the Jammu region had got a better deal than Kashmir in the delimitation in 1995 when its number of seats was increased from 30 to 37 and Kashmir's from 43 to 46 despite the huge difference in population. This time Jammu's number of seats is set to be increased from 37 to 43 and Kashmir's from 46 to 47. Kashmir's constituencies have an average population size of 1.46 lakh against Jammu's average of 1.25 lakh. There have also been growing protests among the Muslim population in the Jammu provinceâ€™s Chenab and Pir Panjal. According to them, Muslim-majority Assembly segments has gone down from 14 to 11 in the province. Former bureaucrat Lateef-ul-Zaman Deva said the delimitation has been carried out in violation The J&K Reorganisation Act 2019 and The Delimitation Act-2002. "The proposal is highly objectionable as it has been carried to disproportionately empower one community by disempowering the other," he said. The delimitation exercise was not to be held till 2031 but the Union along with the Article 370, repealed the law governing the delimitation in the state. It then incorporated provisions for a delimitation exercise in the Jammu and Kashmir reorganisation Act, 2019 making delimitation possible earlier than it's originally specified date.
