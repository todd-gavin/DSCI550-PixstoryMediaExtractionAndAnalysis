Two days from the end of the season, Modena conquers fundamental points in the Emilian derby against Imolese, extending their lead over Reggiana to give victory to Attilio Tesser&#39;s team because it was not a striker but Riccardo Gagno who is the goalkeeper At the end of the match with the score locked on the goalkeeper class in an unexpected attempt to throw the ball towards his attackers he incredibly found the goal that decided the match A fortuitous clearance with the ball bouncing on the edge of the opponent&#39;s penalty area effectively bypassing the goalkeeper from Imolese who remained out of goal An exceptional goal that made the Giallobl fans explode with joy and the whole team ran right towards Gagno to celebrate the victory together which brings Modena one step away from returning to Serie B
