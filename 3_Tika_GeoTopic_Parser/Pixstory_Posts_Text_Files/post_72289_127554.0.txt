Arsene Wenger said he still has some grief about leaving Arsenal because he still has feelings for the team he had a significant role in for several years. From 1996 until 2018, Wenger led Arsenal, becoming an institution at the club and one of the greatest managers in the history of English football.

The Frenchman hasn't worked with the club since he left, since he accepted a position as FIFA's Chief of Global Football Development, but he claims it's still tough for him to be away from the organization.

He said that he felt a little depressed. It's the end of a devotion rather than a love since I still like watching Arsenal and the Premier League. It's the first league I watched, and it is still the case now. It's challenging because you're no longer as tightly a part of it as you once were. "

He went on to say that, "Even though I've been doing this work for roughly forty years, never choosing a single year off, it is clearly incredibly tough when you miss the pressure, the intensity, the amazing moments, and even the terrible ones you miss." Naturally, it was really difficult because of this.

Wenger continued by talking about his biggest opponent, Jose Mourinho, with whom he had infamous fights frequently while the Special One was in charge of the Premier League.

The former manager of Arsenal claims that because such matches were always among the most important on the schedule, he always looked forward to taking on Mourinho's Chelsea.

"Well, in general, I would say that it is usually a major game, one that determines the title, and, at the time, it was more between Man United and Chelsea," he said. But I never made any accusations about the manager personally; my rivalry was always with the clubs.
