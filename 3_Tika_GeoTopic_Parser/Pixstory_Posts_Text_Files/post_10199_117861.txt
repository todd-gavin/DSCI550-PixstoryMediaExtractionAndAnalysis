Here is part Together we made an All India Brick Klin Worker Union and I was its General Secretary For the next years I and Bapuram Pakhade worked extensively for the union We spread its work in Delhi and Haryana and the union grew to a huge level When I joined the union in at that time the payment for these labourers was rupees for raw bricks which are called pathera in Hindi And when I left the union in exactly after years the workers were paid rupees for doing the same work When these workers were paid rupees their contractors used to cut their wages as they would sometimes not include around raw bricks or so and during monsoon the number would even go upto which made these workers not receive their full payment But within years they started receiving their full payment I worked with sincere honesty and with all our efforts and those workers blessings we were able to achieve our goal I remember how we used to travel the entire Delhi by using a motorcycle for the union s work however later in we bought a jeep but the hustle was real When we were working in Haryana we even got threats and thus we shifted our agitation to Haryana Bhawan in Delhi Social activist Swami Agnivesh who was then a MLA too supported our cause and got associated with it But the catch was that he wanted to make this entire cause into a political agenda for his own good We cleared things with him and reinforced the spirit of the union which is working for society and working for these exploited workers To be continued
