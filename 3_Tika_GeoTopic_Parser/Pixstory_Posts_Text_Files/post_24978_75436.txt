First to accept your child has special needs is not easy Than began search for perfect doctor who can help you sail through these troubled times After many recommendations I started consulted Dr Mohammad Rafiq Pampori Ex Principal of Government Medical College Srinagar In my opinion the only doctor of valley who is an angel for such kids He not only gave confidence to us as well as our child He told us about cochlear implants and also said an early intervention can help in development of his speech at par with other kids his age Around medical examinations of Mohammad Numaan were done One examination turned out to be a Herculean task it was a simple which took me months at SMHS hospital to get done The problem was he was not getting fully unconscious for around minutes for it and was regaining consciousness midway As getting into that bright noisy machine can overwhelm adults managing a child his age was almost impossible It was very tough for me to go for the cochlear implant surgery as the cost of implant was too high and most important thing was to get myself and family ready for the surgery for innocent child who even does not know what all is going on around him We all were helpless to understand him and make him understand that his ability of hearing and talking all depends on the cochlear implant We couldn t explain it was only option to hear the sounds and be able to talk I had to keep my blood pressure in check and my heart would often miss a beat till the date of surgery approached It was February date given by Dr Rafiq Pampori for the Cochlear Implant of Mohammad Numaan at Modern Hospital Srinagar As he was taken to the operation theater all my family members and well wishes stood by my side at the hospital The implant surgery took hours and every second and minutes I was crying and crying till my son came out of the operation theatre To be continued
