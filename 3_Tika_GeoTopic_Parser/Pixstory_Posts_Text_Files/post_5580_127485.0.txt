My name is Meera Bharti. I am a ward member of Saraiya ward from Chitrakoot Zila Parishad. In recent times, I have been repeatedly arrested for asking questions, expressing dissension, and holding my government accountable. Whenever people's elected representatives have visited my district on official business such as inaugurations, the state has placed me under house arrest or kept me under observation in police stations.  

I have seven ongoing cases against me, including sedition and unlawful assembly. In May this year, when a minister of the Uttar Pradesh government visited a hospital in my district, I raised my voice against the hospital staff, who had made a show of treating a woman, already dead, in front of the minister. What was the point of this humiliating show, where poor people are not treated with dignity? 

In July, prior to the chief minister's visit to my district, in fact to my ward, I was held under arrest for 24 hours, until his visit came to an end. I was placed under house arrest once again in July and slapped with Section 151 IPC for unlawful assembly. The state was agitated that when the chief minister and prime minister visit to inaugurate the Bundelkhand Expressway, I should not be free to wave black flags against unequal development. A letter to this effect was issued. I have never shown black flags to protest. I rely on the powers and rights given to me by our constitution, by Babasaheb, to assert our demands from our governments. But I was arrested for six days. 

This has been my life in our free country. Why? Is it because I ask my government to be accountable to me and my fellow citizens? Is it because I am a Dalit woman raising my voice and asserting my rights? How can we celebrate 75 years of independence when women like me are not free?
