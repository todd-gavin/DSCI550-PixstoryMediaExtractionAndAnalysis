Seeing the smiles on their beautiful faces makes me happy and I wish Afghan children could always be happy and free of war Their grandmother is in Afghanistan and they wish she could see her in these lovely traditional dresses Their grandmother made these lovely gowns and had them shipped from Afghanistan to India by relatives They were only in their fifth year when they moved to India and they didn t know their grandmothers well They now wished they could see their grandmother again
