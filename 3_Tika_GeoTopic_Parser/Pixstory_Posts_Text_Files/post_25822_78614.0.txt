Doomscrolling refers to obsessively and excessively reading news full of despair, sadness and negativity, notwithstanding the anxiety and fear of your mind. Mindlessly doomscrolling for several hours can take a serious toll on our mental health which can further cause complications.
The onset of the novel coronavirus in 2019 propelled a large number of people to look up for reliable information about the virus on the internet and in no time they ended becoming a victim of doomscrolling. 
People do not intend to read bad and disturbing news on the internet but a constant fear in their minds and the state of apprehension allows little room for positivity and optimistic thoughts. Gradually we are caught in a web and this never-ending vicious cycle starts strangling us.
What can one do to avoid or come out of this pandemonium?
Talking will surely serve as the best remedy to get rid of this toxic activity. You can talk to a family member or a close friend and share your concerns and doubts. However, consulting a therapist should be the best choice. Engage yourself in physical activities and monitor your screen time. You can overcome this problem with a little determination and self-control.
