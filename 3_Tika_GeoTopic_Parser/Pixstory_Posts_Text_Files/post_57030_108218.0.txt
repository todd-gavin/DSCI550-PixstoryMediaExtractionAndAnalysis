Not being able to comprehend what others would have felt in any particular situation is very common because we often care about our feelings, emotions and the harm the situation has thrown upon us.
Although there's no harm in putting one's feelings and emotions first and then thinking about others, here the situation differs.

Sometimes it becomes necessary to understand someone, and for understanding, you need to consider things from their point of view. The quote from the novel  " To Kill a Mockingbird"  very well manifests the meaning " you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view until you climb inside of his skin and walk around it."

There's a little anecdote behind it; I never understood or realised the intentions behind anything or everything my father used to utter; it seemed so futile, always like a sermon.
But it happened to be that once it was not me bearing his cruel words (which are not cruel now); instead, it was my little sister, everything he uttered seemed so relevant, and to the point, I understood it but not my sister.
For the first time, I tried to climb inside my dad's mind and views, and it all seemed so justified, and that's when I realised everything he says is not inappropriate or irrelevant; instead, it is me not being able to consider his point of view.

So trying to put yourself in someone else's position can make things more clear and easier. Try it once!
