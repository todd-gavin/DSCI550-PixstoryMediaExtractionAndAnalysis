People from many walks of life, different social statuses, and diverse economic circumstances desire to provide their children with the greatest education possible. For a child's healthy development, he or she requires a good school, a pleasant environment, cooperative and nice classmates, and, above all, an unbiased environment. A school-issued uniform first and foremost establishes its identity, conceals the child's parental background, and instils a sense of oneness without discrimination. No one can assess the children's family status, caste, creed, economic conditions, religion, etc. because the school uniform acts as a barrier to such type of approach because the colour, design, pattern, and material of the school uniform is one and the same, and it is this that brings all children towards friendliness cutting across all barriers during school recess or in a classroom on first glance.
