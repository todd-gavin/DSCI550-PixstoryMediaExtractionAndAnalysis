One sentence that Makes Every Woman Frustrated ?? Any guesses ?? Let me tell you - " The man is more likely to shed unwanted pounds earlier than woman ! " 😑

I hear this all the time , and it makes me Irritated ! But According to me Without getting irritated We all should think about the solution ! ✅

There are several reasons Due to which i can't loss Fat ! And I can guarantee you , you can also relate to these reasons ! 🤔

Let me tell you my 3 mistakes i made in my fat loss journey 😳

1 🍛Eating too less

I know ain’t nobody is Inviting you at “Daawat-e-ishq” But this doesn't mean you will start eating too less . Restriction will either lead to overeating in the end or metabolism destruction . It can also create nutrition deficiency and can lower your immunity . So please don't go for “ Mai to raste se jaa rha tha , bhel puri kha rha tha" eating patterns .💃

2 😴Not getting enough sleep

“Neend churayi teri kisne oo sanam?” Jisne bhi churayi , this is also one of the reasons for not losing fat ! Your sleeping patterns influence your hormones and critical weight loss functions like your metabolism and appetite regulation . Seven to eight hours each night is ideal , so try not to sleep significantly less or more . So please maintain your “sona khara khara”😴🌟

3 🤨Hating your current body

We all have a certain goal body But , Hating your body will get you nowhere . Infact increase your stress and eventually your cortisol levels will shoot up and hence the hormonal imbalance . This body has helped you survive so far , the least you can do is deal with your body with all the kindness and love . 


Tell me in notes which one are you guilty of ? 😩💭
