Jannik Sinner was eliminated in the quarter-finals of the Internazionali d&#39;Italia by Stefanos Tsisipas in a two-faced match the first set was hard fought and ended in a tie break for the Greek tennis player In the second set instead there was no match and it ended due to Too much difference despite even at the beginning of the match Sinner hadn&#39;t got off to a very good start suffering an injury that seemed to leave no room for the South Tyrolean who instead recovered by reaching the tie break It was just an injury suffered at the tie break that cost Sinner dearly My left hip twisted in the last point of the tie break of the first set while recovering a forehand he said in the post match conference after the medical time out the situation did not improve and in the second set I was unable to keep the level of the first I did not push anymore The first set I played well above all from baseline I had more chances than him and I also scored more points I lost by a hair&#39;s breadth he saved himself with his service Maybe I would have lost anyway even without hip problems we don&#39;t know I have to keep the experience of the first set from this match
