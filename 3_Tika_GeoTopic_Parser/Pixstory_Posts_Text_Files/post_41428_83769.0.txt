The invasion of Ukraine by Russia has had an impact on European sports, especially basketball. 
According to Michael Stockton's agent, Mike Main, the son of NBA Hall of Famer John Stockton, who was playing professional basketball in Ukraine, was able to leave the nation last week and return to his home in Spokane, Washington. 

USA Today reported that Stockton, 32, averaged 10.2 points, 6.2 assists, 3.3 rebounds, and 1.1 steals a game for Budivelnyk Kyiv in Ukraine's SuperLeague. Budivelnyk, which is now in second place, was his first season with the team. 

Archie Goodwin, Stockton's teammate and the No. 29 pick in the 2013 NBA draught, just departed Ukraine and inked a deal to play in Israel, according to his agent, Eric Fleisher.

“The team kept saying, ‘Everything is fine, everything is going to be OK,’ ” Fleisher said. “Having been through similar situations in Ukraine and Israel in the past when there was a conflict, there is a timeliness and build-up, and it was clear to me it was time to leave. The more knowledge you have, the easier it is to sift through what’s real and not real. I said to Archie, ‘It’s time to leave.’ ”
