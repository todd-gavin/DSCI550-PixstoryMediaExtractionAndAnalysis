 Godfrey rushed ahead and at the last river pool where the water is most stagnant he knelt down for one last time at the end of the trail to quench his thirst Nature humbles you often brings you down onto your knees and gently teaches you appreciation for what we have My sure Tip for hiking the Fish River Canyon is that you carry more than one sizeable bottle of water to help you get through the dry stretches where you battle heat and exhaustion cross boulders followed by your feet sinking into loose sand before you reach a river pool again One rule that hauntingly hit home this week was to never walk alone in the Canyon As a rule you walk in a group of minimum three people Also carry a satellite phone in case of medical emergency Recently we sadly received news of a hiker who passed on just six kilometres before the end of the trail Day is a long open stretch with no water or shade until you reach the Ais Ais Resort Our group split up towards the end as we rushed to reach Ais Ais in desperate need of water My family had walked towards the trail to meet us They were worried because group and had finished hours before us We were Group This was one of the most beautiful hikes I have done The many photographs online will show you why And yes I would do it again Perhaps with even greater caution too The Fish River Canyon hiking conditions are one of a kind It completely finished the boots of Chris Mark and Godfrey But this too we had prepared for and we remain grateful for all the advice received
