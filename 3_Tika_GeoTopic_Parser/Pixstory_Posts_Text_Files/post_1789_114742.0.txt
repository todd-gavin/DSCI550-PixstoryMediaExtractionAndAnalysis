This is Pran, in his famous Abraham Lincoln do, in the film "Amar Akbar Anthony". Pran plays a chap who does the bidding for a smuggler called "Raaabaarrtt" (as Pran calls him), and then to avenge his ill-treatment, becomes a smuggler himself. 

His three sons, separated from him, grow up as Hindu, Muslim & Christian. 

Amar Akbar Anthony, which was released in 1977, perfected the formula of lost & found sons. And yes, one of the sons becomes a police inspector, while the other is a bootlegger. 

AAA created magic at the box-office in 1977. It was Manmohan Desai's golden year as his other film "Dharam-Veer" also proved to be a superhit. AAA also sported the song which featured Lata, Rafi, Kishore & Mukesh together for the first & only time. The song was "Humko tumse ho gaya hai pyaar kya karein". AAA also featured Bachchan spouting Angrezi gibberish "The coefficient of the linear is juxtaposition". 

A zany, madcap film that can be seen even today. 

Quite why Pran sported the Ab Lincoln look has never been explained though.
