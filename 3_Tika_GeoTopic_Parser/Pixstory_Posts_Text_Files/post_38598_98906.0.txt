Garner has been compared to Michael Carrick due to his similar movements as a box to box midfielder, playing simple crisp passes and playing through the lines. Ex-boss Ole Solskjaer had high praise  for him. But it won’t be wise to compare him with the United legend, as he is only 21-years old. Incoming boss Erik Ten Hag will be looking to strengthen certain areas of the pitch, he would have a keen eye on midfield, defense and attacking positions. Midfield will be his priority as a host of players are leaving Old Trafford, and Fred and McTominay can’t be depended on fully to hold the fort. Garner fits perfectly, as he is good at pressing, tackling, passing and creating chances. He could slot into midfield, though another DM would be needed as United can’t depend on Scott McTominay.

Garner’s loan ends this season and technically, he should move to a club in the Championship which is more possession-based and higher up the table. But he should fit into Ten Hag’s plans as the gaffer who currently manages Ajax integrates players who press high, have a creative touch, are good from set-pieces, defend from set-pieces, protect the lead and ability to score goals(Gravenberch, Klassen). This season, he should bring in Garner and a defensive midfielder who partners him with Bruno Fernandes up front to perform the role of Tadic at Ajax.

After the Englishman’s exploits in the Championship, he is ready to step up and take the starting place at Manchester United. He won’t be a fringe player and with rumors doing rounds that Leeds is interested in acquiring him, United should recall him and put him in the starting lineup. James Garner could be the player who fixes Manchester United's midfield for a good 7 to 8 years.
