The series The Man Without Fear is back. 

Marvel Studios is finally going forward with a Daredevil series for Disney+ after multiple teasers of characters from Netflix's Daredevil show in its own material. 

Hollywood Reporter said that Matt Corman and Chris Ord have been chosen to create and executive produce a series that will be significant for being the first of the Netflix Marvel projects to be renewed. 

Prior to launching their heroes on Disney+, Marvel's TV division, led by Jeph Loeb at the time, produced many dark titles for Netflix as part of a multi-year partnership. Daredevil, Jessica Jones, The Punisher, and Iron Fist were among them. The Defenders, an Avengers-style event series, was born from the interwoven shows.

Daredevil proved to be one of the more popular outings from the streamer, lasting three seasons, and star Charlie Cox won over fans with his portrayal of blind avenging attorney Matt Murdock, aka Daredevil. Fans were enthralled when the actor reprised the character for a cameo in last yearâ€™s Spider-Man: No Way Home, teasing a potential return.
