If you are a Marvel fan then get excited because from tomorrow onwards Marvel Studios new web series called Ms Marvel is releasing only on Disney Hotstar and Marvel will introduce a new superhero to the world But before reviewing each episode every week I am here to give a brief introduction about Ms Marvel and what can you expect from the upcoming series Ms Marvel s story will revolve around the character named Kamala Khan who is growing up in the streets of Jersey City but her roots are connected with Pakistan Kamala Khan idolises superheroes like Captain Marvel never dreaming she d have the opportunity to join her role model in safeguarding the society from the forces of evil When Black Bolt of the Inhumans released the Terrigen Mist in the atmosphere to transform and empower several latent members of the super powered race the effect of his actions also changed Kamala Khan and now she wants to change the world around her but I think Marvel will not introduce Black Bolt in this series After the inhumanity awakened her now Kamala Khan discovers that now she can extend her limbs alter her appearance and she can shift shape in various manners After realising her powers Kamala Khan made her customised suit while taking inspiration from the Captain Marvel suit and also Kamala adopted discarded Ms Marvel name According to Marvel Comics Ms Marvel will team up with mutant Wolverine and her fellow Inhumans to become a local superhero but as a Marvel fan I think Wolverine will not appear in this series but Inhumans can because in the trailer there is very little glimpse of four people behind the smog There are also rumours that at the end of this series Captain Marvel will make an appearance in this series and will tell Kamala Khan to join her in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and helps Captain Marvel to save the world against big villains As a Marvel fan I can t wait to see the first episode of Ms Marvel
