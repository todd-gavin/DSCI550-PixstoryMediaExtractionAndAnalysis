Some of the main reasons why India hockey coaches—from Michael Nobbs to Graham Reid—preferred to have a certain Akashdeep Singh in their team include presence of mind, peripheral vision in the D, combined with lethal attacking abilities. The forward has been a crucial member of the Indian team since making his debut at the 2012 Champions Trophy in Melbourne. He has participated in all major competitions, including the Olympics and World Cup. When Akashdeep was purchased as the most expensive player in the Hockey India League (HIL) auctions in 2015, earning $84 in the process, his stock shot through the roof. His squad frequently won with the help of his abilities and playing style, whether it was the Champions Trophy, Asia Cup, or Asian Games, for which he was rightfully honoured.
