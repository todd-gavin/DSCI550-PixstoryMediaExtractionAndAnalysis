Seven days after beating Bodo/Glimt, we’re back facing the same opposition again on Thursday night as we aim to take another step towards qualification for the knockout stage of the Europa League.Following the 3-0 win at Emirates Stadium last week, Mikel Arteta admitted that he expects a very different test in this return game, as we head to the Arctic Circle for an encounter that’ll take place on an artificial pitch.It’s a place teams haven’t enjoyed heading to in recent years, with Bodo/Glimt winning all of their last 14 home matches in European competitions, the longest run by any side since Barcelona’s 15-game stretch which ended in March 2017.𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐞Bodo/Glimt play at the Aspmyra Stadion, which holds 8,270 spectators. The club is hoping to build a new 10,000-seater stadium to mark Glimt being named European Capital of Culture for 2024, with the aim of making it the most sustainable stadium in the world.The club’s supporters are known to bring a giant yellow toothbrush to their games, a tradition that started after the item was used by fans to conduct singing in the stands. For many years visiting teams have received a yellow toothbrush ahead of matches.Despite being based in one of the world’s northernmost towns 200 miles inside the Arctic Circle, conditions aren’t expected to be too cold, with a temperature of around 8 degrees celcius come kick-off time.𝐒𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐰𝐞 𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐭 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐝Following their trip to Emirates, Bodo/Glimt were back in league action on Sunday and recorded a 4-1 win at home to Sandefjord to record their first victory on home turf since August.Knutsen made four changes to his starting XI, who trailed at the break when Espejord and Saltnes were introduced to the fray. Within 15 minutes, goals from Vetlesen and Wembangomo had turned the game on its head.The division’s top scorer Pellegrino then netted his 21st league goal of the season, before Vetlesen completed his brace to ensure Bodo/Glimt remain second in the table - 15 points behind leaders Molde with only six games left to play.
