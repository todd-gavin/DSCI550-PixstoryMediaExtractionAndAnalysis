Starting as a young kid who would look at his cousins play Tennis I soon fell into that spell too and joined a proper Tennis academy in my district After that life offered me a lot of opportunities and I am glad I could make good use of most of them I went to amazing heights beginning with Junior ITF to playing internationally in Europe and Asia I also won doubles matches in Pakistan and went to play in Malaysia Russian and Croatian players Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Goran Ivani evi were my inspirations One needs to know that there is no shortcut to success The key is mental strength and hard work All sports activities need immense concentration As a professional player I would meditate half an hour before every competition and calm my mind It is necessary to walk into the court with full confidence and no fear Physical injuries will happen but if you re mentally strong you will get through those as well As mentioned earlier I took advantage of many opportunities however not all I could have also been a part of the Senior team but I couldn t I had a supportive family who were doing everything in their power to send me to different tournaments However the financial strain created issues The Government couldn t do much to help my case further I joined Oil India after a while where I started working full time Regardless my achievements in this sport are something I ll never forget I will always hold them very close to my heart
