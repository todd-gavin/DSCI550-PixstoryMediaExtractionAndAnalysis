Heavy metal is a very diverse genre just like rock and despite the fact that it is predominantly an underground genre it too is guilty of harbouring many songs that are criminally overplayed due to their more mainstream inclinations Now having a metal song that appeases the masses is definitely a good thing as it introduces an otherwise overlooked genre to a wider audience While it may be true for some the problem is that overplaying these songs does not reflect the sound for a majority of the bands Overplaying a song can render it overrated by music critics and magazines which overshadows the better songs created by them Now just because a song is overrated or overplayed does not make it bad instantly in fact some of the biggest classics are classics because they have been ridiculously overplayed in movies serials and video games For example Master Of Puppets is held as a staple for metal as it should be as it is beyond a doubt a brilliant song But the fact remains it is not Metallica s best song Same goes for songs like Du Hast Trooper Walk or any of the other songs on the list They are merely guilty of being overplayed which lessens their appeal These are some of the top most overplayed overrated metal songs Enter Sandman Metallica The Trooper Iron Maiden Girls Girls Girls Motley Crue Crazy Train Ozzy Osbourne Pour Some Sugar On Me Def Leppard Tears Don t Fall Bullet For My Valentine Chopsuey System Of A Down The Sound of Silence Simon and Garfunkel cover by Disturbed Master Of Puppets Metallica Through The Fire And The Flames Dragonforce Bring Me To Life Evanescence Psychosocial Slipknot Nothing Else Matters Metallica Du Hast Rammstein Beautiful People Marilyn Manson Walk Pantera Bodies Drowning Pool Paranoid Black Sabbath Hammer Smashed Face Cannibal Corpse Deutschland Rammstein
