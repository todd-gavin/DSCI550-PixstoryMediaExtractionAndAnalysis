After Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) issued a letter warning of suicide attacks in Indian cities in retaliation for the insult to the Prophet Muhammad, security officials are now on high alert. 
On June 6, the AQIS issued a threat letter stating that it will carry out suicide attacks in Delhi, Mumbai, Uttar Pradesh, and Gujarat to "battle for the Prophet's honour." ".. All of the states have been placed on high alert. 
"Saffron terrorists should now await their end in Delhi, Bombay, UP, and Gujarat," the letter says. They should not seek safety in their fortified army cantonments or in their homes." The central authorities swung into action, first verifying the letter and then contacting all state police departments.
