Ranji trophy has started and the matches have been intense for the very least. 
Another such fixture has been Bihar vs Mizoram. Bihar won the toss and put their trust in their batting line-up. The openers failed to impress and got out early on but Sakibul Gani and Babul Kumar were too tough for Mizoram. 
Sakibul Gani became the first triple centurion of the 2021-22 edition of the Ranji Trophy and was involved in a mammoth 538-run partnership with Babul Kumar as Bihar posted 686/5 decl. against Mizoram. Gani's knock was also a world record as he became the first debutant to score a triple hundred in first-class cricket. Gani struck 56 fours and 2 sixes during his 405-ball stay for 341 runs. The Gani-Babul partnership was the fifth time a pair managed 500-plus in Indian first-class cricket and also the fourth highest partnership in Indian cricket. Babul was unbeaten on 229 when Bihar declared their innings. Mizoram were 40/3 in reply, trailing by 646 runs.
Sarfaraz Khan's superb 275 put Mumbai in a strong position in their game against Saurashtra. Starting the day at 263/3, Ajinkya Rahane and Sarfaraz extended their partnership to 252 before the former was dismissed by Chirag Jani. Sarfaraz, who was on 121 at the start of the day, was involved in a 118-run stand for the seventh wicket with Tanush Kotian (50*) before falling 25 short of a triple ton. Mumbai declared their innings at 544/7, and Gujarat batted out nine overs without any damage.
