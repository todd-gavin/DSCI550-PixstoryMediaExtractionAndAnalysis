Ahead of the festive carnival, ‘Big Fashion Festival’, Myntra has rolled out its mega marketing campaign with actors Ranbir Kapoor and Kiara Advani.
Advani’s appeal as a fashion trendsetter and Kapoor’s cool demeanour are poised to accelerate conversations around Myntra’s apparel segments. They will play a pivotal role in connecting one of India’s leading fashion, beauty and lifestyle platforms with millions of new and existing fashion-forward consumers. 
The campaign’s tagline, "Myntra Big Fashion Festival. India's Biggest Fashion Dhamaka. Don't Waste Time" communicates the scale of the event, positioning Myntra as the go-to destination for every fashion need this festive season, while also apprising shoppers of Myntra’s value offerings as part of the mega event. Poised to leverage Myntra's position as India's fashion expert, the campaign featuring Kapoor and Advani will be amplified across TV, digital and social media.
As a part of Myntra’s multi-channel activation, national celebrities, fashion and lifestyle influencers will form an important network of proponents for Myntra’s Big Fashion Festival (BFF). They will engage with a very large fan base across the country and highlight Myntra’s proposition of biggest brands, styles, products and offers to reach every part of the country and demography, with the central message of the campaign that urges shoppers to look nowhere but Myntra for all their festive fashion needs.
