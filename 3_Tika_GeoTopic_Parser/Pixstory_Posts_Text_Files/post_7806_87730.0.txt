Denis Villeneuve has been snubbed big time by the Academy Awards and this feels all too similar. He hasn't been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director. It feels just like when Christopher Nolan wasn't nominated for Inception and same goes for Ben Affleck when he directed Argo. What pains me most is that the movie is nominated for 10 categories which are all inter-related and would've been majorly looked after by Denis Villeneuve himself and still the Academy has overlooked him. Many Hollywood celebrities have considered this to be the biggest Oscar Snub this year. Villeneuve has been nominated for Dune for the category of Adapted Screenplay and the Best Picture( as he is one of the producers.) Its just baffling how Villeneuve didn't get the nomination for Best Director he deserved. Primarily he is a director so this would've hurt.

Denis does deserve the credit for the epic creative vision of this movie that was adapted from the novel. He set up the universe perfectly while delivering a brilliant well acted movie. Denis has said that he wanted to make this since his childhood, so this nomination would've meant the world for him 

Denis Villeneuve very modestly said that he's happy that the movie got nominated for 10 categories. He's deeply pleased about these nominations. Sometimes it just gets frustrating when such visionary directors aren't nominated for their amazing work. Its not just in one category but almost every category since the start of the awards there have been very shocking snubs. There needs to be a proper process to ascertain who will get nominated and this process need to be made more clear to the geenral public 

I don't take any credit away from the directors that have been nominated but I just think that Denis Villeneuve deserved this nomination for Dune.
