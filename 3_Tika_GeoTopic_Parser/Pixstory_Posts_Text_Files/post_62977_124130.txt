I agree will all your points While I don t know about wildlife as much as you do you completely missed one point between the comparison The Komodo s never missing venom Their venom is strong enough to overpower the tiger s attack One bite will all it ll take Also their tails I wonder if it ll even let a tiger come close enough because of that Sundarban tigers are also the smallest tigers on the planet so unlike other tigers they won t have much a size advantage While of course none of us can surely state which one of them will win until we actually have them face off but I have a feeling a komodo dragon will be able to overpower a tiger with quite an ease
