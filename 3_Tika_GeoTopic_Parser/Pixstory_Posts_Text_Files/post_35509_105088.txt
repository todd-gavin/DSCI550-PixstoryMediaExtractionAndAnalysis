Molina is a player who, due to the interest he is arousing in Italy and abroad, will be difficult to retain. So I hope that an Italian team will take him and enhance him. I believe that Juventus has the ability to do so. These are the words of Umberto Marino General Manager of Udinese interviewed by Tuttosport it is clear that after the excellent season retaining Molina is an impossible feat for the Juventus management who therefore aim to sell him to the highest bidder
