 Predictors of use and improvement in glycemic indices after initiating continuous glucose monitoring in real world Data from Saudi Arabia Ebtihal Y AlyusufaSaharAlharthibAbdullah M AlguwaihesaAnwar A JammahaAssim A AlfaddaacdMohammed E Al Sofiani Abstract Background and aims To identify predictors of use and benefit from continuous glucose monitoring CGM in people with type diabetes T D Methods Predictors of CGM use and changes in glycemic indices and other clinical parameters after initiating intermittently scanned CGMs were examined in individuals with T D Participants were categorized based on frequency of CGM sensor scanning at month into Frequent users scans day and infrequent users scans day Results Frequent CGM users had an improvement in TIR and time above range TAR at months and whereas infrequent users had comparable improvements only at month Individuals with baseline TIR had a significant improvement in TIR and TAR whereas those with baseline TIR had a significant improvement only in TBR Baseline TIR and higher frequency of scans were predictive of improvement in TIR at month OR p p respectively whereas baseline TBR was the only predictor of improvement in TBR OR p Being a woman higher number of scans day in the first weeks of CGM use and having a lower baseline A C predict being a frequent scanner at month OR p p and p respectively Conclusions Improvement in glycemic control with CGM use can be predicted by scans day at months and baseline TIR and TBR
