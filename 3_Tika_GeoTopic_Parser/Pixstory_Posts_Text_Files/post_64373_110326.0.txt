With its distinct assortion of mountains, rivers, plains, deserts, forests, etc, India offers a large variety of diverse and exciting adventure activities that awaits to be experienced and explored. Over the years, there has been a steadily increasing enthusiasm and interest with regard to adventure sports in distinct natural settings. People seem to gravitate towards these activities, owing to the thrill and curiosity factors. They want to experience new things that stimulate the senses. Trekking is a wonderfully therapeutic and liberating activity that can be experienced differently in the summer and in the winter. With the vast mountain and hill ranges that riddle India's boundaries and mainland, as well as its beautiful forests and long trails, trekking is one of the most commonly loved adventure sports in the country. Valley of Flowers, Kedarkantha, Manali, Hampta pass, etc, are few of the many popular trek routes in India. Skydiving, mountain biking, scuba diving, camping, paragliding, bungee jumping and river rafting are some of the other adventure sports that are becoming increasingly popular in India. With some of these activities already being in great demand and increasingly sought-after, there are yet many more adventure sports that could enrich tourism in India if openly discovered and experienced.
