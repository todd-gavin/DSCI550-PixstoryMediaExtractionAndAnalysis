Corbevax, a Covid-19 vaccine developed by Biological E Limited, has been approved by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) as a heterologous Covid-19 booster dose. This means that adults who have received their full Covishield or Covaxin vaccination can receive Corbevax as a third or booster shot.

The Corbevax booster can be administered six months after the second dose of the vaccine has been given.

Until now, the booster dosage had to be the same vaccine that had been administered in the first and second shots.

"We are really thrilled with this approval, which will meet the requirement for Covid-19 booster doses in India," Mahima Datla, Managing Director of Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical and vaccines company Biological E Ltd, said. In our Covid-19 vaccination adventure, we've reached another another milestone. Corbevax's continued world-class safety standards and excellent immunogenicity are reflected in this clearance."

TRIALS
Biological E Ltd recently submitted its clinical trial data to the DCGI, which granted approval for administering Corbevax vaccine as a heterologous booster dose to people who have already received two doses of either Covishield or Covaxin after a thorough review and deliberation with the subject expert committee.

The results of the clinical trial demonstrated that the Corbevax booster dose improved immune response while remaining safe. The company tested 416 people ranging in age from 18 to 80 years old.

According to Biological E Ltd, 51.7 million doses of Corbevax have been delivered to children in India, with 17.4 million receiving both doses. The DCGI recommended in April that Biological E's Covid-19 vaccine Corbevax be given emergency use authorization for children aged 5 to 12.

The corporation has provided the Centre with 100 million doses of the vaccine.
