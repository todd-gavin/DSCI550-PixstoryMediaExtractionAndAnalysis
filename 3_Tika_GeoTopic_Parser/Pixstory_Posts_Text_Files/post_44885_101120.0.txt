A former Red Devil, who played under the Dutch coach at Ajax for the last four years, is confident he will be a success at the Theatre Of Dreams. 

New Manchester United boss Erik Ten Hag is “one of the best managers” but he needs time and the full backing of the board at Old Trafford, according to Daley Blind. 


Ten Hag built up a reputation among the best tacticians of Europe during his five-year stay at Ajax, which ended in Eredivisie title success earlier this month. 

The Dutchman has passed up a summer holiday to arrive in Manchester early and start work, with Blind confident he will be a successful manager in his new club. 


What has Blind said about Ten Hag?

 Blind, who played for United for four years before rejoining Ajax in 2018, has talked up Ten Hag’s meticulous management skills and strong character. 

“Erik Ten Hag is a great guy,” the Dutch international said while appearing on Andy van der Meyde’s Youtube channel.


“It’s not an easy job, of course, but he doesn’t run away from it either. He takes up the challenge. I am quite confident in him at Manchester United but he needs the board behind him. At Ajax, he had Van der Saar and Overmars behind whatever happened also in bad times.” 


How big a task is Ten Hag facing at United?

Ten Hag will inherit a United squad that is set to post the club’s worst Premier League performance following their final game of 2021-22 against Crystal Palace. 

Under the interim charge of Ralf Ragnick, the Red Devils have extended their recent trophy drought to five years while dropping out of the Champions League.
