Rains in DelhiRains in Delhi are my favourite. The temperature falls and there’s respite from scorching heat. This year it barely rained in August which was kinda sad. But over the last couple of days, it’s been pouring and the trees and skies are absolutely gorgeous. The soft sound of rain mixed with its earthy smell and chilly air makes is the key to my happiness.
