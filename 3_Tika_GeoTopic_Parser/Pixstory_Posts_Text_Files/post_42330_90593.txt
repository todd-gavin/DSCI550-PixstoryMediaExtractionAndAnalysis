After watching the most awaited pan Indian movie RRR Rise Roar Revolt I can say one thing only that S S Rajamouli Director has the guts to pull off a movie like this Be it action be it drama be it music and be it background music RRR is a story of two individuals Ram and Bheem played by Ramcharan and Jr NTR respectively Ram is working as a Policeman under British Rule and Bheem is a Messiah leader of the Gond tribe and he is on a mission to bring back a tribal girl from the Britishers During the mission Ram and Bheem became friends but then the conflicts of the movie take the story forward and we the viewers got to know the characters secrets their backstory and characters purpose behind their actions There are many things that I liked about the movie which are as follows The action of the movie is top class and most of the action scenes are fresh and you will love it especially the climax scene The music and background music of this movie is exceptional and even the dull scene which is very less looked good The dance battle scene is one of the highlights of the movie and Ramcharan and Jr NTR did a great job If you have little knowledge of filmmaking then you will find some symbolic shots which will help you to understand the context of the particular scene Things that I didn t like about the movie are as follows Hindi Dubbing of the movie is too average dubbing of British characters was worst There are so many endings and subplots in the movie which will stretch the movie a bit but you will never get bored We all know that the characters of this movie are larger than life but a few action scenes are just too much to digest If you are a movie buff and you just started liking a South Indian movie then RRR will make you fall in love with South Indian movies
