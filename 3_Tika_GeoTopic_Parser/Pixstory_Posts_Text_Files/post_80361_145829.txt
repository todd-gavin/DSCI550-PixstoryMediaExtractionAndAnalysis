The discredit must go to the team s midfield which hasn t had much of an impact on crucial moments Apart from Verratti and Vitinha no other player in the midfield has been impactful in terms of finding his own teammates and creating chances The result is that whenever the opposing team tries to attempt a press they gain possession of the ball against the run of play This also leads to the defence getting exposed and conceding a goal out of nowhere This weakness of the team has been used by several oppositions to gain an advantage over the team Opportunities The club which has several honours and prestigious trophies to its name will be looking to achieve greater heights this season by making a few additions to its trophy cabinet for certain Winning the UCL will possibly be one of the biggest priorities for the side this season With the dangerous trio of Mbappe Neymar and Messi looking in fine rhythm at the front this season so far the team will definitely fancy it s chances to finally lift the trophy that has been escaping its grip for quite some years in the past Winning the Ligue titles along with the Coupe de France and Troph e des Champions will be the aim of PSG too Threats The PSG side despite being absolutely flawless in most of the aspects of the game has been a threat to itself due to some reasons One of them is the players being flagged offside on way too many occasions throughout the game The team has had several goals scored by its players ruled out by VAR this season so far The players being in offside position more often proves the fact that they ve been at fault in terms of maintaining proper positioning off the ball VAR penalising the players for being in an offside position majorly results in a breakdown in the momentum of the game and the rhythm of the play also is lost Moreover no player in the midfield showing impactful performances to carry the ball up forward has been a severe issue for the side in the recent times
