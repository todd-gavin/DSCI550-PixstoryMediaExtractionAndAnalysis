From closed bids in the previous IPL media rights to e-auction for the 2023-27 seasons, it was actually BCCI which played smart. 

The world’s richest cricketing body has considerably increased its wealth after selling the media rights for the next five seasons of IPL for a whopping Rs 48,390 crore.

While TV rights went to Disney Star India for Rs 23,575 crore, at the rate of Rs 57.5 crore per game, Reliance-backed Viacom18 led by top media executive Uday Shankar has bagged the digital rights for Rs 20,500 crore at the rate of Rs 50 crore per game.

The board sold Package C (India digital rights 18-game non-exclusive pack) rights for Rs 3,258 crore to Viacom18. This means Viacom18 will pay an additional Rs 36 crore per game for 18 or more games every year. 

In effect, the digital rights would cost Rs 23,758 crore to Viacom18, which is more than the sum the cricketing body received for TV rights.

Package D for the rest of the world was sold for Rs 1,057 crore.

BCCI Secretary Jay Shah and BCCI announced the names of the winners in a series of tweets at the end of Day-3 of the e-auction.
