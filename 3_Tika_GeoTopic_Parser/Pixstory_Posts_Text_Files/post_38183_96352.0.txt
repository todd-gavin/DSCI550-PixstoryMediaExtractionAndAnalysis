As per the Daily Mail, Harry Maguire will not start for Manchester United against Arsenal today. Interim manager Ralf Rangnick is set to drop the center-back for two reasons. 

Firstly, the England international had a horrific showing against Liverpool as the Red Devils lost 4-0 at Anfield. The defender was at fault for two of Liverpool's four goals and this enraged the United fans. 

Following the game, the fans started tweeting #MaguireOut on social media. The Football pundits were critical of Maguire's performance and wanted him to be dropped. But this is not the main reason behind Ralf Rangnick's decision. 

Secondly and most importantly, The Manchester United captain received bomb threats following the loss against Liverpool. Harry Maguire received an email that stated his house was going to be bombed.

Harry Maguire informed the police about this and his house was checked for any potential threats as well. The United captain lives in his Cheshire house with his fiancee Fern Hawkins and his two daughters.

The England International did attend practice after the bomb scare but Ralf Rangnick has reportedly decided to bench him. The Manchester United manager has reportedly done so to keep Maguire away from any more abuses for the time being.
