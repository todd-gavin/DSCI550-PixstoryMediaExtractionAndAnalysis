After Dominican authorities dropped proceedings against Mehul Choksi, the fugitive diamantaire said he wants justice for violationg his human rights. 

Choksi charged with illegally entering into Dominica which he denied and claimed he was abducted from Antigua by the Indian agents and forcibly taken to Dominica. 

His spokesman said: "Mr. Choksi is pleased that the Dominican Government has today dropped all against him for unlawful entry in May 2021. By doing so they now recognise that there was never any case against him. 

"Mr. Choksi was forcibly removed from 
Antigua against his will by agents of the Indian State, viciously assaulted, and taken to Dominica by boat, where he was again unlawfully handed over to authorities for an offence he never committed. 

"Mr. Choksiâ€™s legal team continue to pursue all 
avenues for justice to redress the human rights violations committed against him. Mr. 
Choksi hopes that those responsible for his kidnapping from Antigua on May 23rd 
2021 will be brought to justice."

Choksi is accused of defrauding the Punjab National Bank of Rs 13500 crore along with his nephew Nirav Modi.
