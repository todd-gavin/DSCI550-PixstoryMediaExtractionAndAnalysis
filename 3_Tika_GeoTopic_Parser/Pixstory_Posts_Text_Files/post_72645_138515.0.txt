Under the spearhead leadership of Hibi Edan MP, one lakh and one menstrual cup were distributed across 100 centers and bagged Guinness World Record for the same.
This program is intended to break the social taboo that existed in society regarding periods and menstruation in the female community.
The program was highlighted by the crowd-pulling presence of Asif Ali, the cine actor, and other dignitaries including Dr.Renu Raj, District Collector, and volunteers from Kites Foundation.
Hats off to Hibi Edan and his teammates for organizing such an inquisitive program for removing the shackles of marginalization suffered by our female community.
