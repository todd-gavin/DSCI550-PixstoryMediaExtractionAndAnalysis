Five things you ought to know about Queen Elizabeth II
1. Elizabeth’s birth in 1926 was attended by the home secretary. She became heir to the throne aged 10. She never went to school.
2. Elizabeth was given her first corgi, Susan, on her 18th birthday in 1944. Susan once bit the ankle of a royal clockwinder, Leonard Hubbard, and has her own Wikipedia page, with sections including “royal life” and “death and legacy”.
3. Elizabeth married Philip Mountbatten in 1947. The cake, four tiers and 9ft (2.74 metres) tall, was baked by McVitie’s, of subsequent Hobnob fame.
4. The tradition of a senior politician attending royal births ended in 1948 with the birth of Prince Charles. Buckingham Palace said Elizabeth’s father, King George VI, felt it was “unnecessary to continue further a practice for which there is no legal requirement”.
5. One biographer said Elizabeth endured a 30-hour labour before giving birth by C-section. Philip was not present, and at one point went to play squash.
