These midfielders are typically outstanding ball handlers who can wriggle out of tight situations
with neat footwork before unleashing the attackers with well-weighted through balls or
attempting to score long range goals. The number 8 shirt has been worn by some of the best
athletes in history. Let's look at 8 of the finest eights in history.

Andres Iniesta:

One of the best midfielders in history will always be Andres Iniesta. He was a member of what
are now regarded as the best club team and the best international squad of the twenty-first
century.

Don Andres has had a very successful career, and many football fans think that he was
wrongfully denied the Ballon d'Or several times. Along with Xavi and Busquets, Iniesta formed
an unstoppable trio for Barcelona and Spain in the international arena for several years. His
dribbling, passing, and vision were simply unsurpassed.

He has nine La Liga championships and four Champions League titles with Barcelona.
Spain's
winning goal in the 2010 World Cup final was scored by Iniesta. In the 2010–2011–2012 Ballon
d'Or competition, he came in second, fourth, and third, respectively.

On his day, the small no. 8 was simply unstoppable, moseying out of cul-de-sacs and choosing
passes that were simply incomprehensible to the layperson. After leaving Barcelona in 2018,
Iniesta is still active and presently plays for Japanese team Vissel Kobe.
