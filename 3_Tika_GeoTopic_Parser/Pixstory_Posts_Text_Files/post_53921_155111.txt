Two per cent of all fishing gear used worldwide ends up polluting the oceans our new research finds To put that into perspective the amount of longline fishing gear littering the ocean each year can circle the Earth more than times We interviewed fishers from seven of the world s biggest fishing countries including Peru Indonesia Morocco and the United States to find out just how much gear enters the global ocean We found at current loss rates in years there would be enough fishing nets littering the sea to cover the entire planet This lost fishing equipment known as ghost gear can cause heavy social economic and environmental damage Hundreds of thousands of animals are estimated to die each year from unintentional capture in fishing nets Derelict nets can continue to fish indiscriminately for decades Our research findings help highlight where to focus efforts to stem the tide of fishing pollution It can also help inform fisheries management and policy interventions from local to global scales billion longline hooks litter the sea each yearThe data we collected came directly from fishers themselves They experience this issue firsthand and are best poised to inform our understanding of fishing gear losses We surveyed fishers using five major gear types gillnets longlines purse seine nets trawl nets and pots and traps We asked how much fishing gear they used and lost annually and what gear and vessel characteristics could be making the problem worse This included vessel and gear size whether the gear contacts the seafloor and the total amount of gear used by the vessel We coupled these surveys with information on global fishing effort data from commercial fisheries Fishers use different types of nets to catch different types of fish Our research found the amount of nets littering the ocean each year include kilometres of longline mainlinesnearly square kilometres of gill nets square kilometres of trawl nets square kilometres of purse seine netsIn addition Read more
