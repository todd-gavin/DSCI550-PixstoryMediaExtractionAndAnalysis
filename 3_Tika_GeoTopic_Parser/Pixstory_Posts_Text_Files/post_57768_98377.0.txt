With a close friend studying psychology, I stumbled upon this title and got immediately intrigued to inspect its contents. Sigmund Freud, an Austrian neurologist ,the founder of psychoanalysis, a method to evaluate and treat pathologies relating to the psyche through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst(now more commonly known as a psychologist or a psychiatrist), is renowned for his notable theories regarding cocaine, the unconscious psychosexual development, the id, ego and super-ego, life and death drives, melancholia, religion and dreams. He has written many works elaborating on all his theories on these topics, one such being the book called "Dream Psychology". This book explains Freud's belief that dreams are a representation of our repressed desires and longings, that they are unconscious thoughts of wish fulfillment and motivations. He states that dreams show our most beloved and anxious desires in our unconscious so that we remain motivated while awake to strive and work towards achieving these dreams, of whatever sort they may be. This book was published in 1920 and can be seen as a sort of sequel to his previous publishing in 1899, "The Interpretation of Dreams", which was the original classic relaying Freud's major ideas and psychology principles. That book emphasizes the role of the unconscious and psychoanalysis of dreams as they are highly symbolic having both manifest and latent content. "Dream Psychology" on the other hand, relays that unfulfilled past or present conflicts prop up as dreams, about the unruliness of the unconscious as dreams due to the censor of the preconscious, and their overall mechanism of how dreams are shown and how they should be seen, their interpretation. It is a very fulfilling read, lending some clarity into and about the weird and incredibly complex state and mechanism of the human psychology.
