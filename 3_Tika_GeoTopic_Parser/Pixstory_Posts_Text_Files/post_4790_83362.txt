Documentaries about the climate crisis are often illustrated with spectacular satellite images of forest fires hurricanes and flooded landscapes People around the world weather these conditions with little control over how their experiences are recorded and represented Our project open weather offers the tools and knowledge to change that On the first day of COP the latest UN climate change conference in Glasgow our network of volunteers captured a collective image of Earth by tuning into transmissions from three orbiting National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA satellites We did this using DIY satellite ground stations made up of radio antennae plugged into laptops Each member of the group recorded a satellite image as well as what they could feel and observe of the weather on the ground Across countries and six continents the network recorded a total of images which when stitched together onto a map produced a snapshot of the planet on October This snapshot included a cyclonic weather system curling around the UK dust clouds sweeping the Indian subcontinent and the glaciers of the Patagonian Andes which have been shown by geographer Bethan Davies to be rapidly receding and thinning in response to global warming How to take your own satellite images Receiving images from the public data broadcast of NOAA satellites is something anyone can learn how to do All you need is a basic V shaped antenna a device called a dongle and one of many free software programmes like CubicSDR The antenna and dongle together cost around US Read more at The Conversation Imagery A DIY satellite ground station in London UK Dyer Engelmann Author provided
