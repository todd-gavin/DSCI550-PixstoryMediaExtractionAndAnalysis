From very young age, we have all learned that plants are living things. We have learned about their parts, functions and biological processes. It all has been a fundamental part of our life, especially for 
people who love gardening. But do you ever wonder who first proved that plants have life? 
The person who proved this was Dr. Jagadish Chandra Bose, a man whose talents had no boundaries. He was quintessential polymath : physicist, biologist, botanist, archaeologists and author.Before the advent of the 20th century, science did not classify plants as living organisms. But Bose sought 
to prove this fact and did it on May 10, 1901 in his demonstration at Royal Society in London. 
To prove this, Bose used his invention the Crescograph which could track movement in plants. After adding Bromide a poison, the pulse point was recorded which became unsteady as the plant absorbed 
the poison. Hence, it was proved that plants have life. 
He also went on to prove that plants have neuro system much like other organisms and responded to stimuli. He claimed plants grew well in an peaceful environment with soft music and did not grow well with harsh noise. 
He also researched about electricity and electromagnetic waves. He invented the Coherer, a device that can detect radio waves and became the first Indian to have a US Patent. He was also an author, writing sci-fi novels in Bengali. 
His works were ridiculed by western scientists but after a while his ground-breaking works were 
accepted. He has created the most exceptional and unrivalled legacy and has made the most paramount 
contribution to fields of biology, botany and physics.
