In today's world, diabetes is probably the most common phenomenon people suffer from. According to the World Health Organisation, about 422 million people globally have diabetes. "The most common is type-2 diabetes, usually in adults, which occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't make enough insulin. In the past three decades, the prevalence of type-2 diabetes has risen dramatically in countries of all income levels. Type-1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin by itself," reads a WHO report. This is why experts suggest taking constant care of our diet and lifestyle to manage the blood sugar level in our body. A recent study has found that the humble onions may help do the job.
One of the most commonly available ingredients in the kitchen, onion is a storehouse of several health benefiting properties. The adequate content of flavonoids (and antioxidants) in onion helps keep the blood glucose level in human body under control. As per a report, published in the Independent, a study (of 2015) presented at The Endocrine Society's 97th annual meeting in San Diego, revealed that the extract of an onion bulb can "strongly lower" high blood sugar and total cholesterol levels when given alongside antidiabetic drug metformin. Lead author of the study, Anthony Ojieh of Delta State University in Abraka, Nigeria, states that onion is accessible and has the potential for use in treating and managing diabetes.
Another study, published in the Journal of Medicinal Food, it was found that onions might have compounds that regulate blood sugar spike.
As per a study, published in the journal 'Environmental Health Insights,' onions work the best on our body when consumed raw and fresh. "Consumption of fresh onions reduced blood glucose levels among type-1 and type-2 diabetics," the study reads.
