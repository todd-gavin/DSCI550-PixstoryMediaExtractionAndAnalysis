There are many reasons behind a child s indifferent behaviour The milieu they were brought up in plays an important role So if a child has the history of child abuse or neglect then he could easily develop the signs of ODD oppositional defiant disorder Like mentioned above the ambience affects a lot in child s development so if the child was surrounded with violence or mistreatment then his behaviour is affected by those The uncooperative behaviour is most likely seen in a child when there is instability in his family like witnessing a divorce moving to different houses or changing schools frequently In such cases the child is not able to find stability in his surrounding and it becomes difficult for them to acclimitze themselves in a new situation leading to uncooperative behaviour A good upbringing is also necessary if there s a lack of adult supervision then kids do things by their own choice which makes them develop these unwanted traits So it is important to keep a child in a safe place to avoid such circumstances
