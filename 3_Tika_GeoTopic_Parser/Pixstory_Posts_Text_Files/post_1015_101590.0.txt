George Bush said China is a strategic competitor of the USA as he went about planning ways  to rein in the dragon country.
 Then, he lost all the interest and got mired in America's war on terror. 

Barack Obama talked even more flourishingly about the need to counter China.

 He announced Pivot to Asia. Then he too got busy elsewhere; mostly in Afghanistan. 

Then came Donald Trump, who talked most menacing and came across as somdone who do things that his predecessors couldn't about China. 

However, his act  of pulling the plug on the trans Pacific trade pact only helped China. 

Now Joe Biden is visiting South Korea and Japan. Well. Nothing seems to have changed. Americans talk, and then China can get away with things!
