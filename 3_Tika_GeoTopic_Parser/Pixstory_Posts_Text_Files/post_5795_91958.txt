UN scientists have unveiled a plan that they believe can limit the root causes of dangerous climate change A key UN body says in a report that there must be rapid deep and immediate cuts in carbon dioxide CO emissions Global emissions of CO would need to peak within three years to stave off the worst impacts Even then the world would also need technology to suck CO from the skies by mid century After a contentious approval session where scientists and government officials went through the report line by line the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC has now published its guidance on what the world can do to avoid an extremely dangerous future First the bad news even if all the policies to cut carbon that governments had put in place by the end of were fully implemented the world will still warm by C this century This finding has drawn the ire of the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres Some government and business leaders are saying one thing but doing another Simply put they are lying And the results will be catastrophic That sort of temperature rise would see our planet hit by unprecedented heatwaves terrifying storms and widespread water shortages To avoid that fate the world must keep the rise in temperatures at or under C this century say researchers The good news is that this latest IPCC summary shows that it can be done in what Mr Guterres calls a viable and financially sound manner But keeping temperatures down will require massive changes to energy production industry transport our consumption patterns and the way we treat nature To stay under C according to the IPCC means that carbon emissions from everything that we do buy use or eat must peak by and tumble rapidly after that reaching net zero by the middle of this century Read more Credit BBC
