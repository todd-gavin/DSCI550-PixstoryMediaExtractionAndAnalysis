After their claimed offensive remarks about Prophet Mohammad sparked demonstrations and condemnations, the BJP suspended its spokeswoman Nupur Sharma and removed its Delhi media chief Naveen Kumar Jindal on Sunday.

The news comes only hours after the party issued a statement attempting to diffuse the situation.

The BJP said Jindal's opinions on social media vitiate communal harmony and are in contravention of the party's fundamental convictions, thus he was expelled.

Adesh Gupta, the party's Delhi president, said in a communication that "your main membership is immediately cancelled and you are expelled from the party."

According to a statement from the party's disciplinary committee to Sharma, she has stated views opposite to the party's position on a number of issues, which is a clear breach of the party's constitution.

"With immediate effect, you are suspended from the party and from any obligations or assignments you may have," it read.

The BJP has always stated that it respects all religions and firmly condemns insults to religious figures. Arun Singh, the party's general secretary, said in a statement that the organisation is opposed to any philosophy that degrades or demeans any faith or religion.
