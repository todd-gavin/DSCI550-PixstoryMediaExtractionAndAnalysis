Shooting, in my view, is more a mental sport than it is a physical sport. This is mere because thought process plays an important role in influencing every, shot and how every single shot greatly influences the next. Shooting and even sports in general might appear to be taxing physically. But what a lot of people donâ€™t know is that it is just as taxing mentally. This is one of the most important reasons, I train with both psychologists and physical trainers. Mental preparation is just as if not more important than physical preparation, when it comes to sports. And unfortunately in India, both the idea of training with a sports psychologist and the idea of seeking help when under immense stress are not something that is commonly practiced. Even the legendary player Abhinav Bindra in one of his interviews mentioned that the concept of utilizing the help of sports psychologist in the field of Indian sports is something that is rarely used. Several athletes do not know of the kind of change mental health professionals, can bring to their training routine. This lack of awareness is something that is being dealt with in the recent years, thanks to social media. While there is much noise being made about it in social media, there are still not many people to talk to the current athletes about the importance of seeking professional help. Hence it becomes imperative to both create awareness among athletes and instigate the process of seeking mental training as a viable addition to the pre-existing training process of an athlete.

When I got into sports, I did not understand the importance of seeking the right kind of help or training but as the journey started getting tougher and I started facing bigger hurdles, I saw the need for additional help. Thankfully for me, my team consists of the right kind of people who provided me with quality help. And I truly hope that every Indian athlete is made aware of the importance of this.
