Lazio has officially announced the signing of defender Nicolo Casale from Hellas Verona until 2027. The Italian centre-back was one of the record breakout talents last season, proving himself a progressive and adaptable defender who has contributed well in his build-up phase.

His strong and stable play quickly attracted the attention of Lazio, who emerged for him in January before agreeing to return in the summer.

As announced by Lazio, Casale has joined the Italian club on a definitive deal, signing a five-year contract until 2027. He is a much-needed reinforcement for Sarri’s side who already bid goodbye to Luiz Felipe earlier this month.

In the concluding season, Casale made 37 appearances across all competitions for a total of 2613 minutes. During his time at Hellas Verona, he contributed two assists which defined his offensive and defensive play, something which suggests that he will be the perfect fit for Sarri’s system in Rome.

The Biancocelesti wanted the 24-year-old Italian centre-back for months. Casale is a progressive and modern-day defender who is comfortable with the ball at his feet.

As reported by Gianluca Di Marzio, following a five-hour-long meeting between Lazio and Hellas Verona a deal has been agreed based on 7 million euros plus 3 million euros in add-ons.

Casale will have his medical treatment at Lazio this week followed by a signing which will keep him at the club until 2027. He will then immediately head upto Auronzo di Cadore to join Sarri’s pre-season training camp. The 24-year-old needs to learn as much as possible for the upcoming season, which kicks off on the 14th of August.
