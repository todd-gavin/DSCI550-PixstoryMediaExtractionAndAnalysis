Luciano Moggi, a former Juventus president, believes the Bianconeri may finish in the top four this season since they are a results-driven team. Juve has made significant progress in the new year, but the Bianconeri continue to struggle to overpower opponents.

Their most recent match was a 1-0 victory against Spezia, but the Bianconeri should have won by many more goals because they are the larger of the two clubs.

With 20 minutes left on the clock, Alvaro Morata scored for the first time since mid-January at the Allianz Stadium in Turin, keeping Juve on the back foot of champions Inter, who thrashed Salernitana 5-0 on Friday.

As Napoli hosts AC Milan in Sunday's late encounter, Juve might find themselves seven points behind Inter, with both teams a point behind Inter ahead of one of the most important matches of the season thus far.

When asked about his team's intentions for the season, Morata was equally cautious as coach Massimiliano Allegri has reiterated that Juve are not in the title chase.

Winning games will help Juventus reclaim their place in the top four, and it's a good thing they can still win games when they're not playing well. Moggi saw them struggle against Spezia and believes they will return to the Champions League because they win even when they don't play well.
According to Tuttomercatoweb, he stated: 
“The fight to qualify for the Champions League instead sees Juve as the favourites who, despite playing badly, beat Spezia 1-0.”

Under Max Allegri, Juve is scarcely enjoyable to watch, and they may struggle to win certain games that you expect them to win easily.
The Bianconeri, on the other hand, remain experts at achieving the desired result, and this key trait could help them win more trophies.
