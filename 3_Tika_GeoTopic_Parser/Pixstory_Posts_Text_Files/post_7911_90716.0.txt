Will Smith through an Instragram post apologized to Chris Rock, saying that violence in its all forms is poisonous and destructive. He also said that his behaviour was completely unacceptable and he couldn't handle a joke on Jada's medical condition. He also apologized to the Academy and the Williams family.

Chris Rock's joke was definitely insensitive and completely unacceptable but Will's reaction also can't be appreciated and both should be criticised. 
This incident has clearly taken Will's best actor win over by a storm and what will happen next is pretty uncertain.
Many people have been calling for The Academy to take back the award given to Will Smith but I don't think this will be the case, it's definitely going to get sorted in the coming days. 

Here's what Will Smith said in his Instagram post :

"Violence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive. My behavior at last night's Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable. Jokes at my expense are a part of the job, but a joke about Jada's medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally.

I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris. I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness.

I would also like to apologize to the Academy, the producers of the show, all the attendees and everyone watching around the world. I would like to apologize to the Williams Family and my King Richard Family. I deeply regret that my behavior has stained what has been an otherwise gorgeous journey for all of us.

I am a work in progress.

Sincerely,

Will."
