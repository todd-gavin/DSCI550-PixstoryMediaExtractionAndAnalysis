India is endowed with extraordinarily diverse and distinctive traditional waterbodies found in different parts of the country, commonly known as ponds, tanks, lakes, vayalgam, ahars, bawdis, talabs and others.🌊

They play an important role in maintaining and restoring the ecological balance. They act as sources of drinking water, recharge groundwater, control floods, support biodiversity, and provide livelihood opportunities to a large number of people. 🌊

One of the reasons is our increasing negligence and lack of conservation of waterbodies. waterbodies are being polluted by untreated effluents and sewage that are continuously being dumped into them. 🌊

Action needs to be taken towards:

1. Attaining sustainability. Thus, emphasis on long-term goals, operation and maintenance should be included along with the allocation of budget.

2. Success of the lakes should be tested on all three fronts namely economic, environmental and social.

3. Encouraging local people to collaborate with other stakeholders to successfully utilise resources and ensure the protection and conservation of waterbodies.
