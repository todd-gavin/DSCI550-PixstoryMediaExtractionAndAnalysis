What are your plans for this Friday If nothing please be ready to welcome this giant asteroid However it s that guest which won t be entering our homes thankfully After a number of asteroids passed very near Earth earlier this week a new asteroid has appeared on the horizon This asteroid which is as big as a house will be approaching Earth today The asteroid named FH is particularly concerning because compared to all the other asteroids we have seen this week it will be coming closest to the Earth HDTech says that as such there is always a risk that even the slightest deviation from its path will result in the asteroid being trapped by Earth s gravitational pull causing it to strike our planet NASA is monitoring the movements of the asteroid and at the moment it looks that FH will make a safe passage But hey things can change as they did when a very small asteroid that was earlier set to pass close to Earth actually ended up crashing on Earth According to NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory asteroid FH is an meters wide asteroid which is as large as a multi floored house The asteroid will make its closest approach to Earth at a distance of kilometers For reference this is less than one thirds of the distance of the other two asteroids that passed Earth and caused quite a concern as potentially hazardous Despite its smaller size the near Earth object NEO can cause quite a disaster if it ends up hitting the Earth Happy Friday
