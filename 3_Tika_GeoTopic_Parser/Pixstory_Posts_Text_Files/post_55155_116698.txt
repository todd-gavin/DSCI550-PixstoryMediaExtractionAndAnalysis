Did you know that most Australian snakes will rapidly slither away from us It could be much worse Imagine if most of our snakes were like vipers or rattlesnakes which hold their ground and can be easily trodden on And imagine if our venomous snakes could sense our body heat as pit vipers and rattlesnakes do with their heat sensing pits For Australians simply staying still can keep you safe Moreover as per Nat Geo compared to other countries with many snake species Australia has orders of magnitude fewer snakebites and related deaths South Africa has snakebite deaths on average every year By contrast Australia has two or three So how can you say ANY Aussie snake is dangerous
