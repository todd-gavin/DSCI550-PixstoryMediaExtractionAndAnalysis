It seems that sometime in the early s when Kapil Dev was at the peak of his popularity the Delhi based Diamond Comics brought out an illustrated title called Prithvi ke Rakshak that featured Kapil Dev as an action hero It was sponsored by Action shoes and formed a part of Action shoes ad campaign Not sure if more than one or two titles were published So that puts Kapil Dev in the league of Amitabh Bachchan who was featured as an action hero in comic books as well A copy of the Kapil Dev book is available for sale at eBay
