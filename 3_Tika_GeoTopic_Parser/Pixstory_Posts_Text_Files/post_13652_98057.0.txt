I congratulate you, the dear people of Afghanistan, and all the Muslims of the world on the arrival of Eid al-Fitr, and I pray for security and peace in Afghanistan.
The days and nights of the holy month of Ramadan are gone, the days when with pain and hesitation; Thousands of families in Afghanistan were still struggling with the security and economic situation in the country. In recent weeks and the days of the holy month of Ramadan this year, the tragedy of explosions and suicide attacks took the lives of hundreds of people in that land and covered thousands of families with grief and mourning. The explosions that killed children, young people and the elderly in mosques, monasteries and schools.

Moreover, although the days and nights of the holy month of Ramadan this year were as difficult for the people of Afghanistan as in previous weeks and months due to poverty and migration; But in spite of that, the people of this land went to greet each other with a hand full of Eid candies and in the other hand with a handkerchief of mourning, and to go to each other's houses with peace and blessings of these blessed days.
  Inspired by the spirit of life and hope among the people of Afghanistan, I wish that those days are not too far away to talk about peace, security and prosperity in Afghanistan. I congratulate the Muslims of the world and pray for security and peace in Afghanistan. Eid Mubarak!
