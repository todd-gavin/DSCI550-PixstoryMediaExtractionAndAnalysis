A letter written in Punjabi has been widely shared on social media with the claim that US-based ‘Sikhs For Justice’ (SJF) has extended support to AAP ahead of the Punjab elections. SFG, founded by US-based Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, was banned by the Indian government in 2019 as an unlawful association as it supports the secession of Punjab from India and the formation of a separate Khalistan.

The viral letter was tweeted by lawyer Shashank Shekhar Jha. This tweet gained over 1000 retweets.

It was also posted by multiple verified social media users such as BJP’s Haryana IT cell head Arun Yadav, National Media In-charge at BJP’s youth wing BJYM Amandeep Singh, BJP leader Anirban Ganguly, National President Indian Youth Congress Srinivas BV, and author of the book ‘Narendra Modi Censored’ Ashok Shrivastav. It was also tweeted by Twitter handle PollUpdateInd and CapitalTV India chief editor Manish Kumar.

Several Twitter and Facebook users have shared this document. Using CrowdTangle, a social media monitoring tool, we found that at least 20 Facebook users made this claim.

We used Google Lens to translate the viral letter to English. The letter allegedly declares that SJF has extended full support to AAP and their Punjab candidate CM Bhagwant Mann. It says if AAP is elected, SFJ’s goals will be revived. It is worth noting that in the second part, the letter claims the SFJ also supported AAP in 2017, during the previous Punjab assembly polls.

Fact-check
Zee News reporter Shivank Mishra uploaded a video of Pannun stating that SFJ hasn’t issued the viral letter. He even alleged that AAP is behind circulating this letter.

The viral letter was shared on social media on February 17. Punjab-based journalist Taruni Gandhi tweeted SFJ had released only one letter on February 17 that called for a ‘Rail Roko’ protest to honour actor-activist late Deep Sidhu. She also pointed out that there are differences between the viral letter and the genuine ‘Rail Roko’ letter.
