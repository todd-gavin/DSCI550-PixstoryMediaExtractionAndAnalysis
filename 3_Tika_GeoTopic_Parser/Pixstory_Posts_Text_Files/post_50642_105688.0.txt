According to an agreement revealed on Thursday, Nasa rockets will be launched into space from the Northern Territory in June and July. 

The Guardian reported that the prime minister and the NT chief minister will announce that three scientific suborbital sounding rockets will be launched from Equatorial Launch Australia's Arnhem Space Centre between June 26 and July 12. 

The event will be the first time Nasa launches rockets from a commercial facility outside of the United States, according to the two governments, and the first Nasa rockets launched from Australia since 1995, when launches were performed from the Royal Australian Air Force's Woomera range complex.

For the launches, some 75 Nasa personnel will be in Australia. The missions, according to the two countries, will look into heliophysics, astrophysics, and planetary science phenomena that are only visible from the southern hemisphere. 

On the Dhupuma Plateau near Nhulunbuy, on the Gumatj people's territory, the Arnhem Space Centre is located. Traditional owners were consulted during the approval procedure, according to the two governments.
