Is probably a question that you should be asking today, at least, if not usually. 50 years since the first conference in Sweden, it is a monumental day for, err, the diplomats- I think, they formed a UN committee and stuff ?  we haven’t actually achieved much and we usually don’t realistically adhere to any of the agreements that are drafted during this time so …* awkward pause*

Nevertheless, it serves as a reminder to dwell on how we are constantly harming the environment such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, increase in carbon emissions and non-biodegradable waste which has only become worse in recent years.

So, for right now, please ignore the atrocities that all Swedish guests have to face whilst tip-toeing around the house only to procure what is only a basic necessity- food but instead focus on the long term effects of not procuring said food. Starvation, illnesses, death- which, co-incidentally, is exactly what will happen if YOU don’t save the environment. So has this been a deliberate scheme all along for Swedish people to make the rest of the world realise the devastating, terminal effects of climate change, for the world to gain a slow yet impactful understanding of this phenomenon? Probably not. But, it does bring across my point- save the environment to save yourself from the fate of not being able to eat? I hope so otherwise this will turn out to be a quite useless endeavour. Lastly, to get my message across to Indian aunties, save the environment to save yourself from the fate of not making your guests stuff mouthfuls of food in their mouth while they were already chewing. 

Back to the question at hand, and how exactly to do so- please refer to my previous( and first) post for steps to increase sustainability in your daily life ! :)

This is all for right now. Leave notes to feed my validation please !! <3////
