Served hot with butter or syrup, a waffle is a small, crisp batter cake that is made in a waffle iron.
Classic flavours like honey and maple syrup, European flavours like fruit compotes, cream cheese, and peanut butter, and timeless flavours like chocolate and Nutella are also available. We also receive a popular dark chocolate batter and frozen ice cream waffles. 
It is challenging to rival Nutella. The Naked Nutella has been the top seller since it first appeared. The Belgian Milk Chocolate and the Chocolate Overload, made with our dark chocolate batter, are two more well-known favourites. Additionally very well-liked are the ice cream waffles.
