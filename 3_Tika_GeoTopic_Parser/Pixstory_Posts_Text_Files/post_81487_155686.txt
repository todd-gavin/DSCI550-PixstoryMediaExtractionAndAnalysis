Granit Xhaka admits that being named Player of the Month for September is extra special after his fine form this campaign The Swiss midfielder was a runaway winner claiming of our supporters votes and following his public falling out with them three years ago he is delighted that his displays have helped repair that bond and made him a fan favourite again During a wide ranging interview he said For me it s always special to get something like this It s my second time I think I got it in April last season the first time after nearly seven years but if I m honest I don t wait for this moment because in the end we are winning together and losing together But to get it makes you happy because it means people can see the work that I do It s extra special because everyone knows what happened three years ago so you can see the performances from us when we get the support That support has also led to the year old gaining his own chant and Granit revealed that has given him even more motivation resulting in even better performances from our no My wife asked me if I heard the song during the game and of course I heard it he added I told her it gave me a lot of motivation because I ve been here seven years and got a lot of love in the beginning Then I had a small break I call it a small break because it was like a cut But I am pleased for that having a song because I feel the love and I always wanted to be good with them To be in this place where we are in the moment I have to say thank you and I m trying to give my best like I always did
