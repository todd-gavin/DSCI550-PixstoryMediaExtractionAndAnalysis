What a game of cricket this one was just brilliant It was end to end stuff Punjab Kings were batting first Mayank Agarwal fell for runs Dhawan managed to score runs It was Liam Livingstone s runs that gave their innings a stong back bone he hit fours and sixes Sharma Chahar and Shahrukh chipped in to take the total to Only Rashid Khan of Gujrat Titans bowled well he took wickets giving away only runs Wade fell too early but it was Shubman Gill s night he played a magnificent knock of from balls he hit boundaries and six He played the cut and pull shots superbly as always he slowed down towards the end and fell to a slower by Rabada Sudarshan also played a handy knock Even Pandya chipped in a few runs A collapse during the end of the innings saw the game almost go away from Gujarat runs were required from the last balls and Rahul Tewatia did it again he hit two sixes and gave GT the win This was IPL at its best
