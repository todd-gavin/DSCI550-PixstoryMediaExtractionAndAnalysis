I do not like them in a box
I do not like them with a fox
I do not like them in a house
I do not like them with a mouse
I do not like them here or there
I do not like them anywhere
I do not like green eggs and ham
I do not like them Sam I am

Dr. Seuss 

As happymag points out, Dr. Seuss was the author who introduced many children to excellent imagery and poetry. He needed to be on this list for that, even if it just meant quoting a page from one of his best works. Seuss's way of infusing whimsy and absurdity into rhyme and metre resulted in several memorable children's books that sold well and lasted a long time.
