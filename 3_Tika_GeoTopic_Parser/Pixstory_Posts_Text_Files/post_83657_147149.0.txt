Here's a simple sign that you're an introvert.
And it comes from Russian author Leo Tolstoy.
It's a line from Anna Karenina in which he says, "Friends are nice, but being at home is better."
And if that describes you, you are an introvert. It's not that you lack friends. It's not that you don't enjoy spending time with your friends. It's not that you can't be extroverted for brief periods of time. However you have to go home and recharge. As much as you enjoy being with others, being animated by others, and sharing moments that will become memories.And you know in your heart that you really want to be at home. You want to crawl under the covers and watch a movie or listen to music that made you happy when you were alone.
It's not that you don't have friends; it's just that you don't need them. So, Tolstoy writes, friends are good, but being alone at home is better.
