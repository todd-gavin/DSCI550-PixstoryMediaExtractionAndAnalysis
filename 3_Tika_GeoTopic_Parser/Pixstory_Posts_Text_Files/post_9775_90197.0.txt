In the wee hours if Sunday, I set out fir a much awaited visit to Haiderpur.

A verdant wetland that appears once the water from the Bijnor Barrage over the Ganga is released for irrigation.

The sprawling reservoir makes way for grasslands, riverine islands which become a home for migratory birds, cattle, horses, swamp deers and a gang of simians.

Explore the several trails that introduces one to a whole new world.

A Sunday well spent listening to the calls of kingfishers, watching the majestic flight of  Painted Storks, Purple Moorhen, Black Headed Ibis and paddling of a variety of ducks.

The leisurely stroll of a flock of Sarus Cranes was a delight to watch.

Must visit during spring time and early winters.

Birder Ashish Gujjar was a treasure trove of information and knew the wetland in detail.
