It’s nice to have the Dallas Mavericks in the postseason for an extended period of time. They have a good crowd and one of the best young players in the league. But regardless of whether it’s Dirk Nowitzki, Michael Finley, or Luka Dončić leading the team on the floor, since the turn of the millennium the constant guiding force for the Mavericks on the sidelines is Mark Cuban.

He’s not cut from the Jerry Reindsorf and Mickey Arison cloth of team owners. Cuban ushered in a new group that was more visible and not afraid to show you their enthusiasm for their team on the sidelines or when talking about them.

Cuban has been more well-known in recent years for Shark Tank than for his Mavericks being a perennial NBA contender, but that all changed this season. This team had expectations after consecutive first-round losses to the Los Angeles Clippers. The season started rough, but they would end up winning more than 50 games for the first time since 2015, and are in the Western Conference Finals after not advancing past the first round of the playoffs since 2011, when they won the NBA Championship.

Not only are the Mavericks players and coaches in postseason form, but so is Cuban. His team has been fined, and unlike in 2005, he can hop on social media and go straight to the people with his displeasure. He did so after the team was fined for its bench decorum for the third time this postseason. He tweeted out a video of Brooklyn Nets — from three years ago — with only one word, “pedigree.” Then he sent out a video of Draymond Green throwing a temper tantrum and sarcastically wrote, “our bench is out of control.”

For everything I don’t like about Cuban, I do enjoy his me-against-the-league attitude. Him yelling at referees and taking digs at David Stern was sometimes more entertaining than watching his perennial playoff contender play basketball games. I’m not about to go as far as saying this particular billionaire was somehow taking the elites to task.
