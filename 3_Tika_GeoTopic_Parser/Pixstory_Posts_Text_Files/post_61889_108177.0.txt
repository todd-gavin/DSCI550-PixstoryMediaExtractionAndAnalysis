Who the fu*k is gonna stop us? 

Louis Tomlinson World Tour 2022 is the talk of the town this year. From upgrading to bigger venues due to overwhelming demands to starting his own festival, British singer-songwriter Louis Tomlinson is feeling ecstatic and emotional to see all his fans are here for him and not just appreciating him as a part of the biggest boyband in the History, One Direction. 

Lou had to postpone his tour due to Covid restrictions. But to give the fans a taste of what the tour would be like and raising funds for his bands, he hosted a live stream, which was viewed by over 350000 people. 

He also hosted a free festival for his fans titled "Away from Home Festival". He live streamed the festival as well. He has given chances to underrated artists, hosted free festivals and treats his fans as his best friends. There has never been an artist that has had such a grounded relationship with their fans. 

Louis Tomlinson has now started to accept that all of this success, the people screaming his name, the people waiting for him outside hotels is just for him, and not for him as part of a band.
