The 1960s Civil Rights Movement, the 1980s Black Feminist Movement, Pan-African Movement, and Political Hip-Hop Movement, and the 2000s LGTBQ+ Movement all influenced the Black Lives Matter Movement. 

BLM continues the efforts of 19th century organisations such as the American League of Colored Laborers, the Florence Farming and Lumber Association, and the New York State Suffrage Association by seeking to abolish institutionalised racism. 

As per the nation, Black Lives Matter, like the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), employed communal planning to challenge the heteronormative, patriarchal heirarchy that dominates most Black rights organisations. By putting people from underrepresented backgrounds in central roles, the Black Live Matter group modelled itself after Chicago's Black Youth Project 100.

With Black women, trans, and queer members in leadership roles, Garza described how BLM differentiated itself from traditional perceptions of Black activism: “It goes beyond the narrow nationalism that can be prevalent within some Black communities, which merely call on Black people to love Black, live Black and buy Black, keeping straight cis[gendered] Black men in the front of the movement while our sisters, queer and trans and disabled folk take up roles in the background or not at all.” 

This revolution is taking over the world, adapting itself according to it and not stopping anytime soon.
