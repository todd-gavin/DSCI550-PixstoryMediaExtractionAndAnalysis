Thanksgiving Day is the day when a woman from Kunar, who now wears a chador (burqa) and a military uniform, goes to operations against ISIL and Taliban shelters in the Special Forces, no longer in peace without fear of losing her chador.

The woman should have a kindergarten soldier to leave her children and go in military uniform with peace of mind and courage.

Women are valued when a Pamiri child does not fall asleep with opium and the mother does not travel miles on a donkey to feed her belly. Thanksgiving Day is a day when the government delivers social security to women in its best form.
