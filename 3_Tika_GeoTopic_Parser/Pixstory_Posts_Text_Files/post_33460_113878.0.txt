The main collection of the statues on site at Kurkihar is to be found at a distance from the main mound site and presently housed in the Devi temple. The same had also been described by Cunningham in his accounts as follows :-


             “At the north-east corner of the village there is a small rude Hindu temple of brick, in and about which a large number of statues have been collected. The temple is dedicated to Bagheswari Devi (Vyaghreshwari), but the principal figure inside is a life-size statue of the eight-armed Durga conquering the Maheshasur or Buffalo demon. The figure pointed out to me as that of Bagheshwari was a four armed female seated on a lion with a child in her lap; but I believe that this figure represents either Indrani with her son the infant Jayanta, or Shasti, the goddess of fecundity, a form of Durga. The principal figure outside the temple is a life-size statue of Akshobya, who is represented squatted under the Bodhi tree, in the same manner as the ascetic Buddha, with the left hand in the lap, and the right hand hanging over the knee. There is a halo round the head inscribed with the usual Buddhist formula, “Ye Dharmma,” & c.; and near the head is a short inscription giving the name of the figure “ Tan Akshobya-vajra, hun”.
