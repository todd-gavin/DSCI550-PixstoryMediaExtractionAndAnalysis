Madeleine Albright, who made history as the first woman to be secretary of state, is no more. She passed away at the age of 84.

A family statement read: “We are heartbroken to announce that Dr Madeleine Albright, the 64th US secretary of state passed away earlier today, the cause was cancer. She was surrounded by family and friends. We have lost a loving mother, grandmother, sister, aunt and friend.” ( The Guardian)

Joe Biden saluted Albright as “a force for goodness, grace, and decency – and for freedom”. Hers were the hands that turned the tide of history,” the president said. (The Guardian)

She was born as Marie Jana Korbelová in Prague in 1937 but known as Madeleine since infancy, Albright fled with her family for London in 1939 after the Nazis took Czechoslovakia and later came to the US in 1948.

Decades later she discovered her parents were Jewish and that several members of her family were murdered in the Holocaust.

After the election of Clinton in 1992, Albright was first ambassador to the United Nations, then secretary of state. The dominant foreign policy themes of the time were the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, including the wars in the former Yugoslavia, the quest for peace between Israel and the Palestinians and the rise of fundamentalist Islam in the years before 9/11.

Albright became secretary of state in 1997, then the highest-ranking woman in the history of US government. It made her fourth in line to the presidency, though like her predecessors Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski she would not have been able to fill the role, not being a natural born US citizen as defined in the constitution.
