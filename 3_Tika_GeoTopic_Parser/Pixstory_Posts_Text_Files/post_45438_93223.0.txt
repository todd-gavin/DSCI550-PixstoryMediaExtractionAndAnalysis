Due to the discriminatory behaviour of supporters during the first leg of their Champions League
quarter-final tie against Manchester City last week, UEFA has ordered Atletico Madrid toplay
with a lower fan turnout.

During Atleti's 1-0 loss to Manchester City, fans were seen on camera appearing to give Nazi
salutes.

The Wanda Metropolitano will be partially shuttered on Wednesday for the City's visit. A section
of the stadium with at least 5,000 seats must be closed, and the hosts must display a banner
with the inscription "NoToRacism" alongside the UEFA logo.

"The UEFA Appeals Body has announced the following decision, which will effect the
attendance of supporters at UEFA matches," reads a UEFA statement.

"To order the partial closure of the Club Atletico de Madrid stadium during the next (one) UEFA
competition match in which Club Atletico de Madrid would play as the host club, for the
discriminatory behaviour of its supporters.

"Club Atletico de Madrid shall inform prior to the match, the sector(s) to be closed, which shall
comprehend 5,000 seats.

"To order Club Atletico de Madrid to implement the following directive in the next UEFA
competition match which the club shall play as the host club: to display a banner with the
wording '#NoToRacism' - with the UEFA logo on it."

Greater Manchester Police had already charged a man with suspected racial insults during
Atletico's last-16 match against Manchester United last month.

Kevin De Bruyne's 70th minute strike proved the difference at the Etihad Stadium last Tuesday,
Manchester City will take a slender 1-0 lead into Wednesday's second-leg showdown at the
Wanda Metropolitano.
