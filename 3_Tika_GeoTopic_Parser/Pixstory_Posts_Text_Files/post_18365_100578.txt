Giorgio Chiellini will greet the Juventus Stadium on Monday evening against Lazio as a player for the last time A year ago he decided together with the club that the time has come to say goodbye at least as a player before embracing him again as a manager perhaps after an experience abroad before ending his career After matches played in years since and many, many trophies won including consecutive championships will leave with a match that for Juve is not worth much in terms of points in the standings but which is very important for Lazio still in the Europa League race Chietini greeted his fans on the members he thanked everyone even the opponents who allowed his dream to come true These are his words The day has come This evening a whirlwind of emotions will pass through me Juve was everything for me My youth experience maturity The will to win the joy of triumph the acceptance of defeat the thrill of the challenge the duel on the pitch my head always bandaged and then the champions on and off the green lawn the coaches the managers all the people on the staff men who have passed by always leaving me something something i have I took care to collect preserve and cherish So I find myself in front of the most beautiful of sunsets trying to imagine a new dawn Because the journey doesn&#39;t end I still don&#39;t know what awaits me next But it will be another time and another story This is the time to say goodbye and an infinite and profound gratitude Thanks Thanks to all the fans and opponents Thanks for welcoming me supported supported Thanks for giving meaning to the meaning of the word dream Thanks until the end thanks
