The Memories were to remain forever in our hearts. After having some breakfast and tea at Adhaura we travelled to the Ancient Site of Mundeshwari Temple and thanked the Almighty for helping us in the most difficult circumstances. The surprise was retained on account of the timing and the slight drizzle as we had reached Soli. The encounter though very dangerous and sudden had served as a morale booster for the forces who had reversed the recent history of the encounters in the district when the Maoists had been on the offensive while the forces caught by surprise suffered losses. In the month of the preceding July, 2007, the Police Stations of Rajpur and Baghela in the plains of Rohtas had been attacked by the Maoists, resulting in severe damage to the buildings and in heavy casualties. 2 CRPF personnel had also been killed in a landmine blast near Dhansa in the first week of the preceding June during the ascent uphill. The Rohtas Police had lost the DSP of Bikramganj in April, 2006 in an encounter with the Maoists in the plains of Rohtas.  The Story in Rohtas so far had been one tilted heavily in favour of the Maoists who were using the terrain to their advantage. The Maoists had been using the Hills as a stronghold to launch attacks on the police in the plains. But this encounter had a different flavor. It was on the Hills and with the reverse results.
