There are different ways of choosing CBT; it could be that you want to try it, or it could be a recommendation of any doctor; the other reason could be that a friend or family member suggested it.
The reason could be any, but you should know how to get started for choosing CBT.

The first step is to find a therapist. You can get a referral from a doctor, health insurance plan, friend or other trusted source. In addition, many employers offer counselling services or referrals through employee assistance programs (EAPs). Or you can find a therapist on your own â€” for instance, through a local or state psychological association or by searching the internet.

After finding a therapist, you also need to understand the costs. If you have health insurance, find out what coverage it offers for psychotherapy. For example, some health plans cover only a certain number of therapy sessions a year. Also, talk to your therapist about fees and payment options.

And the last would be to review your concerns. Before your first appointment, consider what issues you'd like to work on. While you can also sort this out with your therapist, having some sense in advance may provide a starting point.
