Anthony Martial of Manchester United has described his decision to stay at Sevilla as 'very
complicated,' all but guaranteeing that he will not extend his loan. Martial joined Sevilla on loan
during the January transfer window after falling out of favour at Manchester United. The loan will
go until the end of the season, with no option to buy.

To make the move possible, the Frenchman consented to a wage cut, eager to play more
regular football after starting only two Premier League games in the first half of the season.
Martial has yet to score in La Liga, with his solitary goal for Sevilla coming against Dinamo
Zagreb in the Europa League back in February.

 Since arriving in Spain, he has been a regular
starter, however an injury has forced him to miss a few games.

“I came to be able to enjoy football again after a long time without playing. I know I can be at a
higher level, and I work for it, but first the injury, then the adaptation to a new club and a new
city, is being difficult for me because of the language barrier,” the player told ABC.

The loan agreement with United does not include a purchase option, which has always made a
return to Manchester at the end of the season a certainty, even if negotiations with a different
club begin later - Fabrizio Romano recently stated that Sevilla do not intend to make an offer.

“I see it very complicated to be able to continue at Sevilla. I’m not worried about that right now.

 I
came knowing that it would be six months and then I would surely have to return to Manchester
United,” Martial added.

When Martial returns to United in the summer, he will be assigned to a new boss. Erik ten Hag
appears to be on the verge of being announced as the next manager, which might give Martial a
fresh start at the club, especially with Edinson Cavani departing.
