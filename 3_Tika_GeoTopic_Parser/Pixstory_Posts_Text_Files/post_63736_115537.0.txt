Gaming developer Playwing’s latest, ‘Century: Age of Ashes’ is headed off to the world of consoles soon. A free to play dragon based multiplayer, the player rides a dragon into battle, fighting other riders in the skies with a repertoire of attacks. Four classes all bring their own abilities to the battlefield, and there are four modes of play, which includes a spin on Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and Last Man Standing. The last mode is Spoils of War, in which you must gather gold from around the map while protecting your team's hoard.

Already available on PC, Xbox Series X and Series S, the game has been flying under the radar for a while and will be made available on Xbox One on July 12, and on PS4 and PS5 by July 19. Relatively new, the feedback for the game however has been mostly positive, with the game’s new take on aerial combat and dragon-based conceptual design being particular highlights.

For those who play the game on PC, it’s also been revealed that a new content update will be heading to Century: Age of Ashes. This is available now to PC players and takes the form of Season 1: Shadow Over Skeld, which will introduce a number of new features. These include the new Stormraiser character class, a new map known as The Valkürian Sanctuary and a brand new leveling system known as the Dragon Pass. This will contain over 70 different rewards. Alongside a new ranked season and additional story content, it looks like there’s plenty to come from this uniquely designed arena battler.
