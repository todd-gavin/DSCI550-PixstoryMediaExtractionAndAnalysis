Houses and rooms are full of perfumes the shelves are crowded with perfumes I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it The distillation would intoxicate me also but I shall not let it The atmosphere is not a perfume it has no taste of the distillation it is odorless It is for my mouth forever I am in love with it I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked I am mad for it to be in contact with me The smoke of my own breath Echoes ripples buzz d whispers love root silk thread crotch and vine My respiration and inspiration the beating of my heart the passing of blood and air through my lungs The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves and of the shore and dark color d sea rocks and of hay in the barn To be continued Walt Whitman
