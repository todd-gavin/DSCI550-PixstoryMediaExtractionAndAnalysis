Head coach Frank Vogel has been under a significant amount of pressure in with the Los Angeles Lakers failing to live up to the expectations with which they entered the season The Lakers seemed to have stocked up on talent roster depth and star power in the offseason boasting a team whose players combined for the most All Star appearances in NBA history with Also Russell Westbrook teamed up with LeBron James and Anthony Davis to create the league s newest Big But with under games left in the regular season the Lakers hang on by a thread to the last Play In Tournament spot after months marred by injuries embarrassing losses and a lack of effort Poor results appeared to have put Vogel s future to question earlier in but the head coach weathered the storm and kept his job Still he admits this has been the most difficult season of his career Yeah I would say probably Vogel says Just because of the expectations that we ve had We ve had too many really difficult nights and I think there s an element of being a part of managing LeBron s legacy for these final years of his career I want to just give him the best opportunity to have team success throughout that So we haven t won at the level that we wanted to It s been challenging and the losses have been heavier but we ve been able to continue to mend and rebuild our team s psyche and keep a belief in what we can be Vogel adds he is his own biggest critic closely evaluating his work after each game and if they end up in a loss grading himself even harder How many minutes each guy played did I overplay guys did I underplay guys did we have the right schemes in place did we adjust well enough when things were hurting us what offensive sets we were getting in and what kind of actions what kind of poor defenders are we involving in the offensive attack he says
