One of the most played games in India is Battlegrounds Mobile. After Player Unknowns Battlegrounds Mobile, or PUBG Mobile, was banned, Krafton released it, specifically for Indian players.

All of prior events were broadcast live online, but this will be the first time a BGMI competition is broadcast live on television. In this post, we'll talk about how the BGMI television appearance will fundamentally alter the Indian Esports sector.
