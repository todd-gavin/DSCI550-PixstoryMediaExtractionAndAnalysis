Substitute Amezaga Martínez late winner for defending champions against Colombia
Colombia looked like taking away a crucial point with a draw using tactics, but an 85th minute goal made the difference. 
Defending champions Spain started their 2022 Women's U17 World cup campaign with a 1-0 win over South American side Colombia. Colombia played with respect and patience against the European side at Navi Mumbai DY Patil stadium in their first Group C match. China and Mexico are the other teams in the group. Spain will face Mexico on 15th October in their second group match. 
Earlier, Colombia tried to keep tight in their half by staying compact. They didn't give much space for Spain. Colombian defenders and goalkeeper denied Spain an easy win. María Camila Correa made a goal line clearance early in the first half. Spanish striker Camacho's left footed shot was clearly going past goalkeeper. 
Colombia used Linda Caicedo for their attacks and to hold ball on transitions. They tried to break and counter attack on occasions. Striker Munoz Rojas' volley was acrobatically punched away by the Spanish keeper to deny Colombia a surprise lead in the first half. Caicedo failed to hit the target around the halftime mark too. 
Vital goal came soon after the substitution. Long ball from back at the right wing was touched ahead by the other substitute player Alguacil Amores. Amezaga Martínez reached and claimed the ball ahead of Colombian centre back Perlaza, who has been magnificent throughout the match. Amezaga turned with a cut and took the shot with her left foot with composure. 
In the other matches, Japan beat debutants Tanzania 4-0, China beat Mexico 2-1 and France settled for a 1-1 draw with Canada. There won't be any matches on 13th October. Group stage matches will resume on the 14th.
