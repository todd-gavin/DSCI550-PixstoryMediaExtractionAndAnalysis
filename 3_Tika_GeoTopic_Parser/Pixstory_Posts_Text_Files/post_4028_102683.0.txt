For the last few months, the athletes and coaches at the Delhi government run Thyagraj Stadium have been complaining on being forced to finish up with their training sessions than the usual timings that's by 7 pm. According to them the reasons is because Delhi Principal Secretary (Revenue) Sanjeev Khirwar takes his dog one a walk at the facility, past half an hour. 

“We used to train till 8-8.30 pm under lights earlier. But now, we are asked to leave the ground by 7 pm so that the officer can walk his dog on the ground. Our training and practice routine has been disrupted,” said a coach. 

When The Indian Express contacted, Khirwar, a 1994 batch IAS officer, denied the allegations and stated that they we "absolutely incorrect". He did accept that he used the facility to take his dog for a walk but denied that he disrupted the practices of the athletes. 

On Tuesday, Khirwar reached at the stadium with his dog after 7:30 pm. And the pet could be seen roaming around the tracks and football field, as the security guards keep watch as per The Indian Express. 

A trainee athlete's parent explained their situation as "unacceptable". “My child’s practice is getting disrupted. Even if they say they use the facilities late at night, can you justify using a state-owned stadium to walk your dog? This is gross misuse of power,” said the parent. 

The coaches and athletes expressed the difficulties they face when they have to wrap up their sessions soon. They have to start their training sessions earlier in the heat since it has to be winded up soon. “Earlier, we continued training till 8.30 pm and sometimes even 9 pm but now we have no option. Earlier, I took water breaks once every half-hour. Now I need a drink every five minutes,” said a junior athlete.
