Mohamed Salah has been an integral part of the Liverpool setup under Jurgen Klopp. Hence, there is a sense of worry among the fans as the Egyptian winger is yet to sign a new deal with the club. 

The Liverpool manager recently talked about Mohamed Salah's contract situation. He said that he was not worried about it but agreed that there is yet to be a decision made about a new contract. 

Jurgen Klopp said, "I think Salah expects Liverpool to be ambitious and we are! It's his decision. All is fine from my point of view. Nothing has happened further, no signing, no rejection, we just have to wait. Completely fine, no rush."

Mohamed Salah joined Liverpool before the 2017/18 season. Since then the Egyptian has scored 152 goals in 237 appearances for the Reds. The winger has also helped the club win the UEFA Champions League and the Premier League among other trophies. 

The Egyptian winger is at the peak of his powers at the age of 29. Salah has scored 19 goals and has provided 10 assists in the Premier League this season. He has also scored 8 goals in the Champions League and 3 goals in the FA Cup so far. 

With less than 18 months left in his contract, there is an air of uncertainty around the club. Fans are worried that they could lose Mohamed Salah just like what happened with Georginio Wijnaldum last summer. 




What has the Egyptian demanded from the Reds? 

Mohamed Salah reportedly wants to stay at the club. But the Egyptian has demanded a bumper contract from Liverpool as per reports. The winger reportedly wants a contract of around £420,000-a-week if the club wants him to stay. 

This would make him the highest-earning player in the Premier League and would also make him the highest earner in Liverpool's history. Hence, it has to be seen what the club management decides about Mohamed Salah's contract as the season progresses.
