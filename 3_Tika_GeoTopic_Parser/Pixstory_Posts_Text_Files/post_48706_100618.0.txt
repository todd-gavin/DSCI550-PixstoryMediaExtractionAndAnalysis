Overtourism has been a great deal of distress for indigenous Hawaiians. The natives of the island have constantly been put through many problems because of people from other lands coming and commodifying their land. It is about time we listen to them and stop saturating their resources.

The monetization of real cultural values and traditions, as well as their misappropriation for the tourism sector, hurt indigenous populations. Native Hawaiians are fighting to preserve their culture as the business destroys sacred burial grounds and other key landmarks. The severe economic situation has also resulted in a disruption and exodus of Hawaiians looking for more inexpensive housing elsewhere. Tourism is also a significant contributor to the high crime rate, which puts inhabitants in danger. This could be attributed to a transient increase in the number of people living in small regions, as well as the frequent admission of strangers into local communities, resulting in an increase in property and person crimes.

Foreigners come to the island and leave their waste behind, use up the resources and end up hiking the prices for the natives. The land that's supposed to be for the indigenous people is used to build resorts and golf courses. They disrupt the sea life and cultural practices. As an obvious result, Hawaiians stay at the receiving end of all the consequences.

When natives of a land tell you to stay out of it, you have no option but to obey. It's not your land, it's theirs.
