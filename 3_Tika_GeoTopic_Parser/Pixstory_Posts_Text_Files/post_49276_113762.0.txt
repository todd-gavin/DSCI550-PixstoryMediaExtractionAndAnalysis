It's something that I don't appreciate either in books or movies. Like, in the end I know it's fiction so I get it but I guess, for most of us, it's a lived reality and seeing it in something we use for escapism from that reality is really distasteful for me.

Especially, misogynist themes in romance books, considering it's one of my favorite genre. I like to draw the line between 'hot' and toxic. I absolutely hate the objectification done of the female main character by the main character in which he refers to her with words that are dehumanizing. Like "I don't like people seeing WHAT'S mine." I see that the character is being built on as someone who's possessive and that's cool with those who enjoy it, but personally for me, I feel uncomfortable. Especially when the woman is shown to be naive. I can still get behind two toxic characters just being, but when they continuosly focus on the girl being 'sweet', 'cute', 'naive', such language just happens to turn me off.

I'm guilty of enjoying such books early on, and I also tend to read them now sometimes but I do think it's a much better read when such traits in the main characters are developed through intricate and thoughtful writing than just going the easy route of reusing already existing problematic themes. It's always amazing to read a character that's truly and uniquely complex and not just a knock off copy of the hundreds written before him.

Another thing, like you said, the "not like other girls". GOD it irritates me so much. I like it when authors put time and thought in writing a character that's truly unique and not just make her "not like other girls"
