Inter striker Andrea Pinamonti in the last few hours seemed to be one step away from Salernitana who had already reached an agreement with the Nerazzurri club At the last minute due to the negotiation it seems to have been interrupted as La Gazzetta dello Sport says by the will of the player who would prefer other goals to Salernitana The first contender of all is Atalanta, a goal much appreciated by the player as well The Bergamo-based club so far hasn&#39;t shown itself to be very convinced and is far from the offer of millions of euros that Salernitana had made Monza and Sassuolo are also on Pinamonti
