The Snow Lion and the Dragon:
Tibet-China Relations
continues...

In India, a disorganized Brahmin class, often guided by their own financial interests or those of other non-Brahminical and non-Kshatriya classes, has not been able to understand the significance and relevance to society of having a good Kshatriya class, which they have been attempting to suppress since 1947. The recent (2008) Sixth Pay Commission salary decisions are a clear example.

 For the Tibetan ruling classes, through the ‘Brahmin’ priesthood, it offered the advantage of passing the responsibility of physical protection over to the Kshatriya Patron, a Mongol Khan with his all powerful army, in exchange for spiritual teachings and blessings. It also provided them the safety of not having the same Khan and his army ravaging their country. And it was cheap: no army to maintain, only some ritual tribute to be paid.

The Choe-Yon relationship thus helped Tibet to protect itself from powerful and aggressive neighbours, as in the case of the Mongols.

The relationship also allowed Tibet to maintain its own system of religious administration without being either directly occupied by or dictated to by the Manchus who were later ruling China, and who had also become followers of Tibetan Buddhism. Its basic essence was its two constituent elements. Choe-Yon is a contraction of two words, Choe-ne, meaning the object of religious devotion to whom offering is to be made, and Yondak, meaning the giver of the offering to the religious person or object. 
In this case the first constituent element was the Priest-Lama as the Choene, the object of worship and offerings, and the Khan or Emperor as the Yondak, the Patron who worshipped and gave alms. The second constituent element is protection, which the patron is bound to provide by his religious duty, to protect his Spiritual Teacher from the enemies of the Dharma.
