French gastronomy is famous worldwide for its fine cuisine, with fancy preparations, and dishes such as foie gras, scallops, and frogsâ€™ legs. However, there is much more than high-end gastronomy to discover!

What makes French food specific is the range of great local and regional specialties that vary widely from north to south, from west to east. And then, of course, you have all the cheese and charcuterie, which each deserve a list of their own.
