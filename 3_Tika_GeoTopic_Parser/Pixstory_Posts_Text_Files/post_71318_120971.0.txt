It was the last evening of the most perfect summer vacations I had, I was comfortably lounging in my bed, watching cartoons when Mum asked me clean up my room. I murmured, "Soon, I'll be sixteen and I'll not take commands from anyone!", being the typical teen, and got up to clear the mess I had made. I still had the toys I used to play with when I was five, the scribble books and maybe perhaps all those things that made up my childhood. And suddenly I came across my photo album, all the clicks taking me back to down the lane even before I was born. I saw Mumma, how beautiful she looked in her marriage photos and how lively she used to be when she was young. I looked into a few more pictures and cleaned up my entire room. Then I went to sit with Mumma, maybe after a real long time. I didn't say or ask anything, just observed her face and saw how that "young girl" charm has disappeared. "She was really fond of sports but left when I was born, so that I could have her undivided attention. I had asked her once that why she never went back to playing any sport again and she smiled, "You're the biggest trophy I've. What prize could possibly match this grace, even if I win every game!" You see, that's it. That's how selflessly she gave up on the very thing that made her the happiest even without thinking twice for another living being who might not do the same, if asked." While I was thinking all this, I realised I had been staring at her too long, I got up and went back to my room. I used to think how foolish it was of her to revolve her entire life around my and interfere with everything I do, but that evening all those toys, photos, kept safely preserved made me realise, it's her happiness she prioritized, that she found in me. And maybe life always isn't about materialistic joys, sometimes, its the smile, love and proximity of our loved ones.
