Chelsea has a history of producing great defenders, and even before Abramovich took over, Chelsea oversaw many of the best defenders in their annals and rarely had trouble bringing in any CB, thanks to their youth academy.
The west Londoners have had them all, from full-backs to center-backs, and some of them have grouted their reputation at the club in the past. In the following article, we will look at them in greater detail.
10 Andreas Christensen
Andreas Christensen was promoted to the senior team from the youth academy and has since had a successful career at Chelsea. He debuted in 2014 and has since become an integral feature of the Blues. His performance earned him the title of Premier League's youngest player.
Under different managers, the player maintained his excellent form and was deployed as a defensive tackle. He played regularly under Tuchel and helped the club win the ChampionsLeague in 2021. He left for Barcelona after making 161 appearances.
9 Kurt Zouma
One of the club's shy players was expected to make a promising start to his Chelsea career, but a cruciate ligament injury curtailed his career, and the player was loaned out to Stoke and Everton before returning to Stamford Bridge. He was a fantastic player in Chelsea at the time and made a tackle worthy of a Ballon d'Or.
Zouma has been a consistent player since then, making 151 appearances before joining Wests Ham United.
