The large urban aggregations are in growing climatic suffering The average temperature in the Po Valley has already risen by almost two degrees compared to the pre-industrial era and to this figure are added the localized effects of urban heat islands and the impermeability of surfaces which accentuate the dimension of the climatic challenge and the scope required for adaptation and risk prevention efforts associated with extreme climatic events that impact on the safety and livability of cities and therefore also on their attractiveness previously waterproofed and forestation and connection of peri-urban spaces restoring urban surfaces to water infiltration and spaces for vegetation certainly a valuable investment in Nature Based infrastructures which hopefully must radiate to other areas of the metropolitan territory Among the still too undervalued resources of the metropolitan territory there are those associated with the water element largely hidden in the past decades The flowing water and the infrastructure formed by the hydrographic network have been taken away from the public space and from the design of the city because it is no longer considered suitable for generating public utility A choice that today needs to be reviewed light of the potential that a blue infrastructure can generate in favor of urban well-being But to do this, we need the courage to renegotiate the spaces of the public city and the connections between the city and the non-urbanized territory underlines Damiano Di Simine, scientific coordinator of Legambiente Lombardia
