Crystal Palace underwent a fairly good season last year under new manager Patrick Viera as they finished in 12
th place. Questions and concerns were raised after Roy Hodgson’s departure and many experienced players leaving after their contracts expired but Viera did well with the players at his disposal last season. They have made a slow start to this season
so far as they currently sit in 16th and have only 6 points on the board. We will look at
Palace’s squad in-depth in this article.
Strengths
One big strength Palace have in their squad which is clear to see is talented attacking players Wilfried Zaha is the club’s most talented player and their talisman and this has continued this season. Jordan Ayew and Eze are also talented players and the biggest strength of this team is their attack. Zaha has scored four goals in five appearances thisseason and Palace will hope his good form continues as they rely heavily on his performances. Viera has implemented a modern brand of football at Palace and this is good to see as the football is exciting and their talented attackers benefit from this brand the most.
Weaknesses
The biggest weakness of this Palace side is their defence. After some of the experienced players left a couple of seasons ago this has had a negative impact on the defence. Their defence has conceded nine goals so far this season in six games and their goal difference is
minus two. This is unacceptable and this is a clear area which needs major improvement. One way this could be improved is by investing into the defence in the January transfer window and this is maybe something the owners of the club should consider. Marc Guehi isa talented centre-back and has shown he has potential by putting in good performances
which has earned him an England call-up but the rest of the defence must also improve.
