I finished watching Emily in Paris today and I want to be in Paris so bad right now!!

What I loved about the series is how refreshing it is with perfect combination of glamour, beauty, humor and of course French food.

It has some cliche things as well as some stereotypes, few things are too good to be true like how Emily has such a hot Neighbour 😉 but honestly the series is very entertaining.

You will be mesmerized with the beautiful French streets, you will be Tasting all yummy food with Emily, you will laugh as she will deal with “merde” and you won’t be able to take your eyes off her when she will donn Pierre Cadault!

It is a feel good series, a perfect watch for the weekend.
