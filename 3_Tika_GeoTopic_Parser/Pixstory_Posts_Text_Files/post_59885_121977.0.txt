The Enforcement Directorate has reportedly summoned Varsha Raut, the wife of Arrested Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, over allegations of money laundering in connection with a housing project scam. After Sanjay Raut's ED detention was extended by a Mumbai special court until August 8. 
The central investigation agency has mentioned Varsha Raut numerous times, but so far, no one has asked her any questions.

The assets of Varsha Raut and two of Sanjay Raut's accomplices were attached by the ED four months ago, who claim a Rs 1,000 crore scam in the reconstruction of Patra Chawl in Mumbai's Goregaon.

Varsha Raut owned a Dadar apartment as well as eight Alibaug plots that she shared with Swapna Patkar. Swapna Patkar, the wife of Sanjay Raut's "close colleague" Sujit Patkar, has been called as a witness in the case. Sanjay Raut has denied any connection to the "rape and murder threat" that she reportedly received last month.

The ED claimed in court today that the Raut family earned "proceeds of crime" of more over Rs 1 crore for enabling fraud in the Patra Chawl project.

Sanjay Raut, who denied the allegations, also claimed that he was being held "without ventilation," but the ED replied that he was being held in a "airconditioned" room, which explains why there isn't a window.

The 60-year-old Mr. Raut is a Rajya Sabha member and close to Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray. He and the party have claimed that the ED move is a political revenge by the central government, which is governed by the BJP. This is one of numerous instances that have given rise to such accusations of misusing government agencies recently.
