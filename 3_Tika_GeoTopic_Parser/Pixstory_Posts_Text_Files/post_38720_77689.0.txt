According to Gazzetta dello Sport, who report that Kessie's representatives met with Spurs officials but the meeting was 'not positive' and he turned down their offer. Kessie will run down his contract and look to leave in the summer.


Kessie plays as a central midfielder. He has spent much of his career in a double-pivot in a two-man central midfield, such as the 4-2-3-1 he currently plays in under Stefano Pioli at Milan.

He is, however, capable of playing in a three-man central midfield and in a more advanced midfield role. Franck Kessié has also been used as a box to box midfielder, a holding midfielder and as a ball winning midfielder.
Over the 6 years playing for Atalanta and AC Milan,in 189 matches he has scored 40 goals and has amassed 13 goals having a xG of 41.93.

He amasses 0.34 per 90 and has a percentile of 98 for the goals he scored.

He ranks high in goals vs expected goals putting him into the top quadrant with him ranking 0.38.


He ranks decent in % of dribblers tackled with having 61.9% and 99 percentile making him the perfect defensive midfielder. 

He ranks 88.1% in pass completion % per 90 and has 84 percentile.


I have analysed the match between Roma and Milan in which Milan won 3-1 courtesy of a goal by from Penalty.

He had the most passes down the defensive half with 15% and 13% respectively, with him spraying pass in the offensive area with 11% down the middle.

His defense stat is also decent with him having 100% of interceptions down the middle defensive area.

He had successful take Ons down the right wing with equally spreading down the offensive and defensive part.

From the above fig we can see that he ranks high in % of dribblers tackled ,xG and decent in % of aerial duels won.


Kessie's contract expires in the 2021/22 season, and a host of top European clubs will be after him for his signature. Wherever he ends up, he will be a valuable gem. He would contribute to his team both in goals and defensive aspect.
