"Friendship may become love yet love rarely subsides into friendship." It's a line from Baron Byron, and what he means is essentially the same as the maxim that when you break up and remain friends, you were never in love to begin with, or you still are?
And, look, it's a big world. People's experiences are different. And if you're still friends with the person you were once in a relationship with, that's probably a good thing. It's a good sign that you were able to move on in a healthy way.
As a matter of fact, Byron is trying to make clear that, while it may appear to be an easy transition from friendship to relationship, it is a fine line to cross, and that returning can be infinitely more difficult, as once you've been lovers, it's very difficult to become friends.
"Friendship may become love yet love rarely subsides into friendship."
