Sarah Palin a former GOP vice president nominee has been aggressive in her stance against the Covid vaccines She went to the extent of saying she d be immunized only over my dead body She urged her supporters too to avoid the shot Now she has tested positive two days after visiting a restaurant Is this behavior irresponsible or is there no design behind it just a random event that could not have been predicted The year old former Alaska governor s test results came on Monday forcing a postponement of a trial in her libel lawsuit against The New York Times It was announced in court when the jury selection process was to begin in a federal courthouse in New York City District Judge Jed Rakoff s first reaction was said She is of course unvaccinated Then the judge said Since she has tested positive three times I m going to assume she s positive The trial will begin February if the Republican leader has recovered by then Only on Saturday night she had dined indoors at Elio s an Italian restaurant in Manhattan Its famous clientele includes likes of Tom Hanks Mick Jagger and the late Joan Didion Not only the NYC requirement of all indoor guests showing proof of vaccination violated she might have passed the infection to some guests there The restaurant manager admitted that they check vaccination cards for first time guests but Palin was a longtime guest and hence the mistake A City Hall spokesman was stern Palin needs to respect small business workers and follow the rules just like everyone else It was only last month that she had remarked she would get the vaccine only over my dead body That was after she was infected last March Palin however wants everyone to take Covid seriously and be careful she has even urged them to wear masks outdoors She is not in the wrong her followers would think given the fact that the vaccines have not been hundred percent effective against the virus The virus after all is unpredictable Still entering an NYC indoor dining place unvaccinated was crossing the line
