Tipping has long been a source of significant controversy, spilling over from time to time into the pages of Canadian media. Canadians’ views on tipping remain divided, as a recent survey by researchers from Dalhousie University has found.

One reason why tipping garners so much interest is that it reshapes the relationship between workers and their managers, and workers and consumers. In doing so, it has wide-ranging effects on workers.

On the one hand, tipping can boost workers’ income and give workers a greater sense of control over some facets of their work. On the other, more problematic, hand it often comes with a range of negative outcomes that are not always apparent to consumers.

These include sexual harassment, pressure to engage in degrading and demeaning behaviours, inequality among different groups of workers, racial discrimination and unpredictable incomes.

 including exacerbating class distinctions and legitimizing other employment practices like classifying workers as independent contractors that can be harmful to workers. Clearly, tipping is neither a neutral or trivial activity.

A shifting landscape
Tipping underpins much of the rapidly growing contemporary gig economy, in which 13 per cent of Canadians are reported to have worked in 2021.

Tipping is spreading to more and more parts of the hospitality industry, including cafes and limited-service restaurants. Soon, it might even spread to airlines, liquor stores and pet grooming businesses.

These changes are taking place before our eyes without any serious policy debate or direction. When tipping does receive policy attention, it is often limited to tweaking or eliminating different minimum wages for tipped workers, and adapting laws around tip pooling.
