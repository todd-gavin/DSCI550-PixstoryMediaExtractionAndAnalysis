"Women should be able to participate and lead freely in social life," she wrote on Twitter. "Women must live away from any violence.

He also retweeted UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres tweet that the Taliban must respect human and women's rights in order to be recognized and supported internationally.

At a meeting of the UN Security Council a few days ago, all member states expressed concern over the arbitrary detention of women activists in Afghanistan.

US envoys to Afghanistan, Amnesty International and human rights groups have also called for the release of the women activists.
