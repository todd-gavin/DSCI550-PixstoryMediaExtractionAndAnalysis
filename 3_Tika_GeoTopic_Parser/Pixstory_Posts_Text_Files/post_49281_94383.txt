I grew up with pretty non religious parents but my grandparents are strong believers of Christ and have always held religion in high regards Every year on Easter we have a gathering duh and my grandparents put on the songs of worship There are so many Easter songs that I know by heart However my one favourite is and I m sure a lot of people would relate Here Comes Peter Cottontail Here comes Peter Cottontail Hopping down the bunny trail Hippity hoppity Easter s on its way Bringing every girl and boy Baskets full of Easter joy Things to make your Easter bright and gay It s not a biblical song per se but I really enjoy it It kicks in all the right feels for the holiday
