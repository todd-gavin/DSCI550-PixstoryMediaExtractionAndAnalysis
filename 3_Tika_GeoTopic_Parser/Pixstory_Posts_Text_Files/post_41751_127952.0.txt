As part of a strategic plan to increase participation and preserve the game's position at the centre of the nation's sporting culture, Cricket Australia has set its sights on inclusion of the sport in the 2032 Brisbane Olympics. 

ESPN Cricinfo reported that in the next five years, the ambitious "Where the Game Grows" strategy hopes to double the amount of kids aged five to 12 who play the game to 210,000, with girls making up 60,000 of that total. 

If not already accomplished at the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles, one of the aims is to reinstate cricket in the Olympics for the first time since 1900.

Along with eight other sports, cricket has been selected as a potential addition to the 2028 Olympic Games. The International Cricket Council (ICC) will make a presentation to organisers later this month. 

I hope this dream comes true!
