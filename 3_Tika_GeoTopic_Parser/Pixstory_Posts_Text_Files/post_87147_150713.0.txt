Gonzalo Higuain (2019)
Higuain, a great for Real Madrid, Napoli, and Juventus as well as an Argentina World Cup finalist, remains one of the least memorable Chelsea No. 9s. 
After Morata was permitted to depart, he spent 6 months on loan at Stamford Bridge starting in January 2019. However, he never adapted to the tempo of the Premier League since he frequently looked out of shape. A lackluster performance of five goals in eighteen games led to his return to Italia at the finish of the campaign.
Tammy Abraham (2019-2021)
In 2016, the Chelsea academy graduate was elevated to the senior team but was then loaned out to Bristol City. In recent years, he has also played for Swansea City and Aston Villa on loan. He did contribute to the club's bid for continental football in the 2019–20 campaign with his 18 goals, but he was demoted from the starting lineup the next year.
The English attacker signed a five-year contract with AS Roma in 2021 for a purported transfer price of £34 million. However, Chelsea has a £68 million buy-back provision in the agreement.
Romelu Lukaku (2021-2022)
The return of Romelu, who at £97.5 million was a club record acquisition and was seen as a tremendous declaration by the European champions, was a major factor in the sale of Abraham.
Even after scoring 8 goals in 26 Premier League matches, it's still difficult to comprehend how drastically wrong everything has gone. Lukaku's lackluster performance upon returning to England has been attributed to injuries, a decline in form, a lack of interest, and poorly timed media appearances. 
The Chelsea No. 9 curse is still in full force despite his successful comeback to Inter.
