Martin Odegaard revealed that Thomas Partey’s wonderful strike that opened the scoring in the 3-1 win against Tottenham Hotspur was something straight off the training ground.
The Ghanaian lashed home an inch-perfect curling effort from 25 yards out 20 minutes into the north London derby to put us on our way to victory, which was his first goal in our colours from outside the box.
However, the skipper revealed that Mikel Arteta and his coaching staff had expected Partey to be allowed time and space by our opponents, and had worked on creating that shooting opportunity which was executed to perfection.
Speaking post-match, Martin said: “It was a great goal. We knew before the game he was going to be free in those areas and we practised that a lot, to find him in those areas, and he made a great shot. 
"I think he played a great game as well so a lot of credit to him, and of course the team.”
