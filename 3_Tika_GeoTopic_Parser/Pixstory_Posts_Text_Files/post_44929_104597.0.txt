Finland will welcome Bosnia-Herzegovina to the Helsinki Olympic Stadium for the first fixture of their 2022-23 UEFA Nations League campaign on Saturday.

The two teams have been placed in League B Group 3 alongside Romania and Montenegro. With only one promotion slot on the line, both teams will be hoping to start their seasons on a high note.

This will be the first meeting between the two teams since they played two friendly matches in March. Finland was defeated 2-0 by Slovakia, while Bosnia and Herzegovina triumphed 1-0 over Luxembourg.

Finland vs Bosnia and Herzegovina: Prediction

Both Finland and Bosnia will be keen to make a strong start to their Nations League campaign and they will fancy their chances of success on Saturday.

Finland managed to come out on top the last time that these two nations met, but we can see Bosnia claiming a point this time around in a closely-fought contest.
