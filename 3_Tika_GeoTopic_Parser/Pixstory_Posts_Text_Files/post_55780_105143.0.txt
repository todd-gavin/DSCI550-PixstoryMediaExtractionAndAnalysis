Barbecuing isn't uniquely Australian, but it's so deeply engrained in Australian culture that it couldn't be overlooked! 

Despite the ingrained "put a shrimp on the barbie" stereotype, Australians are significantly more likely to grill sausages (or "snags"), corn cobs, and red meat. BBQs are a beloved tradition in Australia, and they may be found in the most unlikely of places: the local hardware shop. 

As per NP (and me) If you go to a Bunnings hardware shop, you'll almost certainly notice a'sausage sizzle' going on. A basic barbecue staple of grilled sausage nestled on a slice of bread with a variety of toppings may be found here. Simple, but priceless in the hearts of locals, and a true reflection of the laidback enjoyment of the BBQ in Australia.
