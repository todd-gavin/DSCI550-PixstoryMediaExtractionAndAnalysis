Have a heart as big as the ocean In this world filled with darkness be the sun that shines every day without fail If someone betrays YOU when you loved them deeply when they finally return will you take them back Or will you give them a taste of what they did to you I have noticed that I always take them back maybe in a different way next time I might never be able to forget but I can always forgive If I made a promise to you that I will be there for you in your time of need I will never break it You will be considered a success in life when you are above hatred When you can fend for yourself and don t have to send someone back when they arrive at your door asking for help that s when you become successful
