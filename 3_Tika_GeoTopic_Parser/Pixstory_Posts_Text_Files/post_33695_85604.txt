Alessio Dionisi technician of Sassuolo to the microphones of Dazn commented on the victory for in Venice We managed to hit the third victory in a row, the goal was the fourth The first half was downhill the second we risked complicating it ourselves The next game is a final now it&#39;s up to us to reach a higher goal than the one set at the beginning of the season Forward we have to keep playing so we have to be unpredictable the more chances they have of touching the ball the more chances we have of scoring I honestly believe that in these games with the right approach we can hardly getting the result wrong is the most important thing I prefer to give continuity to the approach and mentality we lacked it and now we are including this constancy In the last period we have fewer doubts about what to do on the pitch Almost everyone has an important historian in this normal squad that general knowledge has had ups and downs Now I notice greater awareness there is a guideline for everyone and with these players things can go well
