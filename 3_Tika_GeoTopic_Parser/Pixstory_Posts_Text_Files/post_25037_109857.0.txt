Gonzalo Higuain revealed that he was close to signing for Arsenal a decade ago. The Argentine striker was a Real Madrid player back then, and was surprised at how the failed Arsenal move panned out. 

Gonzalo Higuain revealed that just days after turning him down, Arsenal went ahead and signed his teammate, Mesut Ozil for a monstrous figure of 80 million euros. Gonzalo Higuain did have his opportunity to appear in the Premier League later on in his career, when he donned the Chelsea shirt.

After his failed move to Arsenal, Higuain eventually moved onto Napoli where he scaled new heights. "Before I went to Napoli there was [a chance to sign for Arsenal]. We had already spoken but they didn't buy me, they buy Ozil for 80 million or something like that," Higuain told TyC Sports.

"They told me: 'We don't have a lot of money to spend. You're expensive'. From there I went to Napoli. Two days later I see Ozil [signs] for 80 million euros," he added.

Gonzalo Higuain also stated that Real Madrid were one of the biggest clubs in the world, and it was a privilege to represent them at an early age of 19. The Argentine also gave a casual reminder that he outscored Cristiano Ronaldo in his first season. Despite doing so, Real Madrid went ahead and signed Karim Benzema and Kaka in the next transfer window, which again surprised him.

Gonzalo Higuain made 256 appearances for Real Madrid, scoring 119 times spread across six seasons. In 2013, he made his switch to Napoli, where he spent three sucessful seasons.
