This is the moment to change it all — the business climate, the political climate, and how we take action on climate. Now is the time for the unstoppable courage to preserve and protect our health, our families, and our livelihoods.

For Earth Day 2022, we need everyone to Invest In Our Planet. This year’s theme is focused on engaging the more than 1 billion people, governments, institutions, and businesses who participate in Earth Day to recognize our collective responsibility and to push the transition to an equitable, prosperous green economy for all.

EARTHDAY‍.ORG is focused on accelerating action, reframing the conversation, and bringing us together to understand that this is within our reach if we harness our collective power. Only by uniting businesses, governments, and individuals to Invest In Our Planet will we magnify our energies to fight the biggest threat to our existence, the climate crisis.

After COP26 in Glasgow, it is even more apparent that governments will not solve this crisis themselves. We need all sectors of society to play major roles: businesses must innovate, governments must incentivize, and the people must keep up the pressure on both as consumers and voters. Everyone accounted for, and everyone accountable.

We need to act (boldly), innovate (broadly), and implement (equitably). It’s going to take all of us. And while there is still time to solve the climate crisis, time to choose BOTH a prosperous and sustainable future, and time to restore nature and build a healthy planet for our children and their children, time is short.

The planet needs us all to step up and do our part, and Earth Day is the entry point for many into environmental activism. Help us rally the world on Earth Day, and every day.
Let’s Invest In Our Planet. We can do this. Together.
