Everyone loves free books. Duh. Who wouldn't wanna read some really well written novel without having to spend a fortune? And let's be honest, we read fast. That many bucks and we finish a book in a day or two, it becomes impossible to keep buying new books and that kind of puts us, many times, in a reader's block. There are some websites that'll let you have free books to read. Thank me later! 1. Project Gutenberg · 2. The Online Books Page · 3. Kindle Store · 4. Smashwords · 5. BookBub · 6. Robin Reads · 7. eReader News Today · 8. FreeBooksy. 9. Wattpad 10. FreeBooksy But a reminder! One thing we don't do is illegally get books for free that are not free. Authors do not make a lot of money but spend a lot of energy and time into writing those fantastic stories. Most of the time, we're better paid than an author for a book. Please don't take their earnings away from them.
