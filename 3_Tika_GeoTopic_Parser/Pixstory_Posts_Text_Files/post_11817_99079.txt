Let me ask you When you knew how to speak what was your first word It is Mom We All are blessed With our Mother s and Our Mother s are blessed With Us But what about those Mother s Who Are no longer with us Who Faced Miscarriages Are doing it alone And much more This Mother s Day Let s Celebrate All Moms For mothers who have lost a child born or unborn For mamas holding a sick child daring to wonder how much time you have left For Mother who have yearned for a child and have been unable to conceive For mother who want to adopt but haven t yet seen that dream become reality For mother who needed to let someone else care for their child and had to say goodbye For single moms of young kids who are too young to know how to express appreciation as she deserves For those enduring the emotional and physical turmoil of fertility treatments and IVF For mothers caught in a brutal custody battle For those who never knew their mother For those who had a mother walk out on them For those who have lost a mother For those who are step mothers I see you this Mother s Day I hold your heart in mine and ask for God s grace to find you Hopeful mothers Burdened mothers Accidental mothers Bereaved mothers Invisible mothers Motherless mothers New mothers Spiritual mothers And all the women holding the paradox of joy and sorrow with or without your own mothers You are appreciated and I hope there s someone in your life to help you know it this Mother s Day HAPPIEST MOTHER S DAY TO ALL THE BEAUTIFUL MOTHER S
