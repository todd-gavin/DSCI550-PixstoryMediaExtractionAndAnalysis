If a burger with tomato, lettuce, onions, and a juicy meat patty isn't enough for you, try the Aussie gut-buster with 'the lot.' Stuff a burger bun with grilled meat, salad, sauce, and a slice of pineapple, pickled beetroot, and a fried egg for an Australian twist. After a long day of surfing or lazing on the beach, this is the ideal Australian cuisine. 

Finding the finest burger in Australia is difficult because every city, or even neighbourhood, claims to have the best. Sky scanner suggests Easey's in Collingwood, Victoria, a bar and grill that often wins honours in this area, would be a good place to start your quest.
