Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 10 is returning to television sets after years. Madhuri Dixit, Nora Fatehi and Karan Johar are going to be the judges on the dance-based reality TV show. 👌🏻👌🏻❤️🥳🥳🥳😙😙😙😙The contestant's line-up looks amazing too. Shilpa Shinde, Nia Sharma, Dheeraj Dhoopar, and Faisal Shaikh are some of the celebrities who'll be competing against each other for the trophy. Shilpa Shinde is returning to reality television after years. Her most memorable stint was Bigg Boss 11 which she went on to win. 🥳🥳🥳🥳😳😳😳😳

It has to be recalled that there were rumours of Hina Khan, who was also a part of Bigg Boss 11, to participate in Jhalak, but the list doesn't have her name. However, anything can happen! 😱😱😱The makers might bring her on-board to spice up the show, and many of you who followed BB 11, must be aware as to how Hina and Shilpa were in the house. 😱😂Recently, Shilpa was asked how she would react if Hina enters Jhalak, and well, the answer is not surprising!
The Bigg Boss 11 winner quickly responded, “Toh mein he jeetungi (Then I will win the show)." 😳😳😳😱😱😱😱😱

She was asked, “So if you two will meet again then will you guys be friends?” Shilpa said, “So the things that were inside the Bigg Boss house. Mujhe kabhi nahi laga tha ki..dushman word ajeeb sa word hai lekin woh ghar kabhi kabhi bana deta hai (I never thought about this but enemy is a weird word but inside Bigg Boss house you might actually make some enemies). ✅✅✅✅✅✅
Us ghar mein dost bhi bann jate hain aur dushman bhi (You can make both friends and enemies inside the house). Mein dushman nahi bolna chahungi kyunki genuinely woh mujhe bohot acchi lagti thi (I won't call her my enemy exactly because I genuinely liked her)."✅✅
While in recent Shilpa Shinde will showcase her dancing skills in Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 10, Hina Khan is basking in the success of Runjhun, which also featured Shaheer Sheikh..✅✅🙏☑️
