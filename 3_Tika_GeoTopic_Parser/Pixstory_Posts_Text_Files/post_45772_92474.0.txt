I still remember when my father got me my first telescope. I was so fascinated by a device that could let me have a peek at planets and stars that were so far away. I remember thinking that it was the greatest invention of mankind. However, years later, there is a new telescope which will beat all previous records. 

Despite the fact that NASA's massive new James Webb Orbit Telescope is the most powerful telescope ever sent into space, the agency is already looking ahead. It is currently investigating the prospect of using liquid lenses to build a massive telescope 100 times larger than the Webb. 

NASA writes in a new piece on its website that it is looking into novel methods and fluid materials for building big telescopes.

“When it comes to telescopes, bigger is better,” the agency writes. “Larger telescopes collect more light and allow astronomers to peer farther into space and see distant objects in greater detail.

“What if there was a way to make a telescope 10 times – or even 100 times – bigger than before? What started as a theoretical question is now a series of experiments to see if fluids can be used to create lenses in microgravity.”

Let’s see if using liquid lens will prove to be as beneficial as it sounds.
