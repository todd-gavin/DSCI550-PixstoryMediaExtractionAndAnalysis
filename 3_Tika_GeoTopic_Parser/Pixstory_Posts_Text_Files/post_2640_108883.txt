A church in London had rules that it would not employ anyone without formal high school education The old pastor was benign and not a stickler of rules He allowed Alfred Dunhill who lacked formal education as the caretaker to clean the pews sweep the floor etc Once the old pastor retired he was replaced by a younger person who followed the rule book As he came to know about the caretaker s education he issued a notice to him that either he should get a high school certificate in six months or he should resign Dunhill quit He started out his afternoon stroll in deep thought and got into Bond Street Suddenly he felt an urge to smoke He could not find a single tobacco shop on the entire street He walked further down into a side street where he could purchase his cigarette and started a small shop on Bond Street which prospered way beyond his expectations He noticed that many of his customers were coming from the other side of the street He started another shop on that side of Bond Street The two shops multiplied to four and then sixteen In three years Alfred Dunhill Co became a leading tobacconist in England He started machine rolling cigarettes and introduced his own brand of Dunhill cigarettes In five years he was a millionaire many times over To ensure a consistent supply of tobacco he entered into an annual purchase agreement with a couple of American tobacco farmers and went across to America to meet them It was a big boost for the American tobacco farmers and the contract signing ceremony was converted into a media circus with a Senator and Governor participating When the contracts were actually signed Dunhill affixed his thumb impression because he had not learnt to sign his name The Governor was impressed and said Well Sir This is awesome Even without a formal education you have achieved so much Just imagine what you could have done if you had a formal education Dunhill s characteristic often repeated reply was If I knew how to read and write I would still be sweeping the church
