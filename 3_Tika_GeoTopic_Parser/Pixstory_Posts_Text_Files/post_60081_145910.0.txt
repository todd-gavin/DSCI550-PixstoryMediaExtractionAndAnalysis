Amarinder Singh, the former chief minister of Punjab, has joined the BJP over a year after he dramatically left the Congress during the Punjab assembly elections. Kiren Rijiju, the union law minister, welcomed him to the BJP. He held a meeting with BJP leader JP Nadda earlier in the day.
The 80-year-old Amarinder Singh also combined the BJP with his Punjab Lok Congress. Shortly after leaving the Congress and his party of fifty years, he had founded the party the previous year.
Along with Amarinder Singh, seven former MLAs and one former MP joined the BJP.
The former Punjabi Chief Minister ran for office in an alliance with the BJP, but his campaign was unsuccessful. On his own soil, Patiala Urban, he was defeated. All of his candidates lost as well.
Following spinal surgery in London, Mr. Singh, also known as "Captain," just recently made his way back to India. Last week, he met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.
On September 12, Mr. Singh met with Amit Shah. Following their meeting, Mr. Singh reported that they had a very fruitful conversation about "national security, the uptick in narco-terrorism in Punjab, and the future roadmap for the state's overall holistic development."
Mr. Singh is a member of the old Patiala royal family and has served as chief minister twice. He was succeeded as chief minister by Charanjit Singh Channi by the Congress in September of last year, but the party lost the election to Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party in February (AAP)
