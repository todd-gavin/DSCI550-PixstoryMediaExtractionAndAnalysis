Staying or adjusting in a troubled marriage would be far more harmful than actually deciding to get a divorce.
The ambience will be more nightmarish when a child witnesses his parents fighting and quibbling on just mere issues.
I think seeing them unhappy together will be more traumatising for a child.
As every child has this ideal image of their parents, which they never want to get tainted. Although divorce will undoubtedly do harm, staying in an unhappy marriage will be more vicious.
Being surrounded by constant abuse will deteriorate their mental health, whereas a divorce is inevitable. However, parents still decide to work together for the children's sake in parenting; then, it becomes far easier.
Such an attitude and commitment make the process of divorce a bit less painful and more conducive to raising children who can thrive into adulthood.
But staying in an unhappy marriage will harm both a child and a parent.
