A 0:26-second long clip is viral on social media with the claim that the convoy of Shrikant Sharma, “spokesperson and member of CM Yogi’s cabinet” was chased away by the public. The video does not provide detail of when and where the alleged incident took place.

The video is viral on Twitter with the hashtag #खदेड़ा_होई (English: Chased away).

Fact-check
We broke the video into multiple keyframes and performed a reverse image search on one of the keyframes. This led us to a video of a higher resolution posted on YouTube with a title in Hindi. The title reads, “How Ravindra Rai’s Scorpio was chased away by the mob” (केसे रविन्द्र राय की स्कॉर्पियो भीड़ ने भगाया). The video also has a description with several hashtags that suggest it was recorded in Dhanbad, Jharkhand.

Taking that as a clue, we performed a keyword search and came across several news reports. According to a report by The Telegraph published on January 30, language rights activists were protesting in Dhanbad and Bokaro with residents forming a human chain venting their ire on the inclusion of Bhojpuri and Magahi in the regional language list for Dhanbad and Bokaro.

The protest turned violent and the vehicle of BJP leader and former MP Ravindra Rai was attacked near the Telmachcho bridge of Bokaro at around 12.30 pm. He was heading towards Dhanbad from Bokaro in his car to attend the farmers’ cell meeting of BJP scheduled in Dhanbad.

We also came across a video report by Navbharat Times where Ravindra Rai can be seen speaking to the media. According to Rai, he was unaware of the human chain agitation and was heading for the meeting. Protestors stopped his car and asked him to support their agitation. As he was speaking to them the mob slowly turned violent and started attacking his car.
