Best Player: Jose Sa '

The Portuguese has been far from perfect--conceding a number of needless penalties and
being at fault for decisive goals against Man United and Arsenal--but the 29-year-old has largely
been the safe pair of hands that Wolves desperately required when Patricio left for Roma.

Podence stepped up in the final third this season, albeit without a consistent end product, and it
leaves Jose Sa as the standout candidate, even if a return of 11 clean sheets undermines his
actual impact during his first year at the club.

Top Scorer: Raul Jimenez and Daniel Podence

Raul Jimenez and Daniel Podence each scored six goals, which was more than Ruben Neves
and Pedro Neto did in the previous season, who each scored five goals. The fact that Wolves
finished 13th and 10th with such poor scoring records is an accomplishment in and of itself, but
Lage will undoubtedly expect considerably more next season.
