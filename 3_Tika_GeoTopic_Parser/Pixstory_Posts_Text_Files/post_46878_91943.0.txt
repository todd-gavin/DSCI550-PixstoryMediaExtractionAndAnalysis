‌She proved that there is no limit for a human. She rose against above blindness and deafness through her determination. She lost her sight and her hearing after a bout of illness at the age of 19 months. She was very aggressive as a child as she wasn't aware of how to handle herself. She was accompanied by her teacher Anne Sullivan, who taught her language, to read and write and to learn by feeling the objects. 
‌
‌She never gave up on her education. She attended Radcliffe College of Harvard University and became the first deaf-blind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree. She worked for the American Foundation for the Blind from 1924 until 1968, during which time toured the United States and travelled to 35 countries around the globe advocating for those with vision loss. Moreover, she campaigned for the differently-abled people, for women's suffrage, labour rights, and world peace. She was a suffragist, pacifist, radical socialist, and birth control, supporter. 
‌
‌She was an exceptional writer. Her autobiography 'Story of my Life' takes even inspiration to another level. She has also written essays on various issues. She had to face prejudices all her life for being differently able. It was a tiring life for women at her time to have an opinion. She here stood firm in her beliefs and the knowledge she earned through her education.

‌Keller had a peaceful death in her sleep on June 1, 1968. She is a true model to fight harder through your adversities with hard work and determination to achieve every dream of yours in your life.
