The collapse will last for nine seconds and 55, 000 tonnes of debris.Â  According to the project engineer it will take about 12 minutes for the dust to settle, depending on the wind speed. About 55,000 tonnes of debris will be generated, and it may take as much as three months to clear it. The debris will be dumped at designated areas.
The explosion is expected to trigger vibrations in a 30-metre radius for a few seconds. The magnitude of these vibrations, according to officials, may be about 30 mm per second -- similar to an earthquake measuring 0.4 on the Richter scale. Noida's structures are built to withstand earthquakes measuring up to 6, say officials.
