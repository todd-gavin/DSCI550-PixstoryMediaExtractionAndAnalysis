hello guys who all love their body...?? suggest some good ways that how should people love themselves..
Maintaining a healthy relationship with food is very hard but we should enjoy what we consume and appreciate it. If we eat good, we feel good abd think good butt if we want that good feelings we have to love our body too if we always think about our body that...shit i am gaining weight..omg my tummy is being faty..it means if we always feel conscious about our body that how we are looking then it will never let us enjoy our life or the deliciousness of the food. 
So let your body or mind enjoy the food. Support those people who have upsetting relationship with food and help them through the journey of accepting food as regular and normal part of their life.
