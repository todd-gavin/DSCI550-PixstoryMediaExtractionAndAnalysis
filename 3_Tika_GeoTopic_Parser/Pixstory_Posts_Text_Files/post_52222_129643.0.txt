Livestock feeding pollutes the surrounding waterways with high doses of chemicals, including antibiotics, leading the appearance of “dead zones”.

Although industrial and municipal waste are also major factors contributing to water pollution, animal agriculture is sadly taking the lead as demand for animal products grows. Going vegan won’t eliminate the problem entirely, as fertilizers remain a big factor in nutrient pollution, but it will eliminate the great amount of animal waste, hormones, and antibiotics currently polluting our waterways.
