The next morning we drive to the Ellora caves The drive would have taken lesser time but for the traffic jam at an old gateway in front of the Daulatabad fort It was clearly meant to handle the width of an elephant or two at the most but not today s traffic or the erratic drivers The route still has vestiges of the old route with old Banyans lining the road the difference from the previous day s drive is stark We cross Aurangzeb s final resting place shops selling the famous Himroo fabric before going down the hillside which houses the Buddhist Jain Hindu caves which make up the Ellora cave complex Its a short walk to the main Kailash temple at Ellora which seems to be the pi ce de r sistance of this place No amount of reading up about the technical wizardry of it s construction the largest monolithic structure made top down cleaved from the hillside of basalt can actually replace being there As one walks through the entrance cut in the thick stone wall the imposing structure hits you All around grand gods imposing their literally larger than life presence vitality in every pose take up all the space the rock walls can provide The main structure is imaginatively carved with scenes from various mythological texts interspersed with plain rock so each one can be appreciated in it s remaining entirety But what blows my mind is this particular segment in the hall running in the hillside making up a natural wall around the main temple It seems to depict a scene of an assembly of gods goddesses Seated as if partaking a ceremony in all their finery the life sized figures seem to be frozen in stone exquisitely sculpted in fine detail One particular slightly malevolent creature stands out sitting with feet firmly planted on a lesser mortal writhing below it superbly carved showing all the frail mortality of man The whole place has a latent energy that dims the noise of the hordes of selfie takers immersed in their own beauty One leaves with a niggling feeling that maybe the gods were truly here Concluded
