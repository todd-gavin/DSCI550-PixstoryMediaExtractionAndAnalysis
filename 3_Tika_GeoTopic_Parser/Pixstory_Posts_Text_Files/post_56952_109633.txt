American democracy is witnessing its most devastating sight and people sitting to rule the country had nothing to do with it Another way to say it is that it is not a democracy but an authoritarian rule disguised as democracy The picture is so reckless that no one is left unharmed especially the women who bear the atrocities of the anti abortion movement Overturning Roe v Wade has further affirmed the destruction of American liberty and the right to live freely The so called claim of protecting the potential life by the people who overturned Roe v Wade is so unpragmatic that it doesn t seem to justify the threat it will impose on women s body and their rights on their body The court claimed that overturning it would move the country one step closer to national sanity has contradicted the idea of women s sanity The impact on their minds couldn t be understood by people involved in decision making Pregnancy is a complicated process no law or rule can penalise one s choice to decide what they want to keep in their womb Even the idea of protecting an unborn can t justify it
