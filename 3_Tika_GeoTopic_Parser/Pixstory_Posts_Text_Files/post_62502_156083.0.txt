It's all insects. Every single one of them!
Camouflage in animals can be defined as a structural adaptation to survive. Insects and other animals adopt camouflage, also known as cryptic coloration, as a form of defence or strategy to conceal their appearance, typically to blend in with their surroundings. To conceal their location, identity, and movement, organisms use camouflage. Predators can sneak up on prey while prey can avoid predators thanks to this.
There are four basic types of camouflage: concealing coloration, disruptive coloration, disguise and mimicry.
Other than insects, the camouflage of many animals, including the arctic fox, varies with the seasons. Octopuses disguise themselves when they sense a threat. Other species, like the vividly hued, soft-bodied ocean "slugs" known as nudibranchs, have the ability to alter their skin colour by altering their diet.
