Life lessons that I learned during the pandemic -
Family is the support you will never have to pay for and that's family who will be there for you when others will make an excuse, so never ignore them.
At some point, we all lose ourselves, but you won't be down forever. Never give up, keep faith in what will be.
Never give false hope to someone because a clear rejection is always better than fake promises.
There will always be challenges, obstacles and less than perfect conditions. Be the kind of person who dares to face them. With each step you take, you will grow stronger and stronger, more and more skilled.
And I'm grateful to almighty because if this Pandemic never happened, this version of who I am right now would have never existed.
