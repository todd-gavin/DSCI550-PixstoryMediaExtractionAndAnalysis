Mehdi Hasan was a 16th generation classical musician and became, arguably, the greatest ghazal singer of all times. 

Lata had once said, “Mehdi Hasan ke gale se swayam bhagwaan gaate hain.” 

 Lata Mangeshkar and Mehdi Hasan sang only once together:

“Tera Milna Achha Lage Hai” It too would have not seen the light of day had Lata Mangeshkar and Mehdi Hasan not recorded their tracks separately to be later compiled into a full-fledged track.

On his birth anniversary, remembering some of his best ghazals.
