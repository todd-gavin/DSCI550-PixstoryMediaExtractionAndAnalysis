Goatwhore are quite a name in the extreme metal scene their mix of thrash metal sludge metal death metal and black metal is a crushing sound of insanity and relentless flurry of in your face thrashing and heaviness So with that said listening to the band s latest album Angels Hung from the Arches of Heaven it can in fact be envisioned that this is the music to kill and hang angels from But barring jokes Angels Hung from the Arches of Heaven is the band s eighth studio album and they haven t changed much In fact this is more or less what you would expect from Goatwhore this album is a crazy mad mix of blackened thrash mixed with death metal that cares nothing for what you might think And even though the album does not bring any noticeable sonic changes it is fresh enough that it does not grow boring It is short simple heavy furious and maniacal bringing in heavy blasting riffs thick bass bombastic drumming and crazy vocals while deftly employing tempo changes and swift dynamics thus showcasing some pretty solid musicianship Furious violent brutal and heavy this is even darker and more demonic in nature than their album Vengeful Ascension The album tends to shift between violent hardcore aggression some melodic elements s death and black metal and some s thrash metal thus making it quite a cool blend of various genres While there is enough difference here none of the content seems to stick out more than the other As such a lot of content can seem similar This is a cool album that has a good deal to offer extreme metal lovers but can get a bit weary for upon multiple listens Score
