On the eve of the Origin series opener whispers of New South Wales coach Brad Fittler s plan to pull a late switch by starting Stephen Crichton and benching Jack Wighton seem to be getting louder When asked if Fittler has indicated that s what will happen or how the number four himself would feel about it Wighton isn t budging an inch Nah chuckles I am not answering that Wighton told ABC Sport In Blues camp preparing for game one both Crichton and Wighton spent time training in the position Before the team was announced many punters anticipated in form debutant Stephen Crichton would be handed the number four jersey and start on the left edge alongside Panther teammates Jarome Luai and Brian To o But Fittler has kept on insisting Wighton s experience makes him the man for the job something Wighton agrees with Definitely this year I ve come in with more of a calmer head and use my past experience to build on that I just try and bring the talk and bring that bit of experience with it the Raiders five eighth said The year old has become one of the older heads in the group and is now heading into his fourth series yet Wighton feels more physically and mentally prepared than ever I am feeling good I had a few weeks off due to suspension so I m definitely ready to get back into it the body is holding up better than ever this year and I am feeling good he said He s one of two players selected from team outside of the NRL s top eight and playing Origin wasn t on his radar before he got the call from Fittler I wasn t really thinking about it to be honest getting the call up or anything like that I ve got one job to do at the club and I try and do that as best I can when I usually do that the rest works itself out Wighton said So that was my aim and I am very grateful to be here
