"Dahmer — Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story," directed by Ryan Murphy and starring Evan Peters as the renowned Milwaukee serial murderer, has already shattered Netflix's record for a series debut in its first week. But in the process, it stirred a controversy.
In a viral Twitter thread by Eric Perry, a relative of Dahmer victim Errol Lindsey, The series has been accused of capitalising on the suffering endured by individuals Dahmer murdered, many of whom were LGBTQ+ persons of colour, as well as by those who survived them. 
“We’re all one traumatic event away from the worst day of your life being reduced to your neighbor’s favorite binge show. And most importantly, if you’re going to create something that uses real-world people and experiences, you should at minimum contact those people out of respect.” Said Perry.  
Rita Isbell, Lindsey’s sister, who delivered a vehement victim impact statement during a 1992 court hearing, a scene depicted in "Dahmer" by DaShawn Barnes, has also spoken out against the show.
The criticism has not only come from those who see themselves or their family members in the series, though. It has also come from those who worked on “Dahmer.” Production assistant Kim Alsup, tweeted that she was “treated horribly” on set. She found the experience exhausting, and the set — which she alleges had no mental health coordinators available, to be an unsupportive environment.
