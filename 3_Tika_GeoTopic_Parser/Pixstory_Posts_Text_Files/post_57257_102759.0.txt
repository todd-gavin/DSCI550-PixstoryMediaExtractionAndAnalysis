Pfizer has claimed that the doses of Covid-19 for kids under five are effective.
According to the early findings of the company, protection against the omicron rose to 80% after the extra dose.
It was also found that one-tenth the level used for adults in children generated a solid immune system response.

"These topline safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data are encouraging, and we look forward to soon completing our submissions to regulators globally with the hope of making this vaccine available to younger children as quickly as possible, subject to regulatory authorization," Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement.
 
The first two doses of the vaccine are given three weeks apart, followed by a third dose at least two months later. Dr William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said, "We're thinking of this as a three-dose vaccine, and the preliminary data acquired during the Omicron era say it's 80% effective. So we will want to look at that very carefully, but that's good news so far."
