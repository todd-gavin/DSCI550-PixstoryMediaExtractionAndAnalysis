In childhood, the teacher always told us that to find the answer you have to read the question carefully and it is perfectly apt for the poster of the ‘Jalsa.’ 

Just watched Jalsa and now I understand the symbolic meaning of the poster where one character cannot speak the truth and the other one cannot see the truth. 

Jalsa is the story of Maya (played by Vidya Balan) who is a well-known reporter and on the other hand, Rukhsana is a cook working in Maya’s house. 

One day, when Maya left her office at midnight she hit someone with the car, and later we got to know that the person who got injured is the daughter of Rukhsana. 

And from here the onwards second act of the movie begins where Maya tries her best that her name doesn’t come out from any source and Rukhsana is trying to find out the person who is behind all this.  

There are many things that I liked about the movie which are as follows:- 

1. Story - The writer of the movie wrote every character very well that each character of the movie was interlinked with each other and one action of a character will have an impact on other character’s action. 

2. Performance - Special mention to 3 actors who played their characters very well which are Vidya Balan, Shefali Shah, and Surya Kasibhatla who played the character of Vidya Balan’s son. 

Things that I didn’t like about the movie are its pace and few plots that are unnecessarily there. 
Watch ‘Jalsa’ on Amazon Prime Video if you are fond of a crime thriller. The runtime of the movie is 2 hours 7 minutes.
