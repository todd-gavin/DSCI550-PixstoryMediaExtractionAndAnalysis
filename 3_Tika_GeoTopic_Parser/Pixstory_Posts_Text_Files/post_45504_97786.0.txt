Gareth Bale grew into one of the top players in the world during his first spell at Tottenham. 
Spurs' task of replacing him was always going to be difficult. Instead of trying, Tottenham 
re-invested the Â£85 million Bale cost Real Madrid to buy not one, but seven new players.

They've all left the club eight years later. Let us take a look at the players who played alongside Bale in his debut match for Spurs and where are they now?

Heurelho Gomes

The Brazilian goalkeeper is still active, but he is more frequently seen warming the bench at Vicarage Road these days. After signing Ben Foster in the summer, the 37-year-old is no longer Watford's first choice goalkeeper, and his contract expires at the end of the season.

He was named Hornets Player of the Year in 2015/16, although he is nearing retirement currently.

Carlo Cudicini

After Gomes was sent off, the Italian came off the bench on eight minutes and had to pull the ball out of his own net after Samuel Eto'o converted from the penalty spot after Gomes was sent out for a foul. Cudicini stayed with Spurs for two more seasons, mostly as a backup goalkeeper, before joining the LA Galaxy in Major League Soccer.

He is now working as an assistant to head coach Maurizio Sarri at Chelsea, where he began his Premier League career in 1999. He's also a representative for the Blues.

Alan Hutton

Later that season, the Scotland defender had a falling out with Harry Redknapp and was loaned out to Sunderland before being moved to Aston Villa, where he is now playing. The 33-year-old has started all seven Championship games for Villa this season, scoring one on the opening day.
