Seafood is amazing People love it But have you ever wondered what it does to oir oceans The aquatic life We are all about not using plastic straws and feeling we ve saved the world But let me remind you it is like applying band aid on a bullet hole It s not gonna do anything You did not do activism by banning plastic straw It s important we start taking climate threat more seriously We have absolutely DESTROYED our oceans We aren t the only species living on the planet and we need to stop acting like we are Our sealife is dying many flora and fauna have gone extinct many our in the process of it A big part of it is due to fishing Something we can slowly get past Change is slow but it s important that we start There are plenty excuses to make but excuses aren t going to save the planet There are many vegan alternatives for seafood that taste and feel similar to the meat version These substitutes are high in protein and can be made into a variety of dishes that simulate the taste and texture of seafood
