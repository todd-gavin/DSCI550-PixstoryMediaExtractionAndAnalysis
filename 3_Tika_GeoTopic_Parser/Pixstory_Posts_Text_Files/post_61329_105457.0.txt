Data ‘mis-entry’ continues.....

One of the examples is UIDAI and the Election Commission of India. An individual can get a duplicate Aadhaar card by payment of a fee online at his or her registered address in the
UIDAI’s records.

However, at present there is no such facility (as of March 2021) that allows an individual to get his or her EPIC or voter ID card on payment of fees online.

Why such a facility has not been started by the Election Commission is really a matter of concern?

Digitization, with zero human interference, would be a game changer for the country.

People suffer and bame government authorities for corruption, red tapism and error in data entry as most of the public services are partially digitized with human (government employee/officer) intervention.

The country needs to completely digitize all public service deliveries with no human interference else business as usual would sadly continue!

From issuance of identity cards and official documents to getting them corrected, putting all these works in an online frame would help the people immensely.
