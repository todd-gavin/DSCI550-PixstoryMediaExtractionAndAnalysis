My month old daughter s teeth are coming in It feels like such an accomplishment After all the teething toys and mouth gels the sleepless nights where she screamed because of the pain she finally has something to show for it I m also a little sad because between this and her trying to crawl it means that my baby isn t so little anymore Before you know it she ll be graduating from high school They grow up so fast
