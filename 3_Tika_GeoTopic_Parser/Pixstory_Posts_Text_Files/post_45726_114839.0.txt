NASA has hyped the James Webb Space Telescope with another impressive test photo just before the big premiere to showcase the observatory's first full-color images.

Mashable reported that the U.S. space agency revealed a new image Thursday that came from one of the enormous infrared telescope's instruments, the Fine Guidance Sensor. NASA nonchalantly shared the picture over social media to demonstrate the strength and clarity of Webb: an almost unfathomably deep view of the universe in red monochrome.

The surprise teaser came just six days before the agency and its partners, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency, plan to roll out the first batch of real, full-color images on July 12. 

Despite NASA administrator Bill Nelson's announcement that the cache will include the deepest image of the universe ever taken, this picture — a mere engineering test of Webb's Fine Guidance Sensor — already breaks the current record for farthest infrared view into the cosmos, scientists said.
