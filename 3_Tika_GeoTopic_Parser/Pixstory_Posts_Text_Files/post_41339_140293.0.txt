Following the announcement that Queen Elizabeth II had passed away on Thursday at the age of 96, Michelle and Barack Obama delivered a heartfelt homage to their longtime friend. 

As Daily Mail said, in a joint statement shared on their Twitter accounts, the former president, 61, and first lady, 58, said they were "joining so many others who are honouring her life and mourning her departure."

'Michelle and I were lucky enough to come to know Her Majesty, and she meant a great deal to us,' Barack wrote.

'Back when we were beginning to navigate life as President and First Lady, she welcomed us to the world stage with open arms and extraordinary generosity.

'Time and again, we were struck by her warmth, the way she put people at ease, and how she brought her considerable humor and charm to moments of great pomp and circumstance.'

'Like so many of you, Michelle and I are grateful to have witnessed Her Majesty’s dedicated leadership, and we are awed by her legacy of tireless, dignified public service,' he concluded in the statement.
