A "sacred privilege" they would want to save but not the lives. The Republicans on Friday said everything that could save their privilege to possess a gun.
Apparently, a true fanatic spirit shields the sacredness of their firearms. For this, they chose to make every point that would refute the idea of gun control.
This is not the first time their conservative nature would have spoken for itself. Their obsession with gun is so old and apparent.

Words of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas when a gunman killed ten people last year at a grocery store in Boulder" "You go after violent criminals, you go after felons, you go after fugitives, you go after those with serious injuries, mental illness, you stop them from getting guns. And when they try to buy a firearm from you illegally, lock them up and put them in jail"."

He meant to say that someone selling or giving guns would know the situation and circumstances of someone buying it.
But this is not the case always; everyone is a good guy until they are given firearms at 18, and they choose to kill 19 innocent lives, 
the gunman at Uvalde was one good guy who bought the gun, but the moment he became evil no one could have realised.

The conservative ideas of Republicans to not restrict guns for the "good guys" would always obstruct the gun control laws. They know the only way to stop it is lower the unlimited proliferation of guns.
That's the only way out now; we can't wait for millions of lives to be killed to follow the conservative ideas of thinking a good guy exists.
