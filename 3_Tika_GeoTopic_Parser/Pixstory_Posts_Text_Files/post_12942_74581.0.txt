Television actor Nia Sharma did an item song Phoonk Le and talked about how she ends up starving herself to look a certain way. 

She explained how even when she didnâ€™t hate her body she still have a lot of issues. "I stopped eating, man. When I say I stopped eating, it's not even about a diet. I would sleep hungry, I was waking up hungry, I would go to the gym hungry. Hungry bhi nahi, mujhe bhookh bhi nahi lag rahi thi (I would not even feel hungry), because I had lost my appetite. I just wanted to go so hard into that song, look so on-point. And I did, I was just looking at my belly and I was like, 'Look at that'"
