From Italy to the Dominican Republic this is the story of three Italian players in possession of a double passport thanks to the origins of their parents. They are Antonio Natalucci Gianluigi Sueva and Antonio Santurro called up by the local national team for the last window of international matches The first of the three to be Natalucci has been called today under Monopoli but with a past in the Lazio youth team Followed a few weeks later by Sueva striker under Potenza in the last six months and Santurro the Udinese goalkeeper with a past in Serie C which helped him to gain note from the coach I aki Bea the latest arrival in the selection of the Caribbean country and made his debut in the unfortunate knockout against French Guiana The Basque coach has brought a breath of fresh air to the Dominican Republic I aki a very prepared coach a great professional very attentive to detail He has a European mentality said Natalucci A thesis confirmed by Sueva He always asks us to play the ball and never throw it even if we are under pressure The next goal of the Italian-Dominican trio is to learn the local anthem They teach it here starting from kindergarten I grew up with the Italian anthem but it&#39;s not a problem, I&#39;ll be happy to study the Dominican one too, hoping that my adventure with the national team can continue for a long time photo credits Sky Sport
