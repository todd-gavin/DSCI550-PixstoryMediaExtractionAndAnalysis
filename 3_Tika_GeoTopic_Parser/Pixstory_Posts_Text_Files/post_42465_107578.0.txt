I just finished watching the sixth and final season of Peaky Blinders and one thing I want to say about this season is that the sixth season is full of emotions, full of dialogues and the last episode of the season is the perfect ending that any fan of Peaky Blinders can imagine.

The sixth season started from the same scene where the directors ended season five where we saw Thomas Shelby is about to kill himself but he realised that he has some unfinished business.

After that, Thomas Shelby started doing business with opium and with the new season, a new enemy is also there which is Jack Nelson who is a businessman in America, and he is related to Micheal (brother of Thomas Shelby) and both wanted to kill Thomas Shelby.

On the other hand, Oswald Mosley who is a member of Parliament and wants to become Prime Minister in future just hates Thomas Shelby because of his power and his attitude.

Everything was happening according to the plan but the conflict of the season comes in when the daughter of Thomas Shelby died because of Tuberculosis and the doctor also told Thomas Shelby that he have just 18 months left because he is also suffering from Tuberculoma.

After knowing this, Thomas Shelby went on a journey where he want to finish some unfinished business as soon as possible and to secure the future of the whole Shelby family.

His main focus was to sell his opium and get five million dollars in return but all three villains are planning to kill him.

Will they succeed to kill Thomas Shelby or does Thomas Shelby has some other plans. To know this you have to watch Season 06 of Peaky Blinders and witness the great storytelling on your own.

All six seasons of Peaky Blinders are available on Netflix and the makers of Peaky Blinders decided not to make another season for the small screen but now they will make a movie on Peaky Blinders for the big screen.
