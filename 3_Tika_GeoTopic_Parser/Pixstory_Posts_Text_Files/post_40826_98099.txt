In the stormy east wind straining The pale yellow woods were waning The broad stream in his banks complaining Heavily the low sky raining Over tower d Camelot Outside the isle a shallow boat Beneath a willow lay afloat Below the carven stern she wrote The Lady of Shalott A cloudwhite crown of pearl she dight All raimented in snowy white That loosely flew her zone in sight Clasp d with one blinding diamond bright Her wide eyes fix d on Camelot Though the squally east wind keenly Blew with folded arms serenely By the water stood the queenly Lady of Shalott With a steady stony glance Like some bold seer in a trance Beholding all his own mischance Mute with a glassy countenance She look d down to Camelot It was the closing of the day She loos d the chain and down she lay The broad stream bore her far away The Lady of Shalott As when to sailors while they roam By creeks and outfalls far from home Rising and dropping with the foam From dying swans wild warblings come Blown shoreward so to Camelot Still as the boathead wound along The willowy hills and fields among They heard her chanting her deathsong The Lady of Shalott Alfred Lord Tennyson
