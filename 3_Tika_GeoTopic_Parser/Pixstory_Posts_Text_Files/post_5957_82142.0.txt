AUTHOR & FORMER JOURNALIST CHETNA KEER'S BOOK "GIDDHA ON MY GULMOHAR" LAUNCHED

Author, Columnist and Satirist Chetna Keer's third book of fiction, a poignant Pandemic portrait and racy romcom, "Giddha On My Gulmohar", had an unveiling defined by joie de vivre and jaadu ki japphis aplenty at the royal ramparts of The Fort - Ramgarh on Valentine's Day Eve on Sunday.

Luminaries like Mr A. J. Philip, former Senior Associate Editor, The Tribune, Betty Philip, noted author and journalist Nirupama Dutt, and Commander R. K. Sharma (retd) did the book release.

The ceremonial lighting of the lamp and a two-minute silence in remembrance of Coronascape's victims, including Tricity's late Literati Principal Bhupinder, was followed by a felicitation of author Chetna by Nirupama Dutt. The latter lauded the author's writing as works of art and her joie de vivre in celebrating her book launches with a touch of Punjabiyat and panache. 

Nisha Luthra of theatre group The Narrators, who hosted the conversation, lyrically likened Chetna's prose to Amir Khusrau's poetry. 

Mr Philip called Chetna's blooming from a journalist into a full-time writer as the mighty Ganga flowing into spate. 

Commander Sharma (retd) summed it up by saying Chetna's prose reminded of a Roger Federer in a tennis court, with strokes that were effortless yet effective.

"Giddha On My Gulmohar" is
a racy literary and romantic fiction about the "oops" and downs of Lollita, a writer, Netflix-a-holic and Saree-a-holic, navigating Pandemic-shadowed landscapes, spanning litfests tucked in City Beautiful and Himachal Pradesh to culturescapes like Dilli Haat.

It's a tale of hope about Pandemics people as much as it's a summer-spring love story, wherein Lollita, while she is chasing her literary dream, finds herself being chased by a dashing younger artist.
