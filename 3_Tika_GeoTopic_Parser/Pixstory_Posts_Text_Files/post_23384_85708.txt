The extraordinary photo by Lynsen Addatio for the New York Times testifies to the target shooting on civilians by the Russians Today they have announced a ceasefire and who knows if they will respect it What is certain that by now this war will see the number of civilian victims increase Ukraine under attack she is afraid she resists but is tired and the tactic of terror wears down even the monsters How long will it last How much money has Putin allocated for this horror And how much has he already spent The experts calculate the accounts in the dictator&#39;s pocket it seems that every day of conflict costs a billion dollars Meanwhile, the reflection of the war will soon be seen even far from the places of destruction and death Both Russia and Ukraine are among the main suppliers of grain in the world The already weak economies will remain without bread In the afternoon there should be new talks in Belarus And we hope that whoever sits at the table has learned the language of Peace
