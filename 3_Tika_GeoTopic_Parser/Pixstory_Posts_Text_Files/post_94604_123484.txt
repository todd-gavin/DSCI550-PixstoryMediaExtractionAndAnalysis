Most of the time students pass their time with friends on various tea stalls known in the city specially near Dairy den circle while most choose to go mall movie cafes or restaruant Thats why their is sudden jump in number of cafes and restaurants in city which indicates towards more youth turning to this culture Some students mostly are engaged with sports or other activity so they are busy with that Apart some students tend to go on with ride on nearby places like pavagadh champaner or Rajpipla area specially in monsoon as this places are wonderful to visit during this season Sindhroad is another place where students like to hangout earlier the check dam was opened for public so many students used to visit their but after some incidents its closed Baroda being a small city has very limited option so far with new malls and other things students have some new options for their weekends For most food is very important and thus any weekend without having some crunch with friends is not over for msu students
