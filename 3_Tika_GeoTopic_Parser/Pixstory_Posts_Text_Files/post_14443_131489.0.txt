NASA tweets audio of what a black hole sounds like - and it is super eerie

The United States National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (#NASA ) shared a haunting audio clip of a supermassive black hole located 250 million light- years away. The clip, shared on microblogging platform
Twitter, took many by surprise, with many commenting on the 'ghostly' nature of the sound and how audio can be recorded in space.

The video is brief but has been enough to take people by surprise. The caption with which this video has been shared on Twitter reads, “The misconception that there is no sound in space originates because most space is a ~vacuum, providing no way for sound waves to travel. A galaxy cluster has so much gas that we've picked up actual sound. Here it's amplified, and mixed with other data, to hear a black hole!”
