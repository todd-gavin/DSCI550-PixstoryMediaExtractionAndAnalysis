Sweden also takes the side of Poland whose players in the past few hours have said they do not want to take the field against Russia in the upcoming play-offs for the World Cup in Qatar Through a statement from the president of the Swedish Federation Karl Erik it was announced that the Sweden will refuse to play Russia should they beat the Czech Republic in the play-offs all four are in the same group and only one goes through The illegal and grossly unjust invasion of Ukraine currently makes all matches against Russia impossible We therefore urge FIFA to decide that the March playoff games involving Russia will be canceled But regardless of what FIFA chooses to do we will not play Russia in March
