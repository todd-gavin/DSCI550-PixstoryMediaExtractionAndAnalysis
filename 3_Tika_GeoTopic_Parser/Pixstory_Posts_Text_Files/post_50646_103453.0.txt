The NSW government has announced that an external investigation is underway after the bones of Australia's oldest humans were interred despite a legal challenge. 

ABC News reported that Mungo Man and Mungo Lady's 42,000-year-old skeletal bones were removed from a secure facility last week. They are thought to have been buried at an unidentified spot within the Willandra Lakes World Heritage Area in the state's southwest. 

A spokesperson from Heritage NSW said the NSW government "did not authorise, conduct or endorse the removal and subsequent reburial of any remains on 24 May" and an external investigation into the removal of the remains and their reburial was now underway.

The last resting place of Mungo Man, Mungo Lady, and 106 other Indigenous ancestors, who were taken without the permission of traditional owners in the 1960s and 1970s, has been a source of contention for decades, causing discord among the three Aboriginal communities associated with the area.
