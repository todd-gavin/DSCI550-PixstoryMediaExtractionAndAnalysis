I watched this movie the day it was released and had seen no interviews, theories or had any idea of peopleâ€™s expectations of the film prior to watching. I went in with no expectations of seeing Tobey and Andrew in the film which made their appearance give me goose-flesh. This film still feels surreal to me.
