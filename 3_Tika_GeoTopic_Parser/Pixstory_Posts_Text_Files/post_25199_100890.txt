Five Feet Apart is one movie I ll recommend everyone to watch its sad tho putting it out as a disclaimer because I particularly don t like watching sad stuff either life is already sad enough Anyways if I write the story here I m afraid I might give out spoilers This movie I saw it back in and I ve rewatched like times till now so just trying to convince y all to watch it
