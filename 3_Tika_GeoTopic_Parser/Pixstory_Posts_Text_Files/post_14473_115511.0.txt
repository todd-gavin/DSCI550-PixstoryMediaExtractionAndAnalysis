Complex and effective mechanisms have developed on the level of the brain to ensure sufficient energy intake. 

A network in the brain controls the motivation to eat and its adaptation in response to homeostatic signals from the body. 

For the motivation to eat, incentive salience is important, modulated through foodsâ€™ visual appearance, taste, smell, and nutritional value, but also through the homeostatic state of the body or external factors. 

Central to motivation, learning, and reward in the context of food is the dopaminergic system of the brain. 

Through it, hormones are able to modulate responses of the brain to food-related cues.

 Common genetic variation affecting different genes also alters brain responses to food. 

Recognizing both the complex systems regulating the motivational value of food and obesity-associated alterations in many components, it is likely that hedonic responses to food are no longer adjusted in accordance with homeostatic needs in obesity.
