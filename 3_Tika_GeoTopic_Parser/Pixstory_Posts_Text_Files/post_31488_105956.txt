As soon as the occasion arises, let&#39;s talk about it Even in the early morning this is the point of view of INTIMINA who has identified waking up as another moment to open conversations about menstruation And does so by symbolically adding cereals to the breakfast table with a shape that recalls that of the uterus Period Crunch Talking about periods should be normal but due to the ongoing stigma it is difficult and embarrassing to do it even with loved ones There is no scene more normal and everyday than the one in which the whole family is sitting together at the kitchen table Period Crunch cereals are designed to raise awareness and opening conversations about infrequent periods in the family, as the survey also confirms. To combat the stigma around periods, it is important to talk about it. However, despite the giant strides made in normalizing conversations about periods, half of people are still too embarrassed to talk openly about menstruation. Furthermore, more than three-quarters have never talked about anything to do with menstruation at the place where the whole family sits and regularly converses at the kitchen table. Each INTIMINA raspberry cereal faithfully recalls the structure of a uterus and the milk even turns red once once poured into the bowl The cereal is uniquely designed to serve as a conversation starter for people of all ages and highlight the ongoing social barriers around period conversations Taking inspiration from old fashioned cereal box games the Period Crunch box includes conversation starters and a diagram of the female reproductive system to help people identify where the uterus is. We are following research from INTIMINA which reveals that some people cannot correctly identify where the uterus is. I am delighted that INTIMINA has developed Period Crunch to raise awareness of the ongoing social stigma around menstruation deeply disturbing to hear that so many people remain uncomfortable talking about the topic and that only the informed at the time that there was support I can&#39;t wait for Period Crunch to start some difficult conversations and break down barriers at the breakfast table
