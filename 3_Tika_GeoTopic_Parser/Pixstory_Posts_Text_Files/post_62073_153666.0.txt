Bray Wyatt has been on everyone's mind ever since the "White Rabbit" mystery began with the WWE Universe debating his return.
With the mystery continuing as more QR codes pop up at different events, it seems another clue has turned up that could be directly linked to confirming Wyatt making his rumored return quite soon.
WWE removed theme songs on Spotify for the released stars earlier this year but had also seen their themes surface back on the platform when they made a return.
Even though The Fiend's theme song cannot be searched directly, it seems that the song is back on Spotify and can be played on playlists it was already featured in before it was removed.
The theme song was also available with a distinct change in artwork from the original cover. The cover for the song now showcases a neon space aesthetic which is drastically different from his character, which could just be something strange or a clue in itself from Bray Wyatt.
As we near the Extreme Rules Premium Live Event, it looks like we'll find out soon if Bray Wyatt is the real culprit behind the White Rabbit mystery. Fans will have to stay tuned on what it all leads to when the lid is lifted on the entire situation from WWE.
