Several major oil companies including BP and Shell periodically publish scenarios forecasting the future of the energy sector In recent years they have added visions for how climate change might be addressed including scenarios that they claim are consistent with the international Paris climate agreement These scenarios are hugely influential They are used by companies making investment decisions and importantly by policymakers as a basis for their decisions But are they really compatible with the Paris Agreement Many of the future scenarios show continued reliance on fossil fuels But data gaps and a lack of transparency can make it difficult to compare them with independent scientific assessments such as the global reviews by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change In a study published Aug in Nature Communications our international team analyzed four of these scenarios and two others by the International Energy Agency using a new method we developed for comparing such energy scenarios head to head We determined that five of them including frequently cited scenarios from BP Shell and Equinor were not consistent with the Paris goals What the Paris Agreement expects The Paris Agreement signed by nearly all countries sets out a few criteria to meet its objectives One is to ensure the global average temperature increase stays well below degrees Celsius F compared to pre industrial era levels and to pursue efforts to keep warming under C F The agreement also states that global emissions should peak as soon as possible and reach at least net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the second half of the century Pathways that meet these objectives show that carbon dioxide emissions should fall even faster reaching net zero by about Scientific evidence shows that overshooting C of warming even temporarily would have harmful consequences for the global climate Those consequences are not necessarily reversible and it s unclear how well people ecosystem Read more
