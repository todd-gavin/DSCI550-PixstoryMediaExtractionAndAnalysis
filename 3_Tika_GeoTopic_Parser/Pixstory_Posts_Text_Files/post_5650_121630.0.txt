A mysterious sinkhole appeared in Chile over the weekend near the capital city of Santiago.

The sinkhole about 25 meters (82 feet) in diameter appeared over the weekend in a mining area in the north of the country.

Media houses showed aerial images of the sinkhole on land operated by a Canadian Lundin Mining copper mine, about 665 kilometers (413 miles) north of Santiago.

Lundin Mining in a statement said that the sinkhole did not affected anybody.

"The closest home is more than 600 meters (1,969 feet) away while any populated area or public service are almost a kilometer away from the affected zone," the statement read.
