It was the occasion for the former France international (17 caps, three goals) and Ligue 1 (1994), Coupe de France (1993 and 1995) and Coupe de la Ligue (1995) champion with Paris, who was named Ligue 1 Player of the Year in 1994 to take part in the pre-match Live (during which he notably received a surprise visit from Christophe Galtier), to receive a shirt emblazoned with his name and his number 11, and to receive a warm ovation from the capital club's fans. El Magnifico then gave the ceremonial kick-off and performed a lap of honour before watching Les Rouge et Bleu claim glory in the Classique.
