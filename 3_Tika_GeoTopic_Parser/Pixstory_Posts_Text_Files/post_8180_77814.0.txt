Two senior Afghan diplomats in the US-based Afghan embassy confirmed to the VOA on the condition of anonymity that the Citibank accounts of the embassy and accounts of two consulates have been suspended now for more than a month.

The issue is still under discussion by US officials.

A source in the Afghan embassy has told VOA that they have been discussing the issue with State Department but there is no breakthrough yet. The Afghan diplomats are warned against telling the issue publicly.

Afghanistan’s embassy in the US has been surviving by renewing expired passports and consular services as the embassy does not get money from Kabul.

There are 90 Afghan diplomats in four diplomatic posts in the US including in Afghanistan Permanent Representative that represents Afghanistan’s collapsed government.

It comes as nearly all Afghan embassies, especially in Europe, are facing a dire situation in terms of lack of daily expense and most of them have covered the expenditure through their consular services and renewal and issuance of passports in case they have enough.
