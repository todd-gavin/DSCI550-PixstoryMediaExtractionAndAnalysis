The young Indian basketeers have made history as for the first time they made it to the quarterfinals of the FIBA U-16 Asian Championships, dominantly defeating Indonesia in the pre-quarters clash at Qatar, Doha.

India ranked World No. 50 in the world, took on the lower-ranked Indonesia and crushed them fair and square, 97-53 to storm into the quarterfinals for the first time in their championships history. India's previous best performance at the continental event was when they had finished 10th, way back in 2009, when the Championships were first inaugurated. 

13 years hence, the U-16 boys of the Indian basketball team have finally been able to make it to the last eight. With this win, the Indian team is now just one step away from qualifying for the U-17 FIBA World Cup to be held in July in Spain, as the top four teams of the Asian Championships will feature at the World Cup.

Into the quarters now, India will confront the two-time bronze medallists and World No. 32 side of Japan on Friday.
