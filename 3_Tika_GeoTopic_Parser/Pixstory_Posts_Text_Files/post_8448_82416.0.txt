Love recognises no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination full of hope - Maya Angelou

The above quote by the famous American poet fits perfectly here. A few hours back, UK's Dy. Trade Commissioner to India  Rhiannon Harries announced her marriage to an Indian wildlife photographer Himanshu Pandey on Twitter and the twitteratis are pouring all their hearts out on her timeline, wishing the newlyweds a lifetime of togetherness.

The announcement reads:

"When I arrived in #India nearly 4 years ago, I had many hopes & dreams for my time here. But never did I imagine I would be meeting & marrying the love of my life. ❤️ I found such happiness in #IncredibleIndia & so glad it will always be home. 🇮🇳 #shaadi #livingbridge #pariwar".

From the charm of their faces, it can be easily reckoned how strongly these two are bonded to each other.

I am not a believer in true love but such stories at times make me take a second look at my belief!!

They look so beautiful together that I can't take my eyes off them. Such lovely news to start a day, right? 💟
