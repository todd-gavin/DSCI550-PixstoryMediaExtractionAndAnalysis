Paulo Dybala has been involved in more sequences of play that have resulted in a shot, with 19, than any other player so far this season - however, none of these resulted in a goal.

Tammy Abraham, who scored in the most recent league match against Juventus, can match Trevor Francis (18) with a mark as the third-highest scoring English player in Serie A.

Lorenzo Pellegrini, who scored and served assists in the last match against Juventus in the league, has participated in a total of 50 Serie A goals since the 2017/18 season (22 goals and 28 assists) - over the same time period only former Giallorossi Edin Dzeko boasts a better performance for the club.
