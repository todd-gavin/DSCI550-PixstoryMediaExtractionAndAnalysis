In response to Gov Abbott and DeSantis’s sending of migrants to different parts of the country, congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in an a tweet, “It’s appalling that far-right politicians seem to have decided that fall before an election is their regularly scheduled time to commit crimes against humanity on refugees.”This is a typical example of democrats using extremely hyperbolic language to distract people from reality, and make their opponents seem like the worst humans on earth. If sending migrants to heavily populated cities that are willing to care for them is a “crime against humanity” then what would you call the ongoing genocide occurring in China? What would you call the mutilation of women in certain Middle Eastern countries?AOC knows exactly what she’s doing. She knows that she misleading the public about her political opponent. Yet she’s more than willing to do it anyway.
