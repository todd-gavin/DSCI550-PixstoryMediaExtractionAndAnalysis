According to reports, Paris Saint Germain are highly interested in signing 23-year-old Italian 
striker Gianluca Scamacca from Sassuolo and they have made a verbal proposal for the youngster. If things go as planned for the Parisians, Scamacca might be their first signing under recently appointed head coach Christophe Galtier. Their first official signing in this Transfer window, however, has been Vitinha.

Gianluca Scamacca had a prolific goalscoring record for Sassuolo last season. He scored 16 
goals in 25 starts for the Serie A side. He was the highest goalscorer of his team and the 6th highest goalscorer in the Italian league in then 2021/22 season.

His sensational performance has attracted many suitors for the 23-year old but Ligue 1 side Paris Saint Germain are.foremost in the race to sign him. Despite having the most star-studded forward line in all of Europe, PSG lacks a proper poacher and Scamacca’s addition to the team can change that.

Talking about PSG’s links with the Italian youngster, Fabrizio Romano said on his Podcast ‘Here We Go’ - “PSG’s proposal is now about €40 Million with some add-ons. This is a verbal proposal by PSG, still not an official one.

Sassuolo always wanted €50 Million for Scamacca since last January so at the moment there is no full agreement between the two parties but PSG are on it.

So after Vtinha, after signing Galtier as their new manager, after focusing on Renato Sanches and Skriniar as priorities, PSG are always working on Scamacca too. So let's see if this week they would be able to find an agreement with Sassuolo.”

However, Scamacca has other suitors as well.
About a month ago, Arsenal had their £34m bid 
for him denied by Sassuolo and although there seems to be no talk among the English clubs for the Italian striker, they might just get back in the race (there seemed to be some interest from Manchester United) but as of now, PSG is the favourites to sign him.
