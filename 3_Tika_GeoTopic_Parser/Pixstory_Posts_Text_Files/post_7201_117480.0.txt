Down the memory lane continues…..




An FIR was registered and a report was sent to DG for taking action both for the shortage as well as for the non-professional audit, which was conducted. 

The third-party audit of the store brought out that several redundant items, which would perhaps never be used, were procured and many items were purchased at exorbitant costs. To get over this difficult situation, I found out the urgent need to computerise the maximum of the workshop and stores. I moved a proposal and with the support of the DG and the government-sanctioned to undertake the computerisation of the workshop and store functioning. This was one of the first efforts in the police department other than the crime records being computerised. I took the help of TCS and successfully developed a program, to maintain the store inventory and automate the purchase system.

I also found that there were serious loopholes in the security of the stores and workshop. I suspected the involvement of the personnel operating the security for a long time. Therefore, I requested the DG to provide me with police officers on a rotational basis from police units outside Hyderabad so that security checks could be maintained and people guarding the in and out gates did not develop any vested interests and provided foolproof security.

With the newly posted police personnel, these activities came under check and two cases of stealing motor spare parts thefts from the stores could be detected. As senior inspectors were found involved, the concerned were asked to proceed on voluntary retirement. I deliberately did not recommend departmental action, as I feared that these corrupt officers will somehow manage to escape in the departmental enquiry and will continue to stay. Cases of fuel pilferage were also detected and new measures were introduced to check that no unauthorised issue of fuel was made.
