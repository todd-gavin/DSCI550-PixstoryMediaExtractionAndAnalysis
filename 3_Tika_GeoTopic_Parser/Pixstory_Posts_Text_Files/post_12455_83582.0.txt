we spend good time, share experiences and make excellent memories with our friends, but what if your friend is secretly struggling?
We usually notice the stress right away, other times it may be less obvious. 
Work stress , studies , family issues , personal issues, relationships problems ,finances ,etc . Can be stressful and overwhelming for anyone and maybe one of your friends is having a really hard time coping . But how can we find out if our friend is just having a rough day or he/she actually need help.
As a friend you’re in a position to reach out to them to check if they are dealing with something serious.
Here are some signs that might be noticeable: 

Changes in behavior
* No longer participating in activities they once enjoyed.
* Isolating themselves from friends and family, and communicating less than normal.
* Sleeping more and still feeling tired
* Being less productive at work or college.
* Eating differently, either losing their appetite, or eating much more than usual.
* Increasing their use of drugs and alcohol.

Changes in appearance
* Neglecting hygiene or basic care, like how often they bathe or change clothes
* Looking tired or sad frequently
* Dramatic weight loss or weight gain

Changes in mood
* Having trouble coping with everyday stressors or worrying more than usual
* Overreacting to situations or becoming sad, irritated, angry, or aggressive more easily
* Feeling sad and hopeless all the time

Changes in what they post online
* Posting comments such as, “I hate myself,” or “I suck at everything.”
* Posting dark poetry or quotes, disturbing songs or videos
* Using hashtags that are connected to topics you find unusual or worrisome for them (#overit #imdone #igiveup).
If you think that your friend might be going through a difficult time , as a good friend let them know they’re not alone.
Other things you can do to help:
* Let them know that you’re happy to listen if they ever want to talk about anything.
* encourage them to take therapy offer to go with them to a session.
