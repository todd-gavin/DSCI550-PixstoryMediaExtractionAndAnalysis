See you can t help everyone who is trapped in this industry And honestly it is a vast industry different countries have a large group of people who are a part of it and prostitution cannot be ended by criminalizing or abhorring it For those who are part of it they have their own reasons It depends on us whether we will help them live with a little more sanctity and respect that they can earn by legalizing this profession or make it more difficult for them Hence they continue to be the victims of exploitation and violence Victimization occurs when a person is assaulted raped and mistreated by the client or anyone in the industry But question don t these crimes exist even outside the sex industry Instead there are more cases of exploitation and violence in other fields so the point here is not their work As far as someone s consent and choice are considered prostitution can be called a simple transaction a trade of money and service Indeed this trade should be between parties of legal age and ability or consent if it does then it s not a crime or illegal or anything to dislike about
