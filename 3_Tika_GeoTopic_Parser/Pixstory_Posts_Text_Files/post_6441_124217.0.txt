PVR Cinemas celebrated their 25th anniversary with superstar Aamir Khan as the guest of honour.

To commemorate this important milestone, the brand is rolling out a multi-media campaign with a film - “Iss Andhere mein bahut Roshni hai (There is light in this darkness)” featuring actor Aamir Khan. The concept for the film was derived from a poem  Vineet KKN Panchhi which was further evolved for the film. The film idea comes from the insight of all the emotions and experiences the audience goes through – the magic of movies, the bonding and escaping to a fantasy world, when the lights go down.  The film is a perfect play of light and darkness, taking the viewer on a journey that is brought to life inside our cinemas as that’s the only place where darkness plays that role. It reinforces the promise of - “more magic”, “more memories”, “more adventures” and “more happiness” to movie goers to remain relevant, both as a category as well as a brand.

Commenting on the 25 year successful journey of PVR, Mr. Ajay Bijli, Chairman and Managing Director, PVR Limited said, “We take immense pride and feel extremely joyous on completing the 25 years milestone in India. The entertainment industry, the viewership patterns as well as the audience has evolved over the years and PVR has been able to live up to their expectations. As we continue to meaningfully engage consumers as well as introduce them to newer cinematic experiences, our focus will remain on bringing winning stories to the screen and adding joy and comfort to the life of our stakeholders.’’
