Women‚Äôs mental health has been the main focus when it comes to discussing anxiety , depression and bipolar disorder . 

But my question is - what about Men's ?? ü§î Believe me or not , we live in a world where men‚Äôs mental health is often overlooked . For quite some time , society has created this notion that men must not express their emotions . Society has always expected men to possess certain characteristics that are seen as masculine . Men are constantly pressured to be strong , powerful , emotionless leaders , bread-winners and providers . If a man expresses emotions of any kind , he is automatically thought to be weak and lacking in masculinity . 

As members of society , we put an immense amount of unnecessary pressure on men to live up to these unrealistic gender expectations . 

It kills me to think about all the men who are struggling with their mental health but are too afraid to ask for help in fear of the world rejecting them .

Things We need To Normalize For Men ;
1 Mental health Issues
2 Showing Emotions
3 Speaking Up
4 Going to Therapy
5 Not Being *Ok*
6 Asking For help

The mental health of men is just as important as that of women . Instead of continuing to pretend that men don‚Äôt have feelings or emotions , it is imperative that , we acknowledge that men do carry these traits . Let's normalize and discuss the mental health of men . The sooner society accepts the idea that men are allowed to be emotional , sensitive and soft , the less pressured men will feel to be strong all the time .

It‚Äôs time we stop ignoring the signs of depression in men and instead encourage all males to be themselves , to show emotion , and let them know they don‚Äôt always have to stay strong for everyone else . Men are human , too . ‚ù§Ô∏èüß†üßî
