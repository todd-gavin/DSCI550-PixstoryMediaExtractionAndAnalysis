A twitter user has shared the story of their neighbor's fight over abortion and it's doing rounds. User jeeyonshim shares in a series of tweets:

"Someone in a neighboring building is arguing loudly with her partner about today’s catastrophic SCOTUS ruling and she’s taking no prisoners, good for her.

" “So you’re trying to tell me that I can’t even make you wash your hands every time you use the bathroom, but you think you get to make me carry a pregnancy to term no matter what it might do to me?”

Girl, dump him NOW.

" “You don’t think you hate women but you do, you hate us and you’re too stupid to even realize it” how is this man not just a pile of hissing cinders on the floor by now.

"I thought they were done bc it got quiet enough I thought I’d be able to settle in for bedtime but she suddenly bellowed “THOMAS AQUINAS? That’s all you have to say, is Thomas F*CKING Aquinas???” so I think that he just failed whatever rhetorical gamble he attempted.

"SHE DUMPED HIM!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉"


I say, good for her. Reproductive rights are not up for debate. A cis-man thinking he gets to have an opinion against what people with reproductive organs want is the biggest example of mansplaining.
