The feisty Brazil international midfielder is a popular figure in the Liverpool camp, and he's been talking about his game's qualities.

 Fabinho has made such an impact at Liverpool since joining from Monaco in 2018, that he now has a slew of nicknames, all of which the Brazilian has revealed what they signify and who gave them to him.

Under Jurgen Klopp, the languid but ferociously competitive South American has become a mainstay for the Reds as they have savoured Champions League and Premier League triumphs, with an ambitious squad now chasing a historic quadruple this season.

As a reassuring presence in a holding midfield spot, Fabinho will continue to play a key part for Liverpool throughout the balance of the 2021-22 season, cementing his Merseyside legacy and a positive image in the eyes of his manager and teammates.

Fabinho, who now has three nicknames in the Reds camp, has revealed his multiple monikers to UEFA's official website: "The first time I heard 'Dyson,' it was when Jurgen said it after a game in which I'd played excellent defence, sweeping up in the middle of the pitch."

“The nickname 'the Lighthouse' was given to me by [Reds assistant coach] Pep Lijnders.

“The players usually call me 'Flaco'. 'Flaco' means 'Skinny' [in Spanish]. [Virgil van Dijk] started it and now everybody calls me that. Even the coach sometimes calls me that. So, that's the one which is most common here.”

Fabinho has made another 37 appearances for Liverpool in all competitions this season, bringing his total to 150 for the club, and he is expecting to do "great things" before further major trophies are awarded. While Fabinho views end product to be a nice bonus in his game, he is delighted to contribute in as many areas as possible to the collective cause, having scored seven goals this season.
