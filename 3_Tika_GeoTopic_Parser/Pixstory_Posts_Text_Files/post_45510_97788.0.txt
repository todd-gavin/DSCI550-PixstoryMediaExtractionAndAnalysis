Jermaine Jenas

After leaving Spurs in 2013, he spent a year with QPR before retiring at the age of 31. But he's
made a name for himself in the media, writing a regular column for the Daily Mail and appearing
frequently on BBC Sport, either as a commentator or a pundit on Match of the Day and Match of
the Day 2. He was a member of the BBC's World Cup team in Russia and also promotes the
clothing brand Jacamo.

Luka Modric

The current World Cup Golden Ball winner. Luka Modric did not play much in this game at San
Siro, but he went on to have a fantastic career and is widely recognised as one of the best
midfielders in the world.

Real Madrid signed him a year before Bale, and he has been a part of
four Champions League triumphs and one La Liga title with the club. Croatia reached the World
Cup final in Russia as a result of his leadership.

Peter Crouch

The most popular beanpole striker. Crouchy will be remembered for hitting the game-winning
goal against AC Milan in the last 16 to send Spurs into the quarter-finals in the 2010/11
Champions League season.

However, he may also be remembered for being sent off in that
last-eight tie. Crouch has appeared in each of Stoke City's seven Championship games this
season, albeit often off the bench, and has scored once. Has a new book out called "How To Be
A Footballer."

Robbie Keane (sub)

He stopped playing football in the summer, but he hasn't officially retired, when he departed ATK
in the Indian Super League after serving as their player-manager. Most recently, he was spotted
in the studio for Tottenham's 2-1 loss to Liverpool on Saturday as a Sky Sports analyst.

Wilson Palacios (sub)

Palacios, a fan favourite, departed Spurs at the end of the season to join Stoke City. After four
years in the Potteries, the midfielder joined Miami FC and returned to Club Deportivo Olimpia for
a year. He is no longer a member of their team, and he appears to be on his own.
