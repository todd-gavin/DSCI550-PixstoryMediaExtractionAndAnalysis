My Years in the Supreme Court continues....

Shortly after the Cabinet meeting was over the Razakar leaders met the Nizam and told him that they wanted to make him an independent king of Hyderabad wearing the title of His Majesty! Naturally they were not prepared to accept the terms which the Cabinet had agreed to regarding the State’s relationship with India. 

The Nizam succumbed to the suggestion of Kasim Razvi, the Razakar leader. Kasim Razvi and his Razakars surrounded the Shah Manzil in which the Prime Minister lived, the house in which I stayed during my stay in Hyderabad. 

The Prime Minister had to jump over a wall to save his life and take shelter in an adjoining bungalow. He was not allowed to leave Hyderabad for Delhi for finalising the terms of accession. He could no longer continue in office and left Hyderabad. Kasim Razvi assumed all powers. The consequences of all this was that, to maintain law and order, India look police action and merged the State with the Union. 

Before the Police action was taken it was being given out that the Nizam possessed bombs and bombers and a large military force and that if any action was taken, Indian cities like Bombay and New Delhi would be bombed. After the Police action, it was discovered that he had no bombers and the military strength was nothing as compared to the armoured might of the Union! Some unfamiliar weapons, it is true, were discovered at Hyderabad but nobody in the Nizam’s army knew what use to make of them! It must be said to the credit of the Union of India and Sardar Patel that in spite of the rebellious attitude of the Nizam he was treated very kindly and was made Governor of Hyderabad till the time of the reorganisation of States. Even now he enjoys all the rights and privileges which he used to enjoy before, minus of course ruling powers.
