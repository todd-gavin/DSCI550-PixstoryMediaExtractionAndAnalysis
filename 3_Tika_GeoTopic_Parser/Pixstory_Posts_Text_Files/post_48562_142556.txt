 And why do you worry about clothes See how the flowers of the field grow They do not labor or spin Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these If that is how God clothes the grass of the field which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire will he not much more clothe you you of little faith So do not worry saying What shall we eat or What shall we drink or What shall we wear For the pagans run after all these things and your heavenly Father knows that you need them Why debate about his skin color How does that matter nbsp His appearance should be the least of our worries Neither Jesus nor God cares about anyone s skin color and it doesn t matter what we believe his skin color was it was his teachings that have mattered and will matter until the end of the times We have grown up seeing him being portrayed as a white man so we see him like that and there s nothing wrong with that
