Janelle Monáe Robinson is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, and actress. She is signed to Atlantic Records, as well as to her imprint, the Wondaland Arts Society. Monáe has received eight Grammy Awards nominations.

Janelle chose to pen down her thoughts and concoction in a very relevant way in today's times. She has spoken of how Technology has dominated our world, and those in power are shaping the narrative in their favour by rewriting history, using technology as a weapon to create bait for people.
The collection is a collaboration between Monáe and several writers known for their speculative and science fiction work, including Yohanca Delgado, Eve L. Ewing, Alaya Dawn Johnson, Danny Lore and Sheree Renée Thomas. By nature, anthology collections can feel incohesive and messy with the ink of so many different pens on them. But, credit to the editors and Monáe’s strong vision, the group does not fall at that first hurdle.

One central theme she portrayed in her book is the idea of dreaming and how it evokes liberation that tackles the fear of fettered ones. It is a way in which characters find themselves and accept themselves as unique beings.
Her book has a lot to say about marginalised communities and how modern ideas are trapped by those who want to create hegemony.
