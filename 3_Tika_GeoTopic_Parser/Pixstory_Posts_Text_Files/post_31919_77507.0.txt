Jesse Lingard has been with Manchester United since he was a boy.

He has progressed through the academy and has made 224 appearances for the first team and scored 35 goals and provided 21 assists.

He is now 29, and after just 273 minutes of game time and with his contract set to expire at the end of the season, he has decided that he wants a loan move away (transfermarkt).

This makes sense because England have the Qatar World Cup near the end of 2022, and he is also too good to be sitting on the bench; he proved that last season on loan at West Ham United.

Lingard was a revelation at the London Stadium and forced his way back into Gareth Southgate's plans.

He decided to stay at Old Trafford in the summer, but now he wants to go, and the Red Devils appear to be blocking his exit.

Newcastle United offered to take Lingard on loan until the end of the season, and the player was keen, but the club asked for an exorbitant loan fee and survival bonus (Manchester Evening News)

This means that, as it stands, the deal is off.

It also appears as if the Red Devils aren't willing to loan Lingard out to West Ham again because they are in direct competition for the Champions League places (Daily Mirror 4th January).

This would probably also rule out a move to Tottenham Hotspur.

So, it appears as if Lingard won't get a January move, and he might have to be content with a place on the bench for the rest of the season.

Given his loyalty and service to the Red Devils, this would be disgraceful and hopefully, something changes in the final three days of the window.

Lingard has given everything for the club; it is now time they do something for him.
