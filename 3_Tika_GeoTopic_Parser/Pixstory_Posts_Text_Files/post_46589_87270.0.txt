Our favourite President has said that he tested positive for COVI-19 and urged fellow Americans to get vaccinated though the deadly disease is on the wane in the country.

“I just tested positive for Covid,” Mr. Obama, 60, tweeted on March 13.

“I’ve had a scratchy throat for a couple of days, but am feeling fine otherwise,” he said on his official Twitter account. Mr. Obama also said that his wife, former first lady Michelle Obama, has tested negative.

“Michelle and I are grateful to be vaccinated and boosted,” the former President said in a Facebook post.

Unlike Trump, Obama is aware about how serious this virus is. Evidently he urged people to get the vaccination. “It’s a good reminder that, even as cases go down, you should get vaccinated and boosted if you haven’t already to help prevent more serious symptoms and giving Covid to others.”, he said. 

This is important, in my opinion, considering he is an icon for people and his encouragement for vaccine is imperative. The Hindu reported that certain demographics in the U.S., such as African Americans and Republicans, are more hesitant about the COVID-19 vaccine than others.

Like a responsible citizen and great idol for everyone around him throughout the pandemic, Mr. Obama has been a strong supporter of public health efforts. He cancelled his 60th birthday party on Martha's Vineyard last August due to concerns about the Delta variant at the time.
