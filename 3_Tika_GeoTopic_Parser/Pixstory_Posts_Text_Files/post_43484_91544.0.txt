One of the common facts is that Koreans think there is some significance to their blood type. Their neighbors in Japan are also similar in that way. While people in other countries may or may not know their blood type, every South Korean certainly does know theirs.

One of the interesting facts about blood types in South Korea is that they are thought to contribute to a person’s personality and characteristics. Blood types can be used to help choose a spouse since your partner’s blood type may not be a good match for yours. For example, Type B females should look for Type O males. Type AB males will also do, but stay away from Type A’s! While not everyone believes in this, expect to hear about it while you’re in South Korea.

The Korean word for blood type is 혈액형 (hyeoraekyeong | blood type). If you’re on a date in South Korea, it’s one of many questions you’ll want to ask your potential partner.
