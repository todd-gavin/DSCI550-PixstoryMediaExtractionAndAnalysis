#8 Zlatan Ibrahimović

The Swede joined Juventus in 2005. Zlatan had a great impact in just a short time, as hereplaced David Trezeguet and scored 16 goals in his first season at Juventus. Club's greatrun for title resulted in Ibrahimovic winning Serie A Foreign Footballer of the Year.

Next year he was moved higher up the pitch and was told to help in the build-up, but that didnot stop Zlatan from scoring goals; in his two years, he accumulated 26 goals.

#7 Carlos Tevez

Tevez might have played many games for Juventus, but the striker had a sweet time at theclub. The player scored copious goals and won Serie A with them. Tevez joined Juventus in2013 and became a household name at the club.
His impact was massive, and in his two seasons, he struck 23 goals and in another season,29 goals making 85 appearances for the club. He was named Juventus Player of the Seasonin 2013–14 and 2014–15

#6 Gonzalo Higuaín

Higuain to Juventus was one of the most expensive South American transfers of all time. His90 million moves to the club was the highest price paid by the Italian team until Ronaldojoined them in 2018. Anticipations were over the roof, and Higuain was at his peak.

The player delivered in his first season, netting 32 goals in 55 games for Juventus, theArgentine was industrious and productive, scoring 66 goals in 149 games, and later joinedthe rival team AC Milan on loan.
