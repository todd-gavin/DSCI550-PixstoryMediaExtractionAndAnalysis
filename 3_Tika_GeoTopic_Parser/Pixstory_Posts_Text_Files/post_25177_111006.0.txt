My Review:
I read this book months ago and I still think about it every day. Let me put this out there TEAM MANUSCRIPT all the way. Verity is crazy and you cannot make me think other wise. She only wrote Jeremy that letter to cover her a**!!! There is noooo way she wouldn't of ran off with crew months ago if this wasn't the case. I have gone through the facts over and over again and just know the manuscript was really. She hated her kids. She killed her daughter. She was obsessed with Jeremy like psycho obsessed. I did get some weird vibes off of Jeremy not gonna lie but I still stand that he did not know she was faking it!! Lowen is something else too, like girl how are you gonna get pregnant ON PURPOSE to a man you don't know very well while his vegetable wife is in the same house. All of these characters were nut jobs. Which is exactly why I LOVE this book sooo much. If you're team letter DM me so I can show you why you're WRONG Imao jk but I'd love some friendly debating already preordered the book with the extra chapter and deep down know she's not gonna tell us but I'm hopeful. So Colleen Hoover what's it gonna be?
