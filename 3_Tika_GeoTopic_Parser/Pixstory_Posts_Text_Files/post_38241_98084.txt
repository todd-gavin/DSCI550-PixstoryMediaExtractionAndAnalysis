As per the Daily Star Los Blancos are looking to possibly sign Cristiano Ronaldo in the summer The Portuguese international is not very happy at Manchester United and could prefer moving back to the Santiago Bernabeu Cristiano Ronaldo has already made it clear that he is not happy at Manchester United As stated earlier The Red Devils have had a horrific season and the Portuguese international is not happy with the club s management Manchester United s iconic number seven has scored goals in appearances for the Premier League club The year old is the club s top scorer but his team s quality has certainly not been up to the mark Rumours have also suggested that Manchester United would be willing to let him go in the summer Cristiano Ronaldo signed a two year deal with Manchester United last summer Hence Real Madrid would have to pay a transfer fee to sign the striker As per reports the Spanish giants would be willing to pay up to million to sign their star back The Portuguese superstar is certainly no stranger to Real Madrid He is arguably the club s best ever player and their all time top scorer with goals in just appearances in all competitions As per the report Real Madrid are ready to offer Cristiano Ronaldo a decent playing time if he joins in the summer Hence this could be a very good offer for the year old superstar Should Florentino Perez bring back Ronaldo Real Madrid News Bringing back Cristiano Ronaldo would certainly make the fans happy But bringing back their former hero could interfere with the direction that the club is progressing in With Vinicius and Karim Benzema playing at their best introducing Cristiano Ronaldo would mean that one of the players would have to be benched But signing the Manchester United star would make sense if Real Madrid misses out on Kylian Mbappe Hence it has to be seen what Florentino Perez decides to do in the coming days
