Liverpool

Grade - B

Liverpool only made one significant signing during the January transfer window, but what a signing he could turn out to be.

The Reds swooped in and acted decisively to steal Luis Diaz from Tottenham Hotspur and bring him to Anfield from FC Porto.

The 25-year-old has been signed for around Â£45million, and Liverpool have added yet another frightening option to their attack.

Diaz scored 16 goals and provided six assists in all competitions for Porto, and he is arguably one of the most in-form players in Europe at this moment in time (transfermarkt).

He was supposed to be Liverpool's top target in the summer, but Jurgen Klopp's side were told they had to make their move for him now or Spurs would sign him (Daily Telegraph 30th January).

Liverpool also failed to get a deal arranged for Fulham's Fabio Carvalho before the window slammed closed (Sky Sports).

The 19-year-old has lit up the Championship this season, and if the Reds had managed to get that deal sorted, I would have lifted their grade to an A.

You would think that deal will be revisited in the summer as Liverpool continue to build for the future.

In terms of outgoings, the Reds managed to offload the likes of Nat Phillips and Neco Williams as they attempted to trim down their squad.

The only real problem is that Takumi Minamino is still at Anfield, and after Diaz's arrival, you can't imagine that he will get too much game time in the remainder of the season.

Klopp's men are still in the Premier League title race, and it will be fascinating to see if Diaz can help them push Manchester City all the way.

You would expect Liverpool to be much more active in the summer, but the arrival of Diaz is a huge coup and Reds fans must be desperate to see him in action.
