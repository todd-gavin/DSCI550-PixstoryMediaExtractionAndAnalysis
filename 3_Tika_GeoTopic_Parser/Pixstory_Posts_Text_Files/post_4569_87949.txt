The Research Brief is a short take about interesting academic work The big idea Governments and humanitarian groups can use machine learning algorithms and mobile phone data to get aid to those who need it most during a humanitarian crisis we found in new research The simple idea behind this approach as we explained in the journal Nature on March is that wealthy people use phones differently from poor people Their phone calls and text messages follow different patterns and they use different data plans for example Machine learning algorithms which are fancy tools for pattern recognition can be trained to recognize those differences and infer whether a given mobile subscriber is wealthy or poor As the COVID pandemic spread in early our research team helped Togo s Ministry of Digital Economy and GiveDirectly a nonprofit that sends cash to people living in poverty turn this insight into a new type of aid program First we collected recent reliable and representative data Working on the ground with partners in Togo we conducted phone surveys to collect information on the living conditions of each household After matching the survey responses to data from the mobile phone companies we trained the machine learning algorithms to recognize the patterns of phone use that were characteristics of people living on less than per day The next challenge was figuring out whether a system based on machine learning and phone data would be effective at getting money to the poorest people in the country Our evaluation indicated that this new approach worked better than other options Togo s government was considering For instance focusing entirely on the poorest cantons which are analagous to U S counties would have delivered benefits to only of the people living on less than US a day By contrast the machine learning approach targeted of that population Why it matters Our work shows that data collected by mobile phone companies can help direct aid to those with the greatest need Read full story at The Conversation Image Credits
