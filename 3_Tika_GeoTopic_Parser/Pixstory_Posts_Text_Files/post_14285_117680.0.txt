The Bianconeri defence has been strengthened by the arrival of Gleison Bremer, who today signed a contract that ties him to Juventus on a permanent deal until 2027.

Born in 1997 in Itapitanga, Brazil, Gleison Bremer Silva Nascimento not only possesses great physical strength but also an acute positional sense, excellent tackling and aerial prowess. Add to that a precious scorer’s instinct - he has netted 13 goals in his three full seasons in Italy, 11 in Serie A, a record for a central defender over that period.

Bremer began his career in Brazil, emerging first from the Desportivo Brasil youth system before moving to the Sao Paolo Academy. He made his First Team debut in 2017 with Atletico Mineiro, and in 2018 he signed for Torino, making 110 appearances, 105 as a starter, for the Granata.

In his time in Italy he has emerged as one of the best defenders in circulation, confirmed by the MVP award from Lega Serie A as Best Defender for season 2021-22. Not only an exceptional man-marker, last season he was the player that made most interceptions, 105, in Europe’s top-five leagues, and the defender that recovered possession most often, 284 times, won 217 duels and 132 aerial challenges in the league.

Numbers that back up the player’s unquestionable quality and whom we can't wait to see on the pitch in the black and white stripes.

Bem-vindo, Gleison!
