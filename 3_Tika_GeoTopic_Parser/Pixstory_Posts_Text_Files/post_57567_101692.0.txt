A large tornado struck the northern Michigan town of Gaylord late Friday afternoon, injuring more than 40 people and bringing massive destruction of vehicles and properties.
According to the Associated Press, at least 44 others were injured as the twister tossed large debris and reduced numerous buildings to rubble.

Gaylord is located in Otsego County and is home to about 4,000 residents.
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for the county, making further state resources available to the county. Northern Michigan is not used to tornadoes or severe weather in general. Gaylord's last major extreme weather event was in 1998, when a straight-line wind event produced 100 mph winds in the town.

The tornado hit Gaylord, a city of about 4,200 people roughly 230 miles (370 kilometres) northwest of Detroit, at around 3:45 p.m.
After hearing the emergency alarms, people in the Gaylord tried to find shelter.
A 15-year-old got an alert on her phone when she was working at the Tropical Smoothie Cafe; thinking the weather outside looked "stormy, but not scary," she dismissed it and returned to what she was doing. Her mother then called, and she assured her mom she was OK. Two minutes later, she was pouring a customer's smoothie when her coworker's mom rushed in, yelling for them to get to the back of the building, Goddard told The Associated Press by text message. Instead, they took shelter in the walk-in cooler, where they could hear windows shattering.
