The UEFA Champions League 2022/23 draw has left many fans in surprise. Group C has
become the Group of Death whereas Group A is a place where Liverpool, Ajax and Napoli areexpected to fight for the two places in the knockouts. Similarly, the Group B is also a surprisepackage for football fans with teams present in that.

Group B consists of Spanish heavyweights, Atletico Madrid, FC Porto, Bayer Leverkusen andClub Brugge. From the outset, we expect the Spanish club to automatically qualify for the nextround due to the presence of quality that the team possesses. What makes the groupinteresting is the second and third place. The group is not similar to Group A where it is thecompetition between Ajax and Napoli. All three teams are capable of getting the second spot ifnot the first spot.

FC Porto have failed to keep their position on top of the points table in the Portuguese league.However, they are within the distance from the table toppers and a win can set the tone. On theother hand, Bayer Leverkusen play in Bundesliga where the competition is between very few clubs. They have struggled to start the season on a positive note and have just three pointsfrom four games. If the current form is to be considered, they would end as a fourth placed teamin the Group B.

Club Brugge, the Belgian side, is also struggling to find its way to the top of the table but theyare in touching distance like that of Porto. They have added eight players to the teams in theongoing transfer window after losing four key players. By the current form that the clubs are in,we expect FC Porto to qualify along with Atletico Madrid to knockouts.

Predicted Finish:
 
#1) Atletico Madrid
#2) FC Porto
#3) Club Brugge
#4) Bayer Leverkusen
