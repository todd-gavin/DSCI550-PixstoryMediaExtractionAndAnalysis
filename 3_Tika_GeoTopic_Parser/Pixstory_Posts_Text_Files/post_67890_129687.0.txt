We all know that the East Bengal vs Mohun Bagan derby is undoubtedly the biggest and one of the oldest rivalries in not only India but all over Asia. Both the clubs have a massive fanbase in West Bengal and when they come face to face in any tournament, the hype and buzz created about the match is insane. The cultural differences between the supporters of the two teams is the root cause of this rivalry and for over a hundred years, they have been arch enemies. 

East Bengal and Mohun Bagan will face each other in the 2022 Durand Cup as well and as expected, the fans are eagerly awaiting the match. The two sides will take on each other on 28th August at the Salt Lake Stadium, Sector 1, Kolkata. 

The online sale of tickets started on 6th August and not to our surprise, all the tickets were sold just within 30 minutes. It tells us a lot about the excitement and hype regarding this match. We need to consider the fact that one of the two teams, i.e Emami East Bengal, is currently going through a rough patch and the fact that their fans are still looking forward to this match is exemplary of the Bengali football tradition. 

But the problem of the hour is the lack of tickets as thousands of fans have complained about the unavailability of tickets. Listening to the plea of fans, the organisers have agreed to open two more slots of online ticket booking. 

Apart from that, the tickets will also be available at the Box office of Yuva Bharati Krirangan and the tents of these two clubs - East Bengal and Mohun Bagan. 

On the other hand, fans who have already bought their online tickets will also have to collect the hardcopy of their tickets from Mohammedan Sporting's tent in Maidan Kolkata.
