There is no age barrier for getting into the record books. Guinness has so many categories under which you can apply for a record. Since most of the record breaking attempts are indoor events,
the talent and technique needed for getting into the Guinness book is totally different from other outdoor sporting events.

But being a sportsman or being naturally athletic and fit can make the training process easier and faster. In 2018, after I got into the Guinness record for the second time, this time for delivering the most number of full contact one hand punches (312) in one minute while holding a 1 kg weight, a lot of people from all over the country approached me for training.

Till date I have trained 15 people to get into the Guinness. Some of them are holding multiple records. Right now another 38 people from Odisha, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Rajasthan are training under me. Some of them have been training with me for the last three months. Since
I donâ€™t charge any fees for training, I ensure that I train only those who are passionate about it.

So in order to identify the right talent, I have a little screening round for Gunnies aspirants who want to break my punch strike record. The task I give them is to complete 300 to 400 punches in seven days. People who prove themselves are inducted into my coaching programme for further training.
