Hi, this is me. I like writing but I didnâ€™t pursue it, obviously brown household things, but yea after all I have to destroy myself in this one life. Reading books, going alone for coffees, night outs, pasta at 2am, French fries in classes is all what I live for. I wish to go for corporate life but I donâ€™t know if I would be able to survive with a filter coffee lite. Wishing you all luck and more power to youðŸ˜‹
