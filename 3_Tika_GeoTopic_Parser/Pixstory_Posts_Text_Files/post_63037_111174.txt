The picture you see above is probably making you think of an exciting trip But to get it shot we went through a lot Let s go for a camping trip in mountains we heard ourselves saying in the evening when we reached home exhausted from office I still wonder how everyone agreed and plan was on in one shot if you have planned for trips with friends you must know how one of them leaves us hanging and cancels in the end D We took leave and loaded our bikes with luggage and travelled to Bhowali Nainital But it wasn t going to be a pleasant journey atleast what we thought it would be As we were half way heavy rain fall started out of the blue We had no raincoat as rain was not expected during that month In a matter of minutes were all soaked as wind tried to freeze us It was already km to go we kept moving because landslide could occur After riding for km in the heavy rain and cold wind we reached a camp which was km inside the forest We lit the bonfire and sat there One of us felt ill because we didn t let him wear the raincoat that he bought why would he when others are getting wet in rain P S This pic is of next day when sun shone bright
