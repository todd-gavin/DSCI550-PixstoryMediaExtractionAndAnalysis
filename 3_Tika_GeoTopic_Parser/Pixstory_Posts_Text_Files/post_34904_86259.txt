It is a disqualification not disqualification that the ATP imposed on the world number Alexander Zverev for what was combined at the Acapulco tournament The German tennis player had heavily and repeatedly insulted both the line judge and the referee before taking rackets the latter A scene that is difficult to see in an ATP tournament and in fact the organization had decided to immediately disqualify Zverev from the singles competition he had gone into a rage in the doubles at the time of the defeat On that occasion the ATP&#39;s intention to give a long disqualification seemed clear the tennis player, on the other hand, was fined weeks of six and a thousand euros but both are frozen for a year during which if Zverev behaves well they will not be applied The apologies already made at the end of the match probably seemed true The German will therefore be able to play both the Indian Wells and Miami tournaments as well as all the other competitions on the ATP circuit
