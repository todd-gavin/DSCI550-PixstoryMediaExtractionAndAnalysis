My first interview ever So this was right after I gave my last exams of masters and wanted to start look for an internship or a job That time I applied for this intership which seemed good I got shortlisted I was like yayyy finally getting this internship after I get give interview I was soo confident But I guess I wasn t ready for what was coming I entered the building then there was waiting area waited for or so minutes cause there was someone before be for interview She gives her interview and starts to write something on paper which interviewers sometimes make you do that to see if the person knows the responsibilities of that position So it was my turn I went into office where I was gonna get interviewed I removed my mask Was in all formal clothes gave him my resume CV He asks me some basic questions like where I studied masters and where I live but he didn t ask me any basic microbiology questions which usually even for internships interviewers ask He proceeds to say that You are a microbiologist then why that saying that while pointing at my face and in not so very respectful tone I knew it was about my nose piercing I replied to him It s just an ornament which won t affect the work I m going to do in laboratory I m going to be wearing a mask so it won t affect the examinations I m going to do I felt that was very professional way of answering someone So he moves on and tells me right after that after that I think this is all for this interview He didn t tell me to write anything like he told the girl before me So I wasn t sure what that was But I guess this wasn t the best interview And facing this discrimination cause of Nose piercing broke me I know this is mine coming with another not so well written but hopefully you guys will understand nbsp
