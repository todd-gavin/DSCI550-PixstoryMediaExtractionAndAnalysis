Juventus wins at the Allianz Stadium against Spezia A goal from Alvaro Morata decides the match Massimiliano Allegri commented on the match after the match Today we played a good game in the first half which ended with a two-goal lead In the second half we were a bit tired from absences and many commitments Need victories with suffering to get to great triumphs I don&#39;t have to say anything to the boys it was important to score points and prepare for matches with Sampdoria Villarreal and Salernitana at my best I&#39;ve never seen a team win always easy The environment had become unaccustomed to winning with pain but even in my years we had it and it&#39;s normal that it&#39;s like this The important thing is not to give up There were balls to play up front They got up more in the second half but we kept up well the field had a few dangerous situations We were also a little tired Vlahovic and Morata need to get to know each other better as movements and we need to work on this but they worked well anyway They try too hard but they did well I&#39;m sorry for Paulo who was not available for today I hope to have him available for Villarreal. The contract is a thing of the club and nobody discusses his qualities
