Anagen Phase:

Every month, your hair grows around half an inch, and summertime growth is greater than wintertime growth. An average full-length hair measures 18 to 30 inches since the anagen phase, also known as the growth phase, lasts for 3 to 5 years. Asian and African descendants typically experience lengthier anagen phases than caucasians, which can last up to 7 years and allow for hair growth of up to 1 metre.

Catagen Phase

Your hair enters the catagen phase at the conclusion of the anagen phase. a brief period of transition that lasts around 10 days.

Telogen Phase

Finally, your hair enters the telogen phase, a dormant stage during which it releases and sheds. After that, the follicle is dormant for three months until the same procedure is carried out again. Because each hair follicle is independent and undergoes the development cycle at a distinct period, you wouldn't lose all of your hair at once. Instead, you only lose up to 80-200 hairs every day on an average healthy head of hair.
