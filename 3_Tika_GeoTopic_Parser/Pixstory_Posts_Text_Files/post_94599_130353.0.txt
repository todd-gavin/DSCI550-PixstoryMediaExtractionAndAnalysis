Red is not a risky color if you canÂ  carry it with elegance. Trust me when I say this, I have been on both the good and bad side of wearing red outfits and this time I went all out with this wine red kurti from @myntra. 
In my perspective, it works as both a cocktail dress and for traditional occasions depending on what jewelry it is been paired up with. I personally prefer least amount of embellishments on me to give an extra chique and classy look and for me keeping the hair open for girls works wonder!! 
What do you guys think?
