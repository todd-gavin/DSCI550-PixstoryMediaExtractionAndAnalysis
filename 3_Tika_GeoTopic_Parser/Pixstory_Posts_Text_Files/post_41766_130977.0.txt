Tim Paine, a former captain of Australia, is expected to play first class cricket again during the next Sheffield Shield season. 

Fox Sports reported that the Australian claims that despite not having a contract, Paine has been training covertly with Tasmania for weeks in preparation for a full-time comeback. 

He will likely need to return at the club level first, but he might don the gloves for Tasmania's opening match against Queensland on October 6 at Allan Border Field. 

Since his departure from cricket following a sexting scandal involving a former employee of Cricket Tasmania, Paine hasn't participated in any competitive matches. 

It was discovered that Paine had emailed a former coworker an explicit picture of himself along with a message on the eve of the 2021â€“22 Ashes.

Do you think it was a fair decision?
