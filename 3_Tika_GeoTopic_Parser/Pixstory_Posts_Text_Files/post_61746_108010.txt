Free will by it s inherent meaning signifies that we have the choice to be what we want good bad or ugly the CHOICE to be free Why have the Christians as a group chose to portray Jesus as a judgemental son of a God The man who preached love and compassion and forgiveness his whole life how can he be judgemental towards another person s life How can free will be defined as something that has to be good otherwise it won t be salvation coz Jesus won t like you I think we can all agree that we should give Jesus a little more credit He is the son of the God after all I m quite sure he wouldn t mind if some people didn t wanna follow his righteous path Because I m sure that he will find in his heart to forgive them later
