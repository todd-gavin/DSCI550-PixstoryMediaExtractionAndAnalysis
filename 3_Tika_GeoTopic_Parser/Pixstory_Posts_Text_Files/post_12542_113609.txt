When the hurricanes in our head have come to rest and when things starts getting better we will start believing in the days where we were struggling to do things have come to a rest for a while and we have improved from the struggling state Yes that s right the days are getting brighter while you involve in activities where you start doing those things that you enjoyed maybe want to socialize more like never before that s when you can understand that you are doing great and so is your mental health Here are few signs that show how you are doing well You start socialising more regularly During the survival days it s hard to even do basic communication as there are possibilities of high level of mood swings going on but eventually you will feel a control you have over them and start socialising more Taking care of personal hygiene Nourishing yourself and your body will be more You have less brain fog During the struggle days most of them tend to overthink and much of those thoughts would be pessimistic but as days pass by it gets lesser and that s when you realise how you can control these thoughts It s no easy thing to get control over these thoughts and divert it but once you believe that you will overcome this no thought can stop you from that willpower Realising bad days won t last forever The ray of hope is what keeps us going ahead Sources Instagram
