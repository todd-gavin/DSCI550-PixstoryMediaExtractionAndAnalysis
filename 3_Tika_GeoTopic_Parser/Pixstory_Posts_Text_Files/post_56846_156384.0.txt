Coconut oil acts as a great makeup remover, leaving you with softer and younger looking skin.
Apart from its conventional uses, Coconut oil is a great organic solution to removing makeup from your skin.
-Take a small amount of Coconut oil and rub it between your fingers until it melts.
-Keep your eyes closed and gently spread the oil over your eyelids and lashes as well as across all other areas of your eye. Make sure to apply just enough oil for your fingers to move around softly.
-Massage the oil on your skin using a circular motion to be able to remove your makeup.
-Using a warm, wet washcloth, wipe off excess Coconut oil.
-Splash your face with warm water and youâ€™re good to go.
