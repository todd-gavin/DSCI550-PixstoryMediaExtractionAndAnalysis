Everyone has been embarrassed at one time or another It is that moment in time when you wish the earth would open up and swollen you The anxiety and discomfort felt during that time which may only last a few seconds feels like time has stood still I remembered so well when I had my most embarrassing moment i was in th standard when I participated in garba competition held in my school our class was th to perform on a stage and every performer have to go in queue for the performance My foot stuck down in my skirt and i fall down during entrance I still recall i get up so quickly although i was injured and everyone was looking at me that made the situation more embarrassing Well sometimes when you looked back it will be just a funny thing or a joke with family and friends
