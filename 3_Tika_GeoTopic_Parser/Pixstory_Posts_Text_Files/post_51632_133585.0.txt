Yes, it is so tough to play against stronger and more physical opponents then you,
As being small or facing any huge opponent it is not possible to win by just using your own physical strength, so as to dominate these massive players you need to think smartly and perform quickly to always achieve domination over them.
Tips to play against physical players - 
LIMIT TOUCHES - 
You have to limit your touches on the ball and have to move the ball quickly and sharply before you get too close to that huge opponent, then their physicality will not be an problem.
Being quick and maintaining distance is the key to avoid shoulder clashes from them.
NO CONTEST -
If you are taking a lot of touches on the ball then you are making it an 50/50 possession battle against the stronger opponent. As soon as you will enter inside the opponent range the probability of the opponent dominating you will increase effectively, 
Instead keep the ball out from the reach of the player. 
POSITIONING - 
When your team have possession and moving the ball, you have to find areas of space away from the opponents. 
Positioning yourself off the shoulder or beyond the defenders will allow you to avoid these physical battles. 
Defensively, if you know that the opponent is more stronger than you physically then do not just over commit, don't get too much close to the player cause if you get to close to the opponent the player will simply roll the ball away right pass you. 
NO FEAR - 
What are you afraid of ? huh ? What do you have to loose ? 
Surely, you will get kicked sometimes and it will hurt, but isn't your pride of playing hard more important than being seen as an easy weak opponent. 
If being the strongest is the trait a player should have ? Then why the elephant is not the king of the jungle ? 
Start thinking like a Lion and Dominate every other more stronger players than you ? 
Tell me in the notes if this helped you...
