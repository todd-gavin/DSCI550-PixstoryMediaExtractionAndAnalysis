After a highly successful loan spell that saw him help the club regain the Ligue 1 title,
the Portugal legacy has a softy legacy in mind.

Nuno Mendes says he has come to Paris Saint Germain to write his name in the club’s
history books after they had signed the defender permanently.

The 19-year-old is set to remain at Parc des Princes through 2026 after a successful
loan spell saw the club trigger their 40 million option to acquire the defender from
Sporting CP.

Mendes was an impressive performer at PSG and pushed on to reclaim their Ligue 1
crown after losing it the previous season speaking after he put pen to paper on a new
deal, the teenager stated that his long term stay would give him a chance to go down as
a club great.

What has Mendes said about his PSG story?

“I came here to write my name in Paris Saint Germain history, “Mendes told the club’s official website.” It started this year and I hope to continue the good times for the club,
with more league wins and more titles.

“This is what I try to do every time I represent the club. Since I was little, I wanted to
play for a big club and PSG is the one.”

What has Mendes said about PSG’s overall campaign?

Despite his impressions, Mendes was privy to another PSG campaign that saw them fall
short of their European dreams in the Champions League despite a host of major
arrivals, including Lionel Messi, though Kylian Mbappe’s decision to snub Real Madrid
at the close of the campaign provided a boost all around.

Reflecting on that, the teenager paid tribute to the team ethos on show, stating “when
we had bad times, the team was able to react in the right manner. We would go to the
training and do our best and that’s what we did all season.
