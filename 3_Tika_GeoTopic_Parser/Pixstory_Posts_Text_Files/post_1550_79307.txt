Last Friday ESPN s Adrian Wojnarowski reported the Sacramento Kings ended their pursuit of a deal with the Philadelphia ers for Ben Simmons This was a deliberate leak and negotiation tactic to drive the seller s asking price down A potential deal is definitely not dead with so many factors that justify keeping it alive On the Sixers side there is an urgency to capitalize on Joel Embiid s current dominance Team president Daryl Morey s insistence on trading Simmons only if it significantly improves the team s title odds makes sense but Embiid s injury history and the team s overall age suggests they must catch lightning in a bottle to win now Even if there might be a better return available later James Harden Embiid is this good now Who knows about later The Kings face similar pressure for different reasons They are about to set a franchise record for most seasons without a playoff appearance and are dealing with a forever loyal fan base growing weary of incompetence De Aaron Fox has been the team s most promising talent and is an extremely attractive piece for many teams to build around but is now not a great fit on the Sacramento Kings since they have two other intriguing point guards from their last two drafts The prediction here is the Kings must and will decide now to build around either Fox or Halliburton The decision about which one to build around may largely be influenced by who seems to be more attractive to the ers in order to obtain Simmons My prediction is that player is Haliburton Sacramento needs a shakeup as much as any team in the league and has Fox or Haliburton to headline a package for Simmons who s just sitting there on the market New GM Monte McNair knows it is the perfect opportunity to make a franchise altering trade as was done when he was in Houston to obtain James Harden He would be crucified if he doesn t swing for the fences
