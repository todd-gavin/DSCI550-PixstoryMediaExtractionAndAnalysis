In a case that has developed amid tight relations between Moscow and Washington, American basketball player Brittney Griner's trial began on Friday, four and a half months after her detention on allegations of carrying cannabis oil while returning to play for a Russian team. 

CBC Sports reported that since Griner, a centre for the Phoenix Mercury and a two-time U.S. Olympic gold medalist, was taken into custody at Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport in February, the first trial session, which was postponed until July 7, provided the most extensive public interaction between Griner and reporters. 

Griner, 31, was shackled, clutching what seemed to be a magazine and a water bottle, and wearing a Jimi Hendrix T-shirt as he was led into the courtroom in the Khimki area of the city.

Police have said she was carrying vape canisters with cannabis oil when detained at the airport. She could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of large-scale transportation of drugs.
