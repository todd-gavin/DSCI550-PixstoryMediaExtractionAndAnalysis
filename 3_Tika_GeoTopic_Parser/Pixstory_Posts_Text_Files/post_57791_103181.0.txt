Sabrina Carpenter is a relatively newer name in pop music, with her gaining recognition from a Disney show "Girl Meets World" and then creating her identity in the music industry. Her voice, her vocals, her style, her beats and her lyrics are pretty unique and work together in her songs extremely well. Her song, "Exhale" was her fourth album's, "Singular: Act II", second single released back in May of 2019. The tone and the lyrics of the song very clearly tell a story about the weight of this fast paced world and its pressures and expectations being put on people. Of how people around you tell you about, comment and talk about things concerning you in ways that are not needed, the way they are about what you do is too much at times. All of this makes us feel in ways that are unhealthy and wrong, like we're undeserving, not doing enough or doing it wrong most of the time. The satisfaction and happiness that we are able to get from doing things for ourselves gets trodden on and beaten down by other people and their perspectives and words. We don't necessarily need any of that, support is not given in the way it should be and that takes a toll. All that we know about increased anxiety, nervousness and stress and much more is linked to all of this. Yes, the world will not stop moving for anyone, neither will time nor people but that doesn't mean you start going on too many and too wrong paths trying to catch up but just being thrown back. Taking a moment to step back, to calm down, take a breather and reassess and reanalyse is not wrong, it's good to be aware of yourself and your limits and capabilities, its worse if you're not. Music and words mix together enchantingly in a way that makes us think and understand, and also relax. There's immense strength drawn from music by people all across the world.
