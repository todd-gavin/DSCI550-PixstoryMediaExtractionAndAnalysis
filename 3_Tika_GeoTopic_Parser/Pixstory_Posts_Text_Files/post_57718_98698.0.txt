From the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio founded in 1923 to the Walt Disney Company now, Disney has spent nearly a century creating The Best Content! That is watched by people of all ages. Their animated stories have been blockbusters from the very start and now continue to be along with the ones from their acquired subsidiaries like Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm and 20th Century Studios. But, the original classics have, and I believe will always have, a special place in the hearts of all the people who have watched and followed Disney. The classics are those from the first animated movies in the 20th century continuing to the 21st century that have captured every kid and adults hearts in the most emotional and intellectual way possible. These are comfort movies for so many people, something people have sworn to introduce their kids to and something that restores hope and faith in humanity whenever you watch it. These movies have inspired, motivated and helped so many in the most beautiful, intimate and simplistic storytelling ways. Their interpretation is obviously subject to the viewers perspective but if they are truly seen for what they are and show, then you feel that warmth that they exude. Yes, Disney with its above mentioned and many other subsidiaries and acquisitions like ESPN and Disney+ has become a huge conglomerate that evidently earns big bucks, but they haven't lost their essence, that which Walt and Roy Disney wanted and created this company for. If you haven't seen these classics, I strongly recommend you do, you will not be disappointed. The kind of beauty in terms of feelings that you see in these movies is akin to that which you get from the nature around us. Its truly mesmerising, enchanting and captivating in the most warm way possible. They have everything, humor, romance, action, adventure, history, music, literature, politics, mystery and fantasy coupled with real life situations.
