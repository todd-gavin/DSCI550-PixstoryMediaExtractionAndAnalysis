The World Bank announced on Tuesday that it had suspended four of its $ 600 million projects in Afghanistan. According to the bank, the decision was made in response to the Taliban's move to ban girls from school in the sixth grade.

According to Reuters, the projects were to be implemented by the United Nations in areas such as agriculture, education and health.

The World Bank says that the condition for the implementation of its projects in Afghanistan is equal access for men and women to its benefits, and that the work of these projects will begin again when women and girls are not deprived of it due to discrimination.

On March 1, the World Bank authorized the use of $ 1 billion in Afghanistan Reconstruction Fund funds for humanitarian purposes. This money is spent through the United Nations in Afghanistan.
