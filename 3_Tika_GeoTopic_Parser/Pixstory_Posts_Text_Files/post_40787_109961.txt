Even as I sit here I sit a human Not less than you man I sit as a capable woman Also able to woo man So this is my proposal Do read it and take it as personal As you would your own business I mind mine Do not undermine mine So here we go Treat me with dignity and respect I deserve it simply because I am human Not because I should earn it with giveaways No Not at all I am no promo nor a jackpot machine Iseethewayyoulookatme With those lustful desires Lurking in your eyes I see you salivate and crave For me to be in your arms Oh I see them all Darlin Tessah
