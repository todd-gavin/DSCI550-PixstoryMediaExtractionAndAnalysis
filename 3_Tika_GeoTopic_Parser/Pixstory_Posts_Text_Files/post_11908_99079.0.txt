Let me ask you , When you knew how to speak , what was your first word ? It is Mom .🧿❤️✨

We All are blessed With our Mother's and Our Mother's are blessed With Us ! ❤️

But what about those Mother's Who Are no longer with us ?? Who Faced Miscarriages ?? Are doing it alone ?? And much more ! 🥺

This Mother's Day Let's Celebrate All Moms !

For mothers who have lost a child—born or unborn ;

For mamas holding a sick child , daring to wonder how much time you have left ;

For Mother who have yearned for a child and have been unable to conceive ;

For mother who want to adopt but haven’t yet seen that dream become reality ;

For mother who needed to let someone else care for their child and had to say goodbye ;

For single moms of young kids who are too young to know how to express appreciation as she deserves ;

For those enduring the emotional and physical turmoil of fertility treatments and IVF ;

For mothers caught in a brutal custody battle :

For those who never knew their mother ;

For those who had a mother walk out on them ;

For those who have lost a mother ;

For those who are step - mothers ;

I see you this Mother’s Day . I hold your heart in mine and ask for God’s grace to find you .🥺❤️

Hopeful mothers . Burdened mothers . Accidental mothers . Bereaved mothers . Invisible mothers . Motherless mothers .  New mothers . Spiritual mothers . And all the women holding the paradox of joy and sorrow with or without your own mothers .🥺❤️🌎
