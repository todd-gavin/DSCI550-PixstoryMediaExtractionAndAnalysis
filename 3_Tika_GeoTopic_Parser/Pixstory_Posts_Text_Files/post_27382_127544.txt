The first of the two Seoul ePrix could have been the last at least for the moment for Antonio Giovinazzi in Formula E The pain in his thumb suffered following the accident with Da Costa prompted the driver from Puglia to miss the race for precautionary reasons, leaving the seat at young reserve Sacha Fenestraz Certainly not a good way to end an extremely complex season in which the former Alfa Romeo F won the unenviable record for the most races previously the record belonged to the Chinese Ma Qing Hua without being able to score points in the category electric The words of Giovinazzi himself would seem to fuel the rumors of a farewell, who published a post on his social channels that seems to be a farewell to the team but also to the same electric category with which love never blossomed. Thanks to Dragon Penske Autosport and the Formula And for this opportunity as well as all my sponsors who live my adventures with me Only one thing makes a dream impossible the fear of always putting yourself on the line Instagram photo antoniogiovinazzi
