Over the years many games have come, yet few have ever enamoured gamers as much as the Batman Arkhamverse series of video games. Appealing to both our gamer senses as well as the inner comic book and superhero lover Rocksteady was able to create the best rendition of the dark and gritty world of the Dark Knight.
No Batman game was able to do justice to the character until we got Batman: Arkham Asylum in 2009 which totally changed the face of superhero games as we now had something incorporated all the comic book elements of the series while still adding something of its own to make it not feel derivative but rather its own original piece.
From the perspective of the lore, if we look at the series from Arkham Origins to Arkham Knight and all the DLCs, then the character progression and development has been at its best. In Origins we see a young and rash Bruce Wayne who has completely given into his obsession with fighting crime, despite all his skills and intelligence is still very much green and is very much a douchebag.
However by the end of the game he evolves and learns to trust the people around him, while in Arkham Asylum (the first game in the series) we see a highly experienced Batman who is surviving what is now Joker’s death trap while steadily working his way up to unravelling and countering his arch enemy’s plan. 
In Arkham City we only see the events of Arkham Asylum on an even greater scale while Arkham Knight finishes the game on a completely solid ending.
When it comes to world building it is evident that Rocksteady poured their hearts into making it, whether it is the detailed structure of Arkham Asylum, or the vast open world of Arkham City, Origins and of course using a damn Batmobile (which is also a tank) to traverse the city in Arkham Knight. 
Aside from the highly detailed world, the gameplay and its mechanics are smoothly intertwined with the world design and really make you feel like both the protector of the night and the world’s greatest detective.
