In April tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo made the news when they came down with COVID In the months following these surprising diagnoses researchers and veterinarians found SARS CoV the virus that causes COVID in nearly a dozen other species both in captivity and in the wild How are so many animals catching the coronavirus And what does this mean for human and animal health We are veterinary researchers who investigate animal diseases including zoonotic diseases that can infect both humans and animals It is important for both human and animal health to know what species are susceptible to infection by the coronavirus Our labs and others across the world have tested domestic captive and wild animals for the virus in addition to conducting experiments to determine which species are susceptible The list of infected animals so far includes more than a dozen species But in reality infections may be much more widespread as very few species and individual animals have been tested This has real implications for human health Animals can not only spread pathogens like the coronavirus but also can be a source of new mutations Which animals have caught the coronavirus As of February researchers and veterinary diagnostic labs have confirmed that species are susceptible to SARS CoV In addition to pets and zoo animals researchers have found that a number of nonhuman primates ferrets deer mice hyenas wood rats striped skunks and red fox are among the animals that are susceptible to infection by SARS CoV White tailed deer and mink are the only two species of animals that have been found harboring the virus in the wild Fortunately most animals don t appear to experience clinical disease like humans do with the exception of mink However even animals that don t appear sick may be able to transmit the virus to each other and potentially back to people Still unanswered are many questions about which animals can contract the virus and what if anything that means for people Read more at The Conversation Image Courtesy
