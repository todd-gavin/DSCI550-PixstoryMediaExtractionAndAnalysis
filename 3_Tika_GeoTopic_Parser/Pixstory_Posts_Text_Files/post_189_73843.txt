Karnataka s government run Pre University College in Udipi has been violating Muslim students right to religious freedom by policing their autonomy in wearing a hijab by describing it as a violation of school dress codes This is another one of many instances highlighting how educational institutions are places of gender based violence and targeting controlled by Hindutva supremacy Similar instances in the past have violated Muslim students religious freedom by setting codes for a prescribed range clothing items to curb cheating prevent candidates from concealing study materials This meant that Muslim students would not be able to wear hijabs or long sleeve dresses Scroll reports If your exams are causing students to cheat fix the system instead of targeting how your students dress Why should students feel pressured to cheat in the first place These tired arguments are just masks that defend and perpetuate Islamophobia They use jargon to mask how they re violating a person s right to self determination by policing their clothing and religion
