Vagal syndrome is very disabling as it can generate syncope, i.e. sudden fainting with loss of consciousness that occurs for various causes ranging from the sight of blood to a strong emotion. they are not lethal they can represent a severe limitation of one&#39;s life Vasovagal syncope originates from an interruption of the heartbeat from a few seconds to over and seconds caused by a hyperactivity of the vagus nerve which governs one of the two systems which together with the sympathetic system innervate the heart In a normal situation, the two systems are in balance and mediate the heartbeat, increasing it in the sympathetic system or slowing it down in the vagal system When the vagus nerve is hypertonic and receives a stimulation, it prevails over the sympathetic system, causing a drop in heart rate and blood pressure. Currently, the vagal syndrome is severe in young people it can be treated with the implantation of a pacemaker which, however, is not the optimal solution explains Claudio Tondo Unfortunately, in fact, the device is destined to deteriorate over time For these young patients, cardioneuroablation is a new treatment option that arises from the experience in transcatheter ablation for the treatment of arrhythmias The same principle involves identifying the nerve stations through which the vagus nerve acts on the heart mapping and cauterizing them via catheter to reduce or eliminate the excessive action of the vagal system on the electrical activity of the heart During mapping the nerve is stimulated vagus and the stations that trigger the electrical pause are observed, then a cardiac denervation is carried out which consists in deactivating the offending stations In this way we modify the cardiac physiology without implanting a pacemaker The procedure is complex and requires vast experience and know-how of cardiac electrophysiology as well as qualified operators The results are quite promising at Monzino we treated patients and in some cases there was a significant reduction in electrical breaks with great relief for young patients who return to lead a normal life
