Antonio Rudiger might be well on his way out of Chelsea in the summer, as a move to Barcelona nears. The Catalan club's sporting directors, Mateu Alemany and Jordi CruyffÂ were captured having a meeting with the German defender's agent, Sahr Senesie on Wednesday, as reported by Sky Sports.

The sanctions imposed on Chelsea because of Roman Abrahamovic means that they cannot offer a new contract to players. The only solution to this is new ownership for the club. Since Rudiger runs out of contract in the summer, this means he can leave Chelsea on a free transfer.

Antonio Rudiger has transformed into a completely different player under Thomas Tuchel's reign, and played a huge part in his club's success in the past year. Hence, the Blues will be desperate to hold onto their star man. However, the current situation means the future of several Chelsea players remains uncertain, and Rudiger is just one of the players linked to a move to Barcelona.

Xavi has done a tremendous job so far as the manager of Barcelona, since taking over the reigns towards the end of 2021. He aspires to take Barcelona to the top of Spanish football, and make them competitive in the European arena. Rudiger is expected to thrive under Xavi's leadership, as Barcelona's playing style will very likely to suit the German defender.

As reports suggest, Barcelona are going to leave no stone unturned in their quest to sign Antonio Rudiger in the summer. Other suitors in the race remain their Spanish rivals, Real Madrid and French giants, Paris Saint Germain. Rudiger's teammates, Cesar Azpilicueta and Andreas Christensen also remain in the loop for a potential Barcelona transfer.
