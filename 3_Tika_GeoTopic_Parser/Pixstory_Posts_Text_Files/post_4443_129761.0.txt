Weekend fit? Oh yes! 😌🖤
Wore this zebra print black and white pants with Black plain crop top today. I was so dicy about the pants but i think prints are back in trend so ya why not. 🥶

Went out today at BOA village with my friends to spend my weekend and i had a great refreshing time there, 
the food was amazing and the vibe was so good. 🍨🍕🍝

What do you think about my outfit? Let me know in the notes section. 🫶

Happy weekend!!! 🌧🤍
