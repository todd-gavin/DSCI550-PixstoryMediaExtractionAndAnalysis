Hypomethylating agents HMA are currently used as a first line treatment for individuals with myelodysplastic syndrome MDS a group of conditions where there is an inadequate generation of healthy mature blood cells in the bone marrow However the exact mechanism through which HMAs work is still unknown Although this has not yet been completely proved one possible concern is that they could activate a sleeping oncogene In a recent study researchers from the National University of Singapore s NUS Cancer Science Institute of Singapore CSI Singapore in close cooperation with Boston s Brigham and Women s Hospital BWH and Harvard Medical School HMS have shown that HMAs can and do activate the oncofetal protein SALL SALL is a known oncogene and the expression of SALL has been found to contribute to the development of MDS and leukemia A study conducted by another research group in demonstrated that SALL activation in a liver cancer cell line was associated with hypomethylation and Professor Daniel Tenen from CSI Singapore and his team demonstrated in that hepatitis B virus induced SALL demethylation in liver cancer through an RNA mediated mechanism To examine possible upregulation of oncogenes in patients being treated with hypomethylating agents Professor Tenen s team collaborated with the other groups to study the association between HMA utilized and SALL activation as well as the implications on survival outcomes The research team analyzed the bone marrow samples of patients with MDS taken before and after their HMA treatment The scientists found that HMA therapy could result in the activation of the SALL oncogene leading to poor survival outcomes for patients even those in complete disease remission
