A procession the angels Our Lady of Sorrows and the risen Jesus And also the Cavalleria Rusticana with all the characters We are only at the moment preceding the parade and already the fascinating show staged in Piazza Duomo in Syracuse by Dolce Gabbana who have chosen Sicily to celebrate ten years of Haute Couture The stylists&#39; guests sitting at tables and their DG Family which has grown over the years The models parade on the catwalk and in the staircase recreated next to the Duomo, creating an enthralling effect The two stylists had promised that black would be the predominant color as promised by the tributes and tributes to Sicilian culture and to the place that is hosting them And then the gold hood is a tribute to the tabernacle of the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament in the Cathedral There are the candid white Baroque cherubs and then the friezes in Baroque style recreated with more than flowers in the silk cape There is the tribute to Saint Lucia and her virtue in silver and with a golden armor The dresses in lace and macrame There are veils but also garters and bras that can be glimpsed Tonight the DG family moves to the seaside village of Marzamemi for the presentation of the Haute Couture men&#39;s collection
