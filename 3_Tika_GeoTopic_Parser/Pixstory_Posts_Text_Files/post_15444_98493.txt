Who are the trombones Look around for sure you know some too They are the ones who take the chair Explaining what you need to do They have specializations Great talents Great skills Everything as big as the wolf in Little Red Riding Hood What a big mouth you have To eat you better Who are they the trombones Those who explain how to save the country while they are ruining it those who talk about the green revolution and make dirty deals with clean energy those who explain how to save democracy while the virostars are bringing it down after being wrong for two years everything that could be wrong they continue to explain to you what to do to avoid mistakes The industrialists who make fun of their employees the professionals of disasters the judges who break the law the smiling harassers the champions of information who hide information And then still those who fill their mouths with help to the needy and attention to others and then pocket the money intended for the poor to pay for jewels, luxury dinners and holidays in the best resorts. Mario Giordano lifts the veil on the great hypocrisies of our time and reveals all the mistakes the contradictions the blunders of the false teachers Yes because as the author tells the lie the incompetent are easy to be the experts the really dangerous ones They wear the mask of someone who knows a lot they come in disguise and float on the waves of a single thought Always the same music The march triumphal By now we&#39;re all used to playing the trumpets And that&#39;s why I feel like playing the trombones MARIO GIORDANO years as a journalist he directed Studio Aperto the Newspaper Tgcom and the Tg Dal leads Outside the Choir He wrote several books to unmask Leeches Vultures Sharks Vampires and Jackals But he never had as much fun as exposing the Trombones He has four children and has been married to the same wife for thirty years His voice is very recognizable some make fun of her others would like to silence her In these pages you will find her stronger than ever
