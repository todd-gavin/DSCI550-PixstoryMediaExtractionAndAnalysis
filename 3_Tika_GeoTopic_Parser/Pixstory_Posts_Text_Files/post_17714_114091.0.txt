A UEFA Women's EURO record crowd of 68,871 enjoyed at Old Trafford as Beth Mead's first-half sliver got hosts England off to a victorious start against Austria in Group A.

Mead pulled the decisive goal in the 16th minute for the Lionesses - dinking the ball over Austria goalkeeper Manuela Zinsberger after being picked out by Fran Kirby. It was Mead’s 15th goal in as many matches for her country.

Austria were on the back foot for much of the game but came close to an equaliser in the 78th— England goalkeeper Mary Earps doing well to keep out a swiveling effort from Barbara Dunst. 

Maybe not the powerful opening start we expected from England, but they were good value for their victory. It should have been by a larger margin as Kirby purred behind a livewire front three. Hemp grabbed the eye as anticipated and Mead was the matchwinner.

The Lionesses will be back in action against Norway on Monday when Austria will take on Northern Ireland in Group A!!
