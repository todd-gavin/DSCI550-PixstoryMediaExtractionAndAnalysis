An action-adventure game developed by 24 Entertainment and published by NetEase Games Montreal. Naraka Bladepoint is a battle royale where up to 60 players fight each and cut each other down to size, until the last man standing.

Since its launch, Naraka: Bladepoint has been consistently been updated and expanded upon, with new heroes and game modes. 24 Entertainment and NetEase have announced another addition to the package, a new map called Holoroth which will be available by August 19.

Holoroth is a diverse land which will have some new features and a bunch of new scenery with some terrifying and unforgiving terrain that will spice things up for players. Some areas of Holoroth see a lot of snowfall and this can get quite deep, slowing progress for combatants. Players will also have to watch out for overexposure to the cold, with their character needing to seek out campfires for life-giving warmth.

While in the desert, players will need to keep an eye out for disorienting sandstorms. There are also lots of new interactions with objects to incorporate into player strategies, among them various installed mechanisms, falling rocks, and creeper vines. Furthermore, new combat experiences are also prevalent.

On the floating platforms around Plumed Castle in the center of the map, players will be able to try out the new aerial combat, enabling them to leap higher across yawning chasms.

And in The City of Tang and the urban area of Mehtaab, players will find plenty of buildings to climb, where they can also hide and watch out for their enemies, perfect for switching from melee to ranged combat.

Naraka Bladepoint is available on Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Series S, Microsoft Windows.Â
