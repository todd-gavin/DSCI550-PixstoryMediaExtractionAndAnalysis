“Competition has always been my cup of tea. And to me, there is no fiercer competition than when there’s three or four people going for a rebound and you come down with it. That’s awfully satisfying to me.”

Harry Gallatin entered the Knicks in 1948, when they were still a member of the Basketball Association of America, and spent nine years with the team, making seven All-Star Game appearances before joining the Pistons in 1957-58. Gallatin, dubbed "The Horse," averaged a double-double in his final eight years in the NBA. In the Cubs and Reds organisations, he also played minor league baseball.

He fought (and won) battles under the boards with George Mikan and Dolph Schayes on a regular basis. Gallatin was a key member of three consecutive Knicks Finals teams from 1951 to 1953, losing twice to Mikan's Minneapolis Lakers and once to the Rochester Royals. In 1953-54, he had nearly a full board more rebounds per game than runner-up Mikan.

Surprisingly, Gallatin's follow-up season in 1954-55 was the only time another Knick finished second in the rebounding category, trailing Philadelphia's Neil Johnston. Willis Reed and Patrick Ewing never made the top three, while David Lee was third in 2009 (11.7), a tenth of a rebound behind Troy Murphy (and 2.1 behind Dwight Howard).

Gallatin was named into the Naismith Hall of Fame in 1991, and long-time Knicks supporters have argued that his No. 11 jersey should be displayed in the rafters alongside the rest of the franchise's luminaries. Gallatin set a single-game Knicks record with 33 rebounds against the Fort Wayne Pistons on March 15, 1953. (later matched by Willis Reed). There's also no load-management for the Horse: He also set a team record by playing in 746 consecutive games.
