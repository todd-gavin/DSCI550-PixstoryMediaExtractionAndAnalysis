The size of the largest ice comet nucleus ever seen by astronomers has been established thanks to NASA s Hubble Space Telescope NASA TV reported that it has an estimated diameter of miles making it bigger than the state of Rhode Island The nucleus of this comet is nearly times larger than the nuclei of most known comets It has a mass of trillion tonnes which is a hundred thousand times higher than that of a typical comet discovered much closer to the Sun C UN Bernardinelli Bernstein a gigantic comet from the outside of the solar system is barreling at us at miles per hour But don t be concerned It will never get closer than billion miles away from the Sun which is slightly farther than the distance of the planet Saturn And that won t be until the year This comet is literally the tip of the iceberg for many thousands of comets that are too faint to see in the more distant parts of the solar system said David Jewitt a professor of planetary science and astronomy at the University of California Los Angeles UCLA and co author of the new study in The Astrophysical Journal Letters We ve always suspected this comet had to be big because it is so bright at such a large distance Now we confirm it is
