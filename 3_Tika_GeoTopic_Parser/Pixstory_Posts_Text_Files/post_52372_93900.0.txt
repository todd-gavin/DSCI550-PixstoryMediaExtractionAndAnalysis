Jamie Lee Kah (born December 7, 1995) is a jockey from Australia. She has been the world's top-ranked female jockey since October 2020. She became the first jockey in Melbourne Metropolitan racing history to ride 100 winners in a single season in 2020/21.

Jamie Kah, the daughter of two Australian Winter Olympic speed skaters, rose to prominence as a rider in Adelaide.

She began her apprenticeship in 2011 and became the first winner at Clare in 2012. Kah had 40 winners in six months and was the first apprentice to win the Adelaide Jockeys' Premiership in nearly 20 years by the end of her first full season (2012/13)

After taking a few years off, she returned to Australia after riding for trainers such as Sir Michael Stoute and Jeremy Gask in England.

Having initially struggled on that return, she then set a record for most wins by a female jockey in an Australian season in 2016/17, ending the campaign with 129 wins.

After winning the Adelaide Jockeys' Premiership for a third time in 2017/18, she moved to Melbourne in January 2019, to further her career and landed her first G1 on Harlem in the Australian Cup at Flemington in March.
