Everon star Andros Townsend has ripped into Jurgen Klopp for always getting his way The English winger complained that Jurgen Klopp has been moaning for years which has brought about a possible new rule in the Premier League Klopp had argued to the authorities to have as many as five substitutions in a Premier League fixture something which has become a norm after the covid pandemic Although other leagues have adopted the five sub rule the Premier League withdrew the rule after the latter stages of the season Andros Townsend believes that Klopp s moaning has been unnecessary given big teams like Liverpool and Manchester City end up using just the two substitutions in crucial encounters He s been moaning for years They have been pushing back and finally they have given in and given him his five subs And he will probably still use two or three in the biggest games But hey who are we to argue with him I think in the biggest games Liverpool and City they use one or two subs They don t use the full three subs said Townsend In fact Andros Townsend went ahead and added that the teams that will be most affected by the proposed change will be the mid tier and lower ranked teams Having the liberty of using five subs per game will give managers the freedom to introduce world class players and break down the opposition I think it s the games against Crystal Palace or Brentford where they can t break teams down it s they have behind the ball Right can we bring on five world class internationals who are fresh who can change the game Can we bring them on to break down this stubborn defence And that s where I think it becomes a bit unfair he added Andros Townsend believes that this new rule will not hamper the competitiveness of the league However it will be an unfair advantage for the superior teams who have the quality on the bench The Everton star thinks Jurgen Klopp has too much power to bring out a shift in the rules after pressing for votes over the last two seasons
