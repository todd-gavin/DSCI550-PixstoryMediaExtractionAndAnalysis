Sometimes i like to read the stars and wonder what's their story? 🌟📖🔖
Sometimes i like to read the stars and wonder what's their story?⭐✨
For whom do they burn inside and shine bright on the outside?🌟
Why do they guide people
When they themselves are lost in darkness?
Why do they fall and perish
Just to fulfill someone's wish?☄️
When they know the world won't care
If one of them went missing
Why do they still appear every night?🌌
That's when I'm reminded
It's what we all do,
Not just the stars.
Why? For whom? It's a simple story.
For love❤️
From the book- Love, Hope And Magic 💕✨
