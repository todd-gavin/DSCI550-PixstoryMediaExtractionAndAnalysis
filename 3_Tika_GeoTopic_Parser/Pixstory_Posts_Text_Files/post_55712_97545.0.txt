As Samantha Maiden writes, he's the cabinet minister you've never heard of, and his annual salary is $426,619 dollars. 

However, WA MP Ken Wyatt, who gets $7109 each week as the Minister for Indigenous Australians, believes that politicians are underpaid. 

Despite the heated discussion about rising inflation and the campaign to raise the minimum wage, Mr Wyatt remains convinced that lawmakers are in need of a boost. 

Mr Wyatt stated four years ago that he didn't know how much he made, but that in order to recruit quality candidates, taxpayers would have to give MPs more money.

“I’ve thought about this, and I think we don’t pay our politicians enough,’’ he said.

“You want people who are going to go in and look after the interests of all Australians. I earned more as a public servant than as a backbencher. I look at the corporate sector and can’t see how you justify salaries of $18m,’’ he said.
