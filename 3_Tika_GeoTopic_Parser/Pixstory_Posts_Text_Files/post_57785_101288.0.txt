Rumors become trending like butter melts in the heat. Having multiple, credible resources reporting something and trusting that is better than giving into speculation and rumors running in the mill. Manchester City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan reportedly took a trip to Madrid from Manchester airport, sparking speculation about talks of a transfer since his contract ends in 2023. Sara Benamira, his newlywed wife, took to social media to specifically shut down this rumor of having travelled to Madrid, much less for talks about his football career while announcing their felicitous news of having gotten wedded recently.
