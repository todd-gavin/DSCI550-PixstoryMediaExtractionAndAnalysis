Evolution of the Tricolour - ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³

The first national flag in India is said to have been hoisted on August 7, 1906, in the Parsee Bagan Square (Green Park) in Calcutta now Kolkata. The flag was composed of three horizontal stripes of red, yellow and green.

Mrs. Cama and her band of exiled revolutionaries hoisted the second flag in Paris in 1907. This was very similar to the first flag except that the top strip had only one lotus but the Saptarishi was denoted by seven stars.

In 1917 the third flag went up as our political struggle took a definite turn. During the Home rule campaign, Dr Annie Besant and Lokmanya Tilak hoisted it. This flag was arranged alternately with five red and four green horizontal stripes, with seven stars superimposed on them in saptarishi configuration. The Union Jack stood in the top left-hand corner (the pole end). There was also a white crescent and star in one corner.

Then It consisted of two red and green colors reflecting the two main cultures, i.e. Hindus, Muslims. Gandhiji suggested the addition of a white strip to represent the remaining communities of India and the spinning wheel to symbolize the progress of the Nation.

The year 1931 was a landmark on the flag's history. It passed a resolution introducing a tricolor flag as our national flag. 

On July 22, 1947, the Constituent Assembly adopted it as Free India National Flag. After the advent of Independence, the colors and their significance remained the same. Only the Dharma Charkha of Emperor Asoka was adopted in place of the spinning wheel as the emblem on the flag. Thus, the tricolor flag of the Congress Party eventually became the tricolor flag of Independent India.ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³
