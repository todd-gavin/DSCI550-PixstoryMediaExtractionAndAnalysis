Italian manager Maurizio Sarri is keen on bring West Ham central defender Issa Diop to Lazio
this summer. With Diop being the fourth choice center back at West Ham, David Moyes is keen
to cash in on the defender.

Zouma and Dawson are ahead of Diop, with Angelo Ogbonna set to
replace him once he recovers from his knee injury. Diop, who was one of the very best central
defenders in the Premier League during his debut season has seen his form fade away over the
previous two seasons.

Sarri has guided his Lazio side to fifth in Serie A, and will look to strengthen his side for the
Europa League campaign. Given the slower and more technical focus of the Serie A, Diop might
be more suited to the league’s playing style.

Diop just featured 13 times in the Premier League
last season, making it clear that the defender's time is clearly up at the club. West Ham United
are unlikely to get the £22million they spent to sign Diop. They would be aiming for a fee
between £10million and £15million.

However, with Diop’s contract expiring next summer, they do
not have a lot of room to negotiate.

The move does present a great opportunity for Diop to find his form and turn his career around.

West Ham will be looking to bolster their squad in the transfer market after a successful
campaign - narrowly missing out on Europa League qualification and instead settling for the
European Conference League. With center back a priority for manager David Moyes, he will be
looking to shipping deadwood out before he can bring in other players.

West Ham are reportedly interested in signing centerback Joe Warral from Nottingham Forest.

However, the deal now appears to be difficult with Forest back in the Premier League.
