Forgotten Dean Henderson, the goalkeeper for Manchester United, has been linked with a transfer away from Old Trafford, with Bournemouth and Fulham both apparently keen.

After impressing at Bramall Lane, the former Sheffield United loanee was expected to challenge David de Gea for the number one spot at Manchester United. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer gave the 25-year-old 26 starts last season, but he has failed to capitalize on those opportunities this season.

He's only played three times in all competitions, the most recent of which being a stunning FA Cup defeat to Championship side Middlesbrough in February. Due to the scarcity of opportunities, Henderson was anticipated to hunt for a way out of Old Trafford.

According to The Sun, Fulham and Bournemouth are both interested in signing Henderson on loan, something the Red Devils may help accomplish. According to rumors, if Henderson seeks a temporary move, United would be willing to pay at least half of his present salary.

However, it is believed that the Red Devils are not yet ready to sell the goalkeeper, albeit an impressive loan spell away from Old Trafford might compel them to rethink. Should a deal be completed, he might be in line to start for either Fulham or Bournemouth.

Henderson has previously confessed that he is disappointed at not being able to prove himself in front of the Man Utd fans on a regular basis, despite the interest in his services. "I adore playing in front of the supporters," he told the club's official website earlier this year.

"I've always created strong ties with them wherever I've gone because I believe they can assist on a Saturday as much as we can help each other." I believe they have the potential to become the 12th guy.

"Unfortunately, because we had COVID last year, I haven't yet got the opportunity here [in the Premier League at Old Trafford]." It's been a pity, and it's something that continues to bother me.
