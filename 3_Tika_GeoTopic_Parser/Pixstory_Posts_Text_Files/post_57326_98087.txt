The most fathomable thing about pain is that only the sufferer can understand it well and to understand pain one has to endure it But nevertheless it is a part of their memory for those who have been bearing it all their lives The myriads of change have happened to medical science in the past few decades but none of it has made it easier to allay chronic pain It remains poorly treated and people have a long history of suffering The painkillers used to avoid or alleviate the pain sometimes are not beneficial for chronic pain Hence there is also a deep rooted relationship between pain and memory Human beings tend to memorise pain making it chronic Furthermore our brains tend to remember the worst pain spikes more deeply than the moments of relief thus our memory always recounts it negatively This whole phenomenon of memorising turns acute pain into chronic pain This is the work of PKMzeta a molecule that helps us remember chronic pain An experiment shows how the increasing PKMzeta was hindered by injecting ZIP a substance that blocks the work of PKMzeta in a nice who had a nerve injury as soon as ZIP was injected mice lost their ability to remember the pain hence giving it a relief Many other instances show that reducing memorisation can overcome chronic pain To reduce pain it is essential to understand it and medical science should do it to treat the patients adequately
