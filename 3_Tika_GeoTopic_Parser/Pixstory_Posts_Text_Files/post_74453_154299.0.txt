Megastar’ Chiranjeevi-starrer GodFather has crossed the Rs 100 crore mark at the worldwide box office.✅💯God Father which opened with very good word of mouth and excellent ratings has performed below par during its first weekend. 💯The film opened with poor openings on Day 1 and continued the same during the weekend. The film has collected a share of 45Crs during its 1st weekend (5 Days) whereas the theatrical rights are valued at 80Crs👍. The film needs to have a very good long run to minimize the losses. The Twitter handle of Konidela Production Company posted, “Megastar @KChiruTweets’s domination at the Box Office 🔥. HUMONGOUS BLOCKBUSTER #GodFather crosses 100 CR gross and going strong❤️‍🔥.”
