The pullout from Patrolling Point (PP) 15 in the Gogra-Hot Springs region of Eastern Ladakh was officially completed on Tuesday, according to reports, after verification by India and China.
The troops on both sides have returned to their respective areas after a staged, coordinated, and verified pullout at PP15, according to a defence source. Another source claimed that verification was done to guarantee compliance, including aerial monitoring.
The disengagement's specifics and procedures, however, were not made public. Previously, buffer zones were established at the points of friction in accordance with the understanding at the Corps Commander level. Until overall disengagement and de-escalation was achieved, neither side was to conduct any patrolling; instead, new patrolling guidelines were to be developed by the two sides.
As was previously reported, since the start of the standoff, Chinese forces have been heavily present in the Depsang plains, particularly in a key region known as the Bulge. In addition, PLA soldiers have been preventing Indian Army patrols from reaching the PPs 10, 11, 11A, 12, and 13, which are situated on the Limit of Patrolling, which is located much before the LAC. Senior officials told The Hindu that the Indian Army last accessed the PPs in Depsang in January or February 2020.
Chinese troops are getting closer to the vital 255 km Darbuk-Skyok-DBO road, which is a threat to Indian positions at Burtse and Raki Nala, which are both inside Indian territory, as well as Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO). Depsang is very near to the Karakoram pass and has a crucial view of the Siachen glacier and Saltoro ridge.
