Twelve children in the age group of 45 days to 7 years died in Jammu’s Ramnagar area allegedly due to consumption of a highly contaminated cough syrup in the months of December 2019 and January 2020. Some of them died at home, some in hospitals in Udhampur, Jammu and Chandigarh.

Even as out of harsh orders from the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), the Union Territory administration has paid an amount of Rs 36 lakh – at Rs 3 lakh to each victim’s family – a long-drawn legal battle claiming compensation to the sufferers from the manufacturer on the pattern of the Bhopal gas tragedy is still underway. As of now, all the accused are out on bail, and none of them have been penalised in the last two years.

The punishment for manufacturing or trading spurious drugs that can cause death includes 10 years to life imprisonment and a fine to the tune of Rs 10 lakh or three times the value of the drugs confiscated, according to the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.


Jammu-based social activist Sukesh Khajuria, who pursued the infants’ case at the NHRC, says: “In all such deaths, punishment and compensation should be on the pattern of the tragedies of the Bhopal gas leak and the Uphaar Cinema blaze. We can’t fix the price of human life at Rs 25-30 lakh in Delhi and Rs 3 lakh in J&K.”
In January 2020, some publications of insignificant circulation carried stories on the death of the 12 infants. Ramnagar falls in the Lok Sabha and Assembly constituencies of the BJP’s powerful politicians. A public relations exercise is afoot to suppress or underplay reports that the infants – from the extremely poor families – had died due to consumption of the contaminated cough syrup or criminal negligence of the authorities. The story did not appear in major newspapers either.
