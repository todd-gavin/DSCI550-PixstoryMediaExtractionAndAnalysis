Get outside! Learn about all the nooks and crannies that the locals are already familiar with. Spend every day of your trip travelling by bus or car to a different neighbourhood and then walking, walking, walking.
I also like to pick up a tourist guide to make sure I've seen all the important sights in the area. It's great to go see grand places with a guide but in order to truly understand a place, you need to have explored it, become disoriented, and then figured out how to return home.
Participate in community activities like local softball, charity, or your religion. It will help you be understanding of the new place and culture and help you get rid of the habit to whine about everything.
