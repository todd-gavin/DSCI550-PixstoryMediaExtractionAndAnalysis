Arsenal Football Club has announced that nine players - five from their men's teams and four
from the Women's Super League side are set to leave the side this summer after their contract
expires. However, they have signaled their desire to offer Nketiah a contract extension to keep
him at the club for a further five years.

Arsenal announced that there were five players on the men’s team who were out of contract this
summer - including striker Eddie Nketiah.

However, the club was keen to point out that they had
begun negotiating a contract with him to keep him onboard subsequently. The new deal is
reported to be £100k/week for the English striker. So far Arsenal have released Alex Lacazette,
Eddie Nketiah, Jonathan Dinzeyi, Joel Lopez and Jordan McEneff from the men’s team and Lisa
Evans, Tobin Heath, Viktoria Schnaderbeck and have offered a contract to Lydia Williams.

On Eddie Nketiah’s form towards the end of the season, Arteta had to say, “He’s doing what
he’s done all season – when he’s been on the bench, sitting at home or on the pitch, This boy
doesn’t change, that’s why we absolutely adore him and he deserves what is happening to him.”

Arsenal other’s senior striker, Alexandre Lacazette has resigned with former club Lyon after
ending his contract and leaving the club.

Speaking at his Lyon unveiling this week, Lacazette explained why he has returned to his former
club despite being offered lower wages.

“My love for the club was enough (for me to take a pay cut),” he said. “It was difficult to follow
Lyon from a distance last season and not be able to help them. I hope that this period is over
and we can refind a strong Lyon. The objective is certainly to help the club get back to the top,
and achieve a European qualification.”
