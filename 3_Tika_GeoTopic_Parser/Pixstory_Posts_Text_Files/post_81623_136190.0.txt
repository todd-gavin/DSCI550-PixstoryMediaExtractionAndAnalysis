Robin van Persie was one of the highest-rated strikers of the previous generation. He started his career at Feyenoord, making his senior debut in 2001-02. In 2004, He joined Arsenal after a falling out with his manager. He had made 78 appearances for Feyenoord, scoring 21 goals. Wenger wanted to convert van Persie into a striker at Arsenal, as he did with Thierry Henry. His first season at Arsenal was mostly spent on the bench and marred by injuries. However, he did come on in the FA Cup final against Manchester United and convert his penalty in the shoutout. In 2007, Thierry Henry departed for Barcelona, leaving van Persie to take the limelight as Arsenal’s primary striker. In 2008-09, a stellar campaign including 11 goals and 11 assists in the Premier League saw him named the Arsenal Player of the Season. In the 2010-11 season, he became only the fourth Dutchman to score 50 goals in the Premier League. It was in the Champions League semi-final of this season that he was sent off against Barcelona for ‘time-wasting’ after failing to hear the referee’s whistle. Van Persie was promoted to club captain in 2011-12, which turned out to be his final one for the Gunners. He scored 35 Premier League goals in 2011, narrowly missing out on beating Alan Shearer’s record of 36. He also became the first player to score against 17 of the 20 league teams since Ian Wright. His 30 goals won him the Premier League golden boot. In August 2012, he secured a move to Manchester United. An extraordinary season at United helped them secure their 20th league title with 4 games to spare. He scored a hat trick in the title-winning game, including a supreme volley from outside the box. He won the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year in 2013. After two subsequent seasons plagued by injuries, he was sold to Fenerbahce in 2015. In January 2018, he returned to his boyhood club of Feyenoord, where he scored his 300th career goal. Van Persie retired at the end of the 2018-19 season and is currently assistant manager at the club.
