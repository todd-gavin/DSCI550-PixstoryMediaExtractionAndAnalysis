Newcastle United are set to splash a club record fee for the acquisition of Alexander Isak from Real Sociedad in a £63 million deal. 

Having agreed a deal to sign the Swedish striker as reported by The Athletic, the magpies will potentially pay a fee that exceed the £40 million paid for Joelinton in 2019, making Isak the club most expensive signing. 

Newcastle United have long admired the 22-year-old but with the injury blow suffered by their frontman Callum Wilson in their six-goal thriller draw against Manchester City during the weekend, they have now intensified effort in the pursuit to land the erstwhile Dortmund forward. 

Alexander Isak who arrived the Spanish side from Borussia Dortmund three years ago has scored 44 goals in 132 appearances. He has also been capped 37 times by the Swedish national team notching nine goals in the process. 

The transfer negotiation with Real Sociedad includes a wage in the region of £120,000 a-week should Isak join the Saudi-Arabian owned team.

Alexander Isak will however become manager Eddie Howe’s fourth signing this summer after Nick Pope, Sven Batman and Matt Target arrival from Burnley, Lille and Aston Villa respectively.
