Dr. Shashi Tharoor, Congress legislator, former Union Minister and UN diplomat is yet to his due from his party. 

Most of his party men in his home state can't even accept is stature. However, Shashi Tharoor seems to be getting all the recognition outside India. The French government is honouring him with its highest honour, ‘Chevalier de la Legion d’Honneur’, for his writings and speeches. The French Ambassador in New Delhi has written to Tharoor, informing him about the honour, which will be conferred on him during the next visit of any minister of the French government to India. Last year, Tharoor had surprised the officials of the Embassy, Consulates, Alliance Francaise and military attaches by delivering a speech in French. Interestingly, Tharoor had received a similar honour from the Spanish government in 2010 when the King of Spain had bestowed upon him the ‘Encomienda de la Real Order Espanola de Carlos III’.

Tharoor expressed his gratitude. "As one who cherishes our relations with France, loves the language and admires the culture, I am honoured to be recognized in this way. My gratitude & appreciation to those who have seen fit to award me this distinction"
