The Spain-born star possesses an eye for gold as he made cheeky passes the ball into the penalty box and he cheekily sets up his teammates by passing them to create goal scoring opportunities.

From the visualization we can see that the Serb ranks in the top quartile in Passes made to 6 yard box and key Passes made, while Rabiot,whom we’re linked with ranks in the third quartile. He ranks 90 percentile and 88 percentile respectively in PPB and Key Passes. Having made 1.52 and 1.44 passes per 90 respectively. 


Comparing him with Europe’s top 5 League, we can see that he ranks 98 percentile in touches in penalty box, progressive passes received. The numbers don’t lie, the Serb can operate as aggressive attacking midfielder despite playing with his role in a three.

He received 203 progressive passes, only behind Ciro Immobile who has received the most with 281 in Lazio’s team.


Chances Created ?


The Serb has created chances while taking a shot, and if a keeper seem to have to have saved it and the ball to his face, he took another shot instead of searching for space. He ranks 96 percentile in it. He ranks 92 percentile while creating goal chances, if the ball is at his feet he’ll take a shot or score a goal. 

We can see that he ranks in the visualization he ranks in the top quartile, while again Rabiot falls into the 3rd quartile in chances created.


Beast while Scoring Goals 


The Serb clearly possesses an eye for goal as in 3 seasons between 2017/18 and 19/20 he scored 24 goals and last season he scored 11 goals. He is clearly a fox in the box. Out of 24 goals he scored between 17-20 he scored no penalty with 10 of those goals came outside the box.


This season, he ranks 98 percentile in non-penalty xG,shots taken and an inch perfect score on shots which were on target with 99 percentile.

The 6ft 3 inches Serb had taken a total of 75 shots out of which 31 were on target. He had been scoring at every 283 minute
