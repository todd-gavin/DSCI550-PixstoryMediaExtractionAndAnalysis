WHO epidemiologist and technical lead on Covid-19 Dr Maria Van Kerkhove has warned that the next variant will be more transmissible, and perhaps, more deadly than its predecessors have warned that the next Covid-19 variant will be more transmissible, and perhaps, more deadly than its predecessors.

In a recent press briefing, World Health Organization (WHO) epidemiologist and technical lead on Covid-19 Dr Maria Van Kerkhove stressed that the pandemic is far from over and future variants will be in some way more virulent than Omicron is now.

“The next variant of concern will be more fit, and what we mean by that is it will be more transmissible because it will have to overtake what is currently circulating. The big question is whether or not future variants will be more or less severe,” Dr Van Kerkhove said.

She further warned that the next variant could more easily evade immunity, rendering vaccines less effective. However, she doubled down on the imperativeness of getting the jab as it protects against severe illness and death, as exhibited during the Omicron wave.
