The Nainital Lake which is surrounded by mountain ranges and little houses appears magical and the town of Nainital which is encircled by seven majestic hills is one of the most loved and cherished by countless tourists and locals Though my personal favourite activity is boating on Naini Lake the experience is one to remember especially in the early and late afternoon And a walk along the Mall Road or across the street to the Thandi Sarak or a religious visit to the Naina Devi Temple or a leisurely stroll through The Flattish are all worth having activities The Lake is located in the centre of Nainital and is a popular picnic spot for residents and visitors from Delhi It is one of the must see attractions in Nainital during your summer holiday When the sparkling water flirts with the night sky lit by millions of shining stars the beauty and exquisiteness of this natural freshwater body is enhanced The atmosphere around Nainital Lake at night is simply wonderful
