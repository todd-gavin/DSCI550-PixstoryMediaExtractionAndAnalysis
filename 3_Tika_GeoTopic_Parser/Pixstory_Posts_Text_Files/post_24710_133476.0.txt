Arsenal could stay on top till September end
Enjoying a top spot after 3 on 3 wins, they will face Fulham, Aston Villa and Manchester United in the upcoming fixtures. Arsenal started the season with three straight league wins for the first time since 2004. 
Mikel Arteta is showing his class with flow less attack and coordinated moves, using Odegaard, Saka, Jesus like players. They are now on top with 9 points from 3 matches. Only Arsenal managed to win all three opening matches this season. Manchester City, Leeds United, Tottenham Hotspur and Brighton are in the following positions with 2 wins each. In a thrilling match, Newcastle held them for a 3-3 draw. 
Gunners were at the bottom of the table in the last season, after the first three matches. Their Fulham tie on Saturday will also mark Mikel Arteta's 100th match as Arsenal manager. Arsenal have lost none of their 30 home meetings with Fulham in all competitions (W24 D6). But, Fulham are a different side this season, with Mitrovic on fire, scoring in all three of their opening matches. Fulham remain unbeaten in this season’s Premier League (P3 W1 D2 L0); in their top-flight history, only in 2010-11 have they avoided defeat in their opening four matches of a campaign. Arsenal fans are much more confident and proud about their team after a long time.
