We grew up learning things and their genders. Pink is for girls and blue is for boys. Cars are for boys and barbie dolls are for girls. Boys are gifted video games and girls are gifted kitchen sets?

Men can’t have long hair because women have long hair. Seriously?  Something like hair ? 
 It’s high time we stop gendering simple things that all the genders in the world can simply enjoy. 

It’s time we quit assigning genders to things like:

• Colours :-  It is totally unnecessary and outdated to assume that pink is for girls and blue is for boys. What about the other genders ? And why can’t men wear pink? It is as absurd as it sounds.
 STOP GENDERING!!! 
•Makeup:- LITERALLY ANYONE CAN WEAR MAKEUP!
Makeup makes some people feel confident and pretty so it should be for everyone. Some people feel comfortable , confident and beautiful without it, which is also completely fine.
Let’s stop gendering:
• Hairstyles:- long hair , short hair , braided hair , no hair , straight hair ,curly hair ,dyed hair, IT’S ALL GENDERLESS!
•Movies and shows:- You’re a girl and you like superhero movies? Please just stop. Who decided that what men and women love to watch? Who gendered something that can be enjoyed by anyone. Men can watch romantic movies, chick flicks and Disney movies if they want to and women can enjoy action and superhero movies if they want to. MOVIES AND SHOWS ARE MADE FOR EVERYONE!
•Periods and pregnancy:- Trans , non – binary and gender non-conforming people all can experience periods and and pregnancy. Not just CIS women.
Please stop gendering:
•Clothing:- Men can wear skirts if they want to , women can wear a suit if they want to! A PIECE OF FABRIC CANNOT DECIDE ANYONE’S GENDER. A PIECE OF CLOTH DOES NOT HAVE A GENDER.
Also stop gendering:
•Body parts:- GENDER AND SEX ARE NOT THE SAME THING! Sex refers to our anatomical and biological characteristics and is assigned by birth. Gender identity refers to a person’s deep held sense of their gender. 
BODY PARTS DON’T DEFINE OUR GENDERS WE DO!
