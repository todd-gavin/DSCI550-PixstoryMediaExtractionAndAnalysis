In the Tajganj neighbourhood of Agra, a 30-year-old blogger was allegedly thrown from the fourth-floor balcony of her apartment with her hands bound. After divorcing her spouse, the woman was living with a Facebook buddy in a live-in relationship. 
Ritika Singh, an influencer with more than 44,000 Instagram followers, was named as the victim. She used to share advice on travel, food, and fashion. 
Around 11 am, the event happened at the Om Shree residence in the Nagla Mewati neighbourhood. At the time, her companion was also at home.

Police have also detained two other people in addition to the victim's estranged husband.
