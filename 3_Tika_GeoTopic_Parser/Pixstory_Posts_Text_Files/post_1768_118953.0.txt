This seems to be the street in Chandni Chowk heading towards the town hall and the Northbrook Clocktower, which was built in 1870. 

The chap in dhoti and Gandhi cap should be noticed. And the horse drawn Tonga. And the people passing through on their bicycles. 

The tri-colour fluttering on top of the clocktower, stands out. 

Given that the clocktower was demolished in 1950, or not rebuilt, the picture seems to be from 1947-49. 

How clean and orderly the street looks!
