Ødegaard looks to have been given the responsibility of holding down the left side of midfield today for Arsenal vs FK Bodø/Glimt.
Going forward, in my opinion this is going to be the long term position for him. Given how we have 2 right sided central midfielders that excel further up the pitch and can be extremely direct in their play, this should indicate a switch in dynamics to where the left side is more involved with progressing from deep and assisting in build up play.
I'm extremely interested to see how Mikel lines our midfield up. Could Viera play on the left? Of course. That keeps the dynamics the same as we have with Xhaka. Or this could be a sign of things to come.
Very interesting game.
