Tennis is staring at a crisis. 
The sport is exciting only when there are big rivalries: Borg-McEnroe, Becker-Edberg, Sampras-Agassi, Federer-Nadal, Djokovic-Commonsense. 
The Big 3 are now in the sunset years of their careers. Federer is 40 and out of action for months. Nadal and Djokovic are both 35, the first hobbled with injuries and the other with anti-vaccine stupidity. With no one else on the circuit worth mentioning, what comes next for fans?
Enter Alcaraz. The pimply 19 year old has re-energised the tennis world with his impeccable performances this year. He's steamrolled every one in the top 10, winning 4 tournaments already in 2022. 
Will he be the saviour that tennis fans have been looking for? French Open will be the first big test.
