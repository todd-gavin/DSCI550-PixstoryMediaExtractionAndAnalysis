Al-Muftah, Qatar’s ambassador to the United Nations recently deleted her Twitter account, after her homophobic, antisemitic tweets came to the light.
UN WATCH expressed their grave concern to UN Human Rights Council President Federico Villegas regarding Muftah's nomination for UN Forum on Human Rights, Democracy, and the Rule of Law.
Muftah, has been spreading hatred against LGBTQI+ folks and racist stereotypes about Jewish people for years now. She called upon God to curse gay people and has asserted that gay rights are not human rights. 
In another of her tweets, she responded to UN advocating rights of LGBTQ Africans by writing, “Stay away from the Middle East and Arab countries, keep your rights for your people.”
Although, UN forum seat went to Patricia Hermanns of the Bahamas, the incident highlights continued shallowness — Qatar will be hosting the FIFA world cup, and LGBTQI+ folks have been raising concerns regarding their safety, which continues to be dismissed.
