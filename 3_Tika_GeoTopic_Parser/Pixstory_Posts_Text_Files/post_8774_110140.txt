My Years in the Supreme Court continues I had a private interview with Sardar Patel during his Hyderabad visit and discussed with him a certain matter that had come to my notice during my stay there The Sardar addressed a public meeting and in spite of his bad health he went on speaking for about an hour and a half He gave a good and straight talk to the communal minded people of the State His visit had a healthy effect on the people and the administration The effect of speaking for a long time was injurious to his health and he had to lie in bed for some time to recoup I enjoyed a number of parties at Mr Vellodi s place and visited the palaces of the Nizam Some of them are places of beauty I also visited an Ashram built by the Arya Samaj in the suburbs of Hyderabad where it is also running a school I would also like to mention a very interesting person that I met in the Secunderabad Club The Secretary of the Club was one Major Panquilien He was a retired officer of the Indian Army and I was surprised to find him talking Punjabi as if he was a born Punjabi If some Englishmen could learn our languages so efficiently and master them to perfection why do we raise so many questions about the multiplicity of languages in India Today we continue fighting about the different languages that are spoken in different parts of the country and feel it a burden if we are asked to learn a language we do not think our own Linguistic fanaticism in our country is on the increase and the sooner it is put a stop to the better would it be for the solidarity and unity of our motherland The Major was a good tennis player and I enjoyed a number of games with him He also managed very efficiently a dinner party on my behalf in the Secunderabad Club To be continued
