The transfer window is all set to begin in Europe. The teams have already had their share of
exits and are charting out their needs for the upcoming season. On the other hand, few players
are in the search of greener pastures elsewhere. Top-quality players are commanding a
premium from the clubs whereas the agents are busy in brokering the move for less favored
players.

Heading into the summer transfer window, many players are not happy with their current
employer and have had their contracts expire.

In this article, we shall look at the best free-agent
XI available in European football.

Goalkeeper:

Lorius Karius (GK)

The forgotten shot-stopper of Liverpool, Lorius Karius is one of the few free-agent goalkeepers
available for the clubs to lay their hands upon.

After the fiasco in the UEFA Champions League
2018 finals, the club sent him on multiple loan spells as they found a better shot-stopper in
Alisson. Karius’ last loan spell was in Germany and will look to move back permanently to his
country.

Defenders:

Dani Alves

The Barcelona man had almost left football but joined Barcelona back as his former teammate
Xavi wanted him back at Camp Nou. However, the fullback’s contract has expired and is again a
free agent. With the club being in financial difficulty, he might not be re-signed by Xavi.

Dan-Axel Zagadou

One of the most renowned players in the FIFA game circuit, Dan-Axel Zagadou is set to leave
Borussia Dortmund as a free agent. After featuring over 67 games for Borussia
Dortmund, the
player is set to depart from the elite club. Multiple suitors are interested in acquiring his services
once the transfer window commences.
