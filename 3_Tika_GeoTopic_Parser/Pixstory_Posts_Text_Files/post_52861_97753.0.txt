Music heals me, inspires me, bims light within me. 
I was going through Spotify yesterday, searched for a song "GET FREE" and landed up on a playlist after my search "Thank you for being my bff" It consists of the most beautiful and heartfelt songs. I thank my stars for dropping it down unexpectedly. 
After listening to couple of songs I wondered if I am a good friend. Do I really care? 
Yes, I do. That's the least that I can do after being kind. 
Then I texted my friends and had a healthy  conversation. 


 Life gets hard. We get busier. But I hope we are able to take out time once in a month for the people who keep us going. We might not know their value at the moment but remember, everyone who you meet influences your life a bit. So be grateful for the people who wish nothing but the best for you✨❤

Dedicating songs is my love language 👀💗
