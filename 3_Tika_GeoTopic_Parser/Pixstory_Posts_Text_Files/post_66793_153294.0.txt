According to the latest Wrestling Observer Newsletter, there are talents who are quite unhappy with Andrade for making the company look bad after they worked hard over the last month to repair the damage done from the Punk/Elite drama. It is added that Andrade was aware of these things yet still chose to fight Guevara.
Some sources tell the publication that the belief is that Andrade was trying to get fired so he can return to WWE, but that is just hearsay at the moment. Top AEW superstar Chris Jericho pushed that Guevara should not be punished since he did not throw a punch in retaliation.
The Observer ends the report by stating how poor of a look this is for AEW, and how AEW President Tony Khan needs to put his foot down harder to avoid these situations from happening
