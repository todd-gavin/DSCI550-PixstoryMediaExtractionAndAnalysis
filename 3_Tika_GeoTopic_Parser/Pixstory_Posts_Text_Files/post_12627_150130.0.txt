 👉Ask your child how they feel.

🫰Try to send the message that your child can talk with you about feeling distressed, that it is normal to feel 
some stress even after the event has passed, and that it is a good idea to speak with you about it.

👉Initially, there may be increased anxiety in general, or in situations that were previously thought of as safe.

🫰This is normal. This anxiety is expected to get better over the course of a few months (not necessarily 
immediately).

🫰If it does not subside, or if it gets worse after a month, intervention / essurance may be needed.

👉Adjustment after the event may include addressing the feeling that the world is less safe.

🫰The event may lead to a re-evaluation of safety; the task is to arrive at a new understanding of safety.

🫰Sometimes, this process gets derailed and the child’s feelings that she or he are not safe turn into persistent distress, an anxiety disorder, a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other reactions. 

🫰Those are best managed with the help of a mental health professional.

👉Relaxation techniques, cognitive-behavioral therapy, supportive therapy, and psychiatric medications are all 
options that would work for specific types of symptoms in specific instances.

🫰The preference should be for short-term, targeted interventions, unless a chronic mental health condition is diagnosed in addition to a specific response to an event.
