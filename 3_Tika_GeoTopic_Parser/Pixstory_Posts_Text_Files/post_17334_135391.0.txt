Lionel Messi is expected to start when Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) travel to face Toulouse in Ligue 1 on Wednesday, August 31, in Ligue 1. The Parisian giants will want to return to winning ways following a 1-1 draw against AS Monaco last time around in the league.
Messi had a decent outing against AS Monaco. The seven-time Ballon d'Or nearly scored a wonderful goal from outside the box. However, his shot cannoned off the post. PSG needed a Neymar penalty to equalize and salvage a point against the team from the principality.
Messi has been in some good form lately and is therefore expected to be named in the starting XI by manager Christophe Galtier. Barring any last-minute injury, the Argentine forward should start alongside Neymar and Kylian Mbappe in attack.
PSG have one absentee in attack. According to the club's medical report, Pablo Sarabia is out due to a foot injury. Sarabia replaced Lionel Messi for the final three minutes of the game during their 1-1 draw against AS Monaco.
The French champions' attack has been lethal in the opening four matches of the new Ligue 1 season. The Parisian giants have netted 18 goals from their first four games. Neymar has scored six goals while Mbappe has chipped in with four.
Due to their superior goal difference, PSG are currently top of the Ligue 1 charts, having picked up 10 points from their opening four games.
Toulouse, on the other hand, are languishing in 10th place. They come into the game on the back of a 3-1 defeat at the hands of Nantes last time around.
It is worth mentioning Toulouse are a newly-promoted side in Ligue 1 this season. They won promotion after winning the Ligue 2 title last season.
