Undrape you are not guilty to me nor stale nor discarded I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no And am around tenacious acquisitive tireless and cannot be shaken away The little one sleeps in its cradle I lift the gauze and look a long time and silently brush away flies with my hand The youngster and the red faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill I peeringly view them from the top The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair I note where the pistol has fallen The blab of the pave tires of carts sluff of boot soles talk of the promenaders The heavy omnibus the driver with his interrogating thumb the clank of the shod horses on the granite floor The snow sleighs clinking shouted jokes pelts of snow balls The hurrahs for popular favorites the fury of rous d mobs The flap of the curtain d litter a sick man inside borne to the hospital The meeting of enemies the sudden oath the blows and fall The excited crowd the policeman with his star quickly working his passage to the centre of the crowd The impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes Walt Whitman
