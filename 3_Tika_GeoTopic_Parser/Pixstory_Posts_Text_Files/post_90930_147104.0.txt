All that the world needs is peace and harmony, here are the inspirational and warm quotes about peace and love. The theme for the International Day of Peace this year is "Shaping Peace Together." The barriers to peace are complex and steep -- no one country can solve them alone. We must all renew our commitment to global solidarity. To sustain peace, we must build it every day, in every society
"Peace is a daily, a weekly, a monthly process, gradually changing opinions, slowly eroding old barriers, quietly building new structures"
