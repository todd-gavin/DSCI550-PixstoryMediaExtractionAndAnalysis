After a stupendous season with Real Madrid while securing the LaLiga and Champions League with the Nations League, French striker Karim Benzema was awarded the 66th Ballon D'Or. 
Born in the French city of Lyon to Algerian parents, Karim Benzema grew in the council-estates where chances were had to come by and an impoverished life was led by its inhabitants. Like Zinedine Zidane, BenzemaÂ  also had to brave all the odds and start playing football, to grow up both as an individual and to support his family. 
Nicknamed Coco by his teammates, Karim Benzema first attracted attention after scoring a brace against U-10 Lyon youth academy with his first club, Born Terraillon SC. 
It was not long before Lyon came calling on his door and inducted him to their ranks. Karim Benzema made the headlines everyday after exemplary performances with the senior team and steered Lyon to three consecutive league titles during his time at the club.
His performances in France were so eye-catching that Real Madrid president, Florentino Perez himself came knocking on Benzema's door. 
Since his inception at the steps of the Santiago BernabÃ©u, the kid with a dream never had to look back. Season after season, he contributed extensively to Real Madrid's success, bonded well with Cristiano Ronaldo and played a vital role in contributing to the record of the Portuguese legend.
After Ronaldo left Madrid, it was Benzema who took the responsibility to steer Real Madrid to success and finally after years of hard work, patience and perseverance, Karim Benzema has made his dream, a reality. 
FÃ©licitations Karim ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·!
