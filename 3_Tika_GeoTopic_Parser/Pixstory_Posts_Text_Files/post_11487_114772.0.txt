These are the best combination ever.On one hand, apples are a fiber-rich fruit. On the other hand, peanuts provide healthy fats, plant-based protein, and fiber, pretty much all of the filling nutrients you should look for in a snack.

👉Cottage cheese and fruit
The combination is exceptionally good when combining the cheese with tropical fruits such as pineapple, papaya, or watermelon.

👉Pairing cottage cheese with fruit complements the cheese’s protein and fat content with the fruit’s fiber, resulting in a sweet, creamy, and filling snack.
