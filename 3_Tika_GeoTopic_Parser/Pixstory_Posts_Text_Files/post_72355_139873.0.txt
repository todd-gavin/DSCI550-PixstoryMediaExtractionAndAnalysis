During an Instagram Live session with Indian football superstar Sunil Chhetri, 'Arsenal fan' Ranveer Singh talked about his love for The Gunners and club legend Thierry Henry.

Chhetri and Ranveer spoke at length about the beautiful game and the latter's love for English Premier League (EPL) giants Arsenal. Founded in October 1886, football club Arsenal is one of the most successful sides in the history of English top-flight with 13 Premier League titles, two league cups and a record 13 Football Associations (FA) Cup wins. 

Chhetri, who is India's record-goal scorer on the international arena, asked Ranveer to share his first meeting with Arsenal legend Thierry Henry as well. Ranveer told Chhetri how his meeting with Arsenal club legend Henry in Mumbai changed his life. The Bollywood actor hailed Henry's style and swagger of playing the beautiful game during his stint at Arsenal. Ranveer also admitted that he got emotional when he met the 1998 World Cup winner with France in Mumbai a couple of years ago.  

"The fan and celebrity dynamic was never the same after my meeting with Henry," Ranveer told Chhetri. Widely regarded as one of the greatest strikers of all time, former Arsenal and FC Barcelona star Henry is often considered as the greatest player in the history of the Premier League.
