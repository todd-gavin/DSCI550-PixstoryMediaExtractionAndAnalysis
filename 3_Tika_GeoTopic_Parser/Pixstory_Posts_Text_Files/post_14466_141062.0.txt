Eating and exercising go hand in hand.
Consider these eating and exercise tips.
👉Eat a healthy breakfast.
Be well fueled going into a workout. Studies suggest that eating or drinking carbohydrates before exercise can improve workout performance and may allow you to work out for a longer time or at a higher intensity. 
👉Understand the connection between when to eat and exercise.
If you plan to exercise within an hour after breakfast, eat a light breakfast or drink something such as a sports drink. Focus on carbohydrates for maximum energy.
👉Watch the portion size.
🌟Large meals-  Eat these at least 3 to 4 hours before exercising.
🌟Small meals or snacks-  Eat these about 1 to 3 hours before exercising.
👉Snack well
Snacks eaten soon before exercise probably won't give you added energy if your workout lasts less than 60 minutes, but they may prevent distracting hunger pangs. If your workout is longer than 60 minutes, you may benefit by including a carbohydrate-rich food or beverage.
👉Eat after you exercise
Consider a snack if your meal is more than two hours away. Good post-workout food choices include Yogurts and fruits, Peanut Butter Sandwich, Low Fat Chocolate Milk.
👉Drink up
Don't forget to drink fluids. You need adequate fluids before, during and after exercise to help prevent dehydration.
