One of the reasons I am so passionate about PixStory is the fact that there is no room for this type of bullying even for an Olympic super star like Mikaela Shiffrin The poise and grace that she demonstrated on social media makes me admire her even more I whole heartedly agree that it s ok to fail That s one of the hardest life lessons to learn as an athlete and as a human being To those haters sending these horrible and cowardly messages to anyone especially to one of the most decorated athletes in the world I say this unless you have participated in an event like the Olympics you have no right to judge Mikaela I invite Mikaela to engage on PixStory where you will be received with nothing but love support and being treated like the true hero you are to the millions of young girls who want to be like you one day
