Eva Mercy is a single mom and bestselling erotica writer who is feeling pressed from all sides. Shane Hall is a reclusive, enigmatic, award-winning novelist, who, to everyone's surprise, shows up in New York. When Shane and Eva meet unexpectedly at a literary event, sparks fly, raising not only their buried traumas, but the eyebrows of the Black literati. What no one knows is that fifteen years earlier, teenage Eva and Shane spent one crazy, torrid week madly in love. While they may be pretending not to know each other, they can't deny their chemistry-or the fact that they've been secretly writing to each other in their books through the years.
I loved this book. I flew through it in one night. It's witty and sexy and the banter between the two main characters is phenomenal. The love story that develops over the course of fifteen years is gorgeous and leads to full-circle healing for both characters. I also thought that the relationships between mother and daughter in the story was really beautiful. The main character struggles to cope with the trauma from her childhood, especially in regard to her mother, and fights to give her daughter everything that she didn't have as a child. However, over the course of the story, the main character finds herself in the history of the women in her family and uses it as a means for growth.
The tropes in this love story are the best too. A fifteen year yearn? Two writers who wrote each other as their main characters? Chef's kiss. And as I said on my last post, it was everything that Book Lovers was trying to be... and I stand by that.
