Imagine you got back home, fatigued and frustrated after a taxing day at work. All you want now is to get under a nice warm shower and wash down all the tiredness from your body. Exhausted, you managed to trudge your way to the bathroom only to find out that there's no soap in there. Now, what would you do? Would you go all the way to a grocery store just to buy a bar of soap? No way! This is where online grocery delivery service can come really handy. In the United States, the number of online grocery customers is estimated to be around 150 million and is projected to grow further in the coming years. A large part of this increase can be accredited to the pandemic. With the number of COVID cases rising every day, people preferred to stay in their homes and make use of this gift of technology. However, one thing to be noted is that this trend of online grocery shopping has not declined but rather surged even after the restrictions got lifted. This showcases that people have experienced the benefits of this service and are thus not willing to go back to their traditional shopping habits. Apart from convenience, it saves you the time that gets spent on traveling and roaming around shops. It is because of such reasons that it is believed that the trend of online grocery shopping has no turning back. It is very possible that in a year or two, online grocery shopping would become as common as social media now. What are your thoughts on it?
