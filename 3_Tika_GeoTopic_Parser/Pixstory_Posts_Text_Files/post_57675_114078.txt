Every cigarette packet is seen with labels informing the person choosing to smoke that it could injure health By doing this the tobacco industries unfetter themselves from the blame for making a product that is highly addictive But who is to blame the person choosing to smoke or the companies making it There s been a Never ending debate on tobacco smoking being a free and informed choice The adult consumers who choose to take this step are well informed and aware of the adversities Besides this the tobacco industry has made it a point to educate and enlighten people about the adverse health effects of smoking The whole point of discussion came alive when the Food and Drug Administration recently proposed lowering the nicotine content in cigarettes to reduce addiction levels Tobacco industries have always portrayed smoking as a personal decision allowing them to promote and produce the cigarettes to the extent that the illusion of smoking being a choice has become a reality The marketing strategies and product style that mostly enchant the consumers to choose to smoke have always been an important reason why a child unaware of the harm smoking can inflict on him decides to try smoking A single try could become a life threat for him as the nicotine in the cigarettes is addictive It has claimed to have taken the lives of Americans each year The nicotine satisfaction has always been central to the business of these industries and has tried and experimented with increasing the levels of nicotine for growing sales Smoking is undoubtedly not a free choice it is addictive to the extent that a non smoker mostly a child would begin with one but continue with many for life And quitting smoking becomes problematic in the latter part of your life So no matter how hard these companies try to deny the evidence the reality would continue to show us an apparent picture that criticises and opposes the marketing of the industries that promote smoking
