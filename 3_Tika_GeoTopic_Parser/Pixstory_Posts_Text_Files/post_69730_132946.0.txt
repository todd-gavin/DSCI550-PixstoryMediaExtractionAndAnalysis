1. “Solo” by Jennie
Noteworthy lyrics:

“Used to be your girl
Now I’m used to being the G.O.A.T.
You’re sittin’ on your feelings
I’m sittin’ on my throne
I ain’t got no time for the troubles in your eyes
This time I’m only lookin’ at me, myself and I.”

2. “Adios” by EVERGLOW
Noteworthy lyrics:

“Why do you make me feel so small?
I always go round in circles for you
Why do you make me so sad?
I should’ve been the main character in the first place.”


3. “I Am The Best” by 2NE1
Noteworthy lyrics:

“I refuse to be compared, I’m telling you the truth
If we’re talking about my value, I’m a billion dollar baby"

4. “No” by CLC
“Screw how you feel, so “I” can look more like “me”
You act like you’re worried about me, to tell me what to do
You can cut that out, your mouth will just get sore
This cold way of talking, it suits me well actually
I don’t change myself for you, yah“

5 “Woman” by BoA 
Noteworthy lyrics:

“No comparing
I shine just as I am, I’m beautiful enough
To be a woman.”

 “I Don’t Need A Man” by Miss A
Noteworthy lyrics:

“I wake up early every morning
And I’m busy all day
I don’t even eat a proper meal
But I do this because I like it
The money may be little but it’s from my own sweat
This isn’t a ring that a boyfriend bought me
My car, my clothes – I bought it all on my own
I bought them after putting money into savings, after giving allowance to my parents
If you trust men, what will you do when they leave you?“

7. “Lion” by (G)I-DLE
Noteworthy lyric:

“I’ll bite off your useless courtesy
We tear down your suffocating prejudice
Who would dare to stop me
Careful with my sharp claws
I create a new path no one has attempted before
All those condescending people will click their tongues
But the applause I receive after breaking that prejudice is thrilling
I’ve had a taste, now I can’t deny it
I’m a queen.”
