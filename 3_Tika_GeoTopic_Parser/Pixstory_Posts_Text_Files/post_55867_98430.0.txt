‌ In the loss of federally guaranteed abortion rights, predicting that a Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade democrats expect a silver lining. They believe they could galvanize voter support for their party and prevent a midterm elections disaster.
‌
‌It is a tough time for democrats with rising inflation and disappointment with President Joe Biden. Democratic strategists believe the Supreme Court ruling that shifts abortion rights to the states would alter the 2022 debate and stimulate a dispirited liberal base. “Democratic intensity is about to get insanely high. It takes Biden off the hot seat. I can only hope the Democrats overreach and try to pack the court", agreed on a Republican strategist.

T.J Rooney said: "It gives us something to fight for. It gives some hope to an otherwise lifeless cycle for Democrats. Mercifully, it gives us something to go on the offensive with.”


Moreover, The Supreme Court has yet to make a ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a case to adjudicate the constitutionality of a 2018 Mississippi law that bans abortions after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy. But a leaked draft of a majority opinion upholding the law, gave hopes on the Right and Left, with Republicans lauding a possible decision they have worked on for decades and Democrats denouncing the elimination of a federal right they have fought equally hard to protect. Meanwhile, among Democratic and Republican political professionals, there has been a hurry to figure out the impact of this development on the midterm elections.
