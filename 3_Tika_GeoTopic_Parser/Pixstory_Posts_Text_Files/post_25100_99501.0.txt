Liverpool will be looking at nothing less than the three points against Villa. The Reds are yet to face Southampton and will end their league campaign with a home fixture against Wolves. As for Aston Villa, they are in good form at the moment, winning their last two games. The hosts are undefeated in their last three outings, and will look to stop Klopp's Liverpool.
