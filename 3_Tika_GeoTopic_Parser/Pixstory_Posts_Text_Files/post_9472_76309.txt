It pains when Arthur Fleck shows that card to inform his pseudobulbar affect to people around after that random ha ha ha ha in all inappropriate scenarios It was a medical condition he had to deal with his whole life It made him unsettled and humiliated everywhere He is not anti social but his strange looks and poor social skills tell otherwise He wants to be a comedian not a clown But he is a clown who has to spend time with some self loathing clowns in Gotham city A city that is rotten with the smell of piled up garbage The workers are on strike Everybody is dull with no means to live The gap between haves and have nots is huge Gotham City in the early s makes Arthur Fleck s life miserable and hopeless He is back from a psychiatric facility and lives with his mother who calls him Happy She believes the gift of uncontrollable laughter is her son s unique skill to make the world happy Arthur hides his urban isolation from her He was dejected when her deceptive lies proved utterly wrong while searching for his father The worst part of having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don t He tells his social worker during a clinical session He yearned to be connected and accepted by somebody Shots of those steps which he climbs daily for work grab his swinging moods Rather it preps you for stair dance one of Phoenix s best performances in Hollywood More chilling is his views at the TV show with Murray Everybody out there is awful and crazy nobody thinks what it s like to be the other guy Joaquin Phoenix s weary face and disturbingly skinny appearance in Joker upsets anyone Spectacular character mergers are not something new in his career Joker outdid all so far His gripping performance clearly states people in rare conditions expect your civility not sympathy Despite negative reviews on portraying a different comic book villain which separates DC from marvel Joaquin Phoenix took home his first Oscar for this terrifying role
