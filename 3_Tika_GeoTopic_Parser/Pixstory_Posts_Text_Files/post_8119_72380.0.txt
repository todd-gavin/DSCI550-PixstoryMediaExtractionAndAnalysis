Women held a gathering in Kabul city  and voiced support for the UN Secretary General’s call for the release of Afghanistan’s central bank assets.  

The participants also urged the Islamic Emirate to reactivate the Ministry of Women's Affairs, to allow girls access to education, and to include women in the government’s cabinet. 

“We ask the world humanitarian organizations...The number of those who left the country and say to freeze the assets are not even one million. We are aware that they are saying such things. Is it important to kill 34 million (people) for the sake of one million?” askedTajor Kakar, a women's rights defender.  

The participants voiced their concerns over the situation for women in the country.  

They presented the Islamic Emirate with a proposal calling for the reopening of the Women's Ministry, facilitating education for girls, and including women in senior government positions.  

“The utilization of woman workers and academic women, the appointment of women as deputy ministers, the aiding of vulnerable families, and the creation of job opportunities for Afghans are our main wishes,” said Asma, a participant.  

The Islamic Emirate has repeatedly said that it is committed to women’s rights based on Islamic regulations.  

The Islamic Emirate’s spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, said that they are hoping to reopen all schools in the coming solar year.
