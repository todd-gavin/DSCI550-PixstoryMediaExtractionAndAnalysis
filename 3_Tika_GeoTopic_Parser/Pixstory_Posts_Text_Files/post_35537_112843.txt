Gabriele Cioffi the new coach of Hellas Verona The coach of the Scaligeri presented himself yesterday at the press conference for the first time I thank the President Setti and the Director Marroccu I felt strongly wanted They allowed me to bring a staff that will allow me to do a good job The goal is salvation I chose Verona because it is a real square The real challenge for me is to try to match all the good things done in the Juric and Tudor managements I was strongly desired and to add to this the challenge There will be continuity because basically what he did Tudor to give continuity to Juric&#39;s work but with his ideas The same thing I will do Verona teaches that it has a latent DNA that has been pulled out of Juric from Bagnoli from Mandorlini from Prandelli a square that is morbid with the team that wants to see it work When there I played as an opponent with Mantova I felt suffocated on the pitch you enter an arena With these words the coach introduced himself to the environment and is now ready to embrace his players in the imminent pre-season meeting Instagram photo Hellas Verona
