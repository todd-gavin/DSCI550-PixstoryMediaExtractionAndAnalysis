Mexico has named the 29 players who will compete in the World Cup qualifiers in March. Coach Gerardo Martino didn't have many surprises in his call-up list, which will feature the majority of the same players and will almost certainly earn him a lot of flak. Mexico will play the United States in the final round of CONCACAF World Cup Qualifiers on March 24 at Estadio Azteca, before travelling to San Pedro Sula for their final away match against Honudras on March 27 and finishing their campaign with a home match against El Salvador on March 28 at Estadio Azteca.
The call up list was the following:

Goalkeepers: 

Guillermo Ochoa (America)

Alfredo Talavera (Pumas)

Rodolfo Cota (Leon) 

Jonathan Orozco (Tijuana)


Defenders: 

Johan Vasquez (Genoa)

Nestor Araujo (Celta de Vigo)

Gerardo Arteaga (KRC Genk)

Cesar Montes (Monterrey)

Julian Araujo (LA Galaxy)

Hector Moreno (Monterrey)

Jesus Alberto Angulo (Tigres)

Israel Reyes (Puebla)

Jesus Gallardo (Monterrey)

Jorge Sanchez (America)

Erick Aguirre (Monterrey)


Midfielders: Hector Herrera (Atletico Madrid) 

Edson Alvarez (Ajax)

Erick Gutierrez (PSV Eindhoven)

Diego Lainez (Betis)

Carlos Rodriguez (Cruz Azul)

Luis Romo (Monterrey)

Uriel Antuna (Cruz Azul)

Rodolfo Pizarro (Monterrey)


Forwards: Raul Jimenez (Wolverhampton)

Jesus Corona (Sevilla)

Hirving Lozano (Napoli)

Santiago Gimenez (Cruz Azul)

Henry Martin (America)

Alexis Vega (Chivas)

Mexico is currently sitting in third place but is tied on points with United States. Mexico will confront critical matches, despite the fact that they will be facing eliminated Honduras (who have lost five of their six home games) and El Salvador, who will almost certainly be eliminated by the time they meet. Nonetheless, Mexico will have high expectations, particularly in the game against the United States, despite losing three of their last three games against their main opponent in 2021. Martino's career may come to an end if he fails to perform well, or even worse, if he fails to get a ticket to Qatar 2022 (either by qualifying for the fourth-place playoff or by being eliminated).
