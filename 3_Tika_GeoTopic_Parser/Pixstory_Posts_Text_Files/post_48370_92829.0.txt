‌Sex work is nothing but exploiting a person for commercial purposes. Does choice matter? Everyone doesn't choose sex work by choice. Some are forced into prostitution and then find it as a job for a living and they are not to be judged. Most brothels promote forced prostitution and unlike other jobs, this job doesn't have any human rights in them. Commodifying a human is nothing but an insult! 
‌
‌Yes, there are sex workers of all genders. But it affects women in a very negative way. Normalizing the act of buying sex also debases men by assuming that they are entitled to access women’s bodies for sexual gratification. 
‌
‌Moreover supporting sex work has a risk factor for promoting child prostitution. No one can justify child prostitution and this is sheer cruelty. Child prosecution is never a choice; as children, they might not be able to make the right decisions and mostly they are being forced. 
‌
‌Further, the outer glamourous image that it creates is an illusion. The reality is that prostitution and sex trafficking make up a harmful, pervasive, illegal, and violent criminal industry involving pimps and traffickers who are tied to gangs, drugs, and street violence. There is a condition that when a sex worker files a case on the abuse he/she/they needs to prove that they were 'forced'. One way or the other sex workers are exploited for the very Job they do. What we have to strive for is to create an environment sex work or sex workers don't become a need! No human deserves to be commodified.
