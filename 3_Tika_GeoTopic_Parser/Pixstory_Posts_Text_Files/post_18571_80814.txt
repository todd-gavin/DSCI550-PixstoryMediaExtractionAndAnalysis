From regret to happiness Sofia Goggia smiles again because she managed to complete the first trial of the downhill in Beijing where the Winter Olympics are taking place. it counts that I was able to ski just two weeks after my injury in Cortina I am proud that I was able to finish this stage There was no guarantee I was already here this was a success I see no reason why I shouldn&#39;t be so happy I liked the confidence that I had Sofia Goggia&#39;s words at the gate at the end of the descent I just wanted to feel good in my boots and give energy to my skis It was a good test I&#39;m happy with the way my leg feels I just feel a little pain from time to time somewhere I can&#39;t say to be healed i have to manage myself for me for the olympic games they are everything i am the place where i want to be to achieve my dreams as a child there is no place i would like to be more willing to be regardless of how i am
