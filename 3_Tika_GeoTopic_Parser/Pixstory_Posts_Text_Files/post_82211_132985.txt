The DHR Toy Train Darjeeling Himalayan Railway was declared a World Heritage by UNESCO in It is a vintage British built Class B Steam Locomotive It runs between New Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling If you are at Siliguri you can enjoy a ride in the pretty little blue train and indulge in the fascinating sights and hill scenery while enjoying the chilly mountain breeze It is a very interesting way of travelling the hills as the steam engine tracks through the green slopes in loops You can also visit Ghoom which is the highest railway station in India Sitting in the vintage train in the middle of breath taking Himalayan greenery gives an unexplainable joy For people living in Siliguri especially in Salbari the Toy Train is an everyday spectacle The tracks run beside the roads lined by shops and markets On most days the loud familiar whistle from far would make the street vendors pack up their wares and scoot away from the tracks so the train can move without delay Some days the shrill horn would bring the owner of the vehicles parked on tracks Children are always thrilled at the sound shouting and waving at the passengers Riding the Toy Train is one of my most precious childhood memory As a school goer I saw the Toy Train everyday Yet each day increased my wonder at the sight of the beautiful little blue train It is a once in a lifetime opportunity everybody should take to explore what the hills offer
