Sometimes it's not about being nice-people manipulate you. You feel something is wrong or they are taking advantage of you. Leave the place and you need not be kind because you deserve much better. Being kind is good but realising that all people aren't the same is wise. So when you feel something is odd, don't be ashamed to leave.
