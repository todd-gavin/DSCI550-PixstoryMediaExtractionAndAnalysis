In the midst of a political storm in Bihar, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar tendered his resignation to Governor Phagu Chauhan and staked his claim to form the government by submitting a letter of support from 160 MLAs, just hours after formally announcing that the JD(U)-BJP alliance had broken up.

Mr. Kumar justified his extreme action by citing several conspiratorial steps by the BJP to dethrone his government.

Mr. Kumar told reporters outside Raj Bhawan, "I've left the NDA and submitted my resignation to the Governor, which he accepted."
