Karishma Tanna is on cloud nine as she is soon going to get married to her love of life, Varun Bangera.
Yesterday, they had an intimate Haldi ceremony with friends and family members. Karishma and Varun chose to twin on their special day and wore an all-white assemble.
Karishma took the opportunity to share a few photographs from the Haldi ceremony with her fans. The pictures also featured her to-be husband, Varun Bangera. The couple looked madly in love at their Haldi ceremony. They were all smiles as their friends and family members put Haldi on them. While sharing the photos with her fans, bride-to-be Karishma wrote a sweet caption with it. It read, “Beginning of my forever.”
