Australian PM Anthony Albanese who had just returned from visiting Kyiv Ukraine on Wednesday made the announcement of immediate flood assistance for local government areas in New South Wales and explicitly highlighted in that announcement was that New Zealanders there would receive the full gamut of assistance as a result of the flooding There was assistance available for New Zealanders before Albanese came to office but it was not made explicit Although it was something that cost Albanese nothingboth politically and in terms of money the significance of it was plain to see New Zealand residents in Australia who work pay taxes and start businesses would be treated the same by the Australian Government
