Churchill Brothers Football Club have ropped in the services of Senegal striker, Abdoulaye Sane ahead of the  I-League season 2022-23.

The 29-year-old is Churchill’s second foreign recruit this season. The former two-time champions have only retained Senegalese centre-back Momo Cisse from their last season’s campaign where they finished fourth on the table standing. 
Sane has joined from Saudi Professional League side Al-Taawoun FC where he made 27 appearances with only three goals to his name. 
The centre-forward has mostly plied his trade in France where he came up from the ranks of Rennes and made 15 Ligue 1 appearances from 2011-13. He then played for the Rennes’ reserve team for more game time till 2016 when he was loaned out to Laval in Ligue 2. Red Star and Sochaux were his other teams Sane donned colours of before making a move to Saudi Arabia in 2020-21 season. 
Churchill have high hopes of finishing as champions as next season’s I-League winners and securing a berth in the Indian Super League (ISL) for 2023-24.
