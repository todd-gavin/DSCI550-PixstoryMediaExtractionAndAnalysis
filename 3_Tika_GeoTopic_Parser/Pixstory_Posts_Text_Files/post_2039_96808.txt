I m confused by what exactly Tesla CEO Elon Musk means by wanting to transform Twitter by taking it private That word has many meanings and many of them not good as history has taught I m all for free enterprise And he has the right to buy whatever he wants But I m not convinced Musk has thought through the new lens of scrutiny that will be placed on his management of the platform Not only is he now accountable for the operations he is by extension accountable for the users If Trump is allowed back on the platform for example that will have major implications Every move by Twitter moving forward will be viewed through that lens
