Tears galloped 
Oh it's because she's soft heartened
No because its she 
Oh, she's weak, meant to cry
He is crying?! 
That's never right 
Oh no, be a man, says s
Cry, cry hard or not
Thrust thy face on the pillows and cry 
Express your emotions with cry or not 
Cry is non gendered 
Cry out your emotions 
Cry thy beauty prevails in my heart 
Sky's also pours down
Cry, rise and shine
