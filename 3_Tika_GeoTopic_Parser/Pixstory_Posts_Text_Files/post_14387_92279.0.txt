Leo & Ciro vs Thiago & Mateo! That was how they lined up in the backyard with Antonela recording from the sidelines. 

Leo Messi played football with his 3 sons in the backyard where he showed just how competitive he can get with the ball at his feet! 

The seven time Ballon d’Or winner was filmed doing a couple of one-two with Ciro and letting his youngest son take a shot at the goal only to be saved by his oldest son, Thiago! Ciro was quickly dispossessed by Mateo but Leo was quick to retrieve it back and pass it to Ciro again. He later happened find the back of the net after a quick pass! 

While sharing the video on Instagram, Antonella wrote, “Deja ganar a los nenes", which means ‘let the kids win’.

It’ll be interesting to see the Messi legacy continue even after Leo retires and there’ll still be someone to run the show! 

A couple of days back, Leo Messi ended his Ligue 1 goalscoring drought after scoring PSG’s fourth goal vs Lorient. This was just Leo Messi's third league goal. The last time he scored was back against Lille, on February 7, 2022!
