Exposure to air pollution is a risk factor for many chronic diseases, including
chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. There is wide recognition that people with such conditions are at
increased vulnerability from COVID‑19, and may thus be prone to a more severe course of the disease. The World Health Organization and a number of national public health authorities have also issued warnings
for citizens with these pre-existing conditions of greater risks of complications from COVID‑19 (WHO, 2020). Like,it has
been estimated that long-term exposure to air pollution from PM2.5 contributed to about 19% of COVID-19 mortality in
Europe through its effect in increasing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, but the confidence intervals around this
estimate are wide (8-41%), reflecting high levels of uncertainties.
In addition, some studies suggest that air pollution (PM2.5 in particular) may increase the risk of infection by acting as a
vehicle spreading the virus. While there are some concerns that air pollution could carry the virus
over longer distances, at this stage it is not known whether the virus remains viable on pollution particles. Further research is needed to verify this hypothesis.

On the other hand, the confinement measures that have been put in place to reduce the spread of the coronavirus
have led to at least a temporary reduction in air pollution. Reductions in economic and social activities led to significant
decreases in certain types of pollution, notably in nitrogen dioxide (NO2), largely due to reduced traffic and other
activities, especially in major cities
