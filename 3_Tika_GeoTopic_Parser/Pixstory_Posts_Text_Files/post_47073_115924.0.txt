The final matchday of the Euro 2022 is here. Northern Ireland are all set to face thumping England at St Mary’s Stadium on Friday. The win and loss would determine the future for 
Northern Ireland whereas England will look to finish the group stage on a positive note.

England are on top of the points table with two wins whereas Northern Ireland are on the other 
end with zero wins from two games.

In the previous fixture, Northern Ireland lost the game to Austria with a scoreline of 2-0.

Katharina Schiechtl and Katharina Elisa were the goalscorers for Austria. The fixture against 
England becomes much more difficult as the team will miss out on the services of Demi Vance who picked out a niggle in the previous fixture against Austria.

England, on the other hand, smashed eight past hapless Norway on the second match day.

There were five different goalscorers for Three Lioness and Beth Mead bagged the hattrick 
against Norway.
