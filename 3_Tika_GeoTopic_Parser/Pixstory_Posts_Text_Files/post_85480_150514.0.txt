Here are four key on-pitch battles to keep an eye out for - the duels for space, chances and territory.Saliba vs KaneSaliba has been a wall for Arsenal so far, winning his one-on-one duels and raising the level of defending at the club. Harry Kane provides a new test, straight from the book of elite centre-forwards. Will Saliba keep Kane quiet, or will Kane play deeper to make space for Son?White vs SonBen White has moulded himself into a right-back, playing centrally and more conservatively behind Bukayo Saka. The more he plays, the more the understanding between them improves. White has done extremely well to adapt, but Heung-min Son looks to be hitting form at the right time. Son hit a hat-trick last time out, but the battle for space in their zones will be key to whether Spurs can create an outlet, or whether we dominate.Jesus vs DierA key battle will be the front-end for Arsenal, and how much space they will have in the final third. Jesus has hunted down every loose ball, giving centre-backs an issue. Eric Dier is in good form, and time will tell if Romero or Lenglet partners Dier in the 3-man defence. Spurs are expected to defend deep, so will Jesus get many touches to impact the score?Xhaka vs BentancurWho will boss the midfield? Both players are integral to the progressive passes both sides create. Xhaka is a free-roaming midfielder, affecting the game in both boxes. He looks reinvented and classy with the ball. Bentancur has added composure and bite for Spurs, but who will make the biggest impact?Arteta vs ConteThe battle of the managers, which strategy wins? Artetaâ€™s fluid football will be challenged by the security of Spurs defence. Space will be limited, but history proves there are goals to be earned.
