America is in fear of turning red with the recent events of a bloodbath. A man disguised as a construction worker turned Brooklyn Subway into a crime scene.
‌
‌‌According to sources of law enforcement(New York Post) As the crowded subway filled with smoke, the shooter took out a 9mm semiautomatic Glock and fired 33 rounds at commuters, hitting 10 victims and at least 19  wounded. Those hurt involved two teens ages 15 and 19, a pregnant woman who was shot in the leg, seven men and three women.
‌
‌Police identified the person as Frank James (person of interest in the shooting) The gun used by the shooter, who had three vast magazines on him, was crushed amid the bloodshed. 
‌
‌Cops also found a slew of other weapons, comprising a hatchet, a can of pepper spray, two gas canisters, gasoline, two non-detonated smoke grenades, a bag full of fireworks and another satchel holding what appears to be BB pellets at the scene, police. It's showing the need for gun control in the country. Anyone can access guns. This person is considered to be mentally ill yet had access to guns. James, who said he was born and raised in New York City, criticized employment and training programs for low-income Black youths, adding that he had been a “victim” of those and calling his experiences a “horror show" through his YouTube channel.

He warned Mayor Adams that his program might slow down gun violence and a mental health epidemic, “but you aren’t going to stop it. … Violence is a part of your city. Violent people live in your city.”

What does this mean? The guy has lost his senses due to the horrors of the New York city toward Black Americans. And he proved his point on violence when he took the gun and started this violence. I mean too much irony! Improper lobby for guns should be controlled as many laws are enforced in the country. Why don't we call for stricter gun laws and gun law enforcement in the country? Is this title we want that violence is a part of the Brooklyn?
