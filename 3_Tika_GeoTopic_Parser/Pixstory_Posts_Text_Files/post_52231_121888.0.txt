The production of meat is, directly and indirectly, related to the loss of forests in South America. According to the WWF, beef and soy production are responsible for deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest and other areas of Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay.

Vast swathes of the Amazon are being cleared of habitat for cattle farming and the production of soybean for animal feed. Often, deforested areas are cleared using fire. This burning releases huge amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere while also removing a CO2 sink.
