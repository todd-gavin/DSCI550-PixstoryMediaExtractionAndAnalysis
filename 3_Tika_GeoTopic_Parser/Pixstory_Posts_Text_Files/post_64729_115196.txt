The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Earthling Andy Dufresne a suspiciously over qualified banker who is sent to prison for the murder of his nameless wife Once incarcerated he befriends Red Tired of doing boring stuff like sliming the tops of buildings Andy offers the guards financial advice The Warden quickly gives Andy an unpaid internship which seems like it s gonna be a great opportunity After twenty years Andy decides he s had enough despite the fact that he s barely aged a day The guys all think he s gonna kill himself but why bother when he s got that sweet hole in his wall Later Red gets lonely and asks if he can go now and everybody says ok He easily finds Andy halfway around the world presumably using satellite technology and then they chill at Club Med Other than the value of keeping posters in your room the primary theme of The Shawshank Redemption is freedom Many times we see the camera framed by doors and windows suggesting imprisonment Conversely aerial shots are used to indicate liberation In one shot Andy experiences his last gasp of life on the outside as the limo brings him to Shawshank Later he plays Wolfgang Puck s The Marriage of Figaro for the other inmates using art to set them free At the end we see Andy and Red fully torqued on freedom But the movie goes even deeper Lurking beneath is a hefty load existential undertones
