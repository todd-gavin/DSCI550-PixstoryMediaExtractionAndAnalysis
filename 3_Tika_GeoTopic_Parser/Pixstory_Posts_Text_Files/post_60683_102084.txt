Hi Everyone I m Nimisha Bansal a year old trying to picture YOLO at every stage of life I like reading fiction novels Colleen Hoover author is my favorite even though I haven t read a lot of her books yet Maybe because of her eloquent touch in writing style or because of her empathy she s an easy person to fall for I also try singing and can play guitar amateurly Most of my free time is spent binge watching friends on Netflix and I sometimes doodle too My usual days atm begin with contemplations on whether to spend more time on college or Pinterest or a good read Hoping to connect with you all
