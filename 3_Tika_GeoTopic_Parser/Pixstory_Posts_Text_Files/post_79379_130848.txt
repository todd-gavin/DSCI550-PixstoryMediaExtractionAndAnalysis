I would describe myself as being very resourceful and ambitious at the same time I am a keen listener In some ways people expect me to do less as I don t really talk too much but it gives me the opportunity to do more I describe myself as attentive I pay close attention the needs of my customers to the opinions of my peers and manager and to the little details that eventually paint the bigger picture This has helped ne achieve strong interpersonal with my clients and colleagues I am constantly adapting to the changes in the work space I am resilient and don t let anything bog me down
