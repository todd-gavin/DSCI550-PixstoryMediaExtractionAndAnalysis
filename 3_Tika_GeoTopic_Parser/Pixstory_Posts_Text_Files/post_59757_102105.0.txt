“Be a lover. Give love. Choose love..”
Hello everyone! I am Anshika Chopra. To describe myself in a few words, I would say that I am an optimistic person who loves to take up challenges. I love to explore every side of myself, I love to dance, play guitar, and sketch. I am also a black belt in karate. Being a good listener, I am always up for a deep long conversation and one can always approach  me to vent their pent up feelings. I am a very emotional person and one can always find me vibing to Harry Styles’ songs to cheer myself up. Being a Styler, I always go by the quote “ Treat People with Kindness “.
I also love travelling and exploring different places, talking to different people learning new things and unlearning the old.
