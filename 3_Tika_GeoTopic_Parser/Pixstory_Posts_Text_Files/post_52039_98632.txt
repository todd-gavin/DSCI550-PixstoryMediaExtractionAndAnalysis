One of the greatest benefits of being an actor would surely be acquiring new skills for a role whether they be extreme Tom Cruise learning to fly a helicopter in Mission Impossible Fallout or even somewhat illegal Bryan Cranston learning how to cook naughty things for Breaking Bad Like Keanu Reeves before him in the classic action flick Point Break Australian actor Ben O Toole has learned to hang ten for his role in Barons a new ABC TV series that looks at Aussie surf culture in the early s Prior to Barons I hadn t really surfed all that much but I began taking lessons with a few of the other cast members says Cairns born O Toole The amount of upper body endurance you need to get out the back of the surf is incredible as well as the core stability and leg strength required to maintain balance and stay in control It s an incredible form of fitness and something I have fallen in love with Not only has surfing kept the year old thespian in tip top shape he also credits it with changing his outlook on life There is something spiritual about being out in the water waiting for Mother Nature to bring the next set in he says While you may have control of your board you have no control over the conditions the wind the nature of the wave It s a brilliant lesson in letting go of controlling what you can and learning to accept what you can t Having clocked up high profile roles in films like The Water Diviner and Hacksaw Ridge as well as roles on TV shows such as Love Child and Halifax Retribution O Toole has already been contemplating how to adapt his skillset beyond the world of acting A general goal I have for myself is to take on more responsibility within this industry he says I d like to produce and one day direct so any step in that direction is a small win for me and keeps me going I love acting but there comes a time I think when you want to feel more responsible for the outcome of a story
