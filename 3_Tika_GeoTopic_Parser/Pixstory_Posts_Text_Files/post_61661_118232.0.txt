We're just months away from the 10-year anniversary of the debut of one of WWE's most prolific factions – The Shield.

But a decade on from when Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose, first jumped the barricade together, things are very different for all three men.

Reigns is now WWE's longest-reigning Universal Champion, Rollins has reinvented himself as Seth 'Freakin' Rollins – with a wardrobe and attitude to match – and Ambrose is now Jon Moxley in AEW.

While we'll almost certainly see Reigns and Rollins standing opposite each other in a WWE ring again, with Moxley now in AEW, it's unlikely all three members will ever come together for a Shield reunion. And while fans would love the idea of seeing the trio teaming together one more time, Rollins is happy to leave the memories alone.

"I can say that, and maybe this might come back to bite me at some point, but I just don't think you're ever going to see the three of us team up ever again," Rollins said.

"It wouldn't look the way you want it to look. It wouldn't be like the old days in The Shield, it would be a different animal. I think we're all just too big stars with too big personalities at this point.

However, there is a time that Rollins believes we could see him standing alongside Reigns and Ambrose again.

"The next time you see us together it's going to be when we're inducted into the Hall of Fame," he added. "That's going to be it"
