Manchester United legend Cristiano Ronaldo could be heading out of the club just a season after his return to Old Trafford. Multiple news sources have stated that the Portuguese superstar has asked the club to let him go!

As per BBC Sports, "Cristiano RonaldoÂ wants Manchester United to let him leave the club if they receive an appropriate offer for him this summer."

This announcement comes after Manchester United finished sixth in the Premier League last season. Courtesy of a bad season, the Red Devils also failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League this season. This is reportedly one of the major reasons why Cristiano Ronaldo is looking to exit the club this summer.

With Chelsea, PSG, Roma, and Real Madrid his possible options, It has to be seen if Manchester United would agree to let Cristiano Ronaldo leave this summer!
