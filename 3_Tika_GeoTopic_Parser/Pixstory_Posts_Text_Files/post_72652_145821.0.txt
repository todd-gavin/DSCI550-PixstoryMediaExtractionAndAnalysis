Life, just a fairy tale told by an idiot...
We are merely actors who wear various masks
Of melancholy and happiness....
Actually, do we feel satisfied?
Do we feel comfortable?
Do we feel contented?
Actually, what makes us delight?
Money, pleasure or career....?
No... Not at all!!!
Happiness comes through enlightenment of Soul and selfless actions....
May be we are spectators...
May be players in the ground of God's dreams and fantasies....
We play, dance and cheer up...
But it's soliloquy last until death....
Actually, what we need....?
Just six feet of soil to rest!!!
Just to rest for enjoying
everlasting joy!!!
