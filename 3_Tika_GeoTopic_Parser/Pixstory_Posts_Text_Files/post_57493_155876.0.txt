Emotional and social development are both seriously affected by SAD. The condition can cause a child to avoid experiences crucial to normal development.
SAD can also affect family life. Some of these problems may include:
family activities that are limited by negative behavior
parents with little to no time for themselves or each other, resulting in frustration
siblings that become jealous of the extra attention given to the child with SAD
If your child has SAD, speak with your doctor about treatment options and ways you can help manage its effect on family life.
