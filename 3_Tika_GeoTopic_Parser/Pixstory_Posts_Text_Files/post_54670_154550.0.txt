There can no longer be any doubt that Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, the legendary Nigerian musician, activist and father of Afrobeat music, has become an easy career booster for today’s Afrobeats artists who are undergoing creative droughts.Fela’s invention, Afrobeat, is an ensemble and performance-based category that blends jazz, funk, rock and traditional West African chant and rhythms. It originated in the early 1970s through continued experimentation after a stint with highlife music. Afrobeats, however, is a 21st century creation of beat-heavy electronic pop music from Nigeria with steadily growing global audiences. It’s become an umbrella term describing the music of contemporary West African stars, including the likes of Wizkid, Burna Boy and Tems.Over the course of a decade (2010-2020), Afrobeats stars managed to appropriate the text, synthesise the sound, conjure the appearance and invoke the name and symbolisms of Fela in their works in various ways, often as a tribute.Since my last major study on how Afrobeats uses and reframes Fela, several Afrobeats practitioners have laboured – and failed – to tap from him in exciting new ways.In fact, the post-2020 class has reached for Fela’s source in ways that barely recognise the stature of the late icon. As I have noted elsewhere, Nigerian artists often resort to activism pranks to shore up their creative deficiencies. Indeed, there is a sense that an association with the Fela brand and imagery confers on an artist some sort of critical ethos – one which audiences are beginning to see through.Read more: https://theconversation.com/simi-and-bella-shmurda-two-afrobeats-stars-reveal-a-growing-tendency-to-abuse-fela-kuti-192032
