President Joe Biden gave a passionate defence of democracy on Saturday, as reported by US News, as well as a scathing assessment of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom Biden referred to as a "butcher" for the autocrat's horrific month-long onslaught on Ukraine. 

"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power," Biden said at the end of a European trip to coordinate alliance response to the invasion in a speech at the Royal Castle in Warsaw. 

As Susan Milligan says, after the speech, a senior US official downplayed Biden's remarks, telling reporters that Biden was merely stating that Putin should not be allowed to exercise influence over his neighbours and that he was not advocating for regime change. 

However, the president's comments reflected Biden's anger and dissatisfaction with Putin, who has gone from dealing with Western nations as an equal participant to acting more like the Russia that the US struggled against during the Cold War in the last decade. 

The US president provided no blueprint for deposing Putin, but he made a point of speaking directly to the Russian people, praising those who risked imprisonment for opposing the war and rejecting Putin's propaganda about the invasion's grounds.

"You, the Russian people, are not our adversary," Biden said, adding that he does not believe Russians – who fought fascism in World War II – support the "murdering of innocent children or grandparents" or the bombing of schools and hospitals. 

"This isn't your true self." This isn't the kind of future you deserve... This war is unworthy of you, Russian people," Biden said.
