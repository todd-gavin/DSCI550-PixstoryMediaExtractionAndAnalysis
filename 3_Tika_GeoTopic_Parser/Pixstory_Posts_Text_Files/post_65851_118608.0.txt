It was a close match and India survived a scare. Nonetheless, this win means India take 1-0 lead in 3-match series.

Earlier India was asked to bat first after they lost the toss. But the decision proved exactly right as Shikhar Dhawan and Shubman Gill gave India a rollicking start, especially Gill was the aggressor. After his departure, Dhawan and Iyer took over and it looked like India will reach 350. But after the second drinks break, India lost flurry of wickets, with Dhawan, Iyer both departing in no time. Even Deepak Hooda and Sanju Samson ate up balls. In the end, it was Axar Patel who broke the shackles and India managed to cross 300 mark, eventually setting up 309 run target to Windies.

West Indies skipper Nicholas Pooran won the toss and elected to bowl against India in the series opener at Queen’s Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad. India picked Shubman Gill over Ruturaj Gaikwad as Shikhar Dhawan’s opening partner, while Sanju Samson got a nod over Ishan Kishan to keep the gloves. Vice-captain Ravindra Jadeja has been ruled out of the first two ODIs after sustaining a knee injury.

In the absence of several experienced players, Shikhar Dhawan will lead a young Indian team in the ODI series against a struggling Windies side who recently lost the three-match series to Bangladesh.

The Men in Blue are high on confidence after an impressive show in white-ball matches against England. However, they surely missed the services of Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant, Hardik Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah in the first ODI against the Windies, as they barely won by a margin of 3 runs
