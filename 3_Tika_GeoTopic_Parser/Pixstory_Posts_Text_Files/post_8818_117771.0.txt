Chief Justice of India continues....

I have to record a sad event that took place during my term of office as Chief Justice of India. My brother, Mr. Justice Gulam Hasan, was suddenly taken ill and died after a short illness.

His end came suddenly. A few hours before his death, when I was sitting by his bedside he was feeling quite well and told me that he would be able to attend Court within two days. I repeatedly asked him whether he was feeling any trouble and he assured me that at that moment he was not suffering from any trouble whatsoever. His wife had gone to England and no member of his family was then residing with him. 

At about midnight I received a telephone call from Mr. Daphtary, the Solicitor General of India, that Justice Gulam Hasan had expired. He told me that he had been taken seriously ill at about midnight and was taken to the Willingdon Hospital by the doctor attending on him. No sooner did he reach the hospital, he collapsed and died. In Justice Hasan, the Court lost a very amiable person and a very good Judge. His funeral which took place next day was attended by all the Judges and The Court was closed for the day as a mark of respect to his memory. 

It is not for me to say anything about my work as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India on the executive or judicial side. 

It is for others to sit in judgment on my administration as well as on the decisions made, by the Court, but I have the satisfaction to say that I left no arrears for my successor. I In order to decide criminal cases quickly, a banch of the Supreme Court sat during vacation. Previous to this only one Judge used to come during the vacation, occasionally to hear special leave petitions and other urgent matters. I was able to bring the library of the Court up-to-date with the help of the 
then Finance Minister, Mr. Chintaman Deshmukh who granted the amount I wanted for it.
