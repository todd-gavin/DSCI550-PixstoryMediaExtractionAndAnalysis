A move viewed by the 65-year-old tycoon as succession planning saw Mukesh Ambani stand down from the Reliance Jio board and hand the company's leadership to his elder son Akash.

The business's board "approved the appointment of Akash M. Ambani, non-executive director, as chairman of the board of directors of the company" during a meeting on June 27, according to a stock exchange filing from Reliance Jio Infocomm. Earlier this month, on June 27, his father announced his resignation.
Pankaj Mohan Pawar was among the appointments made to the company's management team. His tenure will begin on June 27 and last for five years.
