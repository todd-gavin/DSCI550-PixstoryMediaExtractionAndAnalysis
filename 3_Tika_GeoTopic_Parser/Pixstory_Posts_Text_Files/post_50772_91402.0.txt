Donald Trump's troubles are increasing as the January 6th case has taken another twist with federal officials now examining "the possible involvement of other government officials‚Äù in the attempts to overturn the 2020 elections by Trump.

Trump has survived a number of scandals since becoming a presidential nominee for the 2016 elections. Trump's loyal supporters have stood by him through thick and thin. He has been in a myriad of controversies but has always been backed by his supporter base. 

This new story has been just one of the number of damaging stories about the former president that have come out this week. In a judgement issued on Monday, a federal judge declared Trump and John Eastman to have committed felonies in their attempt to reverse the election results. The committee investigating the incident on January 6th suggested that Trump's two advisers, Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino, be put in criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with subpoenas the same evening. On Tuesday it was reported that Trump's official phone logs had a gap of more than 7 hours. 

Ginni Thomas, wife of the Supreme Court judge Clarence Thomas was found to have been texting Mark Meadows, who was the then White House Cheif of Staff, days after the elections. Ginni Thomas had been urging Meadows to refuse to accept the election results, expecting that they would be overturned. Clarence Thomas was the sole judge to support Trump in the struggle between the former president and the January 6 committee a year later, which raised many concerns.

Trump supporters have stood by the former president through even bigger controversies, so it's difficult to see wether the January 6 probe will have a big impact on the electoral results. However, liberals and Democrats contend that seeking the truth is important in and of itself. and the events this week are a proof of that.
