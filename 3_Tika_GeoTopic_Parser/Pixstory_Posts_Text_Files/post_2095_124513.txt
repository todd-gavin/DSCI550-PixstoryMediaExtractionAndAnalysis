The recent FBI raid of Trump s Mar a Lago residence was unprecedented and terrible The raid was undertaken to hunt for classified documents that President Trump allegedly unlawfully removed to his Mar a Lago home This politically planned raid is an obvious effort to indict him but what many fail to realize is that this raid may have secured his election to the presidency in Establishment Democrats and Republicans are out to get Trump and are prepared to use whatever measures necessary to prevent him from running for president in and winning Yet they fail to see that Trump s current reputation and popularity are a direct result of the six years of attacks he has endured since becoming president Every time the media or a politician criticizes Donald Trump for an inconsequential or fabricated cause his followers get more emboldened and more people decide to support him over other candidates Despite his prowess he has earned the reputation of an underdog who is often beaten and ordered to sit but who stays standing each time his pursuers attack Everyone who planned this raid at the Department of Justice should be on the alert Trump whether we like it or not will likely win in and he s coming for them
