The Monzino Cardiological Center has enrolled the first three patients who will receive Inclisiran in the Victorion P international multicentre study, the drug that Eugene Brauwnwal, the father of modern cardiology, did not hesitate to define as the future anti-infarction vaccine. The study will involve over a thousand patients worldwide with the goal of demonstrating that Novartis&#39; new drug which, like a vaccine, is administered only twice a year can reduce the risk of serious cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke by halving the levels of bad cholesterol LDL C known as LDL C plays a key role in the development and progression of cardiovascular and atherosclerotic diseases and it has been shown that lowering their levels in the blood results in a reduction in their incidence and mortality. An effect that is even more important in subjects most at risk such as those who have already experienced a cardiovascular event in their history heart attack and stroke These are precisely the patients on which this study focuses. To date, in fact, despite having a wide range of anti-cholesterol drugs available, including the well-known statins, the desirable LDL C targets to reduce the risk of relapses are often difficult to obtain. Inclirisan the first drug of a new class that has already been shown in previous clinical trials to lower LDL-C levels in both patients with cerebrovascular disease CEVD and in patients with polyvascular disease PVD
