Climate change and its consequence of global warming are hitting India like never before.
Saturday, Delhi witnessed the hottest day with the thermostat hitting 49° Celsius with an unending heatwave while its neighbor city of Gurgaon reached 48° on the same day according to the meteorological department.

While increasing temperatures are an indicator of the destruction of our environment, southern parts of India namely Kerala & Lakshadweep received major rainfall with their respective governments raising a red alert.

According to Indian Meteorological Department data, the average maximum temperature over northwest and central India for April this year has been the highest in 122 years.

The impact of climate change is amplified in cities since urban areas are usually warmer than their surroundings due to concentrated structures, less greenery, and higher number of polluting factors.

So the question that pops up in my head is where will this stop or will it ever stop? Will we be able to leave a habitable planet for our future generations or will this lead to an end for the species?
