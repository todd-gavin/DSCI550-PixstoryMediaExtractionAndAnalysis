Instead of using physical exfoliants I prefer to use chemical exfoliants and among AHAs Alpha Hydroxy Acids Glycolic acid peels are what I think are the best Since glycolic acid has been studied the most of all AHAs I prefer to use exfoliants that contain it It is crucial to use cosmetics that have scientific support to make sure they re actually good for your skin and are not secretly harming it Sun sensitivity is one of the side effects of glycolic acid and all other AHAs You should use it at night because of that reason if you ask me The sensitivity is not permanent but for as long as it s on your face If you re still not convinced you d like this next information Always use an alumina based exfoliant if you must use a physical exfoliator Because of the perfectly spherical non abrasive particles I believe it is the only kind of scrub that is worth using and wouldn t hurt your skin much
