Recently I visited my native. My native is a quiet sleepy town in West Bengal and it is situated near the Hooghly River.

Whenever I visit, I make sure I pay a visit to this river because of the wonders it carries. From small passenger boats to large cargo carrying launches, this river is a gracious host to everybody.

I visited the river yesterday and the mellow river breeze relieved me from the summer heat. I also love the greenery and the thriving biodiversity surrounding the river. 

The only thing that troubles me is the way we are treating this river that has generously sustained us for ages. Taking a bath in the river is natural, however, discarding your plastic, bath products, and laundry waste into the river is not cool. People do what's convenient for them without understanding the bigger picture. The long term consequences of river pollution are evidently devastating. 

Over the years, I have witnessed how urbanization of this quiet sleepy town has rendered it unkind to the nature that nurtures it. Urbanization is not bad but urbanization without sustainability is harmful. 

Now the river (at least the stretch near my town) has become significantly toxic to its own marine life. Before, you would see many ganges dolphins. Now they rarely surface. 

The river will only become more unwelcoming in the future if no action is taken in the present. It's just kind of sad seeing something you loved as a child changing in the worst way possible.
