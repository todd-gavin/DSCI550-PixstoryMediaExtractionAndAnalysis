A one-minute clip of India’s first prime minister being interviewed by American TV Host Arnold Michaelis in 1964 has been widely shared on social media (Facebook and Twitter). It has been shared with the caption that he said, “I took the decision of partition.” (विभाजन का निर्णय मैंने ही लिया था).

It was posted on multiple high network Facebook groups such as भारत रक्षक संगठन, [over 3 lakh followers]; Kangna Ranaut Group [over 2 lakh followers]; मोदी लक्ष्य 2024 [about 2 lakh followers]; Sudarshan News [over 1 lakh followers]; and हिंदू देशभक्त [over 10K followers].

Misleading claim
The viral video is a clip from a 45-minute interview. The full interview is available on the YouTube channel of the Government of India’s ‘Prasar Bharati Archives’. As per the video description, this is Nehru’s last significant interview before his death on May 27, 1964. The portion in the viral video is clipped from the 14:34 mark in the Prasar Bharati Archives video.

In the viral video, at the 1:06 mark, Nehru said, “…ultimately I decided…” and the corresponding Hindi subtitle that appears is – “आख़िरकार मैंने यह निर्णय लिया”. This is an accurate translation that does not mean, “I took the decision of partition” or “विभाजन का निर्णय मैंने ही लिया था” as suggested in the caption. More crucially, this is only a small portion of Nehru’s statement that fails to offer context.

To understand the full context, viewers must know the question that was asked by Michaelis before the segment that was shared on social media.
