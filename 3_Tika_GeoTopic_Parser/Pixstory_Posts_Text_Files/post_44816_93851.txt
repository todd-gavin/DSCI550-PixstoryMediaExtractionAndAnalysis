Rio Ferdinand a former Manchester United defender predicted an all English final in the UEFA Champions League this season Later this month Manchester City will face Real Madrid in the first semi final followed by Liverpool s match against Villarreal The two Spanish teams are also in contention for an all Spanish final but Ferdinand believes it will be decided in the opposite direction He commented on BT Sport on City s match against Los Blancos I think City go through by two goals The teams last met in the season s last when the Sky Blues won both legs to advance to the quarter finals on aggregate Los Blancos are a much better team now but Pep Guardiola s men still appear to be the better team on paper They haven t given up a goal in the knockout stages but Real Madrid has conceded six goals in their last four Champions League games It s conceivable that they ll duplicate their performance from two years ago and Ferdinand believes Liverpool will win the other match Given their incredible record in the competition this season they won t be an easy opponent They ve overcome Atalanta Juventus and Bayern Munich to get here but Ferdinand believes their lack of experience at this level will damage them I feel Liverpool are a well oiled machine They know how to get through these situations They have been here time and time again in recent years Liverpool have the experience they have the firepower and they will be too strong for Villarreal over two legs The first leg of both semi finals will be held in England April and with the decider taking place a week later in Madrid and Villarreal
