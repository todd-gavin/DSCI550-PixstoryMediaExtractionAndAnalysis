In years that bring the philosophic mind And O ye Fountains Meadows Hills and Groves Forebode not any severing of our loves Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might I only have relinquished one delight To live beneath your more habitual sway I love the Brooks which down their channels fret Even more than when I tripped lightly as they The innocent brightness of a new born Day Is lovely yet The Clouds that gather round the setting sun Do take a sober colouring from an eye That hath kept watch o er man s mortality Another race hath been and other palms are won Thanks to the human heart by which we live Thanks to its tenderness its joys and fears To me the meanest flower that blows can give Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears William Wordsworth
