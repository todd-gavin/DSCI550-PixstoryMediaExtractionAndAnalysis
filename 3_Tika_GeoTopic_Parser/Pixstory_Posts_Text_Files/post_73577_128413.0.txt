When wondering whether to add a facial toner to your routine, here are seven key reasons to keep in mind:

1. Balances your skin after cleansing.

Some cleaners can over-strip your skin as it cleanses, drying it out in the process. Applying a toner after cleansing helps to restore balance to your skin, keeping it from feeling too tight or dry.

2. Hydrates your skin.

Facial toners are water-based, aiming at restoring hydration to your skin after cleansing. Many include additional hydrating ingredients to bind the water to your skin for longer-lasting results.

3. Refreshes your skin.

Spritzing your skin with a spray-on toner is a great way to start (and end) your daily routine. It feels amazing â€” and you deserve to treat yourself.

4. Soothes your skin.

Using a botanically sourced facial toner is a great way to create a calming sensation for your skin, alleviating any temporary redness or discomfort.

5. Helps remove oil and makeup.

Adding a facial toner to your daily routine can help break out excess dirt and other impurities left on your skin.
