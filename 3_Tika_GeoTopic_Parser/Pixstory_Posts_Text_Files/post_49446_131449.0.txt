According to Twitter, Zatko was let go from his position earlier this year due to poor performance and leadership. The business referred to Zatko's complaint as "opportunistic" and implied that the accusations were made with the intention of inflicting harm on twitter.
Zatko left the organization at the same time that Rinki Sethi, the chief information security officer, did. Late in 2020, both execs started using Twitter. According to a memo CEO Parag Agrawal sent to staff, they left the company after "an assessment of how the organization was being led and the impact on top priority work," the New York Times reported at the time.
