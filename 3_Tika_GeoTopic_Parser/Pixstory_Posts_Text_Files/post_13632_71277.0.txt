The feelings of a 14-year-old girl expressed in the form of a poem.

In the home like a prisoner 
In the world like a criminal 
Give me my childhood back 
Give me the moments you destroyed 
And those loves and life you shoot 
The nights I died for peace , the days I cried for my self 
The life I born , I breathe,  I die in the war 
You are destroying my life my childhood with each of your tank 
I closed my eyes and ears not to see any more fire 
When you killed my mother , father , sister , brother friends that day I died alive 
You conquered me , you deceived me , you paly with religion to use me as a toy 
From the world you only give me blasting and shooting,  you convicted me this is the way you must die 
The life that you give me only detest 
The eyes only seed the darkness
The ears only hear crying of victims 
Don't shoot me , let me life , let me breathe 
It's not my right to starve behind the borders 
It's not my right to die in school in university when I hope for future 
It's my right to be considered for my leader 
I can't life in the war in the border ,
