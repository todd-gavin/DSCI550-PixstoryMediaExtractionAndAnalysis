Iberian lynx are one of the world's most endangered cats due to habitat loss, decreasing food sources, car hits and illegal hunting.

But thanks to conservation efforts the species is recovering and can be found in small areas of Portugal and Spain.

Antonio captured this image while leading a conservation project based around photography in Pe√±alajo, Castilla La Mancha, Spain.

He knew a family of lynx used this waterhole to drink, so he rigged up a hide close by.

Focusing on this cub, he was lucky enough to capture the moment it lifted its head from the water, licked its lips and gazed straight into the camera.

Equipmemt used: Canon EOS R5 + 500mm f4 lens; 1/400 sec at f4; ISO 1600; hide.
