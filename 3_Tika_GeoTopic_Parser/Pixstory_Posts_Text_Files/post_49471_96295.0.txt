We do not inspect the kitchen when we enter a restaurant to ensure that sanitary standards are being met. We expect the government enacting dependable food safety regulations. We do not give credit bureaus our consent to gather and utilise our information. Instead, regulations compel bureaucracies to restrict access to our information and remedy any challenged errors. Why shouldn't the information we contribute to businesses, websites, and applications be safeguarded by law?

Companies should be required by new regulations to only use, disclose, and retain customer data for legal purposes. This would mean that personal data of consumers could only be processed in ways that are consistent with reasonable expectations established in their business interactions. This can be accomplished by restricting service providers to just collecting, creating, using, and sharing data that is required for or compatible with the services they are providing. Data should not be kept in identifiable form if it is no longer required for those legitimate purposes.

Nobody has the time to read all thay privacy policy of a company. And they shouldn't have to. The company that is asking for data must ensure the security and the privacy of its customers.
