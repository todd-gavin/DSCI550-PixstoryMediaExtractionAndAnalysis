While speaking with Pinkvilla, Sunny revealed how he always disliked the idea of remakes.“I always look for something different. I am fed up with making remakes, for instance. I must have done one or two of those. But, I prefer something fresh. Let us discover and see what it turns out to be. Most of the time when we do remakes also, they turn out to be messy because the (original) film had a soul. And somehow we missed that.”“When I came into the industry, my dad (Dharmendra), Amit Ji (Amitabh Bachchan), Shatru Ji (Shatrughan Sinha), all these actors were there. Cinema was of a different genre. And I came with Betaab, Arjun, Yateem and all these was different. I was enjoying doing that and was fortunate enough that the directors and writers were looking at that. They found me and I found them and it kind of moved ahead,” he said.
