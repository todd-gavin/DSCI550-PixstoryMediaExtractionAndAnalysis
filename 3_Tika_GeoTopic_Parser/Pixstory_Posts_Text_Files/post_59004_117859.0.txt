The counting of votes in the presidential election is being viewed as only a formality because Droupadi Murmu, who is supported by the NDA and several other parties, is expected to outperform Yashwant Sinha of the opposition by a wide margin. She will become the nation's first tribal leader.

As of this point in the counting of MP votes for India's 15th President, Droupadi Murmu is in the lead. Ms. Murmu received 540 of the 748 valid votes, while Yashwant Sinha received 204. These votes have a value of 5.2 lakh, or roughly half of the electoral college, according to a formula based on population and assembly seats; Ms. Murmu received 3.8 lakh votes, while Mr. Sinha received 1.4 lakh. The outcome is anticipated by 8 PM once the MLAs' votes have been counted as well.

Ms. Murmu is predicted to easily pass the necessary halfway point overall as she currently has 72% of the vote, a larger lead than anticipated. With that, India appears to be on track to elect its first tribal president and second woman overall.

The Rairangpur community in Odisha, where Ms. Murmu is from, is already jubilant. They have prepared 20,000 candies. Following the announcement of the results, a tribal dance and victory procession are planned.

Around 1:30 p.m., counting got under way at Parliament House. Voting commenced at 11 am, when all state-specific ballot boxes were opened and the count got underway.

After the results are announced, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is anticipated to pay a visit to Droupadi Murmu at her temporary residence in Teen Murti Marg to congratulate her, according to reports.
