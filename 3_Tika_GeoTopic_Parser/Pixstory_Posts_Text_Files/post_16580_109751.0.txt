Bobby Deol and Esha Gupta's Aashram 3 also remained to be a hit just like its previous instalments. The web series is available on MX Player and fans are in love with Bobby Deol's character of Baba. He is the Godman with extremely gray shades.🔥🔥

Apart from that In an interview with SpotboyE, Bobby Deol stated that he was nervous the first time while filming. But then he credited his co-star Esha Gupta for making it all easy for him. He stated that Esha Gupta was a thorough professional. He was quoted saying, "I remember the first time I did an intimate scene, I was very nervous. It was the first time that I was doing something like this. My co-actor (Esha ) was so professional, she was so much involved in how well to portray a character, and then it becomes easy. And that’s why people enjoyed it. The way Prakash Ji shot the scenes, the team did work so everything was put in the right sync."

The actor also revealed that he was nervous playing a negative character on screen.

After that interview with BollywoodLife, Esha Gupta was asked the same about intimate scenes 🔥

Her reply to Bollywoodlife 🎬

"There's nothing about being comfortable or uncomfortable when you have worked for like 10 years in the industry. People think intimacy is a problem but it's not, unless and until it's a problem in your real life. We are very open about it. The only thing is every scene is difficult, whether you're crying or driving on-screen. Maybe intimacy was difficult for me to shoot when I did it for the first time. But when you're shooting with good mature people and a nice actor around you, you don't have any problem. 

And abhi industry me rehte rehte now that people have been doing so much, I feel they don't show that much in OTT as compared to movies. So I don't think it has anything to do with intimacy. It's just that you feel happy about it or not."💝💝
