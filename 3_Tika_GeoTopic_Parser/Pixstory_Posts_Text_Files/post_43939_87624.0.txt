Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone was pelted with objects as he went to the tunnel after his side overcame Manchester United in the Champions League last 16 second game.

On Tuesday, Renan Lodi scored the game-winning goal in the first half, giving Spain a 1-0 (and 2-1 on aggregate) victory.
Supporters of the Red Devils at Old Trafford expressed their fury by pursuing Simeone, who evaded damage by darting out of their sight.

Ralf Rangnick's side had a miserable evening at Old Trafford as Renan Lodi's first-half header was enough to send Diego Simeone's side into the quarter-finals.
In the build-up to the goal, Anthony Elanga appeared to be fouled, but United lacked the spark at the other end needed to break down a determined Atletico.

United's limited chances of breaking their long trophy drought this season were dashed by the defeat, with goalkeeper David de Gea subsequently admitting: "There have been too many years without any trophies."

Rangnick on a night of frustration:
"I think we played a good first half," said Rangnick. "All those things we planned to do we did. The only thing we did not do was convert that energy into scoring the first goal ourselves. One thing we cannot do against Atletico is concede the first goal."

Rangnick was frustrated that the officials did not award the foul on Elanga in the build-up to the game's only goal. "I did not think we should have been 1-0 down," he said. "For me that was a foul on Elanga. That was the only really dangerous moment, apart from the offside goal that they scored," he said on BT Sport.

"We had one or two good moments where we should have scored. Conceding that counter-attacking goal before half time didn't make life any easier for us.

"In the second half it was difficult - it was always interrupted with somebody lying on the floor. [The ref] fell for those time-wasting antics and four minutes extra time was a joke."
