Fafda- jalebi is a match made in heaven and Gujaratis treat themselves with this great combination on Dussehra. But have you ever wondered why do they only consume these two food items as breakfast and nothing else?Because it's a belief! During Navratris, people follow a fast for straight nine days and it is said that this fast should only be broken by having something made out of gram flour. Fafda, being the most common snack of Gujarat, makes its way to every house on Dussehra.
