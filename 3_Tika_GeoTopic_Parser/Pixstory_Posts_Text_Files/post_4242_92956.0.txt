‌April is considered Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Everyone has to strive to create awareness of sexual assault every single day. This month remarks an annual campaign focusing on raising public awareness and educating communities to prevent sexual violence.
‌
‌What kind of awareness should be raised? Awareness should be raised to understand sexual assaults. Many don't even understand sexual assault and at times ignorance becomes bliss leading to psychological issues. Survivors should never be judged. Awareness should be given to children as many experiences sexual assault, at a very young age. And finally, sexual assault should be discussed among people of all sexual orientations. This is a vast topic and everyone is invited to join the discussion. Let's raise awareness and help in preventing sexual assault.
