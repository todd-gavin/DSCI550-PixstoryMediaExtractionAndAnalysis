Liverpool's star player Mohamed Salah has been told that he’s ‘frightened to death’ about Erling Haaland’s incredible goal-scoring rate this season.
Haaland, who moved to Manchester City this summer, has been enjoying time at his new home. The Norway international has already netted 15 goals in the Premier League, including three hat-tricks.
Salah, on the other hand, is having one of the worst seasons of his career as he has been able to score only two goals so far. He was even subbed off in Red’s 2-3 loss against the Gunners.
Former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrence believes that Salah is frightened to death about Haaland’s goal tally as he knows that he is not going to win the Golden Boot. Notably, Salah won the Premier League Golden Boot award last season.
“Take the likes of Salah, he’s just another one off the pace and at the moment everything he tries, nothing comes to fruition,” Lawrence told talkSPORT.
"He’s not suddenly become a bad player overnight. He’s probably frightened to death about the fact that Haaland’s already got so many goals, so he’s not going to win the Golden Boot,” he added.
Nothing going in Jurgen Klopp’s way
Jurgen Klopp is having a difficult time as a manager as his side are struggling to find form this season. In the domestic league points table, Liverpool are currently ranked 10th with only 10 points in eight games.
To add to this, winger Luis Diaz was ruled out of action until 2023 after he damaged his knee ligament in the clash against Arsenal. Defenders Joel Matip and Trent Alexander-Arnold will also miss two weeks of play.
Liverpool will lock horns with Rangers in the Champions League on Wednesday before heading into a much hyped clash against in-form Manchester City on October 16.
