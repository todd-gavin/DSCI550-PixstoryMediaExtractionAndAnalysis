‌In a world wherein people need to first for their identity each day; this Bill is depressing.
‌
‌The Parental Rights in Education bill, widely known as the 'Don't Say Gay Bill' was passed by Legislature of Florida. This Bill would limit discussions on sexual orientation or gender identity" in the state’s primary schools. The bill would also allow parents to sue school districts that fail to adhere to those rules.
‌
‌The Republican, Joe Harding, who introduced the bill called it "empowering the parents" and "improving the quality of life for the state's children". This is an typical example of the need for sex education in classes, or else even if you reach a prestigious position wherein you could make laws, you might not make sense!!
‌
‌Another Republican Dennis Baxley said to 'Miami Herald': Why is everybody now all about coming out when you're in school? And there really is a dynamic of concern of how much of these are genuine type of experiences and how many of them are just kids trying on different kinds of things they hear about,". He suggests the sexual orientation is just a joke and nothing else!! 
‌
‌This issue causes concern more because, this is a time wherein many Republican-controlled legislatures around the country have enacted measures targeting transgender youth, or banning books about sexual and racial identity.
‌
‌Older and Younger generations are suffering because of the lack of sex education and studies on gender identity. The constant confusion is because of the lack of knowledge. Any country's progress depends upon the rights of the citizens in the country. If marginalised sections remain oppressed can we can a country progressive? 
‌
‌The bill focuses on the parents' role in the sexuality of a child. What does the parent have to do with the sexuality of the children? They are the ones who had to lead a life, the choice is solely theirs. With the alarming rate of suicide among LGBTQ+ Youths, this is not a safe world for them. This could lead affect the mental health of the youths so roughly. The progress in the country I am afraid is backwards.
