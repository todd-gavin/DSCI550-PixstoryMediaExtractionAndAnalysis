A novel by Gillian Flynn Gone Girl tells the story of a frustrated housewife who fakes her death and watches from afar as her husband takes the fall only to later realise she can t live without him Gone Girl is one of my favourite novels of recent years a sensational story that works in many ways on many levels On a basic surface level it is a hugely entertaining read with endless twists and turns from beginning to end The novel is alive with big surprises both in terms of the plot itself and in terms of Flynn s framing of the story Amy and Nick are fascinating protagonists sharply drawn greatly flawed and relatable Must Read
