There are groups in UEFA Euro 2024 Qualifying Draw that are highly competitive. Then there is a group where there are two clear favorites to top the group stage. And then comes the group that has all the dark horses to qualify for the competition as well as be a contender to play for the title. One such group is Group D. 
Group D consists of the Runners-up of FIFA World Cup 2018, the neighbors of English, the darkhorse of Europe, Armenia and Latvia. Though Croatia look like one of the sides to top the group stage, they have stern resistance from Wales and Turkey. However, considering the form and the experienced pool available, we can expect them to finish the group stage on top of the table. 
Wales have failed to live up the hype in the past but their current exploits make them the strong contender for the automatic qualification for Euro 2024. The experience of Gareth Bale and youngsters experienced from various leagues across Europe will be key for the side. However, they are set to experience a challenge from Turkey. 
In the recently held UEFA Nations League, Turkey had four wins, a draw and a loss to their name. They registered a 6-0 win over Lithuania, raising eyebrows of the giants of football. They will hope to challenge Wales and Croatia for the automatic qualification. 
Armenia, in the recent times, have not achieved big but have the ambitions to mow down any side on their day. They could challenge for the playoffs spot that is available. On the other hand, Latvia are also a team that can give a stiff competition to any side. In their recent five fixtures, they have three wins, a draw and a loss.

#1) Croatia
#2) Wales
