Paris Saint Germain have announced the signing of Valencia midfielder Carlos Soler. The signing came in the final hours of the transfer window with Soler penning down a 5-year contract. PSG has to pay $18 million plus add-ons for his services.
Soler has spent his entire playing career at his hometown club. He joined the Valencia youth setup at the age of nine. He initially started as a striker before transitioning into an attacking midfielder before finally settling in as a central midfielder during his senior career. Ever since his promotion to the first team, the 25-year old has been a regular starter for Valencia. 
Since 2016, Soler has completed 226 games for Los che with impressive stats and also won the Copa Del Rey with them in 2019. His most prolific goal scoring seasons came in the last two campaigns with him returning 12 goals for his team. Soler had been scouted for a long time by major teams across Europe with teams like Liverpool FC also attempting to bring him in to solve their midfield problems.

Carlos Soler said, "I’m very happy! It’s a new adventure in my career. I feel very proud and I’m looking forward to starting work with my teammates, meeting them, and giving everything for this shirt. On Tuesday, we’re playing our first Champions League game at the Parc des Princes, and it’ll be an opportunity for me to get to know it. I’m certain that it’ll be a great party for everyone and for the fans.”
The Olympic silver medalist with Spain became the fourth midfielder and sixth overall player to join the French champions. PSG had already acquired the services of Vitinha, Renato Sanches and Fabian Ruiz. These signings have been majorly triggered due to players like Angel Di Maria, Georginio Wijnadlum getting released or loaned. 
With only a year left on his contract at Valencia the transfer seems like a fair offer for all parties involved.
