Went to watch BRAHMASTRA today It was mind blowing scrumptious and literally a visual feast you can t get enough of This movie has set the standards for future movies to come in terms of VFX in films Especially the ones accompanying the Astr s are very impactful and tastefully placed The spark has been lit and Ayan Mukherji has the opportunity to leave his mark on the industry with this Astr verse Finally the excellent VFX has arrived in Hindi Film industry it was a treat to watch and some of the scenes were so enthralling A wonderful and completely unexpect surprise cameo And a spoiler Amitabh Bachchan and Mouni Roy brought their characters to life in their performances Nagarjuna has a small albeit a very impactful role that he pulls off with the experience and practice the hallmark of a seasoned actor
