“The solution of arming teachers, in my opinion, is further disrespect to a profession that’s already beleaguered and not feeling the support of so many folks,” Education Secretary Miguel Cardona told lawmakers on Capitol Hill last week. “We need to make sure we’re empowering our teachers to be successful at teaching our children.”

Teachers are supposed to teach kids, it's not their job to go face to face with a shooter. It's the police's responsibility which they very conveniently failed to do.

Not to mention, allowing guns in school is such a bizarre idea. You just never know who turns back and carries out an act like that. If a gunman coming from outside, passing by police officers can easily carry out such a massacre, just imagine what one who is legally sitting inside a school with a gun could do. Before people could even know, he'd have taken too many lives.

“Bringing more guns into schools makes schools more dangerous and does nothing to shield our students and educators from gun violence,” National Education Association President Becky Pringle said in a statement. “We need fewer guns in schools, not more. Teachers should be teaching, not acting as armed security guards.”

The country needs stricter gun laws and school needs more mental health support. We have to work as a team where the law and the culture both work in harmony to prevent such acts.
