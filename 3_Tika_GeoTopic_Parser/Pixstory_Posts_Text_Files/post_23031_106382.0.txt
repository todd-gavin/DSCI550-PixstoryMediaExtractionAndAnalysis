Manchester United’s Academy player Poppy Lawson has taken the next step in her career and has signed her first professional contract with Scottish Women's Premier League side Hibernian on a 2-year deal. BBC journalist Emma Sanders first reported this news on June 08th. Poppy’s new club Hibernian finished fourth in the 2021/22 SWPL season under head coach Dean Gibson. 

Poppy Lawson is a name most of us have heard. For those who haven’t, Poppy has been at the club for 12 years and was a part of Manchester United U-21s. She was the captain of the famous CHARLOTTE HEALY’S CLASS OF 22’ which ended up clinching the double in the 2021/22 season - FAWSL Academy League Cup and FAWSL Academy League. An important part of the youth set-up, Poppy has been at the club since she was 6 years old and is adored by the fans who actively follow the women’s academy. After the official announcement of her move to Hibernian, the U-21s captain thanked United fans on Twitter: “I just want to say a massive thank you to all the fans that supported me every single week, your support doesn’t go unnoticed and I will forever remember all of you.”

Still only 18 years old, the no nonsense CB has a bright future ahead of her. It was always guesstimated that Poppy would play senior team football next season. She has proved that she is too good for the academy league and deserves first team football. Like journalist Jamie Spencer of 90min mentioned in his latest tweet - maybe she isn’t ready for United’s senior team as of now; you cannot expect her to wait around for the opportunity to strike. 

United fans took to twitter to wish Poppy best of luck as she leaves United after almost a decade. Poppy & her teammates have written their names into United's history books after winning two trophies this season.

This is not a GOODBYE. This is just a SEE YOU LATER until WE MEET AGAIN!
