During the pandemic, as we spent most of our time in a place called home, I couldn’t help but wonder which place to call home. It wasn’t simply a matter of where I lived. 

Is home the house where I grew up? Is it where my loved ones are, although they are now in more places than one. 
Is it the place where I feel most at home, even when it’s not my own home? 

So, is home a feeling, a place (or two), or is it an imagination of unconditional love and acceptance that we sometimes find in a place and sometimes in a person?

What is home for you?
