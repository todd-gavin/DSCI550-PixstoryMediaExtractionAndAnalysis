The dreams that vied to touch the skies of glory, the mettle to face the heat of rivalries;
Roger, you've had it all, Roger you've aced the ball,
A ball kid who dreamt to rule the gentleman's sport, 
From the ashes of abstraction, rose a phoenix on the court;
Pursuit of a life that spanned 24 years and 1500 matches,
Had moments of pride, joy and tears in all the clashes, 
Only a lucky few get to get the love of the world,
You, be the only one who, ruled the tennis kingdom for 6 years and all well earned,
No eye could ever miss the magician's dance on the court,
Only you, had the might to defend against every attack on your fort, 
The man who taught the world to make the sweat your fate in summer,
From Rafa to Novak, every great name turned from being a foe to your lover,
Someone whose career was much more than the numbers,
The world's going to miss their favourite till nothing less than the final slumber, 
With a smile that personified life in a nutshell,
Roger, your bid adieu to the tennis world has left everyone teary-eyed in the hope to find another ball kid who'd keep the world tied like a team huddle;
Roger, you've had it all, Roger you've aced the ball...
So, as all good things come to an end, likewise, the career of the greatest ever to grace the game of tennis has been turned into a book of memories now. The gentleman who held his own like a north star has had a career that's a testimony to the culture of sports.
Thank you Roger for a tennis experience to last a lifetime. You have been the greatest blessing to the world of sports. May the world get to see more Roger Federers' in the time to come who would bring nothing but love and smiles through the grace of their game.
Tennis won't be the same without you!
