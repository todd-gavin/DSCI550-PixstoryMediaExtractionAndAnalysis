I'M NOWHERE 

I'm here
I'm there,
I'm nowhere,
The floating clouds cajole me,
I get carried far away
On an unknown journey,.
Wearied eyes droop in deep slumber,
I search for your wide shoulders,
But are you here?
Are you there?
I see you nowhere.
The evening sky in a sombre mood
Expands whimsically till the horizon,
Little pink here, little blue there,
In between the dark canvas absolutely blank,
I fill it in with my emptiness,
I'm here,
I'm there ,
I'm nowhere.
