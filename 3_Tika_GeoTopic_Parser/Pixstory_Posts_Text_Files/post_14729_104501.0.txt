Diabetes is the major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attack, and stroke. It is estimated that the number of people affected by diabetes will rise to 700 million by 2045. This has led the World Health Organization to consider diabetes an epidemic.

The next generation of diabetes treatments involve overriding glucose absorption in the kidneys, an uptick in gut hormones, and ditching the finger prick.

Ditching the Finger Prick

Forget the multiple-times-a-day finger prick tests that many diabetes patients need to check their blood sugar levels. In the future, tracking blood sugar may be as simple as inserting a contact lens.

In, type 1 diabetes, replacing missing cells with cell therapy is being approched.

Although still in the very early stages of development, cell therapy is one of the biggest hopes towards developing a cure for diabetes, especially for type 1 diabetes. Replacing the missing insulin-producing cells could potentially recover normal insulin production and cure patients.

Attacking the origin with immunotherapy

Early after diagnosis, between three to six months, it is estimated that around 10% of the insulin-producing cells are still alive and producing insulin. After stopping the autoimmune process, the remaining beta cells would be protected and could continue producing insulin.
