High dietary fibre, protein as well as minerals such as manganese, magnesium, iron and copper make paratha made with this flour waist-friendly and heart-healthy.‚ù§Ô∏è
Stuffing plays a central role in deciding how healthy the paratha will be. Instead of the usual aloo or paneer, it is important to choose healthier fillings such as soya, sattu (ground black chickpeas), broccoli, mixed veg, tofu, dal, eggs, mixed sprouts etc. In this way, you will not only have healthier parathas for breakfast but you will also have a tasty variety to choose from every day. While using veggie filling for your parathas, make sure that the ratio of veggies is more than that of the dough.
