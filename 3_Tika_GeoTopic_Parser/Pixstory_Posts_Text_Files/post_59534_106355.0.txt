The Chinese Air Force has more than quadrupled the deployment of fighter aircraft at its main station near Indian territory, amid claims by an American military officer that the situation along the Eastern Ladakh region is worrying. 

During the conflict, the Chinese Air Force operates from its major base in Hotan. They presently have roughly 25 fighter planes stationed there. Top government sources told India Today that this is significantly more than they used to store. 

They stated that Indian officials are closely watching the situation and that the Indian agencies in charge are prepared for any scenario. 

China is also building a new fighter aircraft facility in Shakche, which will help the Chinese Air Force along the Line of Actual Control with India.
