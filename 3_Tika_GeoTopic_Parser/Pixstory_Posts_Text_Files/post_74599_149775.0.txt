Raju Srivastava’s family held a prayer meeting in Mumbai on Sunday in memory of the late comedian. Several of Srivastava’s friends and colleagues from the industry attended the prayer meeting. 💔Among others, Kapil Sharma, Bharti Singh, Johnny Lever, Neil Nitin Mukesh, Kay Kay Menon, Ehsaan Qureshi and Kiku Sharda were snapped by the paparazzi as they arrived to pay their respects to the late comedian. However, there is one video from the prayer meet that has left everyone teary-eyed. 💔💔💔A video of Raju’s wife crying inconsolably has gone viral on social media. She said in Hindi, “Kya bolu… kuch bolne ko nahi reh gaya hai. Meri toh zindagi chali gayi.” Shikha further said, “Sab logon ne bahut prayer ki, doctors ne bhi puri koshish ki… hum sab ne bahut koshish ki… hum sab ko bahut hasaya. 💔Upar ja ke waha bhi hasaye sab ko, khush rahe shanti se rahe. Thank You so much.” (There is nothing left to say. My life has ended now. Everyone prayed for him, doctors also tried their best, we all tried our best. They all made us laugh and I am sure in heaven too they are making everyone laugh. Rest in peace. Thank you! His friends have supported us a lot).💔💔💔💔💔
