open minded
doesn't mean that you are putting
your own thoughts and beliefs to the
side, but rather being able to listen to
someone without judgement, criticism
or pushing your own perspective on
them.
It can be a beautiful thing that even
when you disagree with someone, that
your conversation is understanding
and thought provoking.
Today, I hope you become a little more
open-minded when you speak to
someone, no matter the place, to
where you leave the conversation
learning something new rather than
changing your mood.
