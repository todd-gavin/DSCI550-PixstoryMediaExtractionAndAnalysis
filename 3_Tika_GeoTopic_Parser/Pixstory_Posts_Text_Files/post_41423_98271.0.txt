The US State Department verified to USA TODAY Sports that Brittney Griner has been classed by the Russian government as being "wrongfully detained." 

Griner, the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury's All-Star centre, was arrested and imprisoned in February after the Russian Federal Customs Service stated they found cannabis oil cartridges in her carry-on luggage. A charge of narcotics smuggling can result in a prison sentence of up to ten years. 

Griner's reclassification was confirmed by a state department spokesman, who also stated that "the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad is among the highest priorities of the United States Government" and that the US government will "continue to undertake efforts to provide appropriate support to Ms. Griner."

The government's new designation could signal a change in tactics for bringing Griner home. Her hearing is scheduled for May 19.
