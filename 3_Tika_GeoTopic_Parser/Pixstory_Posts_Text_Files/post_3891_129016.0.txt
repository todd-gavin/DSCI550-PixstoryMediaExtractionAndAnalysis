We make amendments for the people we love the most, thinking that it would be the right way, perhaps we might not even think that if we are happy even. 

In this process of making change for others don't loose yourself in it. At the end we would end up harming our true self by doing things we don't like. 

Once we had bloomed but if we allow ourself to get plucked away it is just us who is going to fade away, moments after enforcing the change upon us.
