According to RMC Sport (h/t Daily Mail), Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel is interested in signing his former player Layvin Kurzawa from Paris Saint-Germain on a loan deal. 

Blues star Ben Chilwell injured his ACL and has been ruled out for the rest of the season. This injury blow has created a lot of pressure on Tuchel, who currently has to make do with Marcos Alonso. The Spaniard is the only recognized option at left wing-back available at the moment. 

Chelsea failed to sign Lucas Digne and couldn’t reach a compensation agreement with Lyon to recall loanee Emerson Palmieri. With two weeks remaining in the January transfer window, the pressure is building on the manager as, without a viable backup, he faces a difficult second half to the season. 

The German manager successfully called back Kenedy, who was on loan at Flamengo. However, the Brazilian hasn’t played a single professional game for our team since 2016 and therefore, it’s unclear how he would adapt to the current situation. 

Now, it is believed that Chelsea have identified PSG star Layvin Kurzawa for the wing-back role. According to the report, the Blues have already initiated a discussion with PSG regarding a loan move for the French international. 

Kurzawa has fallen down the pecking order under new manager Mauricio Pochettino. He is currently struggling for game time and has made just one appearance across all competitions this season. The 29-year-old was an important player under Thomas Tuchel and a regular starter during the German’s reign at the Parc des Princes. It remains to be seen if a reunion is on the cards at Stamford Bridge.
