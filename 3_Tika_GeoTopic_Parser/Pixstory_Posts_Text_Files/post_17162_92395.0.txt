On the guest list were also her ex husband Hrithik Roshan and his rumoured girlfriend Saba Azad. Susssanne's rumoured boyfriend Arslan Goni was her plus one for the event. On Wednesday night, Sussanne shared a couple of pictures from the bash that also feature Hrithik and Saba. She captioned the post: "The most precious blessing of Life is to be relentlessly surrounded by the best energy... And it definitely takes a whole Village to make a girls dream come true.. So Here goes to my incredible Village of The best hearts."
