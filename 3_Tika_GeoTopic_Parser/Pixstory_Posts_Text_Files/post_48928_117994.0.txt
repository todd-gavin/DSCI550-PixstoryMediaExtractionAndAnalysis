I think it was pretty clear in 2022 why people replicate stuff. It's not a new concept, it's been here since forever.

There are vegans from all parts of the world. They have their cultures, they grew up eating certain foods, they are accustomed to certain tastes. They don't hate their culture or their food, they are just not fond of the cruelty behind it. They veganize their food to be able to live in touch with their culture without going against their personal morals.

In fact most vegans love the taste of the food they grew up with, they just learnt what goes on behind the dark walls and they just don't want to contribute to it.

Why can't we stick to the food we have? For the same reason why non-vegans can't stick to the food they have. It's human nature to want to discover new things. Vegans just want veganism to be accessible to everyone so at the personal level, they are doing their level best. It's not that deep, it's just vegan pasta.

Oh, by the way, pasta is vegan anyway.
