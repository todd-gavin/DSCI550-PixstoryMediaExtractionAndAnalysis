The six-wheeled robot will start climbing up an ancient delta structure in the crater where it landed on Tuesday. 

BBC reported that it will travel uphill, stopping sometimes to inspect rocks that appear to have the best potential of preserving traces of past life on the planet. 

Perseverance will collect some of these rocks on its trip down, depositing the samples at the delta's base for following missions to retrieve. 
In the 2030s, the intention is to bring this material down to Earth for a thorough examination.

â€œThe delta in Jezero Crater is the main astrobiology target of Perseverance," said deputy project scientist, Dr Katie Stack Morgan.
"These are the rocks that we think likely have the highest potential for containing signs of ancient life and can also tell us about the climate of Mars and how this has evolved over time," she told BBC News.

Last February, the rover landed spectacularly in the midst of Mars' 45-kilometer-wide Jezero Crater. 
It's been putting its tools and instruments to the test, flying an experimental mini-helicopter, and getting a sense of its surroundings since then.
