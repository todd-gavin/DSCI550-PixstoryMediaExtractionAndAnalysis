Manchester United defeated Everton 2-1 thanks to the 700th club goal of Cristiano Ronaldo's career, who came off the bench.
The achievement that the Portugal captain accomplished in his team's victory on Sunday has never been accomplished by a player in the history of the sport.
Ten Hag congratulated Ronaldo on his accomplishment and made a hint that he would have a larger part to play in his future plans.
"Scoring 700 goals is a tremendous performance. Since he had to wait for it, I'm really happy for him and commend him on his performance. I'm also glad it was his first Premier League goal this year, and I'm confident there will be more. Ten Hag commented.

Bruno Fernandes -
‚ÄúIt is tough still counting goals for Ronaldo because every week seems like a new record,‚Äù
"I am really happy because he has been working hard to get this goal. Today he got the goal and the win and that is the most important for him, that the team won."
Casemiro -
‚ÄúHe gives you a lot of goals, he is a winner, he is a leader,‚Äù
"He is so important for us. We approached each other because of the language, too. Since the first day here, he has helped me with everything. He is helping me a lot. I really hope he stays with us.‚Äù
