WWE Raw star Riddle has been having a great year. First, the star found tag team success in an unlikely pairing with Randy Orton in RK-Bro until an injury to The Viper cut their run short.

However, this led to opportunities for the former United States Champion as a singles competitor. Continuing his rivalry with The Bloodline allowed him to earn a shot against Undisputed WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns. Although Riddle couldn’t end Reigns’ dominant run, he pushed the Tribal Chief to the limit.


So Seth ‘Freakin’ Rollins is probably one of the best, greatest wrestlers to be doing it right now in this era and to be on the SummerSlam card against Seth Rollins, dude, there’s nothing — other than fighting for a world title or something like that, there’s nothing bigger than going against one of the best in the world at one of the biggest shows in the world in the biggest company in the world so, pretty, pretty excited bro. Plus, we’re going to Nashville. It’s a pretty fun town.”
