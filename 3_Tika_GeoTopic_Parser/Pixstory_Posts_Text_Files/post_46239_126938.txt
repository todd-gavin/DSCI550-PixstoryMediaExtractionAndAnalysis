I belong to an indian household and i know how the day begins with a piping hot and big cup of tea along with newspaper Well Are you amongst those millions of people who take tea as first thing in the morning While we all consider it as a healthy practice But the truth is this is unhealthy practice Today i will tell you some reasons why you must avoid starting your day with tea It disturbs your acid and alkaline balance It can also inhibit absorption of nutrients It can also lead to dehydration causing constipation Initially giving up this habit which you have been following for years might be difficult but definitely not impossible I m not saying you to give up this addiction of having tea completely but try making these small changes Begin your day with glasses of water and have tea mins later Cut down a portion of tea by having it in a small cup and not a mug Stop taking biscuit and rusks along and replace it with soaked almonds and walnut kernels I m really not a fan of tea and being honest i don t start my day with tea not even with coffee I start my day with water and having water is much better than having tea Remember It s all about starting and that s the hardest part Have a nice day everyone
