This is a problem with a lot of people. In fact, sometimes even with me. I love buying and trying out new skincare routines and products.

But the thing is, it's not good for your skin. Not only constantly changing products will not give enough time to your routine to bring a change but will also expose your skin to different sorts of chemicals in a short span of time. And rest assured, that's not what you want for your skin. Your body has a way of protecting itself against new chemicals and in return tend to react to them. 

So before changing your routine, finish the current one first. But it's also good on your budget.
