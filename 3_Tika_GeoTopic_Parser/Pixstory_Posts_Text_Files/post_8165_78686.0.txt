The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres once again stated an urgent need for the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan to be upheld.

The Secretary-general wrote on Twitter: “In Afghanistan, women and girls are once again being denied their rights to education, employment, and equal justice. To demonstrate a real commitment to be a part of the global community, the Taliban must recognize and uphold the basic human rights that belong to every girl and woman.”

Female employees working for the previous government said they have not been able to return to their offices since the Islamic Emirate took power over five months ago.

Monesa Mubarez, who completed her master’s degree in international relations, worked for the former government and the World Bank for a decade.

Mubarez worked at the Ministry of Finance (MoI) when the former government collapsed. “I have contacts and even requested online working since the government's policy led by the Taliban is not clear over the fate of women’s working, so I have not received any response yet,” said Monesa Mubarez.

Many women and girls who lost their jobs are the only breadwinners for their families or were assisting their families financially.

“Family members including women and children are not in good condition, facing health and mental problems, families have not received salaries,” said Shiba Raoofi, an employee of the former government.

In the meantime, officials of the Islamic Emirate say the government is seeking to create a mechanism facilitating women’s employment so women can return to offices.

“After making a mechanism and a good system for women’s work, women will be allowed to work in various sections,” said Bilal Karimi, deputy spokesman of the Islamic Emirate.
