📍Solving the Sanitation Problem for Women.

Safe water access, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) are the most basic building blocks for empowering women everywhere. The three go hand in hand; to truly solve the sanitation problem for women, you need all three.

•At the most basic level, here’s what it takes to provide proper sanitation for women:

1) A toilet with dignity➖

•Building and using a simple pit or pour-flush toilet separates people from poop, drastically decreasing diseases in communities and schools. It also provides safety and dignity for women, giving them a place to go so they no longer have to wait until dark or expose themselves during the day.

2) A hand washing facility➖

•For women cleaning up after small children in rural communities, hand washing is critical to health.
Plus, access to soap and water allows women and girls to keep themselves clean while menstruating.

3) A safe water source➖

•Safe water is vital to sanitation. Without it, bathrooms and dishes can’t be cleaned, and hands can’t be washed properly. Plus, safe water close by provides relief for women and girls who are often tasked with the burden of carrying heavy loads of water to and from the source.

4) A drying rack➖

•Washing dishes and drying them in the sun, away from animals, helps stop the spread of harmful pathogens. A dish drying rack built from local materials improves sanitation for entire families.

5) Menstruation Hygiene Management (MHM) Training➖

•Women and girls experiencing shame for menstruation cycles or who are unaware of how to best care for themselves during their periods face great challenges. Solving the sanitation crisis for women everywhere means changing the narrative about menstruation.

Through Menstruation Hygiene Management Training for girls in schools, available female hygiene products in schools, and lessons on menstruation hygiene management for women in communities, women and girls become confident and capable of managing this very normal, healthy part of life.
