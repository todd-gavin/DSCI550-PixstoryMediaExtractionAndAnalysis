Two juxtaposed photographs are viral on social media with the following claim – “Father married his own daughter so mother got furious and married her own son.” The pictures show persons hailing from the Muslim community posing for the camera with garlands around their necks.

The image was shared on a Facebook group called ‘We Support Nupur Sharma’ and drew over 2,000 likes.

It was also shared on a Facebook page named ‘The Right Action‘. Most pages and individuals on Facebook have shared a screenshot of a tweet by curlykrazy07 carrying the images. The tweet stands deleted but an archived link can be accessed here.

The same images were earlier shared in April with a Hindi caption making an identical claim. Twitter handle Singhjyoti_ was among those who shared the pictures back then.

This is a photo of a man wearing a skullcap and a girl in a burqa. The duo is wearing garlands around their necks. Last year, it was claimed that the man got married to his nine-year-old daughter. A verified Twitter handle ‘@rakesh_bstpyp’ shared this picture with this claim. This user describes himself as an ‘editor of a newspaper’. The tweet amassed over 1,300 retweets before it was deleted.

One Lalita Thakur also tweeted the photo and accompanying claim. Her Twitter bio states that she is a Modi supporter. The viral caption makes a comparison between Muslims and Hindus. It implies that Muslim men marry minor girls whereas Hindus regard minor girls as deities.

The image was widespread on Facebook and Twitter last year.

Alt News discovered that the same image was circulating back in 2017. It was claimed that a maulvi in Pakistan married his own daughter.

Fact-check

We performed a reverse image search and found the original photo on a Facebook post dated September 23, 2018. The post says that a father and daughter who finished reciting the Quran together from memory were photographed together.
