An $8 million, 16-event tour will be the highlight of Australia's next, largest-ever golf season, which will begin in October. 

Fox Sports reported that the Australian Open will return to the summer schedule, which the PGA of Australia announced on Thursday and has risen from 12 events in 2019â€“20. 

The possibility of well-known Australian athletes choosing to play on home soil after the epidemic ruined possibilities over the previous two summers supports the announcement.

The Australian Open and Australian PGA Championship are scheduled to feature world No. 2 Cameron Smith and fellow countryman Marc Leishman. 

Top-50 performer While No. 66 Min Woo Lee will compete at the Australian PGA Championship, Lucas Herbert has already committed to playing both marquee Australian competitions.
