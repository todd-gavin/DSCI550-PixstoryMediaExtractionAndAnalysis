I got my first bicycle when I was in 8th class and I treated it like my car with an instant chance for freedom!

My father bought me and used to take me every evening to the park and taught me how to ride it. He appreciates me in every step of learning, taught me that it's okay to fall in the process, it's part of the learning.

Bicycle signifies a lot of things for me. It's a part of my childhood memories and part of my upbringing.
