The challenge to grand theories related to Feminism has generated a rich understanding of the heterogeneity of human experiences thus inviting the discussion of new perspectives and conceptual frameworks.  Simmering  Silences and Beneath: An Anthology of Gender Issues in India edited by three academicians  Dr. Zeenat  Khan, Pallavi  Kapila and Urvi Sharma aims to provide a solid foundation for countering the conventional interpretive approaches that often reinforce gender hierarchies and inequalities to pave way for new conceptual approaches and frameworks that will decide the future of Gender Studies.
