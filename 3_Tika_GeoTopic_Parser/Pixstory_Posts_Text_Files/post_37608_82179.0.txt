India win the First t20 match with 6 wickets.
India won the toss at Eden Gardens and Rohit Sharma opted to bowl first. Ravi Bishnoi the young Indian bowler making his debut was a star performer from the Indian bowling unit returning exceptional figures of 4-17-2. Harshal Patel was relatively expensive on the runs side but also managed to get 2 wickets. Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Deepak Chahar and Yuzi Chahal all picked up 1 wickets each as West Indies put up 157 runs on board. Nicholas Pooran scored an impressive 61 runs off of 43 balls with Pollard also hitting a quick 24 in the death overs.

Indian batsmen started good with Rohit Sharma opening with his Mumbai Indians teammate Ishan Kishan. Rohit scored a brilliant 40 off just 19 balls setting the pace for the rest but Ishan Kishan and Virat Kohli going off in quick sessions, Rishab Pant and Suryakumar Yadav were faced with a tough challenge. Rishab Pant got out to a smart short ball as he knicked the ball to an easy soft dismissal which saw Cottrell celebrate Pant's wicket in his signature style. 

The experienced Suryakumar Yadav did not make any mistakes though as his quick start helped him gain momentum and with the help of Venkatesh Iyer, they both sealed the victory. SKY scored a quick 34 off just 18 balls hitting 6 boundaries (5- 4's 1-6) in doing so. 

The toss may have been a deciding factor considering how the West Indies bowlers faced issues with the dew setting in but that doesn't take away any credit from the impressive batting perform tonight.
