As vital as following a skin care regimen is, maintaining a decent hair care routine maintains your hair silky, healthy, and free of infections, greasiness, and other issues is just as important.

You may do a lot of things to improve the appearance of your hair. I'd advise beginning by shampooing your hair with a product designed for your particular hair type. Sulfate- or silicone-containing shampoos can dry up and frizz up your hair. As an alternative, you can try rinsing with diluted apple cider vinegar after shampooing.

Long-term hair tying might eventually lead to hair loss and breakage of the hair, even receding of your hairline. This occurs as a result of the roots being continuously plucked, which finally leads them to break. So try not to tie your hair too tight.

One really great tip Indian and African women have for their healthy hair is regular oiling. I have made a post about the black castor oil already, other than that warm coconut oil nourishes your hair from deep within. Onion juice is another magic ingredient found in a lot of ethnic haircare routines. It stinks, but it does the work and does it quite well. Onion oil is a natural cleanser.

Rice water is another ingredient that Asian women have used for generations to have silky, long, healthy hair. Rice water is concentrated with amino acids, many different kinds of vitamins and other great nutrients that your hair just loves!
