It is far too soon to be talking about a proposed guided walk and huts for Tasmania's south-west, Aboriginal organisations say. 

Experience Co is pushing ahead with the proposal for a seven-day, six-night guided walk with catering, which would include the building of six walkers' huts from Cox Bight to South Cape Bay on the South Coast Track (SCT) within the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (TWWHA)

It is an area with sites of "immense importance" to Aboriginal Tasmanians, according to an archaeologist who reviewed the proposal.

A draft reserve activity assessment prepared as part of the original proposal, and released under Right to Information (RTI) legislation, said the South Coast Track had "only been open to a relatively elite group" of experienced, self-reliant walkers.

"The proposal aims to allow the SCT to be accessible [to] those many walkers with a desire to experience the magnificent wilderness of the TWWHA but who are less able to carry the heavy pack required by independent walkers," the document said.

Further documents obtained by the ABC under RTI legislation included a letter from archaeologist Samuel Dix about the Aboriginal heritage sites in the area.

"These sites are of immense importance to the Aboriginal community," Mr Dix wrote. 

"Due to the nature of the proposed works, much of the area where the proponent wants to establish new tracks and erect huts has never been surveyed for Aboriginal heritage.

"Due to the number of sites recorded thus far, the probability of further rock art sites, and the strong cultural ties to the area (including traditional stories and ethnographic accounts of those of those who originally lived in the area), an Aboriginal heritage investigation is therefore required to identify whether the proposed project or related infrastructure will impact on any Aboriginal heritage and to offer mitigation advice."

An Experience Co spokeswoman said: "We acknowledge the importance of this project and respect the steps that need to be undertaken.
