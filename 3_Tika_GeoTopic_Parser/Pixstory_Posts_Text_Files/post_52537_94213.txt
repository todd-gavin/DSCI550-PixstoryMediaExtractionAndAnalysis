Christianity is considered as the largest religion in the world With percentage of the entire world s population which is nearly around billion people following it One of the important festival celebrated by the christians is Easter Jesus was sentenced to death by crucifixion for claiming to be the Son of God Easter Sunday marks the resurrection of Jesus Christ after being crucified Easter is a holy festival of joy and happiness But with this joy there are also things which get ignored in the name of joy Some places have the culture of gifting rabbits to their children as a sign of happiness to make their day memorable But do we know that rabbits are very fragile animals and they need proper care and attention If not looked properly they can die within days And that s what happens after the Easter Some of them automatically die or We either drop them around Either way they are dead By several reports and facts eventually a number of bunnies die after Easter every year All per the old times due to mythical believes there was a ritual of sacrificing animals to make the gods happy But in the modern world we try to prevent that But gifting bunnies in the name of Easter is nearly the same as sacrificing animals in the name of festivals Because ultimately they die Here we don t kill them directly But the whole process will make them dead anyway We must understand that gifting bunnies are not at all appropriate They are animals not any material which can be used as gifting in bulk We must not try harming bunnies or any other animal That is totally unethical We should start thinking in a broader sense and start celebrating it in a more civilised manner Let s try to make this Easter a happy one but without causing any harm to the cute bunnies Happy Easter everyone
