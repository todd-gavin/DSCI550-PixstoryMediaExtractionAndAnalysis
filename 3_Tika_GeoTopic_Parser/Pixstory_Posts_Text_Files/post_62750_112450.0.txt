Escapism.

"Escapism is mental diversion from unpleasant or boring aspects of daily life, typically through activities involving imagination or entertainment. Escapism may be used to occupy one's self away from persistent feelings of depression or general sadness." That is how Wikipedia describes it.

Most people, if not all, engage in escapism. In fact most forms of entertainment is created for that. So that you could forget the hardships of your life for a little while. People find it in different things. Some binge-watch tv shows, some go swimming, others go driving or stargazing. There are some truly unhealthy ways too, like drug or alcohol addiction, sex addiction, engaging in fights. Anything that takes you away from the realities of life.

Mine has been reading. Somewhere laying in the middle of healthy and unhealthy. It doesn't hurt me, it doesn't hurt anybody else but it makes reality a white noise in the background. If I have a book in my hand that I truly enjoy, the world could end by the last chapter and I wouldn't care.

Reading is escapism for me because I am not thinking about all the other things that invade my mind and I can let my mind to have time off from reality. I read to experience other worlds and other lives, when I manage to get completely lost in a story or a character, especially one that I can relate to. It's an amazing feeling. An all consuming feeling that lingers around for a while. It's sometimes even saddening when that world ends. I read because I can live someone else's life for a while and experience their emotions â€“ gives me a break from my own. It used to be really easy to get lost in a book when I was younger, now , however the age and experience really catch up but it still happens, sometimes and it's a wait that's worth it.
