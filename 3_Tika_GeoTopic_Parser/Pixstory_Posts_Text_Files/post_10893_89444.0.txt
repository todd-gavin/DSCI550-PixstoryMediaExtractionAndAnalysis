Czech footballer Barbora Votíková’s journey with Paris Saint-Germain Féminine started in August 2021. The 25-year-old goalkeeper’s illustrative career includes playing with Viktoria Plzeň, followed by her Champions League debut and winning seven titles with SK Slavia Praha. As Barbora continues to sport jersey #20 for Les Rouge et Bleu this season, follow the goalkeeper’s biography below:

Barbora’s commitment to catching the ball started at the age of eight, when she played for the boy’s team in her hometown Pilsen, a city in western Czech Republic. The goalkeeper’s mother and grandfather, who have had their own experiences with sports, have been instrumental in supporting her football career.

“My grandpa was taking a lot of care and was putting a lot of time and effort into me, because he used to play football, so we were talking about football all the time. He was kind of like my mentor in football," she says.

The goalkeeper’s career quickly progressed to playing with SK Slavia Praha, which created a new set of professional opportunities.

“With Slavia I made a lot of successes -- we won the championship three times, we played Champions League, we made it twice to quarterfinals which was really a big success,” Barbora says.

Becoming a part of the PSG team has created new paths in Barbora’s understanding of the sport, and has motivated her to share these with her Czech Republic Women's National Football Team.

“My understanding of the team is different than it used to be before,” Barbora says. “My girls' national team is not that experienced, so I'm trying to bring it there."
