At the end of the season, Andrea Dovizioso will bid his official farewell to MotoGP. The decision from the rider from Forl√¨ arrived during a year for Yamaha RNF to be really stingy with satisfactions with his place in the general standings and a constant presence in the bottom positions of the standings. The year-old explained the his decision I will definitely not race in MotoGP next year there is no reason to do so I have always said that I would not have stayed if I had not been competitive and I have never looked for a saddle because when you struggle you don&#39;t enjoy MotoGP has changed rivals have changed the different way of riding there are many small reasons and if you put it all together what is happening to me right now happens Dovizioso in MotoGP has collected victories and three second place finishes in the standings at the end of the championship
