“The story of the liberation of Lyman in the Donetsk region has now become the most popular in the media,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly address.
“But the successes of our soldiers are not limited to Lyman,” he added without providing any details.
According to the President the soldiers' achievements go beyond simply recapturing Lyman. It's interesting to think what he must have been implying. Is there another counter due?
