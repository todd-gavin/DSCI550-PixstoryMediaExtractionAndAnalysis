The head of the World Health Organisation WHO has issued a warning to world leaders that the coronavirus pandemic is nowhere near over Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus cautioned against the assumption that the newly dominant Omicron variant is significantly milder and has eliminated the threat posed by the virus The intervention comes as some European nations saw record new case numbers France reported nearly half a million new daily cases on Tuesday For the first time since the start of the pandemic more than new infections were recorded in Germany within hours on Wednesday Speaking during a news conference at the WHO s headquarters in Geneva Dr Tedros told reporters that the Omicron variant had led to million new infections across the world over the past week While the variant may prove to be less severe on average the narrative that it is a mild disease is misleading he said Make no mistake Omicron is causing hospitalisations and deaths and even the less severe cases are inundating health facilities He warned global leaders that with the incredible growth of Omicron globally new variants are likely to emerge which is why tracking and assessment remain critical I remain particularly concerned about many countries that have low vaccination rates as people are many times more at risk of severe illness and death if they are unvaccinated he added The WHO s emergencies director Dr Mike Ryan also warned that Omicron s increased transmissibility is likely to drive a rise in hospitalisations and deaths especially in nations where fewer people are vaccinated An exponential rise in cases regardless of the severity of the individual variants leads to inevitable increase in hospitalisations and deaths he said Source BBC News
