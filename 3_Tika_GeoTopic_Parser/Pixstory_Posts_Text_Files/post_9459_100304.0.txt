When I first watched Modern Love series inspired from the New York Times column, one story –When The Doorman Is Your Main Man – snatched me completely. Till last scene, I was clueless but that statement from Guzmin to Maggie, ‘ I was seeing your eyes’ - you call it a moment! That’s the power of John Camey’s direction.

So, how does it feel when ML hit Mumbai. The first series in the anthology is out on Amazon. Six stories in different avatars of love. Trust me, brilliant directors and a careful casting make each story worth a watch. It’s a happy note at a time OTTs churn out anthologies.

Let me start with my favourite – My Beautiful Wrinkles
You don’t get to see Sarika often on screen. If she comes, she wins. In this beautiful story of old women and their love perspectives, Dilbur demands your attention in every frame. Script is unbiased to explore some ageless, true feelings and how elegantly it can be handled, if you prefer to.

Raat Rani – Beautiful in one word. Hats off to Fatima Sana Shaikh for her wonderful character transformation. Shonali Bose has tried to depict an unusual story of regaining oneself after hearing from someone you most love, I am not interested in you anymore, one day. A raw character, grow in slow pace and turn into a revolution herself.

I Love Thane – directed by Little Things fame Dhruv, it brings out a new flavour to love or dating. There is lag, especially actors have nothing exciting to share on screen. It’s much internal. Howmuchever modern you are, sometimes, you succumb to a pure, genuine heart. Then the city still remains hopeful. After Masaba Masaba, Masaba Gupta comes again.  

Cutting Chai – I like Chitrangda Singh’s presence on screen. When it coupled with Arshad Warsi, felt very charming. It’s about fading love in 40s. New direction mode from Nupur Asthana.

Mumbai Dragon –A mother’s love encages his son. It’s hard to say no and it’s hard to live with it. Sui rocks- Vishal Bhardwaj 

Baai – Nothing new
