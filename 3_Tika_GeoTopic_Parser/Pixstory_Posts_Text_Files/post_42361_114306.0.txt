The official trailer of Christian Bale’s new movie “Amsterdam” is out and after watching the trailer, one thing I want to say is that if everything goes in the right direction then this movie will be a sure-shot blockbuster.

The cast of the movie is top-notch which includes Margot Robbie, Chris Rock, Anya Taylor Joy, Taylor Swift, Rami Malek and Robert De Niro.

The movie will hit the theatres in November 2022.
