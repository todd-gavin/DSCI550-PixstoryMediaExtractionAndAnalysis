Russian TV journalist Marina Ovsyannikova, born in Ukraine, who has been put on Moscow's wanted list after escaping from pretrial house arrest, came to international prominence in March after she protested against the war in Ukraine on a live TV news programme and made an anti-war video.
On March 16, 44-year-old Ovsyannikova held up an anti-war banner in an on-air protest on Russia's Channel One.
The sign read "Stop the war. Don't believe the propaganda. They're lying to you," Additionally, she screamed phrases decrying Russia's invasion of Ukraine. As a result of the incident becoming widely publicized, the editor has also been charged with unlawful protest.
She said she had been questioned for 14 hours and not slept for two days, and was not given access to legal help. The journalist was hit with a fine of £210.   
Ovsyannikova refused to remain quiet and set about staging further protests in spite of the government's crackdown on anti-war activists. 
Images posted to the journalist's official Facebook account in September showed her sat in a courtroom, having doodled a sign which read 'no to mobilization'. 
'I, like millions of mothers in Russia, did not give birth to my son for him to go to war. All human life is precious. We gave birth to our sons to make scientific discoveries, fly to the stars, design new cities, build houses and bridges,' the social media post read.
