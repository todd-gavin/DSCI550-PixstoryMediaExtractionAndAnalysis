Governor Greg Abbott of Texas recently signed an executive order that will designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorists in the state of Texas. This comes in the wake of the fentanyl Crisis where these cartels have been mixing lethal amount of fentanyl in illegal drugs, importing them to the United States, and killing thousandsAbbott wrote a letter to Biden urging him to take similar action. The letter read, in part, “Fentanyl is a scourge that is killing thousands of Americans. Drug cartels are the major suppliers of this substance. And the problem is a national emergency.”Under federal law, terrorism is defined as “the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.” So, while Mexican drug cartels certainly do a lot of harm and must be stopped, they don’t necessarily fit within the definition of terrorism.In any case, this is a step in the right direction. Fentanyl overdoses have claimed the lives of so many and will continue to do so unless something is done.
