Selena Gomez, the actress and singer have opened up on her mental health journey. As she shared her story she encouraged others to share their stories as well and make the awareness into action of mental health. 

Gomez implemented the first ever Mental Health Youth Action Forum. The forum focuses on the youth mental health crises that's affecting more than a third of high school students. 

Selena said that sharing her own story was freeing her. 

“I heard a phrase actually recently that I really like, ‘That which is mentionable becomes manageable,’” she said during the event, according to Rolling Stone. 

“I felt like once I found out what was going on mentally, I found that there was more freedom for me to be OK with what I had,” she said, “Because I was learning about it.” 

Gomez had discussed her bipolar disorder diagnosis before and took the lead for mental health awareness. 

“Bringing attention to mental health through media or just talking about your own journeys can help,” she added. “It sets the example that it’s a topic that can and should be discussed freely and without shame.” 

She hopes for the Mental Health Youth Action Forum and other events that can bring changes and development of accessible, resources and culturally relevant services for the young group of people. 

“I want to ensure that everyone, no matter their age, their race, religion, sexual orientation, has access to services that support their mental health,” she said. 

The event involved inputs from young content creators who shared their battle with depression and suicide. They motivated others to come forward and speak out their experiences which will bring change. Destigmatizing mental health is what Biden believes that needs to be done. 

“The darkness inside of us can feel heavy at times, but we can share the weight of it together,” she said. “It takes courage to be honest about the struggles that you’ve faced and to tell your stories.”
