The world of anime/manga contains some of the worst and some of the best characters. What makes a good character? Well this is a complex topic and consists of multiple factors. These include artistry, personality, story, impact, legacy etc. But many characters have that, and in abundant amount. So what makes a good anime/manga character worthy of recognition of being among the best?
 
For that, we are looking for something special in these characters that surpasses even artistry. We are looking for an emotional connection from them which made them special for their time; unique and just all around powerful.
 
Sure, there are many anime characters who are wildly famous and provide the money engine for a jazzed up commercial success, but sales and marketing don't make a character great, and commercial success and popularity does not equal to quality writing. Skillful writing, design, and ingenuity make a character great.  
 
If the worst characters make you want to pull your hair out due to their complete lack of personality, then the greatest of them must stick out due to the sheer depth of their personalities and stories.
