Starting out with shooting for me was a case of chance but very few things after that were I started shooting years back in my father s friend s range Truth be told I did not even know what shooting was then I had heard of Abhinav Bindra but I was not aware of the scope this game has and its sheer magnanimity Only after playing more and going to more games did I develop a passion for the game I guess you could say it was destiny because even back when I started out I knew that I wanted to get into sports However the only options I was considering were cricket and football From the very first day my parents have been in the frame cheering for me as loud as humanly possible They ve supported me in all my decisions My mother who was a high school teacher procured a voluntary retirement merely so she could help me with my career My dad despite having to stay home while I travel with my mom for different tournaments still helps out as much as he can During the pandemic we built a small range in our house so I could continue practice I will eternally be thankful to them for all their efforts in making me who I am I will always be grateful for my journey in sports What started by chance is now a life changer
