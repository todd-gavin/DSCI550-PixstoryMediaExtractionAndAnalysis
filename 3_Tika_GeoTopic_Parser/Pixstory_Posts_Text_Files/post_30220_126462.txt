Atalanta passes through the Sampdoria field and the new Serie AL championship gets off to a great start coach Gian Piero Gasperini very satisfied with this victory Winning in Genoa with Sampdoria on this field and with this crowd never easy for anyone It was important to win the victory these are heavy points that arrived after a difficult game Sampdoria could have drawn it was a difficult challenge but Atalanta were also able to offer football We still lack something This team I have to thank these guys who have a huge attachment to the shirt You can&#39;t always win all much more difficult than in the past The team did not dominate the match but knew how to play its match carefully I can only thank the boys I give a very high mark for these even if we can and must improve on a technical level A test is scheduled next week very interesting for Atalanta with the home match against Milan
