Recently, a video of Akhilesh Yadav has been making the rounds on social media. In the footage, Yadav can be heard saying, “Those who want to take the law into their own hands should vote for the Samajwadi Party. Those who want to mistreat the poor should vote for the Samajwadi Party.” After the purported statement, a graphic appears that reads, “Wahi Hawa Hain ~ Wahi SP Hai. Dangaiyon ka haath, apradhiyon ka saath.” This roughly translates to – “The SP is supported by rioters and criminals”. This video is being shared against the backdrop of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections.

Numerous other users posted this video on Facebook.

The video also made its way to Twitter.

However, unlike the video in circulation, Akhilesh Yadav is heard saying, “Those who want to take the law into their own hands should not vote for the Samajwadi Party. Those who want to mistreat the poor should not vote for the Samajwadi Party.” The footage was taken during a public meeting held by the SP at Auraiya. Yadav had called out the BJP in his speech while addressing the gathering.
