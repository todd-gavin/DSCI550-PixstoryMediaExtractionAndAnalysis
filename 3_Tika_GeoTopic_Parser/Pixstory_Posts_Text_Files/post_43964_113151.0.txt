Gabriel Jesus has joined Arsenal on a long-term deal from Manchester City, the north London
Premier League team said on Monday. However, British media stated that the 25-year-old Brazil
international was signed in a deal worth 45 million pounds ($54.54 million).

Gabriel has won the FA Cup, League Cup, and the Premier League four times each. He has
made 56 appearances and scored 19 goals for the Brazil national team since making his full
international debut for his nation in September 2016. He was a part of the team that won the
2019 Copa America. Gabriel has distinguished himself during his international career by winning
a gold medal at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games and participating in the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

With a youth contract signed in 2013, Gabriel began his development through Palmeiras' youth
programme. His prolific goal-scoring enabled him to advance rapidly to the first team, where he
made his debut in March 2015 at the age of 17. In 2016, when Palmeiras won the Campeonato
Brasileiro Serie A, Gabriel was a key member of the team and was chosen as the league's Bola
de Ouro - Player of the Season.

Gabriel previously played for Mikel Arteta while the Spaniard served as Pep Guardiola's coach
at City from 2016 to 2019. Gabriel will soon resume preseason training with the Gunners team
and wear the number 9 jersey.

Arteta on Gabriel Jesus Joining Arsenal:

“I’m very excited. The club has done a tremendous job to recruit a player of this stature. I know
Gabriel personally very well, and we all know him well from his time in the Premier League and
being really successful here.”
