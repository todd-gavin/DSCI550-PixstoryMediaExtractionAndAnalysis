It is on parents to decide and understand the criticality of such situations Separation comes with its own downfall No one should be biased enough to selfishly think about themselves without even considering what and how others related to them would be feeling A relationship is formed with a lot of mutual understanding and maturity marriage instead bolsters it with validation and law And someone who has decided to become a parent after marriage should think of all the repercussions that will affect the child Just giving birth to a child is not necessary adhering to the duties is also essential If a couple decides to have a child they should think countless times before thinking about ending their marriage I mean it takes a toll on them Their life is completely devastated trying to believe the fact that their parents are no longer together As a result their future relationship is also harmed because they don t develop an emotional or psychological understanding of marriage Instead their parents have already portrayed themselves as a bad example making it easier for children to end their future bonds without even ruminating about it for a while I think parents should think of all the cons before actually deciding to get separated
