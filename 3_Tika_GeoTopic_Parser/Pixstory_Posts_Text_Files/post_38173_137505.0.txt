Liverpool came ever so close to clinching the Premier League and the Champions League titles last season. But having fallen short, Jurgen Klopp tried to maintain stability in his squad.
Players who joined Liverpool: Darwin Nunez, Arthur (on loan), Calvin Ramsey
Players who left Liverpool: Sadio Mane, Minamino, Divock Origi, etc. 
The Reds started the 2022 summer transfer window with heartache as they lost Sadio Mane to Bayern Munich. The Senegalese international was integral to the squad and Jurgen Klopp replaced him with Benfica's sharpshooter Darwin Nunez. 
The Uruguayan striker has scored 2 goals in 4 appearances to date. However, Nunez is yet to settle in with the squad and he needs to start firing ASAP considering the bad start that the Reds have endured. 
Signing Arthur on loan from Juventus was certainly a masterstroke by Jurgen Klopp. The Reds now have the necessary backup in their midfield in case of injuries in the course of the season.
Weaknesses: Liverpool look sturdy once again. However, apart from the Bournemouth game, the Reds have not been at their attacking best as Salah is going through a silent period. Not enough backup on the wings could lead to Liverpool's downfall. 
Rating Liverpool's 2022 Summer Transfer Window Activity: 6/10
