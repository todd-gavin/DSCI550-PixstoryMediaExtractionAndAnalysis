Writing helps me express my thoughts and emotions. Much of my career leans towards writing too. Even so, I have struggled with writer's block quite often. Personally, some of these tips really helped me overcome the block. 

1. Write whatever: My teacher back in school told me to write whatever I felt like regardless of it having any structure. So, write whatever comes to your mind without thinking too much about grammar and stuff.

2. The 5 minute rule: Scrolling through Instagram, I came across this post prompting people to do a task immediately if you know would not take more than 5 minutes. I jotted down any brilliant prompts I felt I can work on later immediately on my mobile when thoughts occurred to me.

3. Inspiration: Change of sceneries does wonders. Travelling has given me so much inspiration that it's hard to resist writing in general. If that's not possible for you, try asking a friend for a different perspective or tell them to give you ideas you can execute.

4. Appreciate: It's so easy to criticize ourselves, that we forget to appreciate the positive things about us. Don't be too harsh on yourself if you're unable to write. Try writing as much as you can. Any amount of progress is still progress! üôåüèº
