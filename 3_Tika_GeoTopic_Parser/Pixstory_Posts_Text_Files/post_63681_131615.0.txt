The Batman has without a doubt been one of the most successful and brilliant films of the year, even more so within the DC fandom as Matt Reeves’s new take on the Dark Knight was a breath of fresh air for many comic lovers as he delivered a tasty new neo noir detective action film instead of your standard superhero film.
Nonetheless the fate of the Caped Crusader is shrouded in a black flag as some of WB Discovery is going through a bit of an uncertain phase, canceling some of its high budget productions either under production or completed such as Batgirl and Wonder Twins.
According to Deadline, WB have given Reeves a first-look film deal, which appears to confirm that the sequel is actually happening. The deal will give the studio first-look rights to Reeves’ work as a writer, producer, and/or director. "Making this legendary studio my home is a dream," said Reeves in a statement. "I am so excited to be working with Mike, Pam, and Channing and our teams to bring captivating stories I am truly passionate about to the big and small screen."
Reeves' new deal has also confirmed that we're still getting the much talked about Penguin TV series starring Colin Farrell and the Arkham Asylum show, with Reeves creating both of them. "Pam and I gratefully inherited the relationship with Matt from The Batman, and through the beginning stages of planning The Penguin series for HBO Max," De Luca said. 
"We were excited to nail down his overall deal because it's a cornerstone of what we want to do with the filmmakers that are working at the studio... Keeping Matt and creating a home for him to do more projects in the Batman universe but also originals, was very important to us."
