IN PRIYA DUTT’S OWN WORDS:

Dad was born on 6 June 1929 in Jhelum, Pakistan in a wealthy family of zamindars. He lost his father (Diwan Raghunath Dutt) when he was five. The Partition took place when he was in his late teens. He was away from home the day when his father’s Muslim friend Yakub helped Dad’s mother (Kulwantidevi Dutt ) his sister Rani and brother Som get on the train to India. Dad went looking for them in every refugee camp. It was like finding a needle in a haystack. Till one day, he found them. Though he witnessed the mayhem, Partition didn’t leave him bitter. He realised there was tragedy and loss on either side.

Dad came to Mumbai to avail of better education. He wanted to join Jai Hind College, which had seats reserved for refugees. But the places were full. But he didn’t give up. He kept visiting the Principal’s office till the gentleman relented. He did odd jobs while studying. Like that of a radio host (for the show Lux Ke Sitare) on Radio Ceylon. He was also part of the engineering division of the B.E.S.T. where he recorded the mileage covered by buses. After graduation, he moved to films and debuted with Railway Platform (1955).

Even before he became an actor, he was a huge fan of my mother, Nargis. During his college days, he’d wait endlessly outside Mom’s house at Marine Drive just to catch a glimpse of her driving away in her Riley car. Of course, much has been written about the fire that broke on the set of Mother India (1957), a film they were cast in, and how Dad rescued Mom. “I would have saved anyone else in her place. I fell in love with the woman she was,” was his take. Eventually, the two got married in 1958.
