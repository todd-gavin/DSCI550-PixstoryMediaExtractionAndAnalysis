Reports compiled, and analyses carried out by various institutes have projected a grim scenario on the status of forests in Assam.

Assam’s pristine and ancient rain forests are being systematically wiped out by the mafia backed allegedly by a section of government officials. The government displayed an indifferent attitude to check the loot.

The illegal felling of trees in the Northeastern states has been on a rise for the past many decades, but it gathered steam over the past couple of years, an official with the state forest department claimed. Reports compiled, and analyses carried out by various institutes have projected a grim scenario on the status of forests in Assam.

According to the data mapped by Global Forest Watch, a repository of forest data worldwide, the loss of tree cover in the Northeast amounts to over 70% of all tree loss in the country that occurred between 2001 and 2018. The net loss of tree cover between 2000 – 2018 in India is 16,744 sq km, out of which 74.7% is from Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and others – amounting to 12,523 sq km.

On top of the chart is Assam for the period between 2001 and 2018 with 2388.46 sq km tree cover loss, while Mizoram lost maximum trees between 2013 and 2018, spanning an area of 1392 sq km.

Assam, over the years has been seeing a steady decline in its first cover. For instance, the Sonai Rupai Wildlife Sanctuary is a protected area in Assam, which is located at the foothills of the Great Himalayan Range. Four rivers flow through this sanctuary and the place was once rich in various species of flora and fauna that is hard to find elsewhere. But this place too has today become a hotspot of rampant illegal felling of trees and encroachment.
