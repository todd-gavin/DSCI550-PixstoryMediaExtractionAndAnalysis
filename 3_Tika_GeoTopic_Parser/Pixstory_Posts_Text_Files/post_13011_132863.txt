 Afghanistan is a country of failed processes and many suppressed dreams Women s equality with men and their equal presence in society without discrimination is considered one of these For years it has been felt that the women of our country have taken a powerful step towards the realization of their human and citizenship rights and freedoms and they are diligently trying to continue this path to the desired destination which is to achieve gender equality But in the meantime there are always many ups and downs and ups and downs that highlight the danger of repeating past failures and falling into regression While analyzing this situation this short article tries to create a conscious and original fight against superficial slogans and dangerous short sightedness Gender discrimination between women and men in Afghanistan is a dependent variable of countless independent variables all of which are connected in a logical chain and play their part in this historical inequality The successful fight against this phenomenon before anything else should focus on deep awareness and strategic foresight Because incomplete awareness and superficiality as experienced can lead this struggle to deviant and incorrect paths or at least by adding to the difficulties of the road lead to the useless depletion of justice seeking and egalitarian forces Without compliments it should be understood that achieving equality between men and women is a rocky road full of mountains and obstacles Walking such a path is not possible with slogans shows and philosophical debates nor with relying solely on the material assistance and support of the world community Certainly in this struggle millions of Afghan men are addressed who do not necessarily have the ability to understand intellectual discussions and acts nor have a positive view of the liberating support of the international community Foreign support for improving the status of Afghan women can be effective and fruitful only when the twists and turns and difficulties of this path are fully understood by Afghan men and women who want justice and the right way to overcome them Photo Archive
