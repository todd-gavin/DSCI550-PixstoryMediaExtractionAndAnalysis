It may feel safer to keep our emotions close to our chests, but it isn't necessarily the best way to live. This strategy keeps us from talking about our wants (which can become a recurrent problem) and from actually connecting with others. In the long run, suppressing emotions might have unintended consequences for our mental and physical health.

Why do we tend to keep our emotions bottled up?
We feel forced to suppress our emotions in a variety of situations. For example, we may simply want to get through the day, telling ourselves that we'll deal with the emotion later, believing that the emotion isn't worth examining, or attempting to hide our emotions in order to make a relationship “work." In the end, though, we tend to bottle up our emotions for one major reason: it appears to be easier and safer to do so.
Why Hiding Our Emotions Can Be Harmful
Though suppressing our emotions may seem like a good idea in the short term, it might have the following consequences:

Stresses Our Emotional Well-Being
Dismissing our own sentiments on a regular basis might have a negative impact on our self-esteem. Over time, we may begin to believe that no one is concerned about our wants or desires, and that our voice or opinion is unimportant.

It can also make us feel worried, depressed, or stressed. We may become enraged or enraged, and generate feelings of hatred toward others in some instances.

Our Physical Health is jeopardized
According to Dr. Mullen, "there is some evidence that suppressing your emotions might lead to physical stress on the body." "Stress causes the body to become more vulnerable to diabetes and heart disease." Memory problems are another possible side effect.”
Our Social Relationships are Undermined
Social ties that are nourishing are essential to our general well-being. After all, we are, at our core, social creatures. Our relationships cannot grow in a meaningful way if we do not effectively express ourselves.
