This is literally one of my favorite memes and I believe you need this on your timeline But on a more serious note telling girls no man will ever want to marry you as an insult or threat will only result in either of the two consequences Either your little girl will become too submissive for her own good and start putting her self worth in other people s hands OR she will despise the very idea of having a partner If you find your daughter doing something that s wrong choose better words to address that Like what you did was wrong because so you shouldn t be doing that That s not how good kids behave Teach her to be confident in herself not to put her worth in a man s hands
