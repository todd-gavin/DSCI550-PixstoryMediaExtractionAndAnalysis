Stamford Bridge hosts a re-match of last year's Champions League semi final on Wednesday night. Thomas Tuchel's side welcome Real Madrid for the second time in the past year.

 Many might remember last year's clash for Chelsea's ruthless performance, or Eden Hazard's post-game controversies but a lot has changed in the time since.


Real Madrid came out victorious in Laliga Santander last weekend, in a game at Balaidos that could've gone either way. That is, if Madrid had a different keeper in goal. With Thibaut Courtois between the sticks, Celta left the game without much to look back at except several refereeing decisions that went Real's way.


This was by no means a one-off. Courtois has kept his side in the game week in week out this season. He is, undoubtedly in the conversation for one of the best keepers in the world. As will be certain when he faces his former club in the Champions League. 


Thibaut for one, isn't a stranger to being booed by opposition fans — having been jeered off by Atlético Madrid supporters previously. However, he asks for the Stamford Bridge faithful to treat him with respect. 


"I hope that they (supporters) don't boo me, but you never know. I hope it's a happy return to Stamford Bridge. We're now rivals. They'll want to win and the same goes for me.


"So I'm not expecting any applause from the fans."


The Belgian International is mid-way through his fourth season at the Bernabéu. Bar a rough first year, his performances have only improved the quality of his team's results. A reception at the Bridge wasn't quite in the books in last year's game, when Madrid lost in front of an empty Stamford Bridge.


Courtois returns to London for a second time since his 2018 departure, while Eden Hazard and Mateo Kovacic may play versus their former teams too. Exciting stuff.
