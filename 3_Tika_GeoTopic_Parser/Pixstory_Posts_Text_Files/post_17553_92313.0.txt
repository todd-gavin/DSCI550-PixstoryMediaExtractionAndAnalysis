Anthony Davis returned from his foot injury last week, hoping to help the Los Angeles Lakers qualify for the Play-In Tournament. But that goal is now unattainable after L.A. lost 121-110 to the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday.

The Lakers’ loss combined with the San Antonio Spurs’ win over the Denver Nuggets officially ruled the Purple and Gold out from playoff contention. L.A. has three more games left in the schedule but nothing to play for, as they have traded all of their 2022 draft picks.

But Davis doesn’t yet know whether he will sit the remaining games out now that the Lakers’ season is effectively over — even though he confirms his foot still hurts.

“A little more sore than normal tonight, it swelled up a little bit tonight throughout the course of the game,” Davis said of his foot after the game.

“It is what it is. As far as the final three, I don’t know. I’m not sure yet.”

Davis seemed to be in pain during all of the three games he has played since returning. He also regularly adjusted his shoe during timeouts.

But even though he wasn’t fully fit, the 29-year-old forward still impressed, averaging 24.0 points, 11.3 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 1.3 steals and 1.3 blocks over the last week.
