Let's take a break and look at the big picture. 

Around the world, low- and middle-income countries are struggling with a deepening crisis driven by three factors. 

They are the pandemic, the rising cost of servicing their debt in the wake of falling revenues and the increase in food and fuel prices further aggrevated by  Ukraine crisis. 

David Malpass, the World Bank’s president, explained his concerns at the organisation’s spring meeting last month. “I’m deeply concerned about developing countries,” Malpass said. “They are facing sudden price increases for energy, fertiliser and food, and the likelihood of interest rate increases. Each one hits them hard.” 

In ther words, this crisis is both coming in the long time and inefficient handling of situations.
