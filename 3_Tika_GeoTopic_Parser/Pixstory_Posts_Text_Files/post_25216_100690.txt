So I want to share a hack or a trick which helped me lot during lockdown Being a part of the debating society in the online mode we used to get just days to prepare for a debate which made it really difficult to write it and the memorize all the content So what I used to do is I used transparent notes on my laptop so nobody got to know if I was reading from the note because I had to look at the screen anyway during meetings It might be called cheating but sometimes everyone needs a little help no
