A recent Gallup poll shows that only 31 percent of Afghans believe that women in their country are treated with respect and dignity. This figure reached 44% in 2019.

In this survey, people's satisfaction with life is classified as "suffering".

Gallup says the 13% drop in the status of women in society between 2019 and 2021 was the biggest decline to date.

In 2021, for the first time in the history of Gallup polls in Afghanistan, a majority of men (more than 60 percent) and women (nearly 75 percent) agreed that women should not be treated with respect and dignity, the report said.

In previous years, however, most men felt that women were treated with respect and dignity.

According to the survey, only 26 percent of women and 37 percent of men said that women are treated with respect and dignity. In 2019, 29 percent of women and 59 percent of men in Afghanistan believed that women in their country were being treated with respect.

The survey, conducted from August 9 to September 29, 2021 by telephone in Afghanistan, polled 2002 people of all ages.

The report also points to a lack of access to food and shelter, and says most men and women suffer from lack of access to food and shelter. Gallup statistics show that 82% of women and 69% of men said that last year was a day when they could not prepare food.

According to the poll, a majority of Afghans (87 percent) said their current income did not meet their needs. Only 12 percent said they had an easier life with their current income level.

Also, 6 out of 10 Afghans will not be able to provide adequate shelter for their families in 2021.

In this survey, 96% of women and 92% of men describe their life situation as very bad, and the score they gave to their life satisfaction in the survey is classified as "suffering".

Gallup is one of the most well-known polling organizations in the world, which annually reports on people's satisfaction with their lives based on their own perceptions.
