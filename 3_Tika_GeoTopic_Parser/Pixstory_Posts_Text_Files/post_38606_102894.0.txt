Possession

The Argentinian is a ball-playing defender progressing the ball from the back. He is calm and composed in the back which helps him in dictating the play. His positional awareness and the vigour to win the ball, allows him to move the ball forward and play slick passes to his teammates in the form of long diagonal passes, key passes, progressive passes etc. 

In his previous season, he has been deployed as a deep-lying midfielder, and that role helped him to shield the ball in tight areas.
