The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) warned on Sunday that more than 12 million Syrian children in Syria and other countries in the region are in dire need of humanitarian assistance. According to the organization, international funding for these children has declined over the past decade.

More than 6.5 million children inside Syria are in need of help, the largest number since the start of the country's bloody civil war in 2011.

 "The needs of these children are increasing inside Syria and in the countries of the region," said a UNICEF Middle East official. "Food prices, one of which is due to the Ukraine war, have risen sharply, and many Syrian families are now struggling to make ends meet."

"5.8 million displaced Syrian children in neighboring countries, struggling with fragility and political instability, live in poverty and hardship."

UNICEF says it is facing a lack of funding to help these children.
