Irene Gakwa moved to the United States from Kenya; however, after starting a relationship with a man she came across on craigslist, she disappeared with no trace of her whereabouts and just scant circumstantial evidence implicating a person in her disappearance. 

Nathan Hightman, the man Ms. Gakwa met on Craigslist, was arrested and charged with several credit card fraud-related charges for accessing and spending money from Ms. Gakwa's accounts. He is also said to have accessed and deleted her email accounts. 

While Hightman has not yet been charged in connection with Gatwa's disappearance, the authorities are actively probing his different transactions and location data. Prior to her disappearance, the closest they have come to a smoking gun is the purchase of boots and a shovel from Walmart. 

This is a horrifying circumstance that no individual or parent should ever have to suffer. Gatwa's parents continue to reside in Kenya, hundreds of miles away with no effective means of searching for her. While there is still no sign of her death, the prognosis is becoming increasingly bleak as the days pass. I wish that her family finds peace, in whatever form that may take.
