This is getting so infuriating with every judgement. 

The whole system was down in the gutter, we had already known that, and we had accepted it. But even the justice system!????? 

Roe vs Wade getting overturned, coz crusty old men thought that women shouldn't have autonomy on their body. 

And now this??? Really, abuse happening multiple times is a hostile environment, but if it's done once, it's completely alright!?? 

What kind of logic is that? Who made these people judges of the court? Do they not understand that logic should prevail over the laws.????
