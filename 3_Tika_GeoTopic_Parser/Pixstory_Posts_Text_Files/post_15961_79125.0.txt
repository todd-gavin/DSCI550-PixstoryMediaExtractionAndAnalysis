Abstract 

Aims 

In March and April 2020, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, our previous survey of Italian pediatric diabetes centers showed that 75% of telemedicine use was voluntary. We hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic has acted as a picklock to overcome barriers to telemedicine regulation, use, and reimbursement. 

Methods 

Between March 22nd and April 12th, 2021, the same survey administered in 2020 was sent to all 68 Italian pediatric diabetes centers belonging to the Italian Society for Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes (ISPED) to collect data on the demographic variables of respondents; information about the center; the use, codification, and reimbursement of telemedicine; and used tools. Descriptive data were evaluated to establish how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed telemedicine practice. 

Results 

Eighty-two percent of responder centers reported an increase in the use of telemedicine, with televisits by video calling implemented in over half of centers. There was a significant increase in the number of centers formally tracking telemedicine use and obtaining reimbursement from the national health service (42% vs. 29% and 62% vs. 32%; p < 0.001, respectively). No reimbursement was provided to centers not using televisits. 

Conclusions 

From a voluntary procedure with a lack of traceability, telemedicine has become a new structured reality that may help our pediatric patients beyond this pandemic.
