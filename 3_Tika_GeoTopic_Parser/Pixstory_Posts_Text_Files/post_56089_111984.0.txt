I Grant You Ample Leave
BY GEORGE ELIOT

"I grant you ample leave
To use the hoary formula 'I am'
Naming the emptiness where thought is not;
But fill the void with definition, 'I'
Will be no more a datum than the words
You link false inference with, the 'Since' & 'so'
That, true or not, make up the atom-whirl.
Resolve your 'Ego', it is all one web
With vibrant ether clotted into worlds:
Your subject, self, or self-assertive 'I'
Turns nought but object, melts to molecules,
Is stripped from naked Being with the rest
Of those rag-garments named the Universe.
Or if, in strife to keep your 'Ego' strong
You make it weaver of the etherial light,
Space, motion, solids & the dream of Time —
Why, still 'tis Being looking from the dark,
The core, the centre of your consciousness,
That notes your bubble-world: sense, pleasure, pain,
What are they but a shifting otherness,
Phantasmal flux of moments? —"


According to the poetry foundation, Eliot manages to bring together most of the buds of her thought on understanding, consciousness, and language, creating in 21 short lines a stunning garland of intellect, argument, and hypotheses. 

While the poem addresses themes found in her long poem “A College Breakfast-Party,” and even touches upon some of the great debates in Middlemarch, the brevity of “I Grant You Ample Leave” powers it forward.

 Its dense compactness, adept treatment of the scientific language, and startling rhymes demonstrate an understanding of poetry’s potential to affect “complex relations” in a form that feels shockingly modern—especially coming from the woman who, for many, epitomized Victorian high-minded sincerity.
