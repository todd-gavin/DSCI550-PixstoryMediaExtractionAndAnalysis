Liverpool are set to snatch the signing of Luis Diaz ahead of Tottenham Hotspur.

Incredibly reliable transfer expert Fabrizio Romano revealed on the 28th of January that the Reds were closing on the Colombian winger.

Liverpool have offered 40million Euros plus 25million Euros in bonuses, which works out as about Â£54.11million.

It seems as if talks are coming to a conclusion, and the Reds are set to add yet another quality attacking player to their squad.

What might make it even sweeter for the Reds is that it appears as if they have snatched the 25-year-old from Spurs.

According to Romano, Antonio Conte's side were in talks for the Colombian winger and had their opening bid rejected, but Jurgen Klopp's men appear to have stolen Diaz.

Now, this could be an incredible deal.

The winger has made 28 appearances this season in which he has scored an incredible 16 goals and provided six assists.

If we compare this with other players in Klopp's squad, we can see that Diaz would be the second-top goalscorer and fourth-highest assist provider (BBC).

If this deal goes through, Liverpool will have an embarrassment of riches to pick from as they look to make a late title push.

Diaz is arguably one of the most in-form players in Europe, so the prospect of him linking up with Mohamed Salah and Diogo Jota should excite Liverpool fans around the world.

You have to credit the Reds for the speed they have moved to gazump Spurs, and it looks as if it is only going to be a matter of time until Diaz becomes a new Liverpool player.

This is an exciting deal, and I can't wait to see what Klopp does with him.
