Harry Styles released his third studio album Harry s house In may He has had amazing success in that album One of the songs on the album Keep Driving has tugged at my heart strings and I cannot move past it Harrys sings A small concern with how the engine sounds We held darkness in withheld clouds I would ask Should we just keep driving The song is so beautiful and talks about a relationship that feels suffocating but we still endure it coz we cannot live without it Styles uses the metaphor of engine sound to compare it with relationship problems and not breaking up as driving on The master of words has crafted an amazing piece of art in Keep Driving
