McLaren revealed a bold and aggressive updated livery on their new car on February 11, as the Formula 1 giants bid for a fast start to the sport's new era.

Taking the wraps off at their Technology Centre base, the team unveiled a new design - due to F1's regulations overhaul - and a new colour scheme on the car they insist is "real" and ready for pre-season testing. The MCL36 look has taken inspiration from McLaren's retro Gulf Oil livery from Monaco last year, combining 'Fluro Papaya' with a lighter blue. It was described as "aggressive" by young British star Lando Norris.

"We wanted something that was very vibrant," added McLaren CEO Zak Brown. "The livery changes we did last year - both in Monaco and in Abu Dhabi - we got a lot of great fan reaction and they like to see a lot of energy.

"I think it's got speed and elegance to it that we thought would go on top of the fast race car that hopefully we've designed this year."


AlphaTauri
AlphaTauri revealed the first images of their car, the AT03, on Valentine's Day.

Revealing a revised blue and white livery as they kickstarted their campaign with a digital launch and video, AlphaTauri will hope the new-look car builds on a very promising 2021 this year, the first of the sport's new era.

AlphaTauri, who were formerly known as Toro Rosso before a name change in 2020 to push the Red Bull-owned fashion brand, finished sixth in the championship last season, although their car - particularly in the hands of Gasly - was regularly a top-10 contender.

"Once again, we have worked closely with AlphaTauri to launch our new car and I think we've managed to deliver something very special."
