The United Nations population fund has announced that women and girls need immediate and serious care after the earthquake disaster in Khost and Paktika provinces.

The United Nations Population Fund tweeted that out of 5 women in earthquake -stricken areas, 3 tons are in the last three months of their pregnancy, which is expected to be delivered in the next three months.

According to the organization, women are now living under tents and far from health services and are at particular risk.

Concerns about the lack of health services to pregnant women and girls in earthquake -prone areas are raised as they did not have much access to health services before the earthquake was left out of Khost and Paktika.
