Marco van Basten urged the new manager of Manchester United; Erik Ten Hag to sign
a Chelsea midfielder for Manchester United.

Ten Hag has now begun work with United after Ajax’s season ended over the weekend
and is tasked with getting the club back on track after a woeful season.

Ziyech meanwhile, has struggled to secure a regular role under Thomas Tuchel this
season, starting just only 12 games in the Premier League for his side.

The Morocco international was a key factor for Ten Hag during his spell in Ajax which
won the Eredivisie title in 2018 before he was sold to Chelsea for two years in a 33.3
million pound deal.And during, Ziggo Sport’s Rondo which welcomed ten Hag as its guest, Van Basten
suggested that Ziyech could also thrive under the new United manager at Old Trafford.

“What comes to my mind is that I think Ziyech who already plays football in England
could be a very good pick for Erik, said Basten.”

However, Ten Hag refused to respond specifically to Van Basten’s suggestion and
insisted that he is already used to dealing with transfer speculation before joining
United.

“Of course, this was already the case at Ajax. You take that in and then you have to
continue to work well with the dressing room and with people within the club. You will
have to analyse well and make the right choices.” Erik said.

Ten Hag confirmed that he has already started preparing for United’s pre-season
campaign after deciding to not travel with Ajax’s squad for the post-season trip to
Curacao.
