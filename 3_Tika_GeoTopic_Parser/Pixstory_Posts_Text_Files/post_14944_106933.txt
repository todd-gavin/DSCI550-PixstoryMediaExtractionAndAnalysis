A case that will be discussed A case that has already been defined as controversial because the will of the judge does not reflect that of the parents The story linked to the life of Archie Battersbee was found unconscious at home in Southend in Essex last April Archie in an irreversible coma and a judge of the High Court of London decreed in first instance after hearing the opinion of the doctors who say that there is no possibility of recovery for the twelve-year-old that the plug must be pulled The team of the Royal London Hospital who are treating the child according to what has been established by the judge presented sufficient elements to support the belief that an irreversible diagnosis of brain cell death appears highly probable at this point. they decided to appeal Hollie Dance the mum but spoke like this I am devastated and extremely disappointed with the ruling today after weeks of legal battle and intend to stay by my son&#39;s bedside My mom instincts tell me Archie is still here A diagnosis is not enough of probable death she added I am disgusted by the attitude of the judge and the doctors seeing that Archie&#39;s heart is still beating and she concluded she shook my hand What do you think Do you agree or did the parents&#39; wishes have to be respected We must rely on science or the heart These are decisions that no one would like to have to make but life is ruthless in some cases and puts us in front of immense pain Write me your thoughts on this very sad story
