One of the major vows that Rishi Sunak made is that he would crack down on gender neutral language if he becomes the next prime minister as he declared we must be able to call a mother a mother Really he is said to advocate for women by ignoring the rest of the genders and gender non conforming persons He always kept culture wars afar and now he has announced this as his first policy Mr Sunak told the Mail on Sunday he would reverse recent trends to erase women via the use of clumsy gender neutral language and argued that we must be able to call a mother a mother and talk about breastfeeding Gender neutral language isn t clumsy but appropriate and precise acknowledging what a person wants and respecting personal choices Other candidates including Suella Braverman and Kemi Badenoch have also put on the same cracking down on woke culture in their pitches for leadership His campaign has pledged to restore trust rebuild the economy and reunite the country and has garnered online signups in the first hours Mr Sunak has previously said he thinks that government policy on toilets and transgender people participating in sports should be led by biology You need to have compassion for those thinking about their identity and thinking about what that means for them their families as they re potentially going through a change and we need to be compassionate and understanding about that he said in April And we also have to have respect in particular for views of women who are anxious that some of the things they have fought hard for and rights that are important to them will be eroded We need to have respect for that point of view Biology is critically important as we think about some of those very practical questions We do get an idea of what biology means for Rishi Sunak it is just the binary genders and nothing else Biology is a very dynamic term which he used precisely for many to not get offended However no one even language cannot trace diverse genders and sexualities
