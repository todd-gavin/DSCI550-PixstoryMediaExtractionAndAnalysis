The patients we have currently hospitalized in intensive care at the Padua hospital with severe neuroinvasive forms of West Nile have an average age of years and comorbid underlying pathologies. They are mainly males. Then there are also people younger than years of age who have an of the minor nervous system and do not need access to resuscitation The youngest case in intensive care was years old Tracing to Adnkronos Salute the identikit of the patients hit hardest by the virus Marina Munari head of Neuroanesthesia and Neuroresuscitation of the University Hospital of Padua who in these days it has a particular concentration of cases The symptoms of neuro invasive forms What all these cases have in common an initial fever that is even quite violent in some cases illustrates the expert Then depending on whether there is encephalitis or meningoencephalitis there is an alteration of consciousness which can sometimes go as far as coma or other neurological and focal disorders and the patients we have seen now are characterized almost entirely by a flaccid paralysis affecting all four limbs. that there is dependence on mechanical ventilation because the patient is unable to breathe on his own These people continues Munari stay in intensive care for a long time At the moment the patients in this ward are up who are in hospital for West Nile Their stays are also long if the outcome is favorable even beyond intensive care because they are patients who, having flaccid paralysis, need very very long rehabilitations We hospitalized the first patient with neuroinvasive symptoms from West Nile in mid-July and it took only a short time to say what the impact of possible sequelae I think it is very difficult for these forms to leave without after-effects, at least in the short term. Recovery takes months in these cases and a follow-up should be done every month to understand what the outcome. In the literature, zero outcomes are in percentage terms less than moderate and severe L non-trivial impact
