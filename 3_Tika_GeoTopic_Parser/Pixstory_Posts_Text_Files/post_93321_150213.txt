Have you ever wondered why at night you tend to be more towards the negative spectrum of the mood and easily irritable You are not alone in this There is not a lot to be worried but yes there is a lot to be cautious of It has been hypothesized by researchers of the Mass General Research Institute that people tend to interpret events more negatively at night and especially past midnight And our tendency to perceive situation and events more positively is highest in the morning The reason given is that at night our brains undergo physiological changes It happens more after the midnight Disturbance in our circadian night midnight causes these changes It has also been found that there is an increased tendency to be involved in risky behaviour criminal activities and self harming behaviour This occurs because of our hampered ability to accurately judge the reward risk consequences of our actions We erroneously judge the magnitude of the negative consequences and misjudge the records of the actions we may take during night Tiredness of the day may also add to this misleading judgment The hormone dopamine which induces positive states are released which greatly contributes to indulge in risky behaviour Another factor found is the influenced circadian rhythm which obstructs accurate decision making at night Therefore don t misinterpret the situations and their consequences at night They will definitely reduce the next day if not wither away So beware of the feelings especially past midnight Most of the far reaching consequences may just be false alarms
