The state of California is considered as a global leader on climate change policy which has a law in place to help it switch to 100% use of environment-friendly electricity by 2045. The credit for its position as a “climate change leader” largely goes to a huge number of rooftop solar panels across the state.

The widespread panels supplied as much as 9 percent of the state's electricity in 2020, more than coal and nuclear energy clubbed together. This also made the state home to nearly 40% of residential solar energy produced in the US.

But, a bitter infighting between two rival energy camps and an upcoming new rule by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is all set to ruin the state’s leading position in renewable energy production. This may also push the state back to buy more polluting energy sources, such as natural gas and biomass from other states. This will surely raise the yearly death rates due to air pollution in the state over 12,000 per year and especially affect areas of high pollution levels where poor communities live.   

The public utility companies, along with its labor unions, have always hated rooftop solar panels and those who sell or buy them because they help individual houses and buildings take care of their own power production. Not only they don’t buy power from utility companies but they earn huge incentives for installing solar panels on their rooftops. In addition, they can sell back extra electricity back to the grid to recover the huge cost of installation of the panels.

If new CPUC rules are implemented the incentives will be cut and those who install panels may have to pay a fee to maintain the grid. The move will make rooftop solar panels quite expensive and out of reach of middle- or low-income households.
