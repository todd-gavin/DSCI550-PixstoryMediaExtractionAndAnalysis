It’s been ages since Arsenal saw another Mesut Ozil marauding forward and thwarting defenders with his silky movements and dribbles and panache to score goals. They tried to cover up with Nicolas Pepe, Bukayo Saka, Emile Smith Rowe, and Gabriel Martinelli but no one even came close to emulating the German. But the tide seems to have changed and after acquiring Fabio Vieira from FC Porto, Mikel Arteta can breathe a sigh of relief.


Why didn't we hear of this Left Footed Midfielder Before? 


Vieira was not on the map till the second half of the season after the departure of his teammate Luis Diaz to heavyweight club Liverpool. Until then, he went under the radar. After the Portuguese’s departure, we came to know who Fabio Vieira is. We will find more about the man who has 6 goals and 11 assists to his name. 


Which Position does Vieira Play?


Vieira who has a namesake in the form of club legend Patrice Vieira is not like the legend. He is a nimble-footed, versatile, and attacking threat of a playmaker who is going to add depth to the already boasting squad of Arteta’s. He plays as an attacking midfielder but doesn’t have any problem in dropping to a striker position to help his team or playing as an all-out midfielder if his team needs him.

Looking at his seasonal heatmap for the 2021/22 season, we can see his attacking and defensive contribution and his touches.
Who is Fabio Vieira?


Like every Portuguese youngster, Vieira started his early footballing career with Porto Junior. The kid from Santa Maria da Feria made his professional adult debut in the world of football with Porto B in February 2019. The following year i.e in June 2020, he started for the first team and played for the European giants for 2 years before the Red and White team from England called Arsenal came knocking at Porto’s doorstep and were able to prise the Portuguese away for 40 mil dollars. He will be donning the number 21 jersey while playing for Arsenal.
