God, I loved them, their music was just so different. 

I know it's crazy, but trust me, they truly are the greatest boy band of all time. 1D were fantastic they knew their audience, and they properly catered to them.

It was amazing how all of their albums sounded different, and they stayed relevant for so long. 

Even though most of their songs were about sex, they are worth revisiting. 

And the fact that 5 top tier artists came out of the band is just mind boggling to me
