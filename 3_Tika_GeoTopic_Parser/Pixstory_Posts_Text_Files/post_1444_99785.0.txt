If it is true that- as J Sai Deepak has argued- “marriage changes everything” and rape cannot occur within a marriage, then why should any woman get married?

As we wait for the Supreme Court to deliver its verdict (the HC delivered a split verdict), I find myself musing this question. I was not previously aware that marriage negated my bodily autonomy; my right to consent. But this is what is being argued, that my future husband will have absolute rights over my body, and that I have to have sex even if I do not want to, and also that said sex is “not rape”

Well! If that is the case, then why get married at all? I do not wish to enter into a state where I lose what is most sacred- not the right to have sex, but my right to consent and bodily integrity
