👉How "successful" you are according to conventional
societal metrics

👉Mistakes you've made along your path

👉How much you accomplish in your work week

👉How productive you are
A number (# of friends, your weight, # of dollars in the bank)

👉Your level of output

While some of these things might factor
into elements of your self-identity, it's important to
remember that you are a beautifully complex and multi- faceted person 

You are not defined by any single number, your output, or how productive you are… especially when it's an arbitrary metric imposed on you from the outside, and unaligned with your true desires + values.
