Namita Thapar, who was one of the titular sharks on Shark Tank India, talked about the investments she made and the regrets she has. 

Namita Thapar, the executive director of Emcure Pharmaceuticals, talked about about investments she made during Shark Tank India and the regrets she has after the show ended. In a new write-up, Namita talked about ‘missed opportunities’ and being ‘vulnerable’ as a business leader.

In her piece published on Your Story, she went on to talk about her ‘biggest regrets’ about not backing certain business ideas. “As future leaders we need to champion not just founders who can scale and make money for us but also those who have tremendous potential, are working on a real problem but don’t have the right mentorship to gain traction in their business. Jugaadu Kamlesh and Pandurang of Agro Tourism were both Maharashtrian farmers out to solve real problems but due to lack of right guidance hadn’t made sales,” wrote Namita.
