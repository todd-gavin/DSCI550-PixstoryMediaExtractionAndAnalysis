It's all I have to bring today—
This, and my heart beside—
This, and my heart, and all the fields—
And all the meadows wide—
Be sure you count—should I forget
Someone the sum could tell—
This, and my heart, and all the Bees
Which is the Clover dwell.

Emily Dickinson is an American poet who wrote during the Romantic Era of American Literature. She lived in Amherst, Massachusetts for her entire life, and seldom left her family’s homestead. She struggled at times with depression and struggled with the deaths of many close friends, including the family’s hired help.

This poem, similar to many other of Dickinson’s poems, contains heavy usage of dashes for punctuation. The dash itself is aimed to indicate either a strong interruption of the thought or other abrupt endings. 

Dickinson discusses with God. She is offering herself and her heart to Him, indicating devotion. She also offers the fields and meadows around her, implying that though He created them, she saw herself as responsible for them. She offers them to be "counted", or for God to judge her investment in them. She infers by again reiterating what she has to offer and adding the insects of the fields as well.
