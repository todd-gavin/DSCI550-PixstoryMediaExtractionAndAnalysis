In an exclusive chat with Bollywood Bubble host Nayandeep Rakhshit SS Rajamouli was asked if he feels pressure to deliver with RRR after Baahubali s success The director said No actually I don t feel the pressure of expectations in fact that is a booster dose for me The audience is expecting something out of me that means I am going to get that many audiences in the theatres on the first day Later from then onwards the film should take it forward which I am absolutely sure of for this film That is because of the number of action sequences the emotional moments The scenes and the moments that connect with the audience is much more in RRR That makes me a confident person today To tell you in simple words it is no pressure only pleasure
