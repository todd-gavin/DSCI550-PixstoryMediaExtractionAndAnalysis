Mount Mahadev (396 m). The only short trek on the list that is situated on the outskirts of Srinagar, Kashmir, is Summit Trek. This lush Himalayan region offers beautiful vistas of waterfalls, glaciers, and gypsy life. The trek's steady elevation begins near Dachigam National Park in Dara, Harwan, and Srinagar. This quick hike's top view offers a sweeping panorama of Dal Lake and Srinagar City with the Pirpanchal Range in the distance. The second-highest mountain peak in Kashmir, Mt. Harmuk (5262 m), is also visible from the northeastern side when you approach elevations of 3000 m. 
It is advisable that hikers complete this walk in a group at all times because the area is a living habitat for Himalayan Brown and Black bears and is part of Dachigam Wildlife Park. This little hike is more exciting in the spring, when most of the high-altitude hills and meadows are still covered in snow. Starting in April and ending in October, you can complete this summit hike at any time of the year. You must be physically fit or have previous experience trekking across difficult terrain.

TREK DURATION: 3 DAYS.
