Luis Diaz finally is a Scouser !! Liverpool were able to prise Diaz away from the clutches of Spurs. Jurgen Klopp will add to his attacking options by taking the Colombia winger from Porto, who say the Reds are buying an "amazing player". The Reds’ interest in the Porto winger had been signposted for some time but suggestions of a January deal had been swiftly dismissed by Anfield sources. 

 

The signing of Diaz, a 25-year-old who has played predominantly on the left flank for both Porto and Colombia, adds an extra layer of intrigue.


His primarily role is in the left midfield, but he can play as both left winger and right winger.

Liverpool will get a player, who already has contributed 14 goals in Primeira Liga while playing as Midfielder.

Diaz has 14 goals and 4 assists this season in the Portuguese League alone, a combined goal contribution of 19. 

Only nine players in Europe’s major leagues have more combined goals and assists, with Mohamed Salah the only Premier League player to have registered more (25).

I have analysed the match between FC Porto and , in which Porto won courtesy of 1 goal from Dias.
We can see that his passes are majorly down the left wing, with some passes  distributed down the defensive half too.

Against Famalicao, we can see from the heatmaps, where Luis received most of the passes.

We can see that Luis Diaz played mostly as a left winger, making his most touches down the left wing.

From the above radar we can see that he had 90 percentile in touches, 98 percentile in touches in the attacking third. He contributes higher in successful pressure with 92 percentile. He ranks high in goals/shot and goals per Shots on Target with 84 and 92 percentile respectively. 

Diaz is seen as a signing similar to that of Diogo Jota, who arrived for a similar fee in 2020 and has since managed to do the impossible


What the signing means for Mane, Salah & Co. however, remains to be seen.
