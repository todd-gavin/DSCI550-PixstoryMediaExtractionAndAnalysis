House of the Dragon is set 200 years before Daenerys Targaryen, Mother of Dragons, stepped out of the fire with her three dragons. While the dragons had been extinct at the time of Game of Thrones with Daenerys’ dragons being the last of their kind, House of the Dragon is set during the era of the dragon riders when the fierce and awe-inspiring creatures ruled the skies and the Targaryens reigned over the kingdom with their fiery companions. That can only mean one thing: We’ll get to see a lot more of the fantastic, winged creatures in House of the Dragon. The new poster for the upcoming show plays on that fact perfectly, with a huge menacing dragon’s head looking at us from behind Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen. With the Targaryens taking center stage in the new show, we can rest assured plenty of dragon action will be heading our way
