Seemingly, Trump is a menace that won’t end so easily. In a long string of events where Trump has put Republicans in a difficult position, another one Is added. 

A rift over the Republican National Committee's symbolic vote to censure former President Donald Trump’s House GOP critics has exposed more than they bargained for. This has highlighted the opposite forces currently at each other’s throats to gain the control over party.

The Guardian reported that Senate Republicans blame the Republican National Committee. The RNC blames two Republican House members. They blame former President Donald Trump. And Trump blames Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell.

In the midst of the GOP’s first major election year blowup, each bloc believes it represents the real Republican Party and its best interests in the bid to regain control of Congress.

The Republican rift over a symbolic RNC vote to censure Trump’s two GOP House critics has exposed in stark contrast the competing forces fighting to control the party. The sudden burst of infighting shattered a period of relative Republican peace just as party leaders insist they need to come together to defeat Democrats in the looming midterms.

But this week, at least, Republican unity is hard to find.

Meanwhile Trump has also issued a statement in this regard. He maintains that Mitch McConnell does not speak for the whole party and majority of voters. On the contrary, Trump said that his stance is “so against what Republicans are about.”
