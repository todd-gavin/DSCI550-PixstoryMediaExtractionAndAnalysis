Summary Environmental and genetic factors cause defects in pancreatic islets driving type diabetes T D together with the progression of multi tissue insulin resistance Mass spectrometry proteomics on samples from five key metabolic tissues of a cross sectional cohort of multi organ donors provides deep coverage of their proteomes Enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology terms provides a tissue specific map of altered biological processes across healthy prediabetes PD and T D subjects We find widespread alterations in several relevant biological pathways including increase in hemostasis in pancreatic islets of PD increase in the complement cascade in liver and pancreatic islets of PD and elevation in cholesterol biosynthesis in liver of T D Our findings point to inflammatory immune and vascular alterations in pancreatic islets in PD that are hypotheses to be tested for potential contributions to hormonal perturbations such as impaired insulin and increased glucagon production This multi tissue proteomic map suggests tissue specific metabolic dysregulations in T D Sources
