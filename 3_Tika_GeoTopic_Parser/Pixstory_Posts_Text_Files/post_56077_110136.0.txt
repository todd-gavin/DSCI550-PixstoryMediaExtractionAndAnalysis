A crown of sonnets or sonnet corona is a sequence of sonnets, usually dealing with one person, and/or about a single theme. 

Each of the sonnets examines one aspect of the theme and is correlated to the preceding and succeeding sonnets by repeating the final line of the preceding sonnet as its first line. 

The first line of the first sonnet is repeated as the final line of the final sonnet, thereby bringing the sequence to a close.

John Donne wrote La corona, a set of 7 sonnets that are tied together. Because there are only 7 of them and because there's no Mastersonnet, La corona is not a full heroic crown.

A Wreath of Sonnets is the oldest Slovenian crown of sonnets, written by the Romantic poet France Prešeren. It was written in 1833 and was enhanced with acrostic in the master sonnet.
