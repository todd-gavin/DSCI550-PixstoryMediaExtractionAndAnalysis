Christians all over the world are now preparing for Good Friday and then Easter. Good Friday is the day Lord Jesus died on the cross to pay the wages of sin for all mankind, for all ages to come. So in this week Christians need to prepare spiritually in order to receive this divine gift of Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross and his resurrection from the dead on the third day to fulfill God’s divine plan of forgiveness for mankind. That is if they want it in their life. Because Christianity is a religion of free will. You are free to accept God’s plan for your life or reject it. It’s your life.
