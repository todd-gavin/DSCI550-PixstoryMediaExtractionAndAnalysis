Highlighting the urgent need for multisectoral interventions, A lancet study shows that in 2020, about 3% of children and 5% of adolescents had metabolic syndrome, with some variation across countries and regions and prevalence is high in areas low income countries . 
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was not consistently higher with increasing level of development, suggesting that the problem is not mainly driven by country wealth but vice versa.
Writing in The Lancet the researchers said the high number of children and adolescents living with metabolic syndrome globally highlights the urgent need for multisectoral interventions to reduce the global burden of metabolic syndrome and the conditions that lead to it.
The researched searched PubMed, Embase, Africa Journal Online, and Global Index Medicus from database inception to Jan 30, 2021, with no restriction on language or geographical location. The included community-based and school-based cross-sectional studies and cross-sectional analysis of cohort studies that reported prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the general population of children (6–12 years) and adolescents (13–18 years).
169 studies which included 550 405 children and adolescents from 44 countries in 13 regions. 
Prevalence
The study estimated the global prevalence of metabolic syndrome in 2020 at 2·8% for children and 4·8% for adolescents, equating to around 25·8 million children and 35·5 million adolescents living with metabolic syndrome. In children, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 2.2 percent in high-income countries, 3·1% in upper-middle-income countries, 2·6% in lower-middle-income countries, and 3·5% in low-income countries.

In adolescents, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 5·5% in high-income countries, 3·9% in upper-middle-income countries, 4·5% in lower-middle-income countries, and 7·0% in low-income countries.
Prevalence in children varied from 1·4% n northwestern Europe to 8·2% in Central Latin America. Prevalence for adolescents ranged from 2·9% in east Asia to 6·7% in high-income English-speaking countries. The three countries with the highest prevalence estimates in children were Nicaragua (5·2%, 2·8–10·4), Iran (8·8%, 8·0–9·6), and Mexico (12·3%, 11·0–13·7); and the three countries with the highest prevalence estimates in adolescents were Iran (9·0%, 8·4–9·7), United Arab Emirates (9·8%, 8·5–10·3), and Spain (9·9%, 9·1–10·8).
