I remember the good old days when footballers were tough There was a time when a footballer would toil in the fields all day and then go on the pitch and give his everything for minutes And in today s generation we have specialist footballers for every competition the sport has been watered down so much and it s sickening This young and so called fit players cannot lace up the boots of the OGs and they are still getting paid in millions to miss the games
