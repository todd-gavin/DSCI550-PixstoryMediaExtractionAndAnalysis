BRIGHT START - This is the earliest in the year that Juventus have started their season, three days before the previous record, a 3-2 win at Chievo Verona on 18 August 2018

LUCKY THIRTEEN - Juventus have collected 13 victories from their 18 meetings with Sassuolo and have scored in all of their last 13 games against the Neroverdi.

UNLUCKY THIRTEEN - Sassuolo obtained only one clean sheet away in Serie A last season and are looking to complete their first 90 minutes without conceding in 13 league games.

HOME COMFORT - In the last two Serie A seasons Dusan Vlahovic is the top scorer in home games with 27 goals in 37 outings, including four goals in his eight matches at the Allianz Stadium.

TRADITION DICTATES - Juventus drew their most recent season debut, 2-2 last campaign at Udinese after having won their first match five times in a row. The Bianconeri have not gone winless in Matchday 1 for two seasons in a row since 1978-1980.
