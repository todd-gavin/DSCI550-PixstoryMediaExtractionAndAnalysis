Willa Sibert Cather American novelist is known for novels like O Pioneers!, The Song of the Lark, and My Ántonia. She is a Pulitzer prize winner for a novel on World War 1. 

She wore on migrant settlers into western states. Common themes in her work include nostalgia and exile. A sense of place is an important element in Cather's fiction: physical landscapes and household spaces are for Cather's dynamic presence against which her characters struggle and find community. She had recurring themes of landscape and nostalgia in her novel. 

Under the influence of Sarah Orne Jewett’s regionalism, however, she turned to her familiar Nebraska material. With O Pioneers! (1913) and My Ántonia (1918), which has frequently been adjudged her best work, she found her characteristic themes—the spirit and courage of the frontier she had known in her youth.

Though Cather had destroyed much of her epistolary record, nearly 3,000 missives were tracked down by scholars, and 566 were collected in The Selected Letters of Willa Cather.
