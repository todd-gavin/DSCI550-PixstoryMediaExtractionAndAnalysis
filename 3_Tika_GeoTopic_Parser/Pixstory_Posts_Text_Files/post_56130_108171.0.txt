According to the Department of education statistics, The proportion of men teaching in Northern Ireland's schools has continued to fall.

According to separate statistics from the Department for the Economy, almost three-quarters (72%) of 3,900 Northern Irish students studying topics related to education or teaching in 2020/21 were female this is followed in teaching too. 

More than one in five (22.8%) teachers in 2021-22 were male, down from one in four a decade ago.

The school sector with the greatest proportion is grammar schools, where about a third of teachers are male.

But according to the department, there are no male nursery school teachers anywhere in Northern Ireland.

Only about 15% of teachers in primary schools are male.

Overall there were 4,779 male teachers in Northern Ireland in 2021-22, compared to 16,157 women.

While the actual number of male teachers has increased slightly, the proportion of teachers who are men has begun again to fall.

The department's just-published report on the teacher workforce does not give explanations about why teaching is a much more popular career choice for women than men.

But the gender gap in teaching is not unusual in Northern Ireland.

In England, for instance,Â previous figures have indicated that 98% of early years teachers were women. Men should also consider teaching as a career.

The principal of St Ronan's College in Lurgan, Fiona Kane, said that the female workforce in education was powerful but there is a need to bring in male teachers too.

"Boys and young men need to see education as something males are involved in," she told BBC News NI.
