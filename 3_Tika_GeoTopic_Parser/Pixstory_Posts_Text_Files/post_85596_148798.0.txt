Childhood memories My favourite one for sure has to be from the summer vacations my family spent at my nani maa’s place. I’d go out with my friends and we’d sit under the lemon tree and make mud laddoos and utensils, and then stomp around the garden. It’s probably the reason for my love for the nature. Today’s lovely weather somehow reminded of that. :)
