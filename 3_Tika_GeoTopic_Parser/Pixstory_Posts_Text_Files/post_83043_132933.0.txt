Women in Soccer (WIS), a community supporting women and marginalized individuals working and loving the game of soccer, teamed up with Pixstory to promote the app's mission of providing a platform for athletes to express themselves safely online. 

Social media has become a powerful part of our sports industry but it is often abused to the detriment of our athlete’s mental well-being. During the Equal Playing Field 2-day long Equality Summit, WIS brought Pixstory to life. During our guided networking sessions, attendees snapped a polaroid with a word summing up an issue in soccer they want to connect with others about; allyship, inclusion, pay & prizes, wellness, storytelling, Title IX. We added dozens of smiling changemakers to the board and asked them to connect with their fellow teammates to create a 6-word story around their topic. The stories were thoughtful, smart and impactful…we’d expect nothing less from our barrier-breaking soccer community! 

Do you recognize any of the folks in these Pixstory polaroids?
