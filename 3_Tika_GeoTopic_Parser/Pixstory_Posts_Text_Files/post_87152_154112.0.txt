Many great players have represented Manchester United, and in this article, we will rank the top ten players with the most appearances in Manchester United history.

Spence was signed by United from Scotswood in March 1919, and he made his first appearance against Derby County the following month. He would eventually make his identity at Manchester United, where he scored 168 goals and appeared in 510 games. He was a true United star whose name was shouted during games, "Give it to Joe!" Despite his heroic performance, United were relegated to the Second Division.

9 Denis Irwin
Irwin was honoured for his long and successful career with Manchester United, where he appeared in 529 games. Denis Irwin was a solid left-back of his era. From 1990 to 2002, he won a succession of domestic trophies and was one of Manchester United's best signings. Under Alex Ferguson, he devised into a fantastic left-back who contributed significantly to the club's success. Before leaving the club in 2002, he had won seven Premier League titles.

8 Tony Dunne
Tony Dunne's breakthrough came when he moved to England and joined Manchester United from the Irish league. He spent 13 years at the club, making 535 appearances, and was an essential element under Alex Ferguson, steering the club to FA Cup and First Division wins, and his one of the great performances came in the European Cup final, which United won 4-1 against Benfica, despite rupturing his Achilles tendon.
