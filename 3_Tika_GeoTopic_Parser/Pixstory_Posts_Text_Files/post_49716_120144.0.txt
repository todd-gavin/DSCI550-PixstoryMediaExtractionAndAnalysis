Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito mocked major figures around the world, for speaking against the decision to overturn Roe. This includes Prince Harry and outgoing British Prime Minister Boris Johnson,

In what appeared to be his first public comments since the decision was handed down last month, Alito rejected criticism from the British pair, as well as from French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

He was delivering the keynote speech at a conference on religious liberty in Rome last week that was hosted by the Notre Dame Law School. The speech was only posted online by the school Thursday.

Alito, who wrote the argument overturning the landmark ruling that enshrined the right to an abortion in the United States, condemned the global figures for weighing in on "American law."

“I had the honor this term of writing, I think, the only Supreme Court decision in the history of that institution that has been lambasted by a whole string of foreign leaders — who felt perfectly fine commenting on American law,” Alito said, prompting laughter from the crowd.
“One of these was former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, but he paid the price,” he joked, appearing to reference Johnson's decision to step down as prime minister amid domestic scandals and widespread criticism of his leadership from within his own Conservative Party.

“But what wounded me — what wounded me — was when the Duke of Sussex addressed the United Nations and seemed to compare the decision, whose name may not be spoken, with the Russian attack on Ukraine,”
Alito said, referring to Harry.

Harry described 2022 as a "painful year in a painful decade," during the speech on July 18.
He said the world was "witnessing a global assault on democracy and freedom," pointing to the "horrific war in Ukraine to the rolling back of constitutional rights here in the United States," among other global events as examples.
