There is a significant distinction between feeling that someone should not do something and believing that something should be criminal. I feel that it should be unlawful to perform a sex change procedure on someone under a particular age, and that beyond that age it should be discouraged but not forbidden. People have the right to chart their own course in life, and it should not upset you if someone chooses a path that does not harm you. Obviously, one should interfere if they fear a person may inflict severe damage to themselves, but ultimately, the decision to do anything is up to the individual who makes it so long as it does not harm another.

Due to the immaturity of their minds, children under the age of 18 do not have the capacity to make this decision for themselves. This is why, for instance, we prohibit adults from having sex with children under a certain age, because even if a child consents to having sex, we all agree that the child does not understand what they are consenting to.
 
The same principle applies to sex alterations, often known as gender transitions. Even if a 10-year-old or 16-year-old consents to undergoing a sex change, they cannot completely understand what they are agreeing to.
