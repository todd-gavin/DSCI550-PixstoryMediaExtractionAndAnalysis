This blood donors day as the theme speaks for itself "donating blood is an act of solidarity, it is indeed an act of solidarity and this can be done only with courage that's taken by the donors for that first step towards donating blood. 

As we commemorate the Blood Donor's Day, I got a chance to interact with one of the regular blood donors, Mr. Fayaz Ahmed, who gives his blood twice a year and have been following this routine for the past two and half decades. 

Here is how the interview when with him. 

• What inspired him to take that first step of going for a blood donation ? 

He shared about a life event that occurred to his family at the age of 16. His relative was admitted in the hospital and was in need of blood. But since no one turned up he didn't get sufficient blood and passed away. 

This is what motivated him to donate blood.

And ever since he started donating his blood this moment always comes into his memory. 

• His first blood donation experience 

He donated his blood during a blood donation campaign that was conducted in JNU during the year 1996. He shared that he was nervous at first but still went in for it and after donating his blood he went for classes and later that day he felt an internal pleasure for saving lives. 

• What pre and post diet routines he follows before going for a blood donation 

He follows more of liquid diets and have plenty of water before and after donating. He advises that a proper diet is required all the time. 

• What are some things he would want to tell to those who wants to go for blood donation but is taken aback due to some preconceptions or fear 

The first step is fearful, but don't worry it is going to be really fine. 

Through this act I'm sure Mr. Fayaz have been a source for many lives being saved and benefited over the years and this is really an inspiration for all those upcoming blood donors out there.
