Directly from St. Gallen from the retirement of his Valencia Gennaro Gattuso returned to talk about the rather complicated last year amid accusations of racism and sexism that spread on various social networks I suffered a lot for untrue things said about me I suffered in silence and maybe I was wrong right there not speaking to defend myself Untrue things have come out sentences said years ago and inserted in a totally different context and to make controversy I am a totally different person from the one they described Plus everyone thought I had left Fiorentina because I already had an agreement with Tottenham But it didn&#39;t go like this I didn&#39;t coach the Spurs because the management believed in untrue things they fell for it completely Social media can really destroy a person and above all it is difficult to defend oneself I think of the kids who end up on the web and remain labeled for life for a small mistake I was really bad but it&#39;s okay even if a few more rules would be needed I thank Valencia who have been close to me and have always supported me as well as my friends and family without them everything would have been even more complicated
