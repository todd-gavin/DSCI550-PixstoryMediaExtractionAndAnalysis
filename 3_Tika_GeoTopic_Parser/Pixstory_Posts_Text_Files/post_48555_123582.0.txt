Mashiach, or Messiah in English, is a Hebrew term that means the same thing. So, while the Bible uses it both ways, Christ is more of a title than a name. The Bible, for example, frequently refers to Jesus as "Jesus Christ," just as we do in modern language (see Matthew 1:1, 18; Mark 1:1; John 1:17; 17:3; Acts 3:6; Romans 3:24, etc.).

However, it also refers to Jesus as "the Christ," which means "anointed one," or "Messiah." When Jesus asked His disciples who they believed He was, "Who do you think I am," Peter said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God” (Matthew 16:16). And He [Jesus], rebuking them, forbade them from speaking, for they realised He was the Christ" (Luke 4:41).

As a result, Jesus Christ unites His name (Jesus) with His title (Christ), resulting in Jesus Christ, the Anointed One or Jesus Christ, the Chosen One. As the chosen, anointed Son of God, Jesus is His personal name, as told to Mary by the angel Gabriel (Luke 1:31), and Christ is His title.
