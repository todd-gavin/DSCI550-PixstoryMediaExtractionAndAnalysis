Facebook founded back in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg. One of the early social media sites to have found itâ€™s root. Facebook is an American social media site owned by Meta Platforms. 
Now instagram, created in 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. Acquired by Meta Platforms in April 2012. 
So Facebook and Instagram are nothing but two sides to the same coin. But nowadays we can see, all the youngsters are on instagram and most of the oldies on Facebook. The audience is divided.
