The most interesting and fun game I saw last week in my college fest The name was UPSIDE DOWN We were given mins to solve the treasure hunt We were roaming at all places of the computer engineering department Once we jotted and found all hints we combined them to get the answer of the riddle The answer of the riddle was an instrument for the next round This round was all Maze all black and dark theme we found our instrument here and we proceed to the stage where we had to solve the puzzle within the limited time Guess what we were the winners of our slot
