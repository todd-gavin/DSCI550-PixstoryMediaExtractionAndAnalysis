I personally still feel if you choose to shave you should shave with the grain, but there's a catch.
The benefit of shaving against the grain is that it lowers your chance of getting razor burn or skin irritation after shaving. The drawback of shaving with the grain is that, particularly if you have thick hair, you may not always get the really close, revitalising shave you imagine
In my opinion if you want a smooth skin without much of the shaving problems, waxing, or even better, sugaring is the best option you can go for.
