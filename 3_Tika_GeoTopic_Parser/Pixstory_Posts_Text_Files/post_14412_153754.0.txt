👉Read labels carefully. All the main food allergens should be listed in bold letters after the ingredients list for easy identification. If ingredients aren’t listed, try asking staff or skipping the food entirely.
👉Note that some labels might say “may contain” or “made on shared equipment” for certain ingredients. This type of labeling isn’t well regulated. 
Speak with a doctor or allergist if you have concerns about your baby eating these foods.
👉Have your child tested over time to see if they’ve outgrown their allergy. This is a more likely scenario with allergies to milk, eggs, wheat, and soy than it is with peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, and fish.
👉Consider reaching out to a dietitian or nutritionist for help if you feel your baby’s allergy is restricting their diet.
👉A food expert can help you make sure your little one gets the nutrients they need to thrive, all while being safe.
👉Look into getting a chef card. You can take it to restaurants to inform staff of your child’s specific allergy concerns. Cards are available in several different languages.
