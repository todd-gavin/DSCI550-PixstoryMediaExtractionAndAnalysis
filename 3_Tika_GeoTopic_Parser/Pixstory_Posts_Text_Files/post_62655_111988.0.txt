Hyaluronic acid is well known for increasing skin firmness and suppleness. Hyaluronic acid functions as a humectant, drawing moisture and water from the air to the skin while also having anti-aging qualities. It improves skin firmness and reduces the visibility of wrinkles.

Because our bodies naturally produce less hyaluronic acid as we get older, early indicators of ageing can be observed as early as the early 30s. Hyaluronic acid serums are frequently used as anti-wrinkle serums because they can lessen wrinkles and redness when applied to the skin's surface. However, in order to see visible improvements from skincare, you must apply it consistently.

Where most people go wrong with Hyaluronic Acid Serums is there usage. They lock moisture in your skin so make sure you let them. Apply them on damp face (not wet), applying them on a dry face would not be exactly beneficial. Another thing to keep in mind is to apply moisturizer immediately after it. I cannot say this enough but moisturizer is one of the most important elements of your skincare routine, do not skip that!
