1)-NEHA KAKKAR

Singer Neha Kakkar donned a dramatic red shimmery gown with a thigh-high slit for IIFA 2022's green carpet. She completed her look with matching gloves, jewellery, and heels. Neha's dramatic look did not go well with her styling.

2)-TIGER SHROFF

Heropanti 2 actor Tiger Shroff donned a pink suit on the green carpet and completed his look with light pink shades. The actor did not impress us with his look as we expected a lot from him.

3)-SARA ALI KHAN

Actress Sara Ali Khan arrived at the green carpet and greeted the paps. She wore an off-shoulder black gown which was way too simple.

4)-RAKHI SAWANT

Rakhi Sawant arrived at IIFA's green carpet with her boyfriend Adil Khan Durrani. She opted for an off-shoulder red top paired with matching pants. Her look did not do justice to her overall fashion.

5)-YO-YO HONEY SINGH

Singer-rapper Yo Yo Honey Singh arrived at the event in a casual and comfortable look. He opted for an all-black t-shirt paired with matching pants. Yo-Yo Honey Singh is known for his impeccable fashion, but he failed to spill the same magic on the green carpet.
