Austin Reaves made a leap from an undrafted free agent to a Los Angeles Lakers starter in his first year with the team in big part thanks to his Summer League performance Reaves averaged points rebounds and assists over five Summer League games clocking in minutes per game the third highest number on L A s team Even though the guard s shooting was streaky his hustle and defensive skills earned him a two way contract with the Lakers which the franchise upgraded to a standard NBA deal before the start of the season Reaves has made tremendous progress since the preseason but he still doesn t rule out heading to Las Vegas to represent the Purple and Gold in this year s Summer League I m not sure yet That s really about the most honest answer I can give you he told Lakers Nation Reaves considers the Summer League as a major learning experience that helped him get ready for his rookie year Hence the year old will treat each game as if he was playing in the NBA in case he ends up going to Las Vegas I feel like I ve always got something to prove Reaves said So if I go and play I m going to play it like I play every other game But last year Summer League was fun It gave me a perspective of really just the physicality of the game the speed of the game Last year that helped a lot moving into my rookie year Like I said if I go back and play this year which is possible I m going to play it like every other game Like it s just a regular season game just try to do the right things on the court
