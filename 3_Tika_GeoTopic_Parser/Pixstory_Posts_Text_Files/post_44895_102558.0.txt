Following the acquisition of Fabio Carvalho, former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson has claimed that three players might depart Liverpool.

Carvalho, who was close to joining the Reds in January, has already been revealed as the club's first summer acquisition. Fulham achieved promotion to the Premier League this season, and the 19-year-old had a terrific season with the Cottagers.

In 36 games, the Portuguese under-21 international was a major member of Andre Silva's championship-winning squad, scoring 10 goals and providing eight assists.

The emergence of the wonderkid, according to Paul Robinson, might ease the departure of three Liverpool exiles. Divock Origi, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, and Takumi Minamino, according to the former Tottenham goalie, might all be traded this summer.

Robinson believes the Reds were in desperate need of a makeover, which Carvalho's acquisition will provide.

"Oxlade-Chamberlain, Minamino, and Origi are the three I believe will depart," he stated. Minamino was close to joining Leeds in January, but the deal fell through. Origi seemed to be set in stone. Those three players will leave a significant vacuum in Liverpool's lineup. "There is a void that must be filled." "It's an area they'll try to revitalise." Klopp and Guardiola are experts at renewing teams. Carvalho will breathe new life into the Liverpool team. "

Origi, Minamino, and Oxlade-Chamberlain were all part of Jurgen Klopp's team this season, but they have all produced when called upon.

The Reds would not have won the League Cup or the FA Cup without Minamino, and Origi, as usual, has scored some key goals.

Despite being on the outside of the group for the majority of the season, Oxlade-Chamberlain performed admirably, notably during the AFCON when Salah and Mane were sidelined.

If Liverpool loses all three players at the same time and fails to replace them, it will be a huge blow to their squad depth.
