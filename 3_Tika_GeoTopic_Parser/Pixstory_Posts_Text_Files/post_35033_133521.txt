Sampdoria wants to repeat the first two good outings in the third match against Salernitana a direct rival for coach Giampaolo Our goal I expect to repeat a level of performance along the lines of that offered in the first two league games with Atalanta and Juve because for that&#39;s what we need to achieve a result We go to Salerno with good intentions The draw with Juventus has given us great energy the Sampdoria coach said again Tomorrow it will be a direct match the stakes are worth double and the match must be played with that kind of forethought The match it will be tough in an environment that is certainly warm Djuricic will be among the starting eleven lined up with the team and perhaps the Spaniard Villar I see him more and more inside In training he does things well and in this mini tour de force he too will play from the start Because around the corner there really is a tour de force with Salernitana Lazio and Verona The three races in one week must be managed in the best possible way but now let&#39;s think about the challenge in Salerno
