It goes without saying that Leo Messi’s free transfer to Paris Saint-Germain in 2021 was one of the biggest moves we’ve seen in the recent years. 

The Argentine was at Barcelona for 21 long years, where he featured in 777 games for the Catalonian outfit, scoring 672 goals and assisting 302.

With the arrival of Leo Messi to Paris, the French team did not only see their sponsorship requests skyrocket but also saw an incline in revenues from channels such as shirt sales, stadium attendance and more. It also had a tremendous impact on the club’s social media channels.

Following confirmation of the signing, PSG gained 15 million followers across all platforms and surpassed the 150 million mark for the first time. The club added close to 1.4 million followers per week.

Marc Armstrong, Chief Partnerships Officer, Paris Saint-Germain said, “We were the first club to reach 10 and 20 million followers on TikTok or the top French brand on Instagram."

On how Leo Messi's arrival led to a significant increase in ticket revenue, Armstong said, "We are now sold out at every game, with record revenue among European clubs per seat, with eight times the number of fans going without tickets or VIP, so clearly it has been a turning point."

The numbers speak for itself and it’ll continue to grow in the months to come. 

Barcelona’s loss has helped PSG take big strides in terms of positioning themselves as one of the most followed club — a team which has seen success off the field in terms of revenues and popularity. But, the big question remains un-answered, Will the goal to win the Champions League remain a dream of will Leo Messi help the club achieve the big trophy next season.
