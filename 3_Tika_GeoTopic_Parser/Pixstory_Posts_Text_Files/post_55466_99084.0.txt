My mums a character that’s a rare find, she’s an overachiever and someone so strong yet weak. While I struggle on my relationship with her on a daily basis what I Fail to realize is that I’m a lot like her. I am all she could have  been and she is all I might be.
I’ve got her anger, her temper and I’ve got her kindness and her love. And her perfectionism, her ambitions, and her over thinking, her emotionalism.
Mothers and daughters exist as wretched mirrors of each other.
