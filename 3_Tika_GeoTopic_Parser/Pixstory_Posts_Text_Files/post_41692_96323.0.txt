Australia will host a slew of major international athletic events over the next decade as part of a long-term strategy to increase tourism, health, and the economy while also improving its international image. 

The inviting atmosphere, sports-loving populace, stable political environment, and high-quality infrastructure have made the country a popular tourist destination for many years. 

However, CNA reported that the sheer number of major athletic events coming to Australia, which has a population of 26 million people, is unparalleled. 

The green and gold - the nation's athletic colours - "runway" culminates in the Brisbane Olympics in 2032, according to Australian Olympic Committee chief Matt Carroll.

â€œMore than 30 major global sporting events are coming to Australia across the next 10 years," he said. 

This year, the country will host the men's Twenty20 World Cup, the Women's Basketball World Cup, and the UCI road cycling world championships, in addition to the yearly Australian Open tennis and Formula One. 

It will then host the Women's World Cup in football in 2023 with New Zealand, a British and Irish Lions rugby tour in 2025, the Commonwealth Games in 2026, the Netball World Cup in 2027, and the Presidents Cup golf the following year. 

Australia's standing as a sporting powerhouse will be further cemented when it announces next month that it will host back-to-back men's and women's Rugby World Cups in 2027 and 2029.
