A video of a group of men thrashing a woman is widely being circulated on social media with an Arabic caption. It has been claimed that a Muslim woman in India was lynched to death by a mob of men for “refusing to remove her hijab”.

The video is viral in India amidst the Hijab ban controversy that started at a PU college in Karanataka and has spread across the nation with various Hindu outfits demanding a ban on hijab within the campuses of educational institutions.

On Twitter, the video has been shared with the hashtag #طرد_السفير_الهندي (Expell the Indian Ambassador). The tweet below is by Talal al-Kashti, director of Etijahat Studies Center in Kuwait.

Old, unrelated video
We broke down the video into keyframes and performed a reverse image search on one of the stills using Yandex. This led us to the same video uploaded on Facebook in May 2020. As per the caption of the post, the video is from Balrampur, UP.
