Confidence is the chief trait any athlete can have, if you lack confidence then you will not be able to showcase your unique skills you have. 
Lack of confidence may hinder performance, cause you will not be taking risky steps to do something exceptional which you can do. 
Stop letting your potential go waste because you don't have the confidence. 
People with half of your ability are getting what should be yours. 
Following your managers tactics and instructions is your goal, but this doesn't mean that you can not think out of the box. 
From your football life experiences you have developed a unique style of play and tactics. Don't feel shy to show your own moves besides from what the manager is expecting. Show the manager that this is also a way to play football. 
Young footballers who just got admitted in a new football club mostly face this problem and this is why players are not getting playing in the matches causes coaches are not aware of the hidden talent these players have which is suppressed by lacking confidence. 
Just believe in yourself and give it a try, i know your uniqueness will impress the people and coaches around you. Don't be a copy, always be original. 
I hope this will help you !
If yes then let me know in the notes...
