Every year countries around the world celebrate World Blood Donor Day on 14th of june. The event serves to raise awareness of the need for safe blood and blood products and to thank voluntary, unpaid blood donors for their life-saving gifts of blood.

Throwing back to the time when my college society organised blood donation camp in our college and  students activity participated in that. The feeling of being part of the camp and the whole process was definitely wholesome. Satisfaction on the faces of the people who donated their blood was definitely the best part to witness. After donating their blood, donors were provided with the refreshments. Felt great to be the part of that whole process.
