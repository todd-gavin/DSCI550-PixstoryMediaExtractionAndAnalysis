Formal education - these two words are very familiar to us. Our parents , relatives and all the people who had completed their education in classical way they all suggest it. But today in india every body needs a job and when our syllabus and cilurriculams are not relevant to industry the importance of  formal education is declining. There are many examples which can prove the fact. In India iur universities are not giving any great skills to their students . The lack of skills and internship they can't explore the industry which make a great impact on them. Skils qre more important than formal education in some aspects. As there if a person looking for job he or she need to know the relevant skills according to him / her preference. But if someone one to become master to one particular subject skills + formal education is a good choice for him. Though it has some exception in this theory. Like Bill gates, Mark Zuckerberg who have not completed their bachelor's but they are still successful just not on their skill but also they have some competitive advantage and first mover advantage also. They had studied in a 1 st world country where you can become successful for many ways but in India it is quite impossible as students have to support their families and after they can manage their study . So it quite tough . So best way to live a fruitful life is not to skip formal education but simultaneously acquiring skills and education is a great choice. The job should be relevant to the skills on the people. So they can nourish it and they can't feel boredom in job . This is a great manage the work life and education.
