Fundamentals of Vedic Astrology continues......

Similarly, if somebody has the Libra Ascendant/Tula Lagna then in that case the sign of Libra represented by the number 7 shall be placed in the ascendant and the rest of the numbers shall be progressively filled in a anti 
clock wise manner in the chart.

Every house controls several aspects of life in its domain. Here I have summarized from the point of view of Gem Therapy, the major areas covered by each house. Advanced users can build on this information and gain knowledge or more areas/ sectors governed by each house. 

1st House/Ascendant/Lagna Bhava

This is the most important house of the chart and is considered to both a quadrant and a trine house. The most important aspects governed by this house are:
- All Health affairs including personality, build, physique, facial appearance and constitution.
- Behaviour towards elders such as grandparents and parents of self and the spouse.
- Part of the body from head to the neck.
- The third pregnancy or the third child. ( Please note in a situation where in a couple is desirous of a 3rd child or concerned about the 3rd pregnancy one should analyse the 5th house of children but also the 3rd house before ascertaining which house to fortify using gem 
therapy.
- General level of self confidence and self esteem
- Addiction to drugs or liquor
- Impotence in men and frigidity or lack of sexual interest in females
- Leadership qualities.
