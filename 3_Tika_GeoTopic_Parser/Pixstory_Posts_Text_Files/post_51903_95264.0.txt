CIES Football Observatory have put together an analytical, data-driven look at who it is that boasts the most potent attacking front-three in Europe: Manchester City, Real Madrid or Paris Saint Germain? 

The report focuses on 11 different game variables: six are offensive (shots, assists, key passes, crosses, successful dribbles and offensive aerial challenges won) and four are defensive (interceptions, ground challenges won, picking-upâ€™s and aerial challenges won), as well as passing (distribution) that stands alone. 

These stats have been taken into consideration as personal characteristics of each player rather than simply the position they occupy on the field, allowing a detailed definition of the role that each footballer plays in his team, granting an unbiased identification of the actions in which the individuals stand out above their teammates.
