Two per cent of all fishing gear used worldwide ends up polluting the oceans, our new research finds. To put that into perspective, the amount of longline fishing gear littering the ocean each year can circle the Earth more than 18 times.We interviewed 450 fishers from seven of the worldâ€™s biggest fishing countries including Peru, Indonesia, Morocco and the United States, to find out just how much gear enters the global ocean. We found at current loss rates, in 65 years there would be enough fishing nets littering the sea to cover the entire planet.This lost fishing equipment, known as ghost gear, can cause heavy social, economic and environmental damage. Hundreds of thousands of animals are estimated to die each year from unintentional capture in fishing nets. Derelict nets can continue to fish indiscriminately for decades.Our research findings help highlight where to focus efforts to stem the tide of fishing pollution. It can also help inform fisheries management and policy interventions from local to global scales.14 billion longline hooks litter the sea each yearThe data we collected came directly from fishers themselves. They experience this issue firsthand and are best poised to inform our understanding of fishing gear losses.We surveyed fishers using five major gear types: gillnets, longlines, purse seine nets, trawl nets, and pots and traps.We asked how much fishing gear they used and lost annually, and what gear and vessel characteristics could be making the problem worse. This included vessel and gear size, whether the gear contacts the seafloor, and the total amount of gear used by the vessel.We coupled these surveys with information on global fishing effort data from commercial fisheries.Fishers use different types of nets to catch different types of fish. Our research found the amount of nets littering the ocean each year include:740,000 kilometres of longline mainlinesnearly 3,000 square kilometres of gill nets218 square kilometres of trawl nets75,000 square kilometres of purse seine netsIn addition.
