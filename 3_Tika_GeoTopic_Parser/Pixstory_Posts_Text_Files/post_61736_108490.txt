Sleep is fundamentally a process that is predominant during the night time Therefore it is of utmost importance to understand the spiritual science underlying various aspects related to peaceful sleep In the modern world filled with capitalism and dismay sleep is looked at as a bad thing while it is the bedrock of recovery among our body There are various ancient practices accustomed to sleeping that may have lost in the wheel of time Sleeping positions are very important the right one can give you peaceful sleeps while the wrong ones can affect your health and well being As per Hinduism no one should sleep with their head in the North and feet in the South direction as it is considered detrimental to our health It is because of this that the activities of negative energies gain momentum and therefore the possibility of the individual being distressed by negative energies is the highest Hence avoid sleeping in the north south direction if possible Scientifically speaking the magnetic field theory is an important concept to surrender to while understanding this stance of hinduism When your head which has north magnetic poles faces the south it creates a harmonious exchange The result is that it draws energy into your body rather than out This direction makes you wake up feeling happy rejuvenated prosperous and healthy Whereas if your head is facing North the magnetic waves of your head will polarise with the magnetic waves of the Planet which drains you of the energy and makes you restless thus not helping with recovery Hence we should listen to the hindus and not sleep with our head towards North
