2 Diego Costa
Costa was an aggressive defender who used his combative style and mercurial temperament to bully opposing defenders. Costa was brought in to replace Didier Drogba when his contract with Atletico Madrid expired, and Mourinho signed him from the Spanish club in 2014. In his first season, the Spanish player evidenced his goal-scoring competence, scoring 21 goals in 37 games.
Costa was named Premier League Player of the Month twice and was named to the PFA Team of the Year: 2014-15 Premier League. Chelsea appointed Conte in 2016, and Costa had a major falling out with him, resulting in him leaving the club with 120 appearances and 59 goals to his name.


1 Didier Drogba
Chelsea are still looking for a striker with Drogba features in goal; the Ivorian player left a gap at the club that no one has been able to fill. After joining Chelsea from Marseille, Drogba scored 164 goals in all competitions and won 12 major awards.
The Blues have never seen a player like Drogba, who left a void at the club that no striker has been able to fill.
He will be remembered for his equalising goal against Bayern Munich and winning the penalty shootout against the same team, which led to the club's first-ever Champions League victory. Drogba finally left Chelsea in 2012, after his most successful spell there. In 2018, he announced his retirement.
