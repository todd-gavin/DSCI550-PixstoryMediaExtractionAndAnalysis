LEONARDO DICAPRIO 
Let us not take this planet for granted,” Leonardo DiCaprio said in his acceptance speech for the Oscars 2016. Arguably the most visible Hollywood figures fighting the environmental crisis today, the actor doesn’t just talk the talk. He incepted his eponymous foundation, with the credo to protect the world’s threatened ecosystems, in 1998. Since then, DiCaprio has made sizeable donations and calls to action in documentary films and public platforms. In 2018, the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation announced $11 million in new grants pledged to the non-profit's six main programs bringing the organisation's total financial impact to over $100 million. Over the years, he has sat on the board of the World Wildlife Fund, Global Green USA, and the International Fund for Animal Welfare; was named UN Messenger of Peace on Climate Change in 2014; and he spoke at the United Nations in 2016 before the signing of the Paris Agreement to combat global warming.

JANE FONDA
Another Oscar winner and longtime political activist, Jane Fonda is making the most of her golden years to save future generations. From October 2019, the actor moved to Washington to lead a weekly climate change protest, Fire Drill Fridays, about inaction over the climate crisis at the US Capitol every Friday. Not only did it get her celebrity friends, with the likes of Joaquin Phoenix, Martin Sheen, to participate, it spawned corresponding protests across the country. The demonstrations led to several arrests, including Fonda’s on four occasions. "We have very little time, and if we don't do what's necessary in that brief amount of time, it's hard to even think about what the future is going to be like,” she said. On December 21, 2019, the star celebrated her 82nd birthday by protesting and eventually got arrested for it. And even while public gatherings are on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic, Fonda is continuing her work from home in Los Angeles and simply moved Fire Drill Fridays online.
