A member of an Islamic State militant group nicknamed “The Beatles” that beheaded American hostages, was sentenced to life imprisonment by  U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis in Alexandria, Virginia. 

London-born Alexanda Kotey, 38, pleaded guilty to murdering U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig. During the hearing, the defender said that Kotey is trying to make amendments by meeting some members of the family of the victims. Does it even matter? What would have mattered is saving all the lives he took! 

Kotey was a citizen of the United Kingdom, but the British government revoked his citizenship. His Islamic State cell took journalists and aid workers hostage, tormented them and circulated videotapes of gruesome beheadings on the internet.

Kotey admitted to causing torture on hostages, including waterboarding and electric shocks with a stun gun.

Family members described the dread of knowing loved ones were in captivity, and the sadness they felt in the aftermath of their deaths. Terrorism is a strange state of mind. When people try to kill one another that too in savage ways. Loss is a loss to the family member of the victims.
