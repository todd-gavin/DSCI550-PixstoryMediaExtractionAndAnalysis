Vaping is just another form of smoking! It isn't in any way harmless. Vaping just gives too many choices to smoke! That E-liquid can be anything from nicotine to dangerous drugs! Nicotine even on a low level for a long period is dangerous. Many use Vaping for controlling their level of nicotine intake or quitting smoking. They are basically smoking and they have control over the amount of nicotine they use. You may lose control because of your addiction to the nicotine intensity, the chances are high that you can develop cancer in your body. ‌The use of nicotine in growing adolescent brains can harm parts that control: Learning, Mood, Attention, Impulse control.
