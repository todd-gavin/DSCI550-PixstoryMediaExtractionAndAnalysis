In an attempt to get away from his Old Trafford nightmare,
 Manchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo has been linked with a transfer to Sporting Lisbon.

The Portuguese club is aware that closing the transfer will be difficult. 
Hugo Viana, the club's sporting director, is very active behind the scenes to attract Ronaldo back to his first team.

Before joining Manchester United in 2003, the 37-year-old started his career with Sporting Lisbon. The five time Ballon d'Or winner is willing to leave Old Trafford this season in hopes to play in the Champions League. 

Sporting will compete in the league despite of having poor chance of winning away Europe's most desired club title this year because to their second-place result in the previous campaign.

A year is still left on Ronaldo's contract with Manchester United, where the team is now last in the Premier League positions.

The Portuguese captain played for 45 minutes as his team lost to Brighton & Hove Albion on the opening day at home. However, he did participate for the entire 90 minutes of United's humiliating 4-0 loss to Brentford. 

The legendary attacker has been rumored with a bunch of the top teams in Europe, and yet no move has been completed.

Where do want Cristiano to go ? Is sporting Lisbon is the best option ? 

Thank you âš½
