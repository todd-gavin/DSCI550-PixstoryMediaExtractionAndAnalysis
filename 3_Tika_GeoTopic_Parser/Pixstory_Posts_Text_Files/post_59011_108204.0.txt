At a high-level seminar on hate speech at the global conference, India's permanent envoy to the United Nations said that the country has been one of the worst victims of terrorism, particularly cross-border terrorism, and that there cannot be double standards on religiophobia.

Ambassador TS Tirumurti stated that tackling the problem should not be a "selective exercise" involving only one or two religions, but should apply equally to non-Abrahamic religions.

Tirumurti gave a speech titled "Role of education to address the core causes of hate speech and advance inclusion, non-discrimination, and peace" at an event commemorating the first anniversary of the International Day on Countering Hate Speech.

"As we have stressed, addressing religiophobia should not be a selective exercise involving only one or two religions, but should apply equally to non-Abrahamic religions as well," Tirumurti stated. Such international days will never fulfil their goals until this is done. "There can't be two standards when it comes to religiophobia," he stated.

The Permanent Mission of Morocco and the United Nations Office on Genocide Prevention and Responsibility to Protect co-hosted the event. According to Tirumurti, India's multicultural edifice has made it a safe haven for all individuals seeking asylum in the country, whether Jews, Zoroastrians, Tibetans, or those from its own neighbourhood. "Over time, it is our nation's inherent strength that has resisted radicalism and terrorism," he remarked.
