Chelsea reportedly believe that they will beat Manchester United to the signing of Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong this summer.

According to Spanish outlet SPORT (h/t the Mirror), the Netherlands international wants to play in the UEFA Champions League this season if he does leave Barca. The Blues have an understanding that this gives them an edge over the Red Devils.

Hence, they are waiting for the green light to pounce on the opportunity and make a move for the former Ajax midfielder. He is valued at €80 million by the Catalan giants.

There is a real possibility that he could leave Barca this summer as things have started to turn sour at Camp Nou between him and the club. The Blaugranas want him to return to the wages he was being paid before his contract extension in January 2020.

They believe the agreement reached between him and the club's board two-and-a-half years ago was illegal and are threatening to take the player to court. They apparently owe De Jong around €18 million in deferred wages.

Chelsea have signed centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly and winger Raheem Sterling this summer to strengthen their first-team set-up. However, they are arguably yet to sign a proven, world-class central midfielder since Mateo Kovacic arrived from Real Madrid in the summer of 2019.

Investing in that area of the pitch is long overdue. Club co-owner Todd Boehly could look at De Jong, 25, as the natural successor to one of Jorginho (30) and N'Golo Kante (31). Both are also in the last 12 months of their respective contracts at Stamford Bridge.
