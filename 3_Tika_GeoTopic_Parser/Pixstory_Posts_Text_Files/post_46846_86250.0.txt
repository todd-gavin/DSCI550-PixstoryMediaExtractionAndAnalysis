Over the last few years, the Classic Physique division in Olympia has been one of the fastest growing in the sport. In fact, it has been a hot issue of discussion in the run-up to the 2021 Olympia, with people like Arnold Schwarzenegger and others proposing that the sport should move in that direction rather than toward Open Bodybuilding, which has the potential to be more dangerous.

Furthermore, it is home to two-time defending champion Chris Bumstead, who is one of the biggest names in the sport today. Fans were eager to see the battle this year to see whether he could make it three in a row.

Bumstead won the 2021 Classic Physique Olympia for the third year in a row by the end of the tournament. Terrence Ruffin, who finished second, and former champ Breon Ansley, who finished third, were right behind him, both fighting courageously for the championship but having to settle for these results instead.

“It’s called classic physique for a reason,” Bumstead says. “When you look back at the original big guys like Frank Zane and Arnold Schwarzenegger, the vacuum pose helped put them at the top of their game. I figured if that is what we’re trying to embody, then practice like those pros. I’ve always practiced the vacuum and have tried implementing it in my posing routine. It really helps keep my waist as small as possible. Nothing looks smaller than a vacuum waist, so it really brings back that classic look.”
