A mindless Atalanta falls at home against a far from irresistible Napoli Gasperini&#39;s men are unable to direct the match in the early stages after numerous mistakes in the defensive phase by their opponents and fall at the first good opportunity for the Azzurri who are good and cynical at hitting in their less brilliant moment Not even de Roon&#39;s goal in the second half gave new verve to the Nerazzurri players who definitively say goodbye to fourth place Let&#39;s see the match statistics together Atalanta Ball possession Shots on goal Blocked shots Offside Corner Cross Dribbling Fouls conceded Yellow cards Napoli Ball possession Shots on target Shots blocked Offside Corner Cross Dribbling Fouls conceded Yellow cards The Goddess wins the data on ball possession but Napoli responds with the incisiveness that in the end wins the matches Spalletti&#39;s team&#39;s shots on target are in fact fruitful while the Nerazzurri with total shots on goal and clearances they managed to score only once The players from Bergamo also lack being decisive when set pieces Ben corners weren&#39;t enough to create problems for their opponents The same goes for crosses are those totaled by Atalanta but even in this case the concrete sills did not help The hosts then dribbled more than Insigne and his teammates but often and willingly only useful for statistical purposes Perhaps the upcoming Europa League match influenced the psychology of Atalanta players because otherwise it would be serious for a high-ranking team to be slipped in so easily by a direct competitor
