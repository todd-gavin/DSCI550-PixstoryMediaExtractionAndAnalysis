Drafting stricter hate crime laws with harsher punishment would not eradicate the prevalence of hate crimes in society The presence of hate crimes can be traced throughout history there are ample examples to suggest the existence of hate motivated crimes that have been inflicted on people for a long time No such law or harsher penalties have made it possible to end the hate crimes until this day instead it has proliferated more and become more intense So dealing with hate crimes should not involve more hate or cruel behaviour that would not just aggravate it but rather make the prejudice more dangerous The perpetrator s hate would increase thinking that the justice system had unjustly treated him This would impact other people in his community supporting the same views or ideas which can eventually increase more minds with hatred and prejudice The more appropriate way of dealing with this would be to evoke a sense of empathy in the offender and teach the values that would eradicate such hate ideas Of course the method might not successfully vanish all the hate at once but at least it would impact the mind of several others who thought of committing a crime and persecuting innocent lives
