When denim meets denim, you meet the best.
Janvi  kickstarted promotions for her upcoming movie, the fashion set can tune in to get ready to note down some exceptional inspirations. As seen yesterday, the actress picked out a blue denim corset top from S&N by Shantanu & Nikhil. 
Janhvi's strapless structured attire entailed a colour-block detail and metallic studded rivets. This was tucked inside high-waisted denim pants to meet the matching code. The distressed detail on her straight-fit jeans spiced up her OOTD. Miss Kapoor's look counted on minimal accessories such as mini gold hoop earrings and white strappy stilettos. To make it fit for a brunch or a date, pick a clutch that goes with your footwear. The starlet was seen with her styled into a ponytail, a brown lipstick, and a winged black eyeliner.
