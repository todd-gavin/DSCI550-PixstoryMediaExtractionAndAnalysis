Chelsea could lose out on Reece James in the summer as Real Madrid are reportedly interested in the fullback and could make a move in the coming days. 

The Blues were looking to offer Reece James a new contract. But that could not happen due to the sanctions placed by the UK government. Owing to this, Real Madrid want to make full use of this opportunity to sign the fullback. 

Dani Carvajal has been out of form for Los Blancos. To add to this, Lucas Vasques could also be shown the door in the summer. Hence Real Madrid are looking to make a mammoth bid of £58m (€70m) for Reece James in the coming days. 

The versatile Reece James can play as a right-back, centre-back, and even a right-midfielder. Hence this make him more valuable in the eyes of the Spanish giants as per the report.

Since joining Chelsea in 2019, James has made 116 appearances for the club. The right-back has especially burst onto the scene this season scoring 5 goals and 6 assists in just 20 Premier League games. 

This upturn of form from the 22-year-old has made him a regular starter at Stamford Bridge. But the right-back has been unlucky with injuries and this has stopped his momentum with Chelsea to an extent.
