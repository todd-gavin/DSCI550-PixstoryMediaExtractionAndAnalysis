The James Webb Space Telescope s first sharp photograph acquired a startlingly clear photo of a sparkling star nearly light years away from Earth The image which was released on Wednesday depicts a faraway Milky Way star located roughly light years away in the Ursa Major constellation in deep space MASS J has been assigned to the star by experts At this distance light released by the star years ago is only now reaching Earth providing earthlings a close up view of what the star looked like during the reign of Julius Caesar and the time of Jesus Christ AccuWeather said that this image was taken during a test of the telescope which employs a complex system of hexagonal mirrors that have been fine tuned to the nanoscale level or one billionth of a metre The changes allow the mirrors to form a single surface allowing for the formation of a single image in extremely precise focus according to NASA scientists who added that the test exceeded their expectations Other experts noted that the shot is so accurate that delicate background elements may be seen Not only do you see the star and its spikes from diffraction but you also see other stars in the field that are closely focused which is exactly what we want Lee Feinberg the NASA engineer who led the development of Webb s optical elements told reporters according to the BBC
