According to a United Nations report released on Monday, India is expected to overtake China as the world's most populous nation next year. The report also predicted that the world's population would reach eight billion people by mid-November 2022.
According to the World Population Prospects 2022 report from the Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the world's population is expected to exceed eight billion on November 15, 2022.

In 2020, the world's population decreased by less than 1%, rising at its sluggishest rate since 1950.

According to the United Nations' most recent estimates, the world's population may reach 8.5 billion people in 2030 and 9.7 billion by 2050.

The population is predicted to peak at 10.4 billion people in the 2080s and stay there until 2100.

Just eight nations—the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Tanzania—will account for more than half of the predicted growth in the world's population by 2050.
