Psychotherapy can take different formats depending on the therapist's style and the patient's needs. A few designs that you might encounter include:

Individual therapy involves working one-on-one with a psychotherapist.


Couples therapy involves working with a therapist as a couple to improve how you function in your relationship.


Family therapy improves the family dynamic and can include multiple individuals within a family unit.


Group therapy involves a small group of individuals who share a common goal. 

(This approach allows group members to offer and receive support from others and practice new behaviours within a supportive and receptive group.)
