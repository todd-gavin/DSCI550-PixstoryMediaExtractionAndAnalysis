We cannot deny the fact that there have certainly been improvements in renewable energy sources over the last decade But a complete replacement is not possible Solar energy still has an amateur status Solar merely equals the amount of electricity that the nation generates by burning natural gas captured from landfills The biggest sources are the old methods Oil still reigns supreme at quadrillion Btu natural gas at quads and nuclear at Hydropower and biomass bring up the rear at and quads The wind is just quads And coal the great carbon belching demon of the global energy mix its contribution is quads That s nearly times all the nation s wind and solar generation combined Modern society depends on always accessible power If the power goes down then society stops There will be a complete halt to life with no phones or internet or ATMs hence Renewable energy can never under any practical scenario meet that target To imagine that battery prices could fall sufficient to make wind and solar backup such tremendous power demands is simply a misconception We still have a very long way to go to achieve such a state
