Eid al-Fitr was supposedly invented by the Islamic prophet Muhammad, according to Muslim belief. 
These celebrations are said to have started in Medina after Muhammad moved there from Mecca, in accordance with some traditions. When the Islamic prophet Muhammad came in Medina, Anas, a well-known companion, related that he observed people celebrating two particular days in which they amused themselves with amusement and pleasure. Muhammad then observed that Allah had predetermined two holidays: Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.
