Do u remember the ad where a beautiful woman was centre of attention in a wedding till her small daughter comes running calling her mummy. 
And then comes the tag like 
“Aap ki twacha se aap ki umar ka pata nahi chalta”. 
The haldi aur Chandan and santoor . 

With sandalwood and turmeric, which have been for ages the grandmas beauty secrets. So these elements when first combined in a beauty soap must have really attracted attention. In the days of lux, there was a soap which talked tradition and worked . 

The basic template of the santoor ad stayed on over the years. The last ad has Bollywood actor Varun Dawan about to offer a role to a lady and ultimately finding her to be a “mom’. 
I however have a very different problem with the ad. The glowing skin and perceived beauty for the Indian woman can stay on even as she is a mom/mummy. Do the ad film makers still believe in a different perception of beauty and why can’t a young mother have beautiful skin. 
The show targets middle-class lady and promising ‘younger looking’, radiant skin to her consistently, its normal for ur skin to glow after your have kids. And that’s how it should be.
The ad however did work in the favour of this soap. Santoor steadily gained popularity and in the next two decades became the third-largest selling soap in India, with a market share of almost 9%.  In 2018 it overtook lux soap and became number two soap. It is now a 1,000 crore brand and  is exported to 15 countries too. 
In 2019, Santoor released a commercial for its product – Santoor Gold, which featured a young tour guide. There was no reference to her status as a mother. Instead, the ad focused on how the soap could help protect a woman’s skin against pollution- a career oriented woman. 
It is refreshing for me as a Modern woman, I would  want to look good even as a grandmother.
