A research team from the UNIGE has discovered a potential target for restoring standard therapy efficacy in resistant individuals Many people with breast cancer acquire resistance to traditional medication therapies targeted at inhibiting cancer cell proliferation A molecular regulator involved in these resistance mechanisms has been found by a team from the University of Geneva UNIGE Even if cancer cells are treated the loss of this regulator causes them to proliferate through a signaling route that can be stopped by another treatment The findings of the research allow doctors to consider dual therapy for patients whose malignancies are no longer responding to normal treatment This research was published in the journal Cancers One of the female hormones estrogen plays a negative effect in the majority of breast cancer patients A receptor for this hormone which is generated by the ovaries is found in around two thirds of breast malignancies When estrogen attaches to its receptor it promotes cancer cell proliferation Hormone therapy which consists of a pharmacological treatment that prevents the cancer cells from being stimulated by the female hormone can be used to treat these hormone sensitive cancers More than a third of patients develop treatment resistance Tamoxifen is the gold standard in the treatment of hormone sensitive breast cancer This chemical binds to estrogen receptors and blocks them preventing estrogen binding and consequently cancer cell growth promotion However the cancer cells in roughly of treated people eventually develop resistance to this chemical Clinical trials are now underway for a therapy that inhibits the estrogen independent cell activation pathway In patients with low levels of SPRED the authors recommend combining tamoxifen with this additional chemical There are definitely still more research to be done but this combination of therapy could be very promising concludes Didier Picard of the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Faculty of Science of the UNIGE
