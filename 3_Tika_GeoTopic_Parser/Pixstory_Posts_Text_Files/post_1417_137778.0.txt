A sentiment that I have seen a lot of late

I don’t necessarily feel that way, but I’m older than Timothée- my personality was well and truly baked before the age of social media. I think it must be hard sometimes for teenagers today- they don’t have a lot of room to be wrong online 

I know that if I had published every single stupid little thought I had at the age of 13 or 14, I would have definitely said some things that I regretted. The internet is forever! And while people should of course be accountable for whatever they say, I think that perhaps it is not useful to judge the young too harshly. There’s always room for nuance and change, and hopefully growth. What do you think?
