Bengaluru Twitter is furious as walking 8 km took just a minute longer than driving amid rain.

Bengaluru has been seeing incessant rains
and citizens were severely inconvenienced by
waterlogging. Schools and colleges declared a holiday on Tuesday as the city grappled with uprooted trees and flooding potholes. There was a five-hour traffic jam outside RmZ Ecospace in Bellandur, reported Times of India, and lack of movement was even responsible for the death of one person as flooding delayed the ambulance. A Twitter user, Sahil Mathew, has shared a snapshot reflecting the grim 

Mathew's screengrab from Google Maps posted on Tuesday shows that if one chose to walk the distance of 8 km from Mahadevapura to Bellandur, it would take them an hour and 42 minutes. What was shocking is the fact that
by car, the 8.7 km distance would take only a minute less, given the traffic situation. The car route via NH 44 showed a 1 hour and 51 minute delay due to congestion.
