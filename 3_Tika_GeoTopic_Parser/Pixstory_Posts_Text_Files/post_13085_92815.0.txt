Greece faces "double standards" and "cruelty" in repatriating Afghan refugees to Turkey.
While Greece welcomes Ukrainians, it cruelly pushes back Afghans fleeing similar violence.

 "This double standard is a behavior that mocks the European values ​​of equality, the rule of law and dignity."

Turkey and Greece are the main routes for asylum seekers to enter Europe, and in recent years tens of thousands of Afghan refugees have arrived in Turkey and from there to Greece and European cities.

The number of people leaving Afghanistan for European countries has increased following the fall of the previous government to the Taliban.

Greece has been a destination for many women activists in recent months, including former members of the Afghan parliament.

A number of former MPs held the first session of the Afghan Women's Parliament in Exile in November last year.
