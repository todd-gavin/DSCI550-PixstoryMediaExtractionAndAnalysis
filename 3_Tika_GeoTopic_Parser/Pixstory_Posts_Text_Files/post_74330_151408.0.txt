Arsenal 3-1 Tottenham, 5 Things We LEARNED!1. Midfield masterclassFrom Arteta starting Zinchenko to overload the build up. To Xhaka & Partey excelling. Arsenal dominated the midfield. Xhaka continued his evolution as a number 8, now having 5 goals & assists this season. Partey’s wonder goal killed Conte’s initial plan. We’ll win most games with them two starting. 2. Arteta outclasses ConteFootball won this game. Conte’s style of play can be effective but today was next level football terrorism. Parking the bus works for some but not for Arteta. Who’s overloads & team dominance killed Conte’s game plan. 3. The role of Bukayo SakaSaka had a under the radar masterclass. His presence alone on the right hand side attracted 2/2 Spurs players which give more space to others. He’s getting that ‘Messi treatment’. 4. Saliba pockets KaneWilliam Saliba has done it again. First NLD, at 21 against Harry Kane? Not a problem. Calm as you like & as dominant as ever. Alongside Ben White, he was our stand out defender. 5. Narrative rewrittenThe United defeat started a poor narrative that Arsenal couldn’t beat good teams or defend counter attacks. Today that was dispelled. As emphatic a win as it gets.
