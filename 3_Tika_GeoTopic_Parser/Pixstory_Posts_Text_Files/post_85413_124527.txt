It s beaches over mountains for me any day And it is a proven fact that beaches are better As per travel triangle beach goers tend to lead active highly energy lifestyles because of how happy and exciting the beach lifestyle is People who enjoy mountain getaways on the other hand tend to be more level headed travellers who enjoy being in nature They adhere to the philosophy of present focused living and single tasking A beach person is perceived to be more of a social butterfly in the virtual world A beach person is more likely to take frequent selfies post them on all social media sites respond to every comment and become fixated on their phone A mountaineer on the other hand wouldn t mind giving up the virtual world to reconnect with wouldn t mind ditching the virtual world to get connected to the real world around them Trying their best to stay away from people s focus and shying away from the camera is the person who chooses to be a mountain monk when it comes to beach or mountains So what do you prefer
