I have this beautiful and I think healthy habit of drinking herbal tea in the evening before going to sleep, a family tradition that we inherited from my grandmother who used to make us a cup of camomile tea before going to bed in the mountains in the evening. We decline it according to the day if we are in company we make it a social fact a last cup and a last chat If we are alone we drink it as a consolation If there are problems we use the herbal tea as a thought chase if there are issues to celebrate instead the herbal tea replaces the glass of wine that with the diet not allowed you drink it As you like it I love the fruity ones and with lots of cinnamon
