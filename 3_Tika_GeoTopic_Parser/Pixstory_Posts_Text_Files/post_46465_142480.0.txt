We all have an inner critic . At times this little voice can actually be helpful and keep us motivated toward goals ‚Äî like when it reminds us that what we're about to eat isn't healthy or what we're about to do may not be wise . However , this voice can often be more harmful than helpful , particularly when it gets into the realm of excessive negativity . This is known as negative self-talk , and it can really bring us down . ‚ùåüß†
Negative self-talk is something that most of us experience from time to time ! It creates significant stress , not only to us but to those around us if we're not careful . Negative self-talk can take many forms . It can sound like - I'm not good at this or I can never do anything right ! 
Negative things we say to ourselves ; ‚ùå
1 I hate how i look today , I'm so ugly ! 
2 That would never look good on me . 
3 I'm a failure . 
4 I wish i had that too ! 
5 I'm so stupid , i can't believe i made this mistake .
6 I don't deserve to he happy . 
7 Everyone has their life together except me ! 
8 I'm never going to be successful . 
9 I suck !
All these critical inner dialogue are directly linked to depression and poor mental health ! Those who find themselves frequently engaging in negative self-talk tend to be more stressed .
So it's definitely something to fix ! Always remember - Optimism and positive self-talk take practice . It may feel strange at first . But the benefits you‚Äôll experience are real . Positivity is like a muscle . It needs regular exercise to become stronger , but with practice you‚Äôll get the hang of it ‚Äì and reap the rewards ! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚úÖ
