I was looking at the wedding pics of J LO and besides gushing over how beautiful she looked It made me wonder whether there is any standard age for peak beauty Although I am not talking about J Lo or for that matter people like Rekha closer home I mean for lesser mortals like us No Botox no surgery types The health reporter in me decides to dig deeper Well Lots of studies with good enough sample size tell you there surely is an age when both men and women look their best Studies say both genders look most attractive in their thirties A study done almost a decade earlier explains it the best possible way It s based on US survey of people has found The study carried out by Allure magazine found women are considered most beautiful at show signs of ageing at stop looking sexy at and are thought of as old at Same for men they look best in s start showing age at However they can still look sexy till and are considered old by So here is the reason why SRK still tops the sexy chart Ranbir not yet still looks young and Deepika looks stunning Surely better than the newbies on the screen the Saras Ananyas and Jahnvis Having said that if you are an eternal optimist than age is just a number Do share your thoughts
