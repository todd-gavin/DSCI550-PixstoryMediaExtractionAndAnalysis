The Wonder Twins are no longer active. 

According to various sources, the DC-based film project, which was set to begin production in early July, has been cancelled. 

Hollywood Reporter said that Riverdale star KJ Apa and 1883 actress Isabel May were cast in the film, which was being created as a feature for HBO Max. The Wonder Twins script was written by Adam Sztykiel, who also directed Dwayne Johnson's next film Black Adam. 

According to sources, the decision to shut down the project was made several weeks ago. According to insiders, the leadership of Warner Bros. Discovery, the new company combining Discovery and Warner Bros. and now being led by CEO David Zaslav, is imposing a mandate that DC movies should now be made with a theatrical-first goal. Wonder Twins, the way it had been conceived, was “too niche,” said one source.
