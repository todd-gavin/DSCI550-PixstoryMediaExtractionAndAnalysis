Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will not attend a Buckingham Palace banquet for world leaders coming to London for Queen Elizabeth's funeral along with other members of the royal family. People reported that The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were previously invited to the event on Sunday, but the palace has since changed its invitation policy to state that the reception is only "for working members of the royal family." Heads of state and dignitaries from other countries who have come to London for Queen Elizabeth's state burial on Monday will be welcomed at the reception hosted by King Charles and Queen Camilla. At Westminster Abbey, 2,000 people are anticipated to attend the occasion. In Westminster Hall on Saturday night, Prince Harry will stand with his seven cousins by Queen Elizabeth's casket in Westminster Hall, where it has been lying in state and visited by thousands of mourners since Wednesday.
