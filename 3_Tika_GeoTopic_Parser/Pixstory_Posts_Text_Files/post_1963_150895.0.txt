Of all the stupid online “challenges” children partake in for likes, clicks, views, and fame, a new challenge might be one of the dumbest. The “sleepy chicken” challenge, as it’s called, challenges people to take a video of them eating chicken doused with NyQuil. The challenge became popular enough to the point that the FDA sent out a statement warning of the risks.Despite how dumb this challenge is, there are some that are so unnecessary you wonder how they even became popularized in the first place. For example, there was the “Benadryl challenge” where children were encouraged to consume large quantities of Benadryl, leading to at least one known death and numerous hospitalizations. Additionally, there was the “blackout challenge” that encourage children to choke themselves in various creative ways until they passed out, leading to at least seven known deaths.Parents, be sure to monitor your children’s usage of social media to ensure that they do not participate in these dangerous and often times deadly acts.
