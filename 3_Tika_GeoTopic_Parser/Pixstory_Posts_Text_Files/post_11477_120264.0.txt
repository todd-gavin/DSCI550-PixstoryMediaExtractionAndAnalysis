Consumption of the herb haritaki (Terminalia chebula) with rock salt is extremely beneficial for good health in the monsoon. 

One can eat 2-3 gm of haritaki powder with a pinch of rock salt each afternoon during the monsoon, after lunch.

You can incorporate a glass of warm water mixed with a teaspoon of honey and lemon (half a lemon) juice in the morning, to flush out accumulated toxins.

You can boil 5-6 holy basil (tulsi) leaves, 2 peppercorns, 1 clove, a small bark of cinnamon, and some ginger in water. Allow the decoction to boil until it reduces to half, and sip it warm.

Grate a small piece of raw turmeric and squeeze a few drops of Lemon juice on it. Have it once a day for 2-3 weeks for a detoxifying as well as rejuvenating effect on the body.
