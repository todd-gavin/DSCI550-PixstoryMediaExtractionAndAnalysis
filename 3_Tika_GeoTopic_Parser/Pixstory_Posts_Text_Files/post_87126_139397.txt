Chelsea had the worst possible start to their Champions League contention losing to Croatian side Dinamo Zagreb The London side were already lacking confidence after a shaky start to their season and this loss has further added to Chelsea s problems It was the London side that took the ascendancy early in the match with the first clear chance in the th minute falling to forward Kai Havertz who couldn t score Zagreb made the most of the missed opportunity as they went ahead on the back of their striker Mislav Orsic The Blues were caught on the break with Orsic making a daunting run from his half receiving the ball from his partner up front Bruno Petkovic He then outpaced million euros signing Wesley Fofana and dinked the ball into Kepa s net Since the goal it was Dinamo who mounted most of the attacks in the first half They created more chances and kept ball position In the second half Chelsea tried their best to break the deadlock The best chance of the match fell to Reece James whose shot late in the match hit the upright The match ended with Orsic s solitary goal as the London side slumped to their third loss in five matches This is also the first time that Chelsea under Tuchel have been beaten in three consecutive away games Pierre Emerick Aubameyang has a forgetful debut Chelsea s new signing Aubameyang did not have the best of debuts he would have hoped for The striker was seen sporting a face mask due to a broken jaw in an attack during a recent home invasion The Gabon striker had the ball in the net but it was ruled offside as the supplier of the pass Ben Chilwell had drifted in an offside position Apart from this he did not have much to show as the Croatian team was resolute to most of Chelsea s attacks Aubameyang is one of the many star players bought by Chelsea in a transfer window where they have spent more than million euros Tuchel s team would be looking for a swift change in their fortunes
