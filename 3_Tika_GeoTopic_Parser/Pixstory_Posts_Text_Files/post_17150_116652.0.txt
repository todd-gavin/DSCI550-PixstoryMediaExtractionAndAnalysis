Ranbir Kapoor is currently promoting his upcoming film Shamshera and has been more active than ever. From once being MIA for 4 years, considering his last film came out in 2018 to now being out and about making appearances for promoting his film, Ranbir Kapoor is everywhere. 🥰🥰

During one such promotional event, someone played a game of ‘Two truths and a lie” with the actor and that is when things got interesting.  ✅✅❌

After spending a few minutes thinking about what he wanted to say, Ranbir Kapoor made three statements that had the internet guessing about which is which.  🤔🤔

He started by saying

1- “I am having twins”. 😍

2- “I am gonna be a part of a very big mythological film”🔥

3- “I am going to take a long break from work.”😇

Since everyone knows about Brahmastra, it was easy to guess that the statement about starring in a mythological drama was definitely true. As far as the other two were concerned, people wondered if he really was having twins with his wife Alia Bhatt. 😍❤️
