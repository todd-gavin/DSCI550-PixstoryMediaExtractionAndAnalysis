The current Secretariat of West Bengal, the Writer’s Building is one of the scariest places in Kolkata.
Writer’s Building is one of the centres of power in Kolkata and many important duties of the West Bengal State Government are carried out here. However, this heritage building is also said to be haunted.
Writer’s Building was used as the office of clerks and junior staff in the period of the British raj. Lots of huge halls are kept vacant here which makes the place scarier. People generally refuse to work here late in the evening. The lift sometimes run by itself here in the night.
Nightguard and the owners of food centers besides the building reported about the scary cry of persons inside the man less building at night. Also late in the night a roaring voice of someone can be heard from the closed doors of this haunted building.
You can explore the reality of this place by having some interviews with the local people and staff. Please don’t dare to stay there at night to explore the truth.
