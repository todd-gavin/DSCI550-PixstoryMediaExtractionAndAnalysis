Gender is a social construct Language is a social construct Culture is a social construct These three things were made to make the life of mankind read man kind language easy not more difficult than it already was Funnily enough all of these three things have had one common thing Putting cisgendered heterosexual men above others For the longest time men have oppressed women in different ways To name some cultural ways fighting wars to win territory and treating women as trophies where they used women as anything that they pleased from a sex toy to a punching bag For the language part of it women s different identities have been used as swear words to the point men find it funny to talk about mutilating their genitalia And for the gender part do I even need to start From aborting a fetus just cause it s female to murdering women because they re walking alone In what world do you think culture language and gender are a reason enough to defend gender roles and workplace discrimination How does that make sense If anything these things make the worst of arguments What s wrong with a man expecting his daughter to give him grandchildren The lack of consideration It is not their place to expect If a woman wants to have children she will If she doesn t she won t There s nothing wrong with wanting grandchildren but expecting them when the daughter isn t ready Sounds like an entitlement mentality to me However the problem isn t limited to that The problem is extended to how men are not denied promotions for being fathers but women are for being mothers The standard to judge a man is his potential and the standard to judge a woman is her performance which never seems to be enough Women have to keep trying to prove themselves all the time only because they are women Which is not okay Oh and one last thing a woman doesn t owe you or anyone an explanation for wanting to focus on her career life happiness and not bearing babies It s her choice you re not entitled to explanations or her life
