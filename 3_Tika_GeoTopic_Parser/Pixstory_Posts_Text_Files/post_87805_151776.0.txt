Hello everyone! I am Aashna Katiyar a 19-year-old girl living alone in Delhi and here are a few things that I discovered about myself in the past few months that I wouldn't have known otherwise. First of all, I don't like to sit idly, I need to do something whether it is talking to my friends, taking late-night strolls, trying a new recipe, or doing my makeup at 2.00 am. Secondly, I like coding, the way it challenges me and tests my patience, coding push me to my limits and finds better solution. At last, I like meeting new people. Since college started I have interacted with so many people and everyone I have ever met has taught me something new and it has helped me a lot in growing into better person.
