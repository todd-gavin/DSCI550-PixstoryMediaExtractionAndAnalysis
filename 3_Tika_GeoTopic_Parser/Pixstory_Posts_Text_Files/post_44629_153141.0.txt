Operation LEGHORN and the battle of the Namka Chu continues......
If Gen. Sen removed Umrao on grounds of professional incompetence then he should have been made to relinquish 
command of XXXIII Corps. Discredited Corps Commanders do not retain their ranks and appointments.
It has also been insinuated that the burden of commanding Assam, Nagaland and NEFA was too heavy for one commander. 
This is perhaps the most unconvincing argument of all. . . In any case the solution obviously lay in appointing another commander for the Assam and Nagaland sectors and freeing Umrao to concentrate on the NEFA operations with which he was familiar. 
Would Government have removed Umrao if he had agreed to have a crack at the Chinese without harping on military prudence? Brig. Dalvi, writing later, pondered another matter with serious implications:
The last puzzling question is why Government did not appoint Kaul to command XXXIII Corps and create a phantom corps for the dormant Assam and Nagaland Sectors. XXXIII Corps was a running organisation, had a tuned up staff under an extremely capable Brigadier and the necessary corps troops for themaintenance of troops in combat.
The unavoidable conclusion is that Delhi was afraid of making an issue of removing Umrao lest the truth about the divergence of opinions within the Army and with the politicians leaked out, thereby shattering the morale of the nation. Umrao wanted more time and time was the one commodity Government did not have.
