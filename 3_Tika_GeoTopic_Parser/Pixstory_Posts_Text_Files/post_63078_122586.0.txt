Former West Bengal Governor and NDA nominee Jagdeep Dhankhar defeated Opposition nominee Margaret Alva on Saturday to become India's 14th Vice President. Dhankhar received 528 votes, Alva received 182, and 15 votes were deemed invalid. As incumbent M Venkaiah Naidu's term expires on August 10, members of both Houses of Parliament voted throughout the day to elect the next Vice-President, who will take the oath of office on August 11.

Dhankhar was set for an easy victory from the start, with support from regional parties such as the Janata Dal (United), YSRCP, BSP, AIADMK, and Shiv Sena. Even though Alva received support from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), and Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), she did not receive support from the Trinamool Congress (TMC), the second largest Opposition party in Parliament after the Congress, with 39 MPs in both Houses. The TMC had decided not to vote, citing a lack of consultation with them on Alva's candidacy.
