On Sunday morning in the paddock of the Red Bull Ring the Spielberg circuit which hosts the Austrian GP F nothing else was said in the previous days in fact cases of verbal sexual harassment were reported against some female fans present in the stands and around the racetrack where there are huge spaces intended for camping rivers of beer flow and the party goes on from the first light of the morning until late at night Both Formula and Red Bull, owner of the plant, took part We appreciated it reads the note from Verstappen&#39;s team There is passionate support from the majority of fans but we are shocked to hear that there have been unacceptable incidents in the grandstands and car parks We hope safety and the authorities deal with this quickly There is no place for such situations either in racing or in society Inclusion is a value and we want ours to be a safe place for enthusiasts to enjoy our sport Instagram photo redbullracing
