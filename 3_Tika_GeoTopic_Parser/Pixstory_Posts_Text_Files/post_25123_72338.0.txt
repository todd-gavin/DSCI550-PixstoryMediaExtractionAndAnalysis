A two month old stray kitten brought home to take care. She spent some rime exploring the entire house n slept peacefully. We thought our beagle boy 'Zingo' would be freinds with her. But we were wrong. The boy was frowning, felt his space being intruded and sulked so much so that in 12 hours we had to give 'Zella' away for adoption .... Now 'Zingo' is happy and satisfied like always ...Boss of the house!!
