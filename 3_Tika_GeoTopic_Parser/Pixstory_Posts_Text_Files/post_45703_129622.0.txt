The US space agency has made one of the many thrilling discoveries from Lucy mission that was  anticipated and expected from the probe spacecraft. 

Mint reported that the team led by Lucy has discovered that one of the Trojan asteroids orbiting Jupiter has a satellite of its own. 

Launched in October 2021, Lucy will be the first spacecraft created by humans to visit more asteroids than any other mission after it is finished. In March of this year, Polymele, one of Lucy's targets, showed off a tiny partner that resembled the asteroid's own moon. 

The companion rock is said to be 5 kilometres in diameter, located about 200 kilometres from Polymele. According to its widest axis, Polymele has a diameter of 27 kilometres. 

Astronomers have not yet given the moon a name because astronomers are yet to define the nature and characteristic of the rock.
