Erik Ten Hag will be leading Manchester United in the 2022/23 season. The Dutchman was signed after a horrible season under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick. 

A lot was expected from the Red Devils after a positive 2020/21 season. However, things went wayward despite big-money signings in the summer as United finished 6th in the Premier League table. 

The incoming manager Erik Ten Hag was reportedly interested in bringing former Manchester United striker Robin Van Persie to the club. Ten Hag wanted Van Persie as one of his backroom coaching staff. However, the Dutch footballer reportedly refused to come to Old Trafford. 

Van Persie currently works as a coach for the first-team and youth set-up at Feyenoord. His son is also part of the youth setup of the Dutch club. The offer initially tempted the Dutch legend, however, he decided not to go to United. 

Explaining why he said no to the offer, Robin Van Persie said, "My son and daughter are important right now. In London, when I played at Arsenal, we moved five times. We also lived in Manchester and Istanbul. All in all, we were away for almost fourteen years. But then we thought 'what's good for the kids now?' and felt a little stability would be nice."

Robin Van Persie scored 48 goals in 86 games for Manchester United. Hence bringing him back as an assistant would have instantly made Ten Hag have a connection with the fans. However, things didn't go as planned and it has to be seen how the next season unfolds at the club.
