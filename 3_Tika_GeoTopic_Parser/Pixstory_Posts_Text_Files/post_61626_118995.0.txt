In the aftermath of Vince McMahon’s retirement, it was Bruce Prichard who took over Vince’s duties on the creative end of things. Prichard was reportedly in Gorilla Position for last Friday’s “SmackDown” and inherited a lot of McMahon’s television roles. While there is no word on whether Prichard has been slotted into the role permanently, Paul Heyman has emerged as a possible candidate to lead WWE’s creative direction at some point in the future.

According to Wade Keller on his latest PWTorchVIP podcast, Heyman and WWE Chairwoman & Co-CEO Stephanie McMahon share “a very positive” dynamic these days, a far cry from the mid-2000s when they reportedly butted heads on several occasions.

“As I’ve talked about in recent months, it seems like to people that have seen them that Heyman and Stephanie get along,” Keller said. “You know like, genuinely, there’s a chemistry and a dynamic between them that’s very positive. And that’s very different than you know, 15-20 years ago. So, Heyman is someone to watch. He’s really, really smart. And he is a wrestling guy.”
