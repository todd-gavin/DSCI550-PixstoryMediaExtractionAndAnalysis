 Birthday BluesIf you’ve ever had your birthday between exams then you probably know what I’m talking about. Most people look up to their birthday but people with birthdays during half-yearly exams or annual exams have a different pain in their life. A good six birthdays gone, pfftt… just like that. Then the person thinks okay my 12th grade is done, I’ll enjoy my birthday in my 3 years at college but no, this time internal assessments greet you and if by chance, you’re in an all girls college then you’re basically back in school. I could blame the education system for keeping exams and tests at such a horrible time but that’ll be unfair to others. Rather, parents should probably consider this issue!A huge shout to parents to plan conceiving their kids at the ‘right time’ and let them be kids and enjoy while they’re still free from responsibilities. :)
