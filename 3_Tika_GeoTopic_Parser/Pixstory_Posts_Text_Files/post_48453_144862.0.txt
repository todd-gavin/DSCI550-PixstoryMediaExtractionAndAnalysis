Good lord! I have never understood how people do all of that despite knowing what all can happen to them. I don't want to be a bummer to your spirits but skydiving is definitely not the best idea. For one, there's always the risk of injury. Even if you're an experienced diver, there's a chance that something could go wrong during your jump and result in serious injuries or even death.
Secondly, high-altitude jumps can be incredibly dangerous. As you rise higher into the sky, air pressure becomes more intense and less dense - which means objects have more resistance to movement than they do at lower altitudes. This makes it difficult for your body to regulate its own blood flow (and therefore your temperature), leading to potentially life-threatening dehydration and hypothermia conditions.
Skydiving isn't without its costs: The price of admission usually includes both the cost of flight AND accommodation (in case something goes wrong). So unless you really enjoy spending money on things that might not turn out well for you, skip the plunge!
