I was in bachelor s when I enrolled myself for the English literature lessons as an extra subject Can t be more proud and happy to have encountered this subject which taught me so much about war peace caste race and gender It has been some years since I finished my bachelors but the book have stayed with me ever since My favorite part was the theme around race taught me so much about black history Maya Angelos poem Still I rise became my favorite ever since I first read it It talks about courage confidence and being unapologetically oneself in the world of hate The poem goes like You may write me down in history With your bitter twisted lies You may trod me in the very dirt But still like dust I ll rise Does my sassiness upset you Why are you beset with gloom Cause I walk like I ve got oil wells Pumping in my living room Just like moons and like suns With the certainty of tides Just like hopes springing high Still I ll rise Did you want to see me broken Bowed head and lowered eyes Shoulders falling down like teardrops Weakened by my soulful cries Does my haughtiness offend you Don t you take it awful hard Cause I laugh like I ve got gold mines Diggin in my own back yard You may shoot me with your words You may cut me with your eyes You may kill me with your hatefulness But still like air I ll rise Does my sexiness upset you Does it come as a surprise That I dance like I ve got diamonds At the meeting of my thighs Out of the huts of history s shame I rise Up from a past that s rooted in pain I rise I m a black ocean leaping and wide Welling and swelling I bear in the tide Leaving behind nights of terror and fear I rise Into a daybreak that s wondrously clear I rise Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave I am the dream and the hope of the slave I rise I rise I rise
