Having fun with the assignments while we canðŸ˜‚This is a Set up for a Paper Cut-out Stop Motion Animation...For those of you who are unfamiliar with the term-It is a kind of Animation where in your background, charecters or any objects in your animation are cut-out from paper ,these cutouts are then moved or animated while simultaneously clicking individual photograps of every position...when these photographs or frames are put together it looks as tho they are motion!!
Paper cutout especially can be very tiring as it is every difficult to give charecters cut off from paper body movements that look natural...As you can see in the above picture the paper cutouts of the two characters are stitched at the position of our joints so they can be given human like movement!
