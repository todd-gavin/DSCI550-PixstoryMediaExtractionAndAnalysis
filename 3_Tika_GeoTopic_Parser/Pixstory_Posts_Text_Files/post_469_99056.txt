She was tossing and turning in bed I thought the day at trampoline park must have exhausted her and she was unable to sleep At the strike of midnight she quickly left the bed and came back with the card and goodies The handmade card had hearts all over wished me Happy Mother s Day To my first best friend that came into my life My ten year old called me Her First Best Friend and left me in tears Yes mothers are truly your first friends your first best friends what touched me was her acknowledgement at such a young age Son who is a teen tried wished me for Mother s Day in a casual manner as not being emotional about all this is cool when u are in class I guess but the fact remains he waited for midnight and came into my room at the exact strike of These days the arguments are at the peak sometimes so is love and care When it comes to sharing I am the person He will always have that special place in my heart he made me mother My parents came back to India after five months of stay abroad and I felt that relief when I hugged her I felt loved the love no one else gives u Her touch is a blessing that I pray to God stays with me for life When my daughter gave me the card I felt the msg ring in my ears Yes for me also my mother was my first BEST FRIEND and she will continue to remain so I have discussed everything with her bullying at school trouble with studies with friends matters of heart ups and downs of life marriage children work She hates everyone I despise she loves everyone I love She cries with me and my brother she laughs when we laugh At times I feel she had a capacity of taking all her troubles on herself becomes our shield Her spirituality her kindness has even my friends turning to her she is everybody s mother Happy Mother s Day mom
