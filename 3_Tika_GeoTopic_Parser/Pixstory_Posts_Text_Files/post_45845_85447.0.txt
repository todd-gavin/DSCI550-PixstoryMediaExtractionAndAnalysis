NASA TV reported that The Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science Division (ARES), which preserves, studies, and shares NASA's collection of extraterrestrial samples, is opening the sample at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. The Apollo Next Generation Sample Analysis Program (ANGSA) is leading this effort, with the goal of learning more about the sample and the lunar surface in preparation for the planned Artemis missions to the Moon's South Pole.

“Understanding the geologic history and evolution of the Moon samples at the Apollo landing sites will help us prepare for the types of samples that may be encountered during Artemis,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington. “Artemis aims to bring back cold and sealed samples from near the lunar South Pole. This is an exciting learning opportunity to understand the tools needed for collecting and transporting these samples, for analyzing them, and for storing them on Earth for future generations of scientists.”

NASA had the foresight to keep some of these samples unopened and pristine when the Apollo astronauts returned them roughly 50 years ago. 

"The agency anticipated that science and technology would advance, allowing scientists to analyse the material in new ways to answer new questions in the future," said Lori Glaze, director of NASA's Planetary Science Division. "The ANGSA programme was created to study these specially kept and sealed samples," says the researcher. 

The ANGSA 73001 sample came from an Apollo 17 drive tube sample recovered in December 1972 by astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison "Jack" Schmitt. The astronauts hammered a pair of 1.5-by-14-inch tubes into the lunar surface to gather rock and soil fragments from a landslide deposit on the Moon's far side.
