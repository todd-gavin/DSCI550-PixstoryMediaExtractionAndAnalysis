Remus Lupin, the Defense Against Dark Arts teacher for the students at Hogwarts in their Third Year, who was undoubtedly the best DADA professor Harry ever had, while his time at the school. 

Remus is a beautiful character - an even more beautiful human, and one of the most heartwarming characters you'll come across. With his knowledge and patience in his classes, to his painfully human, humble nature, honest concern for people around him, his insecurities, alienation, his sufferings, being from an underprivileged background, an outcast in both worlds, with mental as well physical effects, him being able to still somehow rising above everything, genuine love and support for Harry - being not just a teacher, but a well wisher, all the time, for your best friend's son.. being one of his biggest mentors, Remus is a wonderful character through and through. 

The sheer relatability of being an outcast, the absolute warmth and love Remus radiates, as a teacher, and later on, the pain one feels upon seeing him struggling, to the happiness when he finds love, a proper family, to the tear jerking end, he's truly one a kind!
