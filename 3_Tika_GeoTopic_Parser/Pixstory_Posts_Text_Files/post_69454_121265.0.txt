The Ziarat of Baba Reshi, a well-known Baramula shrine that is 13 kilometres from Gulmarg and located next to the Alpather Lake, belonged to the saint Baba Payam-Din. A well-known Muslim saint by the name of Baba Payam-Din served as a courtier to Zain-ul-Abidin, the ruler of Kashmir. Baba Payam-Din passed away in this shrine in 1480 after spending his days in prayer and meditation. 
The Baba Payam-Din burial, which is covered by a fabric embellished with exquisite craftsmanship, is the focal point of this shrine. The shrine is well-known for bestowing the blessings upon its followers. After receiving their wishes, devotees return to the shrine to thank the great saint with an offering.
