As Isha Sadhguru has rightly said, “Before we build, we must strive for balance. Without the necessary balance in one’s life, whatever we build will only lead to more trouble.”
The functionality of life is based on the basics of balancing. Something as fundamental as the concept of balancing is what we seek, since the moment we set feet in this world. The child is taught and seeks to achieve balance in handling his legs when he learns to walk, he learns to balance his hands when he wants to hold his toy and he learns to balance his body when he runs towards his mother. This quest for balancing goes on and on and the list to balance something or the other, keeps on increasing along with the numbers of candles on our cake. We spend most of our lives in this pursuit of striking the perfect balance where we have the best of all possible permutations and combinations, which supposedly will give us eternal happiness.
