Globalization has contributed to the dramatic rise of civil society organizations around the world though their impacts have been uneven across countries and issues Some countries have been particularly open to developments associated with globalization rapid communication and wide dissemination of information quick travel and transportation political democratization and fragmentation economic dynamism and concentration of wealth or cultural homogenization and polarization that support the emergence of civil society organizations as important actors International NGOs and NGO alliances have taken roles in service delivery and disaster relief policy analysis and advocacy and social learning and problem solving But the real question is In what ways does globalization affect NGOs and civil societies within nations and across national boundaries While the main focus of research has been on international NGOs and the evolution of transnational civil society the impacts of globalization on domestic NGOs and national civil societies also needs to be understood The reason is that international initiatives often have their roots in national issues around which civil society actors first organized and then found that international initiatives were required to attack the problems involved Even when international movements begin with international NGOs they often need domestic NGOs to give them the political base and legitimacy they need to survive and be effective And it may well be that some of the most important effects of international NGO activities are their impacts on domestic civil societies International NGOs and civil society alliances have demonstrated the capacity to engage in international debates that affect the processes and institutions for international governance Past initiatives have increased access for international NGOs Thus the increases of information flow human travel and trade associated with globalization have on the whole made the formation and operation of international NGOs and NGO alliances easier and less expensive The costs of international organization and coordination have been drastically reduced by the shrinking globe Globalization has also contributed to the rise of new problems to which international NGOs and alliances may be particularly relevant The rise of transnational environmental problems such as global warming ozone depletion and cross border pollution has sometimes severely taxed the capacities of inter state institutional arrangements
