I am not the captain of the team,but i acted like a caption and leads the team so that our players gets motivated.So, we won 2 matches continuously and our team goes in the semi final.We are very excited and nervous also because the semi final match will be more difficult than these two matches because we have to face pharmacy department there. But no big deal, we are practicing hard for the game so that we will win the semi final match.And Inshallah we will win the tournament also.Thankyouüòç‚ù§Ô∏è‚öΩÔ∏è.
