Chris Rock made his first appearance after being slapped by Will Smith during the Oscars, it was on the comic's own stand up show. He kicked off his comedy tour on Wednesday at Wilbur in Boston. 
The crowd applauded Chris Rock as soon as he entered and gave him a standing ovation. The first words Chris uttered were, "You got me all misty and s***."
Just as the crowd settled down, Chris asked them, "How was your weeknd?", the crowd burst into laughter. Chris did speak a bit about the incident but didn't mention the Ceremony, the organisers or even Smith.
He said, “I don’t have a bunch of s*** about what happened, so if you came to hear that, I have a whole show I wrote before this weekend, and I’m still kind of processing what happened,” Chris Rock added. “So at some point I’ll talk about that s***. And it’ll be serious, and it’ll be funny.”

Later on the show, he told the crowd, “Except for some other pretty weird things, life is pretty good right now,” which led to a big applause . Even Chris hadn't expected such a response from the crowd at times and he mentioned this on the set. He also received a standing ovation at the end. This was the kick start of Chris Rock's Ego Death World Tour.
