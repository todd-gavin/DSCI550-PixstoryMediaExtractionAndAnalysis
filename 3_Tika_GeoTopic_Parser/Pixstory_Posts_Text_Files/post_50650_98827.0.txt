Most indicators show that Australia's economy is booming: the monthly unemployment rate is approaching a new low, inflation is picking up, and business confidence is at an all-time high. 

Bloomberg reported that the government estimates that growth will be significantly above the global average this year, following a brief slump caused by Covid-19. This seems to be a textbook case for raising interest rates. Will politics, however, obstruct the process? 

Almost everything happening in Australia right now is being examined through the prism of the upcoming election, which will be held on May 21. While the Reserve Bank of Australia sets borrowing costs independently of the Australian government, it despises being drawn into partisanship. That's exactly what raising the benchmark rate from near zero on May 3 would do.

The last time the Reserve Bank tightened during a campaign was in 2007, when conservative Prime Minister John Howard relied on a strong economy to defeat Labor Party leader Kevin Rudd. Howard was defeated, and his team issued a warning to the central bank. There was a lot more going on at the time — Howard's backing for the US war in Iraq was profoundly unpopular — but the autopsy included increased rates.

Let’s see what happens next!
