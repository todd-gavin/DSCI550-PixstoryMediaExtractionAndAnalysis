After England s triumph over Ivory Coast Jack Grealish backed his teammate Harry Maguire Maguire was booed by the Wembley fans before the game which irritated his manager and Grealish when they spoke to the press afterward Grealish jumped to Maguire s defence emphasising that the Manchester United defender was a major contributor for his country Personally I think it s ridiculous said Grealish Even tonight he was brilliant Our first two goals first one him driving out with ball second one driving a bit and passing to Ollie Not every centre back can have those qualities He s been a fantastic servant for his country and it s ridiculous for him to get booed It wasn t something the team liked Harry s a strong minded person His performance tonight will have done him the world of good It will only spur him on It s not nice to hear but you ve got a job to do We had a brilliant relationship with the supporters last year at the Euros and we need to keep it like that into the World Cup Maguire s future for United and England is a valid topic of debate and there s reason to believe he ll need time away from the squad to reclaim his form However it s tough to listen to the nasty welcome he received from some spectators under the Wembley arch without thinking that the contempt directed at him is excessive The most expensive defender in history will have to take comfort in the fact that Southgate is on his side even if some elements of the England fanbase
