She is the recipient of the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke Award and the Bharat Ratna, which is the highest civilian honour in India. She has recorded songs for over a thousand Hindi movies. 

Some of my favourite songs by Lata Mangeshkar: 
Tujhe Dekha Toh Yeh Jana 
Its from the movie Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Kumar Sanu, this song has become an evergreen classic now. Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol in the mustard fields, the picturesque scenes have immortalized the song. 

Ajeeb Dastan hai ye 
This song is from the movie, "Dil Apna Aur Preet Parai" which stars Raaj Kumar, Meena Kumari, and Nadira. This song is a timeless gem and written by Shailendra. Shankar Jaikishan is the music director. 

Humko Humise Chura Lo 
The song is from the movie Mohabbatein, its written by Anand Bakshi. Lata Mangeshkar along with Udit Narayan have sung this song melodiously. Jatin-Lalit provided the music. 

Tere Liye 
This will always be my favourite Bollywood song, from the movie Veer-Zaara, it plays finally at the end when the two lowers unite, its a song filled with the hardships one endures in love. Lata Mangeshkar and Roop Kumar Rathod have sung this song with to pure perfection. The words penned down by Javed Akhtar.
