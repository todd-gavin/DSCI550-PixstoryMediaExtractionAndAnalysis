2. Riqui Puig

Ruqui Puig has struggled to meet the heights he was destined to once he broke through the La
Masia academy. The talented midfielder has seen his fair share of problems at Barcelona, with
struggles with former manager Ronald Koeman accusing him of leaking information to the
press.

However, the player does possess immense talent and would look to do better in an
environment where he gets more time.

A creative midfielder by craft, Puig is good at finding teammates in space and bringing the ball
up the field. His intelligence, perfect technique and ability to quickly execute were set to make
him one of the pearls of La Masia, however that has failed to materialize.

Puig would be
perfectly suited to a mid table team in the Bundesliga, a league with tons of space and attacking
football where a player of his profile would thrive and do well.

3. Samuel Umtiti

Sadly, Samuel Umtiti’s Barcelona career has not gone exactly to plan. Constantly plagued with
injury problems, he has spent last season warming the bench at Barcelona which has seen his
value plummet.

Having won the World Cup in 2018, Umtiti’s career has seen a sharp decline
with his stellar performances a distant memory of the past.

Umtiti is currently on €245,000 per week at Barcelona, proving to be a massive drain of the
finances and more evidence of Barcelona’s poor wage management. With very few chances of
once again making the team at Barcelona, it would be in the best interest of all parties for Umtiti
to move on.

However, Umtiti’s massive wages make it difficult to move him on, with Barcelona
surely having to subsidize some part of his wages if he is eventually sold.
