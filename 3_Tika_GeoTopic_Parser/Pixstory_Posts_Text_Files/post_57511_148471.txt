So to whatever degree useful or necessary it may seem there are things for which we should refrain from believing it Most of the myths I have heard do not tell that it is not always good at the end of the labyrinth the harsh realities are often concealed by portraying the win of good over bad But to speak of the st century where we live and reside it s a different story we can t always find happiness at the end of the struggle I think there are some truths falsely represented and narrated by the mythologies which eventually contradict their aim of teaching lessons or shaping modern thinking What I feel is that belief is a part of the human world and it can t be entirely accepted or denied but at least we can avoid believing and accepting anything and everything Most importantly avoid making the myths the truth People often try to impose their learnings and half truths on others by using tales to prove their point This is the wrong and incorrect way of understanding myths So nbsp it s OK to believe in certain things but not everything that can harm people and the world through its falsehoods
