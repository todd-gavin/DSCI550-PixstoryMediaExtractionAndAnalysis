As gun laws are being dismissed one by one, Is America realising the fact that the rate of gun-related deaths in the US appears to be getting worse? 

According to data published Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US firearm homicide rate in 2020 was the highest recorded since 1994.

It has been a surge between 2019 and 2020, as the overall firearm homicide rate increased by about 35%, according to the new data in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

The covid-19 pandemic might have triggered severe emotional stress in individuals resulting in homicides and suicides that too between certain racial communities.


The researchers have also found that during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, US counties with the highest poverty level had firearm homicide and firearm suicide rates that were 4.5 and 1.3 times as high, respectively, as counties with the lowest poverty level.

The largest increases in 2020 occurred among Black boys and men ages 10 to 44 and American Indian or Alaska Native men ages 25 to 44, the data showed.

The country must realise what's happening around the world is stressing out the country too. the recent rise in overall violence, hate, tensions, political divisions and anger displayed in communities across the country. When one state passes a law suppressing a particular social group that affects the overall community badly. Hence violence should be curbed at any cost that every life is precious.
