A stranded bride had no choice but to hitch a ride to her own wedding - after three Uber drivers cancelled on her.

Marksteen Adamson was driving through traffic to visit friends for a reunion lunch in South East London when he spotted a bride “looking confused and flustered”.

As he stopped at the pedestrian crossing, the bride, known only as “Anastacia”, started walking towards his car before asking if he could give her a lift.

The good Samaritan kindly offered to drive the bride and her bridal party to the church where the groom and wedding guests had been waiting for almost an hour.

“I started filming as I thought it would be a great shot, seeing her cross the road in her full attire,” Marksteen said on TikTok.

“Then she saw me and started gesturing.

“It turns out that she, her bridesmaid and team had been trying to order Uber but three (drivers) had cancelled at the last minute and she was 45 minutes late for church.

“She asked if I could give her and the group a lift, and so they jumped in to my Land Rover and I drove her to church.
