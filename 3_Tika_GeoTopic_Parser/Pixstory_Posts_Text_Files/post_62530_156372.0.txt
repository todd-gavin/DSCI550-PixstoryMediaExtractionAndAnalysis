It has long been recognised that the evolutionary position of bats is rather unclear. Formerly classified as belonging to the superorder Archonta, they are now classified as Laurasiatheria. The Order Chiroptera includes bats. means "hand wing" in Greek. The oldest bat fossils we have discovered lacked echolocation and had claws on all except the thumb of their fingers.
They physically send out a sound wave, listen for a response, and then utilise that sound to guide themselves in the dark. Did you know that bats can use echolocation to find objects as thin as a human hair? Different species use it differently.
Of all mammals, bats have the greatest heart-to-body mass ratio.
Some bat species have very intricate courtship rituals; males (and some females) fly around hibernacula at extraordinary speeds while doing loop-de-loops and whirling around to entice a mate.
They are sensitive animals. 77 species are either severely endangered or endangered. The sickness known as White-Nose Syndrome has already claimed the lives of approximately 5.7 million bats in the USA. Because of the loss of their habitats, so many are in peril. By far, we spread more diseases to them than they do to us. Our power cords cause them to become electrocuted. We erect buildings on the sites where they nest. And the fear and hate caused by stupid Dracula myths have us throwing rocks at them or shooting them. It's just sad. They are innocent little balls of fluffs â€” just sky puppy, we need to start appreciating them more. Treat them like you'd treat a wild squirrel.
