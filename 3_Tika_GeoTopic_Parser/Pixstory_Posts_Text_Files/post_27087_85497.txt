Dickinson Season Following up to the events of Season of Dickinson the show takes a leap in the lives of the characters Sue and Austin are now married and living in a separate house Emily is writing her poetry with even much more burning passion than ever with her only reader still being Sue If you loved the first season of the show you will only grow fonder and fonder of the show in it s next two seasons Dickinson is one of those rare shows that do not go downhill as the seasons progresses it only finds a way up The second season of Dickinson is a work of art every single frame with Emily Dickinson is worth your watch and the story gets complicated as the lives of the characters start to get inter twined New characters are introduced who may not be exactly as who they seem For me Dickinson season symbolises character growth Emily grows through the course of the show in all three seasons but it is in the second season that we see the peak of Emily s growth Austin and Sue show a completely contrasting and different sides to their characters and Vinnie starts finding herself At the core I feel that the lives of all the Dickinson s are nothing but sad till the end but the way the show handles their lives and the struggles related to it in a positive and uplifting light is truly commendable Nothing left to be said if you liked the first season of Dickinson you will surely love the second season as well
