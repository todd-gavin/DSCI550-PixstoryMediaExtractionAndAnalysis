Sex work is work Sex workers are workers You hire them to do a job they do the job It s work that is not easy and often quite dangerous and it s dangerous mostly because other people don t respect the people who do it There s no logical reason why sex workers shouldn t be afforded the same protections as everyone else People often cite the reason that normalisation of sex work is the reason behind sex abuse and trafficking I call BS The kind of irrationality that fuels sex workers marginalisation is directly responsible for the worst parts of the current sex industry or even the older ones The stigma against sex work the shame that it is forced to carry is the reason why the sex industry has a dark side Moreover every industry has its dark side but do we go ahead marginalizing and abusing its workers for it No We understand that the workers aren t responsible for what the industry is perpetuating Then why do sex workers take the brunt for what the mafias in the industry carry out People should be able to make choices about their bodies We are all trying to survive in capitalism and if people choose to do it by adhering to other people s sexual needs then why not We all sell our bodies here albeit it s never seen like that because most professions are not stigmatized and people are not coming with reasons laided with shame to discriminate against them There s no denying that the porn industry is exploitative just like any other big industry but why should the workers trying to survive bear the brunt for it It s like saying the fashion industry is exploiting people so let s go after local designers to hurt them It just doesn t make sense Men have sexualized women and trans people for the longest time in movies and magazines and schools and literature but as soon as women and queer people capitalize on it it s wrong It heavily implies that women s consent holds no value and their sexuality should be controlled by men now that is something that should carry shame with it Her body her choice
