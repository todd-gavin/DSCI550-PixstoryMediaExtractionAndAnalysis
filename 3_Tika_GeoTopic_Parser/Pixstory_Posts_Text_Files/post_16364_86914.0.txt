For Bachchhan Paandey promotions, Akshay Kumar, Kriti Sanon & Jacqueline Fernandez arrived in a vintage car at the city's most popular theatre. 
Upon arrival at the Gaiety theatre in style, Akshay, Kriti and Jacqueline also cut a ribbon at the box office. Again, for the same, Akshay did not use a scissor but instead carried its character's weapon and flaunted it. TheyÂ  then went on to purchase their own tickets at the box office.
