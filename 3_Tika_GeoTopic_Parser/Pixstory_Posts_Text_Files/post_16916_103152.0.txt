Recently, while talking to Indian Express, Sonu Sood opened up about why he has been doing back-to-back Hindi films. Sood said, “I have always been choosy with my scripts, whether I do Tamil, Telugu or Hindi films. South saves me from doing bad Hindi films. Otherwise there comes a phase when you think you’re doing a film just for the sake of being seen in a big film. South helps me from staying away from doing that.”
