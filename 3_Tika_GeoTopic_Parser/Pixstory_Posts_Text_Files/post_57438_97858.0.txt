It is appalling to see how the anti-trans movements are increasing and affecting the identity of trans people.

They don't feel accepted amidst the fear of hate and negative feelings evoked in people's minds for them. So why do people believe in this set portrayal of gender identity that considers cisgender and heterosexuality as innate, and any other deviation from it is not acceptable? Is it because they don't want to leave the sight of gender conformity that has shaped the idea of preserving their identity? 
Passing anti-LGBTQ bills to harm the trans identity and the concept of protecting the class and culture by excluding the trans people worsens the situation.

Living amidst these narratives and unacceptance makes it difficult for them to accept their identity and not consider themselves "unnatural beings".
This relentless increase in the idea of transphobia by people who want it to be spread all across the world so that they can preserve the identity of heterosexual people is vicious.

The idea of gender conformity prevails, and it haunts every trans person who wants to live with self-affirmation and assurance. People who support the identity of trans people are threatened and abused in a similar way a transperson is inflicted.
