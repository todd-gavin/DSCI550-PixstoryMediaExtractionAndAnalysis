Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya is contesting the 2022 assembly elections from the Sirathu constituency. Prior to being a part of the legislative council, he was a member of parliament from the Phulpur Lok Sabha constituency which he won in the 2014 general elections. Maurya is the OBC face of the BJP helping them in expanding their base from the upper castes to the OBC, a combination which led to party's victory in 2017 assembly elections.  

Maurya’s stature in the party rose high when he was assigned as the party president of the state in 2016 and his prominence as a political leader further grew, after, under his leadership, BJP registered a historic victory in the 2017 UP assembly elections with 312 seats during which he was also considered for the Chief Minister's position. Now, in the current elections, he is contesting for the seat of Sirathu and the exit polls show that he will emerge victoriously. These elections are crucial for Maurya as if  the BJP is unable to get a majority of their own, and exit polls go wrong, in this scenario of an alliance, Maurya might become an alternative candidate for the CM’s chair.
