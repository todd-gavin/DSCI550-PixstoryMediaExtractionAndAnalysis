Daniel Kaluuya will not be in the Black Panther sequel, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed. Rotten Tomatoes was first to report the news.

Kaluuya, who will soon be seen in the Jordan Peele thriller Nope, played W’Kabi, the best friend to T’Challa/Black Panther and the husband of Okoye, played by Danai Gurira, who is expected to return for the sequel, Wakanda Forever.

Kaluuya told Rotten Tomatoes that he had to back out due to scheduling conflicts with Peele’s movie, which is due out in theaters this month.

Wright — who expressed anti-COVID vaccine sentiments, raising concerns about her return after the CDC implemented rules requiring all non-immigrant and non-citizen air travelers to the U.S. to be fully vaccinated — eventually returned to the Atlanta set and filming resumed in January. At the time, it was reported that M’Baku actor Winston Duke was taking on an expanded role in the Panther mythos.
