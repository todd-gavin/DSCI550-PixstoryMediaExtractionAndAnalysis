For those who have been subjected to sexual misconduct, the question of whether to express themselves—how, when, or how often—never goes away. By far the most common answer on record for the people to describe their experience has been “No”. In spite of the incredible difficulty of continuing to speak, many still choose to, months or years or decades later. If they froze in the past,they may feel disempowered and frozen to respond in the present. They may have chosen unconsciously to bury the past. Coming forward now would only trigger those unprocessed feelings. So they choose to stay silent, consciously or unconsciously, until it feels safe to come forward.

Another reason could be shame. When faced with shame, our tendency is to hide or escape the event that elicited the painful emotion. So we may not all rush forward to tell the world that we are being sexually harassed. Shame also comes with a sense of powerlessness as well as a belief that we are fundamentally flawed. So many people feel that they will not be believed or that it is their fault.

However, getting the support you need can help you be more confident and comfortable breaking your silence. It’s never easy, but when you are ready to speak out against your perpetrator, it can be an empowering first step in the healing process.
