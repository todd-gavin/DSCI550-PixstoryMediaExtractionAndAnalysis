Without a doubt, Kate Middleton is the large "royal" sister we wish we had at our side. The Duchess of Cambridge wasted no time in getting to know her niece Rose and the newborn daughter of Pippa Middleton and James Matthews. The 40-year-old member of the royal family has "already met the kid," a source told US Weekly, and he or she believes the infant is "simply gorgeous."

In addition, Duchess Kate is "overjoyed for her sister" and her brother-in-third law's child's birth. For the uninitiated, Pippa and James already have a 3-year-old boy named Arthur and a 16-month-old daughter named Grace. According to news sources, Pippa Middleton and James Matthews welcomed Rose on July 11. Since May 2017, Middleton and Mathews have been wed. In contrast, Kate Middleton and her husband Prince William have three children together: Prince George, 9, Princess Charlotte, 7, and Prince Louis, 4.

The insider said to US Weekly that Pippa Middleton and James Matthews are doing well after becoming parents of three children "Since having Rose, Pippa is doing well. She and James are completely enamoured with their little one and are adjusting to being parents to three children nicely."

Best wishes to the lovely couple! What the royal family playdates will be like, we can only imagine!
