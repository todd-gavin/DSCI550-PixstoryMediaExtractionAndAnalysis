"In the absence of a reliable infrastructure, we were going to have to build one," George Cohon wrote. "We were going to have to go right into the countryside and develop a network of suppliers that didn't exist before."

When McDonald's did finally open its doors in 1990, some were skeptical and believed it wouldn't last.

"It will all go downhill. We don't know how to run a restaurant like this," Andrei Grushin, an engineer who visited the restaurant on opening day, told the Washington Post at the time.

But the pains McDonald's took paid off.

Service with a smile

One of the defining characteristics of the Moscow McDonald's location, at least on that first day, was the friendly staff.

"They are always smiling," a young employee told CNN reporters on opening day. "As you know, in Moscow, not in every restaurant you can find smiling people."

Another employee told the CBC that when she smiled at people, they asked what was wrong. "They think that I'm laughing at them," she said.

At that time in the Soviet Union, "food service was really terrible," said Williams College's Goldstein. "It was rude, places were dirty. There often wasn't food that was listed."

McDonald's was an "almost magical place where food always replenished itself and people smiled at you," she said. "It represented more than just a place to get American hamburgers."

The hamburgers themselves weren't as exciting, at least not to some customers.

"I don't like it at all," one man told the CBC of the food, shaking his head. Another said he liked the cuisine, but had "expected more." The meal was pricey. A meal could cost half a day's pay for the average consumer, according to the CBC
