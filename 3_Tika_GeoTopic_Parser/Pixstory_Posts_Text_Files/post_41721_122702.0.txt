The Hockeyroos are one game away from taking home the gold after making it through a contentious penalty shootout against India to reach the gold medal game. 

Fox sports reported that Australia, who were eliminated from the Olympics by the same opponent in the quarterfinals the previous year, let up a late goal, but the umpire granted them an early reprieve by allowing Rosie Malone to attempt the opening penalty shot again. 

Malone's attempt had failed, but the official timer had not been set up properly, giving her a second chance.

“That would be a national outrage if that happened to Australia,” commentator Alastair Nichoson said on Channel 7.

However, after tearing his ACL in the semi-final, an Australian competitor gave one of the gutsiest performances of the Commonwealth Games thus far, capturing a bronze medal. 

But on day eight, England won a plethora of gold medals, cutting into Australia's lead in the medal count and putting them just a few points behind.
