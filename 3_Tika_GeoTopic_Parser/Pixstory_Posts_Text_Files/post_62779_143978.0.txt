This is one of my favorite quotes ever. It says so much in so less. Self love is one of the most important things that you can do for yourself.
Why?
Because self love means accepting who you are, what you have, and where you're going - flaws and all. It's about acknowledging your worthiness, regardless of what others may think or say. And without self-love, it's difficult to build healthy relationships with other people or feel fulfilled in your work or leisure pursuits.
So why should YOU start practicing self love? 
You'll be less susceptible to negative emotions like anxiety and depression. When we're unhappy inside, it impacts our moods and reactions to the world around us negatively. You'll achieve greater happiness on a long term basis because genuine self-love brings satisfaction both now AND in the future.
â€œSometimes your joy is the source of your smile, but sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy." - Thich Nhat Hanh Self-acceptance leads to gratitude - which makes us nicer people towards others (and ourselves!). Gratitude creates virtuous cycles of positive reinforcement that keep building over time!
