Manchester United face Brentford tonight In Sir Alex Ferguson s time this would ve been as easy win but times have changed small teams are competing and winning against the Red Devils easily Ralf Rangnick hasn t been able to implement his style as of yet some blame it on the midfield and most balme it on the players mentality One thing is sure though The formation hasn t worked and Rangnick has admitted this and he said in a press conference that they ll be changing to He said in the press conference We have now decided to play a like we did against Aston Villa with one holding six two eights and three offensive players It ll be interesting to see who they employ as the No because everyone has been saying United don t have a proper player for that position Matic is just too slow now The line up will be interesting to see We might get to see quite a few changes on this one Nonetheless its going to be a great game of football
