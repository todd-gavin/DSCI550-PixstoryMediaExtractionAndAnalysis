The skin is an organ whose anatomical and functional integrity is essential for defense against the external environment comments Riccardo Asero President of AAIITO just think of the very frequent micro traumatic events to which we are exposed every day to infectious agents to toxic acids bases etc and also to allergens, for example, patients suffering from atopic dermatitis frequently sensitize percutaneously due to the altered permeability of their skin, therefore it is essential to take care of it to preserve its defensive function. Beware of those who use photosensitizing drugs If in general the treatment of mild forms consists of a cold bath soothing and anti-inflammatory emollient creams such as low-potency cortisones explains Dr. Myriam Zucca dermatologist and allergist AAIITO the risk increases for a patient who uses photosensitizing drugs such as antibiotics such as tetracyclines or retinoid quinolones both by oral and local routes including drugs for the treatment of acne such as isotretinoin gels based on benzoyl peroxide topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs especially ketoprofen and more generally cosmetics containing perfumes But the sun is not always harmful sun exposure with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis If sun exposure is always contraindicated for patients suffering from pathologies such as systemic lupus erythematosus Dermatomyositis Polymorphic solar eruption Porphyria there are instead the more common forms of Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis which can improve with gradual and correct sun exposure as well as the initial form of Mycosis fungoides which is a cutaneous lymphoma For in fact, phototherapy is provided for these pathologies during the winter with the use of cabins available in dermatological centres
