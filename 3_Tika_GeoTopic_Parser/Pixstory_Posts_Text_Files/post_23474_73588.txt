I spent some time last year on the beautiful beaches of Varkala Varkala is sort of like a lesser known Goa although its nowhere near as crowded it has plenty of natural beauty to rival the other resort destinations of India It is about km from Thiruvananthapuram the capital of the south Indian state of Kerala It is on the Arabian Sea and known for Varkala beach backed by palm covered red cliffs In the south Papanasam Beach is believed to have holy waters On a nearby hill the ancient Janardanaswamy temple is a Hindu pilgrimage site dedicated to Vishnu Farther inland the Sivagiri Mutt monument memorialises the social reformer Sree Narayana Guru who is buried here I ate some of the absolute best meals of my life here From giant crab lobster and shellfish to more traditional Kerala rice and fish curry plates it was all delicious and very reasonably priced Try Black Beach where they serve contraband beer or God s Own Country Kitchen on the Varkala Helipad cliff these lovely little restaurants have been struggling with the pandemic and the ensuing lack of business They deserve all the customers they can get and Varkala will certainly delight all the tourists who are new to its expansive beaches
