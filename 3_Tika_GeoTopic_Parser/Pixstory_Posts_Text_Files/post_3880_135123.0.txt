I have lived in Delhi all my life, but it wasnâ€™t until I started dividing my time between Delhi and Bengaluru did I start to appreciate the beauty of my hometown. Delhi is, of course, beautiful in many ways, but what makes it especially alluring compared with BLR is how accessible it is. Be it the wide roads or the efficient public transit system, Delhi makes it easy for most people to get around. 

A good public transit system is what is said to make or break a city. Every time I have been able to get around a city on my own, I have fallen in love with it. Access to safe, clean and efficient public transit systems is a socio-economic leveller that enables access to education, employment, entertainment and freedom in more ways that we can define. 

So, today, I ask you to tell me the one thing that you would like to change about your place of residence, wherever you live, to make it a better one. For me, the answer is always the public transport system.
