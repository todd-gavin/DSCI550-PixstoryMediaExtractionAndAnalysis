This effect came into light in 1964. The situation was that a woman was threatened, abused and murdered in a public place. Reports mentioned that there were a substantial number of onlookers who noticed this ordeal but took no steps to either catch the criminal or call law enforcement authorities. Though, the police reached the spot of murder shortly afterwards as they were informed by a good Samaritan. But this incident brought focus on the non action of those who witnessed the murder, as it was concluded that the chances of a victim being helped by an individual reduces as the number of people present increases. This happens because subconsciously each person thinks that as there are a large number of people present, at least one of them will take corrective action. But, this thought also plagues the mind of others and hence none of them takes the initiative.
