Droupadi Murmu, the BJP-led NDA's presidential nominee, filed her nomination papers on Friday in the Rajya Sabha secretariat in front of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other senior leaders. She is well-positioned with the backing of regional parties and an intact alliance. In what was perceived as yet another attempt to forge agreement over the person who would take the helm of Rashtrapati Bhavan, she also solicited the backing of opposition parties.

A few minutes before submitting her candidacy paperwork, Murmu chatted with important opposition figures such as Sonia Gandhi, the president of the Congress, Sharad Pawar, and Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of West Bengal. According to sources, the opposition leaders wished Murmu well but did not guarantee their votes or support because they had already chosen Yashwant Sinha as their candidate.

A consensus on the presidential election will improve the nation's democratic system, according to BJP chief JP Nadda, who also called Congress leaders Mallikarjun Kharge, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Farooq Abdullah, and HD Deve Gowda to ask for their support of Murmu.

Additionally, sources described this as a "NDA ruse" to force the opposition to support a female candidate who is an adivasi from a distant hamlet in Odisha.

Rajnath Singh endorsed Modi's nomination of her, which Modi had originally recommended. The chief ministers of the states where the BJP is in power recommended and seconded the second group of nominees.
