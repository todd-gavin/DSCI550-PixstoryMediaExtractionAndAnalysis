Supermodel Bella Hadid walked the Coperni Womenswear Spring/Summer 2023 runway on Friday during Paris Fashion Week wearing a spray-on costume that was essentially made particularly for her.
She made an appearance on stage during the last act while she covered her breasts with her hands and was in nude underpants.
The material solidified as they spray painted Bella's body, turning into a wearable cloth that took on the shape of her body and looked stunning on her. With thin straps sliding off her shoulders and an asymmetrical hemline with a slit, she exited the stage wearing an off-the-shoulder white dress.
Science and fashion together can truly create magic. The process was fascinating to see, to say the least!
