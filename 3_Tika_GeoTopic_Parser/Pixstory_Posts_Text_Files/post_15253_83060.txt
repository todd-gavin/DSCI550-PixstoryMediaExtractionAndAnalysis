From February to March OGR Torino presents two new exhibitions for an unprecedented relationship with time HERE by Maria Hassabi curated by Samuele Piazza with Nicola Ricciardi at the platform and HARDSCAPES by Nina Canell curated by Samuele Piazza with Lorenzo Giusti at the platform A sculptural environment changes the spaces of the Binario creating the landscape for HERE live installation by Maria Hassabi commissioned by Secession and Wiener Festwochen Vienna and produced by OGR Turin in collaboration with Onassis Foundation Athens with the support of Milvus Artistic Research Center MARC Knislinge and Onassis Stegi Athens The artist&#39;s bodies and five dancers inhabit the sculpture and explore a choreography at a decelerated pace inviting visitors to join them in sharing time and space Immersed in a constant continuum the movements of the dancers create a situation of changing presence that underlines the slippery nature of the here and now here ness Since the early years Maria Hassabi has created a unique choreographic practice that focuses on stillness and the space between movements At the heart of the choreography stillness and deceleration are used both as a technique and as a subject of the representation while the performing bodies oscillate between dance and sculpture, a living body and a static image
