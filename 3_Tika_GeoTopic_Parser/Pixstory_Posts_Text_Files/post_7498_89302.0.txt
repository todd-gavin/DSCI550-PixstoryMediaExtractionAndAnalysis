There are a dozen of new restaurants, children, that have made themselves available for new yorkers eating needs when so many sit-down restaurants understandably take a break at the start of the week.

Wau is an intriguing new Southeast Asian restaurant on the Upper West Side, and Rolo’s in Ridgewood, Queens, where the dream of Monday night banana daiquiris and short-rib carbonara is very much alive. My mental inventory also includes Cha Kee in Manhattan’s Chinatown, they have flaky pastries inspired by Hong Kong’s curry puffs, and blackened, stewed chicken afloat in a turmeric-rich curry. And should I need excellent aguachile on a Monday, I’ll no doubt turn to Mariscos El Submarino in Jackson Heights, Queens.

There’s also Soothr Thai Noodle Bar in the East Village, which is perfect if you like a bit of wallpapered escapism with your ba mii pu. The Hudson Yards-adjacent Ci Siamo, which is one of the finest Union Square Hospitality project in quite some time, slings its buffalo-butter tagliatelle and classic Italian cocktails on Mondays. Also open is nearby Zou Zou’s, the new Mediterranean restaurant from the Quality Branded restaurant group; Lodi, Ignacio Mattos’s Italian spot at Rockefeller Center, now serving dinner; and Andrew Carmellini’s Carne Mare.

If you have tremendous foresight and incredible luck, Runner Up in Park Slope, Brooklyn, the sister restaurant of the bakery Winner, has three seatings every Monday (5 p.m., 6:30 p.m., 8:15 p.m.). Small-bites fans should look no further than the Spanish seafood spot El Pingüino in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, for a Monday night treat. And for a special occasion, you can reliably expect that Gage & Tollner in Downtown Brooklyn will be there for you and your loved ones.

So do tell us where you are planning your to eat coming monday?
