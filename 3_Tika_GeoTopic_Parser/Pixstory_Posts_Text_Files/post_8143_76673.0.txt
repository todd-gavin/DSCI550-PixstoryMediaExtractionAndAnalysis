Ministry of Education of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan announced that high schools for girls are most likely to reopen in March across Afghanistan.

The educational year in Afghanistan starts in March which also marks the first month of the new solar year.
The Ministry said that the IEA is committed and optimistic to reopening schools for girls and that it is working in this regard seriously and tirelessly.

Spokesperson of the Ministry of Education Aziz Ahmad Reyan said the reason behind not allowing girls to attend classes in high schools was creating a safe system for girls.

“IEA has no issue with girls’ education that is why we have paid the salaries of female teachers. We will hire more female teachers for girls.” Said Reyan.
The spokesman added that they are working on capacity building of female teachers and want to increase the number of these teachers so that only female teachers teach girls.

Meanwhile, the ministry also said that only elderly male teachers will be allowed to teach girls in case female teachers were not available in some areas.

Girls are only allowed to attend classes up to six since the Taliban gained power on August 15 last year.

Earlier, spokesman of the IEA Zabiullah Mujahid had said schools and all public universities will reopen as the new educational year begins in Afghanistan.
