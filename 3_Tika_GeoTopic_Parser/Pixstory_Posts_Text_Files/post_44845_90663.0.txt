The Barcelona hero has chosen the game's best three players in each position.

Trent Alexander-Arnold, Reece James, and Achraf Hakimi are among Barcelona player Dani Alves' favourite right-backs in the game today. Due to his performances at Barcelona, the Brazil international is regarded as one of the greatest players to ever fill the position.

However, the 38-year-old has been pleased by the players from Liverpool, Chelsea, and Paris Saint-Germain, who have emerged as some of the finest in the world.

What's been said so far?

"I admire Trent Alexander-Arnold very much," Alves told FourFourTwo. "He’s a fantastic footballer – this guy has got world-class skills.
"I also like to watch Reece James and Achraf Hakimi.

"They mix strength with technique and are also great players.

"The three of them obviously have different characteristics and styles, but they all know how to do the job."

What has the trio's performance been like this season?

Alexander-Arnold and James have established themselves as two of the Premier League's best right-backs.

The Liverpool forward has two goals and a personal best 16 assists in all competitions this season, helping Jurgen Klopp's team reclaim the Premier League crown.

Meanwhile, James has six goals and seven assists in all competitions for Chelsea this season. The 22-year-efforts old's this season have cemented his place as a true Blues star.

After a great season with the defending Serie A champions, Hakimi was scooped up by PSG last summer. The former Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid midfielder has quickly established himself in Mauricio Pochettino's starting lineup, scoring three goals and setting up four more to help them build a solid lead at the top of Ligue 1.
