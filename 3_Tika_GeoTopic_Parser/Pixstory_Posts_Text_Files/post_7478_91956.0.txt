5. Neighborhoods

New York is a big city, but feels more like a cluster of small towns once you live here. Each New York City neighborhood has a distinct personality and flavor. From Harlem to the Lower East Side, Astoria to Flushing, Brooklyn Heights to Coney Island, and the Bronx's Little Italy to Staten Island's St. George, the best neighborhoods in NYC are brimming with character and culture, and something for everyone.

6. Excitement

No one can deny the excitement of life in New York City, or the fact that anything can happen at any time. I've been out walking my dog, and without warning, had a celebrity sighting. I've rubbed elbows with film stars, attended the Tony Awards, and scored free tickets to some of Manhattan's hottest events. An ordinary day can turn into an extraordinary experience in a New York minute.

7. Landmarks

The Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Grand Central Station, and the list goes on –– you'll discover magnificent architectural treasures and more New York City attractions than you can count.

Even though I don't spend my free time every weekend touring, I take advantage of the many legendary spots in this town whenever possible, including New York's museums. I can't help but feel proud of living in New York City each time I walk into the Guggenheim, look at the skyline, or stroll through Central Park.

8. Opportunity

It's true that there's more competition in New York than in most other cities, but there's also a host of opportunity. Gotham is a city in which you can make that opportunity. You can come here with a dream and work hard to achieve it. I can vouch that dreams do indeed come true here every single day.
