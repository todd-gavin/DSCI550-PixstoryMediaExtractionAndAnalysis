Randle hasn't quite lived up to his image this season, despite still putting up respectable stats. They aren't up to par with last year's, and he isn't having the same impact on games. Randle's shooting percentages are down across the board, and he's down dramatically in most of the key offensive statistical categories, including points.

He made a thumbs down signal to the New York crowd at a game a few months ago. Randle has struggled throughout the season, and he hasn't missed much time either. He's only missed four games this season, so he's not as prone to injury as Anthony Davis in Los Angeles. Davis' numbers have also dropped this season, although he's been in and out of the lineup. Last season, he looked like a No. 1 option (until the playoffs), but this year, he's just another role player. Randle simply hasn't been able to compete at the same level as his teammates. He's not on Davis' level, but he's still an important part of the Knicks' lineup.

The Knicks thought they'd found their Batman and only needed a Robin, but it appears they're back on the hunt for the franchise's game-changer. No one was calling Randle a superstar, but averaging 24 points per game for a full season catapults you into a different league, and fans come to anticipate those kinds of performances. Remember last year's MVP chants at the Garden? Well, this Broadway second act hasn't lived up to the first, and it's unlikely to do so in the future.
