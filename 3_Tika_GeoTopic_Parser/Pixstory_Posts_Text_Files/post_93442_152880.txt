 pt continued Love is love Pallavi and Kanchan were lovers in their maiden days and while queer relationships are not taken very positively what stands out in this film is the purity of their love When asked are you a lesbian during a lie detector test Pallavi asked for the word lesbian to be defined and received a revert a woman who has had sexual relations with another She confidently denied the allegation and passed the test On the way back her son asked how was she able to pass the test to which she replied only if they asked me if I ever loved a woman I would have failed the test happily Is love enough Kanchan asked Pallavi if she would elope with her and Pallavi confidentially said she would go anywhere with her If their love was so pure why was it not successful That is because it took too long for this country to give a legal status to queer relationships and it has yet not been normalised Love is love but sadly love is not enough The family Pallavi settled married a man took up all responsibilities of a homemaker and became an ideal wife and mother and remained that for years so much that her son saw her as godly taking the right to be human away from her As soon as the family realised her identity they went through phases of denial her husband turned his back to her and son wanted his mother back as she was The daughter who was an activist was overly supportive as a privileged ally of the community and pressurized her into coming out of her closet disturbing her emotionally It took a while for the Patel family to accept and embrace her identity but all s well that ends well The individual struggle of each member of the family brings out the depth of each character and brings the movie in touch with reality because that is how people are imperfect and a little selfish
