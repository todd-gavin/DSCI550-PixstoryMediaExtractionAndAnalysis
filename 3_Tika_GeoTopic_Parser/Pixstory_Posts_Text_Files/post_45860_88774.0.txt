Melania Trump is once again being harangued about her "Einstein Visa" amid claims that she "likes" Dr. Oz, the celebrity doctor who is in a tough Senate primary in Pennsylvania and holds both Turkish and American citizenship.

The former First Lady, 51, obtained US citizenship on a visa reserved for immigrants with "extraordinary ability" and "sustained national and international acclaim." The EB-1, dubbed the "Einstein Visa", is technically reserved for people who are highly acclaimed in their respective fields, including Oscar and Olympic winners as well as reputed researchers and multinational executives. A source recently told NBC News that Melania is a fan of Dr. Mehmet Oz, who has vowed to renounce his Turkish citizenship if he's elected to the Senate.

Meamw reported that shortly after accusations that the former First Lady "likes" the celebrity physician, her detractors questioned her fitness for the remarkable ability category, pointing out how she had received a special visa. 

Melania Trump arrived in the United States in 1996 on a tourist visa, followed by a series of skilled immigrant work visas. She met Donald Trump at a party in 1998 while working as a supermodel in New York. She worked as a top runway model in Europe and was featured in various British and American magazines before applying for a Green Card.
