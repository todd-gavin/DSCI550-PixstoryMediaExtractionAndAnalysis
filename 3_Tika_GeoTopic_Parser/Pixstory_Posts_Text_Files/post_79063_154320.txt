Yesterday s win against Liverpool was symbolic An eventful game in which I d argue neither side were at their best Arsenal managed to continue their excellent start to the season with a win against a side who they have struggled against in recent years albeit if Liverpool haven t been firing of late Let s take a look at some of the things we learnt from the game Arsenal deserve to be top of the leagueI ve heard an awful lot of talk from rival fans so far this season that Arsenal haven t played anyone good yet and that is why the Gunners are top of the Premier League However even the most anti Arsenal football fans can t use this theory anymore Last weekend we beat Tottenham and now we ve beaten Liverpool Six points against two Big Six sides in the space of just eight days You cannot discredit that Gabriel Martinelli is specialWe ve known this for ages now but yesterday just confirmed it Gabriel Martinelli is a special talent He has been undeniably the best left winger in the Premier League this season His pace dribbling and ever improving creativity make him an absolute nightmare for right backs up and down the country He s unpredictable Absolute beast That blistering counter attack and inch perfect pass for Bukayo Saka in our second goal summed his performance up perfectly Unplayable Bukayo Saka is still a threat He came under some criticism early in the season but there s no way to deny how good Bukayo Saka has been of late Two more goals yesterday brings him to seven goal contributions in nine league games this season Our full backs are incredibleBen White dropped yet another stellar display in his new found right back role Don t think he s had a bad game all season But it was Tomiyasu who was preferred at left back to Tierney that impressed me most One of the best players on the pitch The Japanese international really can play anywhere across the defence Another huge win We move Come on you Gunners
