Real Madrid star Karim Benzema has been crowned with UEFA Menâ€™s player of the year award after an exhilarating exploit last season with the Spanish outfit on Thursday in Istanbul. 

The French striker took Real Madrid to their 14th Champions League title last campaign scoring 14 goals in the process as they defeated Liverpool 1-0 in the final in Paris.

He scored 44 goals in 46 appearances across all competitions as Real Madrid claimed the Champions League and La Liga silverware. 

On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti was named the manager of the year by UEFA after guiding the Los Blancos to domestic and Champions League glory. 

The 63-year-old is arguably touted as the greatest managers of all time, having recorded tremendous achievements since the inception of his managerial career in 1992. 

He is the only manager to win a league title in each of Europe's top-five leagues, tasting glory with AC Milan, Chelsea, PSG, Real and Bayern Munich, and is also the most successful coach in the history of the Champions League with 4 Champions League titles to his name and 5 European titles in total.
