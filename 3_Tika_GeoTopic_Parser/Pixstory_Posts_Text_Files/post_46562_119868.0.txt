Did you know that for John Wozniak, the famed security officer who hit him with his own shrug, Michael Jordan spent almost $10,000 on a watch. 

Michael Jordan presented the public with a variety of characters. As per Sports Rush, Sam Smith exposed the manic side of him, and it was said that Jordan would reign tyrannically over the rest of his Bulls colleagues. The All-American, goody-two-shoes hero was another character that marketers adored exploring. 

Michael Jordan himself said that he wished to live a quiet life among all the controversy about what he was actually like. He liked to gamble, play golf, spend time with his kids, and most of all, he wanted the constant media attention to stop focusing on him.

For someone who was given the nickname ‘Black Jesus’, he needed to have an inner circle that he could trust fiercely. While many think of his connections in the league as his closest friends, a lot of the time, it was his personnel who he shared some of his best of memories with. 

His security guards were featured quite heavily in ‘The Last Dance’ and it was clear he shared a special bond with them/ the two who stood out the most were Gus and John Michael Wozniak.
