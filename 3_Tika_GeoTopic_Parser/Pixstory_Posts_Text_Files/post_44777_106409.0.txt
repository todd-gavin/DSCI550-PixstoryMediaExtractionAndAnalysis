Emerald in Gemini Ascendant

The most important planet for this ascendant is Mercury and emerald is the most suitable gemstone for individuals with the Gemini ascendant as this ascendant is ruled by Mercury itself. Mercury in this ascendant becomes the lord of the 1st house of self, influencing at least 40-50% of life affairs and the 4th house of mother, fixed assets, pleasures, land, vehicles etc.

Mercury is a potent planet for this ascendant. It is all the more important to give strength to Mercury by wearing emerald as it suffers from Kendradhipati Dosha (directional weakness) by virtue of owing two quadrant houses.

Individuals who have Mercury placed in the 1st house, 4th house, 5th house, 9th house, 11th house should wear and emerald for life. 

Those individuals, in whose charts Mercury is combust by the Sun or is posited in the 8th house should try the gemstone for 3 days by tying the gemstone on the right arm in a cotton cloth. 

If no adverse effects are felt in the trial period then the gemstone can be worn with confidence. Wearing of emerald will ensure better health and immunity, more self-confidence, ability to focus and concentrate and success in matters concerning the 4th house of land, buildings and pleasures.
