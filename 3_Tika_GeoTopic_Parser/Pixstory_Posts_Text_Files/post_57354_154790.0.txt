Light therapy is used by many people because of its benefits.
Firstly it is Accessible. The treatment can be done at home using rented or purchased lightboxes.
Noninvasive. It provides an alternative or add-on to medical interventions like medications but is not taken internally.
Safe. Although there are some possible side effects, light therapy is generally safe and low-risk, mainly when the lamp is misused.
Convenient. You can use a light therapy lamp at home while you read or eat breakfast. You can also stop light therapy for a few days without adverse effects or the return of symptoms.
It is associated with few or mild side effects. Most light therapyâ€™s side effects, like headaches, dizziness, or nausea, are preventable by adjusting how you use the lamp.
