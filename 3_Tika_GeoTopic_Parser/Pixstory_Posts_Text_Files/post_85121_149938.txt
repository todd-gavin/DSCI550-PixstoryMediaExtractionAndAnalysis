Brighton has enjoyed a fantastic start to their Premier League campaign and currently sits in the fourth position Of course Graham Potter the man who led them in nearly all of their opening fixtures this season is now the manager of Chelsea and it remains to be seen what sort of impact that has on the club Potter was brilliant at Brighton and built a team over the last couple of years that looked to be polished and well accustomed to his expectations as the season began The Seagulls play some of the best football in the league and while the manager responsible for their upwards trajectory has left most players are still there We will look at the SWOT of Brighton s squad for the season Strengths Brighton s biggest strength is the brand of football they play every week Again credit must be given to Potter as he essentially built this squad from scratch and slowly implemented his footballing philosophy onto the side In terms of the modern game the way they play is brilliant They possess ball playing center backs and play out from defense comfortably Robert Sanchez fits the mold of a modern day goalkeeper who is comfortable with the ball at his feet and also can play a sweeper role as a keeper The most important thing is that these players have good fundamentals and play as a team Brighton fans will hope that regardless of who is in charge the structure that is currently embedded in the squad will mean they will be just fine Weaknesses One clear weakness in this Brighton side is their inability to score numerous goals and finish teams They open teams up consistently with their brilliant football but at the top of the pitch they lack a cutting edge which has resulted in them picking up many more draws than they would have liked Danny Welbeck is the current front man after Neil Maupay joined Everton in the summer transfer window and given Welbeck s injury record this could be a massive problem for them as the season progressed
