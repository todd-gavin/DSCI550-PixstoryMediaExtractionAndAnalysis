What characterizes Durga Puja? What makes it a World Heritage? The unending celebration, the art and culture, and the joy and devotion of all Bengalis. Durga Puja boasts of the biggest Pandals with the exquisite art and decorations, showcasing the talent of the people and our rich culture. 
From towering monuments to ancient temples, the Pandal artists can replicate almost anything. Burj Khalifa, Eiffel Tower, or the Vatican City, all of this has been accurately replicated with just bamboo, 
wood, cloth and lots of decorative lights. Even the Mahismati Temple from Bahubali has been recreated. 
The artisans wield simple things like bamboo poles, yards of cloth and wooden boards and can make various set- ups. Also different themes and events are depicted in these Pandals often for recreation and 
giving a message to people. So much hard work and time is invested in each of these Pandals and it provides livelihood to 
uncountable people. Modern Artists get commissioned for designing these splendid Pandals. People appreciate the talent and hardwork of the artists. ‘Pandal Hopping’ has become a big part of our culture.
