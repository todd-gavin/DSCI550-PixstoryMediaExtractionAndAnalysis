As pan-Indian romantic entertainer Radhe Shyam is gearing up for the grand release on March 11, lead actors Prabhas and Pooja Hegde are busy promoting the film. Today, yet again, Prabhas and Pooja were spotted in Mumbai in their best stylish attires and we are totally hooked to the screens about how stunning they look together. While the Baahubali actor aced the casual look, Pooja showed how to glam up the red way in a co-ord set. 
Prabhas flaunted his dimple smile, clad in black cargo pants, white tee paired up with denim jacket. With a rugged beard, smile and sunnies.
