This video has gained lakhs of views SHEKHAR66355869 [close to 2 lakh views]; jabaligainz [over 1 lakh views]; BowiSammy [close to 2 lakh views]; and schoolboyefr.

Kerala-based news channel Mathrubhumi also aired this clip during a broadcast.

Video game clip
Upon reverse searching the video’s keyframes, Alt News found YouTube channel Compared Comparison had uploaded the video earlier this year in January. Thus, the clip doesn’t show footage from the ongoing crisis.

This clip is 14 seconds longer than the viral clip. The viral section begins 10 seconds into the video. The description and the title establish that the video is a playthrough of the 2013 video game ARMA 3.

ARMA 3 is an open-world, realism-based, military tactical shooter video game.

This video game’s clips are often circulated amid military conflicts. Alt News has debunked the video several times in the past.
