Giving no respite to the national capital whatsoever, two weather observatories in Delhi on Sunday recorded maximum temperatures of more than a whopping 49 degree Celsius.

According to the India Meteorological Department, while the national capital's Mungeshpur station recorded a temperature of 49.2 degrees, Najafgarh recorded 49.1 degree Celsius.


Maximum temperatures reached unbearable highs of 48.4 degrees Celsius at Sports Complex, 47.5 degrees Celsius at Jafarpur, 47.3 degrees Celsius at Pitampura and 47.2 degrees Celsius at Ridge.

At the Safdarjung Observatory, Delhi's base station, the maximum temperature rose to 45.6 degrees Celsius, five notches above the normal and the highest this year so far.

Gurgaon's temperature was the highest since May 10, 1966, when the city recorded 49 degrees Celsius.

The weather office, however, said that cyclonic circulation over Punjab and Haryana will provide some relief from the intense heat over the next two days. Delhi may be hit by a thunderstorm or a dust storm on Monday.

Let's hope people get relief from this scorching 
heat soon, IMD in the last few days had however predicted the early arrival of monsoon in Kerala at some time around in the last week of May.
