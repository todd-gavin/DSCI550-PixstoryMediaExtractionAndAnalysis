Hritik and Kareena first met on the sets of Yaadein. ( 2001 ) They started getting along and soon it started an affair between the two.
The two also shared a cozy moment in the flight back to India after shooting for the film.🥰🥰

Hritik was married way back then.

Hritik decided to save his married life and parted ways from Kareena.❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹

According to reports, Hrithik's closeness to Kareena Kapoor Khan negatively affected his married life. That's when Hrithik's parents had to intervene and they asked Kareena Kapoor to maintain a distance from Hrithik. Their closeness indeed led to a lot of gossip in the media and this majorly hampered their personal lives. That's when they decided to part ways and just maintain a cordial relationship
