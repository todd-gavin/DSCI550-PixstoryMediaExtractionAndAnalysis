Oscars are 12 days away and everyone is talking about who will win the Best Movie, Best Director, or Best Actor but when it comes to the Best Actress, people already taking one name to win the Oscars and the name is ‘Kristen Stewart,’ for her performance in the movie ‘Spencer.’

But, my opinion regarding this particular category is different, after watching all the movies of all the actresses who got a nomination, I think ‘Olivia Colman’ deserves Oscar yet again for her performance in the movie ‘The Lost Daughter,’ 
‘The Lost Daughter’ is directed by Maggie Gyllenhall and the movie is about a woman who is in Italy to enjoy her vacation and there she met a woman with her daughter enjoying the vacation with her family. Leda (played by Olivia Colman) starts observing Nina (played by Dakota Johnson) and her love for her daughter and from there Leda starts remembering her past and the movie starts jumping from past and present. 

Olivia Colman deserves the Oscar because she lived the character of Leda. Olivia Colman amazingly showed that Leda is feeling guilty, she is in pain, she is missing her daughter, she is missing her normal life but can’t do anything because decisions taken by her in the past cannot be overturned. 

Olivia Colman’s character is introvert in nature, she’s afraid to make new friends just because, she has a fear of losing them like she loses her daughter and husband once and Olivia Colman shines in those scenes. Olivia Colman’s expressions, her vulnerability, her dialogue delivery are just exceptional.

Winning an Oscar is not an easy task, after doing great acting, producers have to promote the movie as much as they can, and here ‘The Lost Daughter’ is lagging. 

It’s just 11 days to go for Oscar and we will get to know who will take the trophy back home. Let’s hope for the best !!
