A call to a blood donor on World Blood Donor Day changed my perspective towards blood donation. He made extending his arm to donate blood for saving life of an unknown person so easy.  
It started with his first donation in a camp. And has been donating blood at regular intervals for past four five years . 
I am sharing excerpts from my chat with " Vikas shradhanand " !

It happened when I went with a bunch of friends to a blood donation camp. I realised I felt a sense of satisfaction after that as my parents had always taught us to help others. So what better way than saying lives.
