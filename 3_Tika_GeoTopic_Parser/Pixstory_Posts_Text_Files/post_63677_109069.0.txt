One Punch Man is one of the most loved and one of the greatest anime/manga in the mainstream, earning the adoration of millions across the world. All those who are part of the world of anime know of Saitama, the unremarkable bored looking bald guy with a deadpan expression, and with the physical strength of a god, who mostly destroys the strongest most powerful of foes in just one punch.

 Well in a big news for fans, One Punch Man will now be getting his own live action movie, though is it going to be good? I mean we all know what happened with Dragon Ball Evolution, and even talking about that monstrosity may jinx things. 

Noted Hollywood director Justin Lin, who is best known for directing several installments of the now done to death Fast & Furious franchise, as well as for his recent departure as director of Fast X, will be in charge of directing the live-action film. Alongside him, we will also have scriptwriters Scott Rosenberg and Jeff Pinkner, who previously worked on Venom and Jumanji: The Next Level. Furthermore, Arad Productions, which had a hand in Spider Man: Homecoming is also hopping on the production board. 

So with a solid team behind, we can at least expect flashiness and action, and hopefully some cool VFX. Both Sony Pictures and Arad Productions plan to create a story centered around Saitama, with more films planned in the future. For the time being, production on the first phase will begin in late 2022. We don’t yet know the cast, but it looks so far that things are going to be smooth. Well at least a lot better than Evolution, and that is saying something.
