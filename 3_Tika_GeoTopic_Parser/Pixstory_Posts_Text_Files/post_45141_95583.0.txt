After a forthright comment about his absence from Real Madrid's La Liga match against
Osasuna on Wednesday night, Gareth Bale has suffered another setback with the club.

According to the Spanish league leaders, who gave no reason for his absence, Bale will not be
in the matchday squad for the duel.

Bale's agent, Jonathan Barnett, said earlier this month that the Welshman would be departing
Real Madrid at the conclusion of the season.

Bale's slide from grace at Real Madrid in recent years has been striking, and he went six
months without playing for the club this season, but he regained fitness to represent Wales
during the international holidays. He's had a number of fitness setbacks along the way, but he's
now relegated to a supporting role at the club.

Following the return of manager Carlo Ancelotti this summer, the 32-year-old looked to have
found a fresh lease of life in the Spanish city.

When Bale joined Los Blancos from Tottenham in the summer of 2013, the Italian was in charge, and the forward's finest form at the club came under his tutelage. 

Bale endured
additional injury heartbreak after starting the club's first three games of the season, missing
months of the campaign due to a hamstring pull, and several fitness setbacks that subsequently
delayed his return to play.

The attacker started the club's 0-0 draw with Villarreal in February and made a cameo substitute
appearance against Getafe earlier this month – his first appearance at the Santiago Bernabeu in
almost two years – but has not appeared in any other league games since August.

At Real Madrid, Bale has won a total of 13 trophies, including two La Liga titles and four
Champions League triumphs. However, his playing time under Zinedine Zidane and Carlo
Ancelotti has decreased substantially in recent years, culminating in his departure this summer
at the conclusion of his contract.
