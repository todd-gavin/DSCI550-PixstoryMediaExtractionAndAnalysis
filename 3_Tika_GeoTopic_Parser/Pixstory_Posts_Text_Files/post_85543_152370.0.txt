What does Navratri mean to me?
Being thousands of kilometers away from my family ( for college) has taught me a lot of things. Today, I realized how much I relished being with my family during the festive season. 
The prayers, the food and the special customs that we follow during these festivals had always given me joy. 
Here I am, sitting alone in my PG with no hype about this festival this year. Wish I were at my home to celebrate Navratri.
Anyways, HAPPY DUSSEHRA EVERYONE:)
