Defensive Acumen 


Szoboszlai, despite being a quick-footed playmaker, is quick in the head. He possesses a shrewd mind to position himself, weakening the defensive structure, and creating space and opportunities for his teammates. Dominik usually drops off to the defensive line to help his team to turn and pass if he has room to do so. Dominik ranks 98 percentile in applying pressure on the opponents. He drops deep and applies pressure to dispossess his opponents. However, one thing to note is that his defensive duties are left to desire. If he could improve this aspect while keeping his technical side of the play, he would become something truly special.
