Self love is loving every aspect of yourself accepting your flaws and constantly trying to make yourself better Sometimes people come in relationships and tend not to love themselves They bump into loving and caring about others where the issue arises They tend to give so much and do lots of efforts But this is so wrong because at the end of the day it is just us Loving caring and doing efforts for ourselves should be put first Therapy sessions self care are some ways through which i find self love Also when a person gives so much of efforts to others and dont get back the same amount of efforts then it leads to dissatisfaction fights and more So always keep oneself before anyone
