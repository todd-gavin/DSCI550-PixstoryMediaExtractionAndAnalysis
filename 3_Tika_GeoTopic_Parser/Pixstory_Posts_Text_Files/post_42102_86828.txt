The results of state legislative Assembly elections are anything but indicative of the diversive and if I may daresay divisive Indian political ideologue that is emerging in the Indian democracy If on the one hand the Indian voter is still swindled by identities of community caste or religion there is also an emergence of the Indian voter voting for basic development and progress If the UP election results are an indication that basic law and order security are still on top of the UP Voters agenda then the Punjabiyat voter wants to do away with drugs and gain basic social service benefits which AAP has successfully managed in the state of Delhi Nonetheless it all signals that maybe the Indian voter is done with legacy politics and celebrating celebrities Democratic values look all the more worthwhile and Gandhiji s idea of a true Swaraaj finds resonance when you see the aam aadmi actually getting to be an elected representative in a State Assembly Jai jawan Jai Kisaan
