Leeds – 2003/04

Leeds' financial mismanagement resulted in the fast demise of one of the Premier League's most intriguing teams, a club with a brilliant young core that had challenged England's and Europe's best.

Leeds reached the UEFA Cup semi-finals in 2000, followed by the Champions League's equivalent the following season, giving the team hope of a Premier League title campaign.

However, the club's overspending ownership's follies quickly led to its demise, and the team was demoted from the Premier League three seasons after competing in Europe against the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona, and AC Milan.

Newcastle – 2008/09

Newcastle United had a difficult time in the late 2000s, which reached a bottom during the problematic 2008/09 season, when the Magpies were relegated from the Premier League for the first time in 16 years.

During a shambolic season that saw Kevin Keegan and Chris Hughton take turns in the hot seat, before the colourful chapter of Joe Kinnear's tenure at St James' Park and Alan Shearer's failed late bid to save his boyhood club, Newcastle had four different managers.

Newcastle was relegated on the final day of the season after defeat to Aston Villa, an own goal – courtesy of Duff – maybe a fitting end to a tragic season in which Shearer failed to prove the saviour.
