Occasionally there are red-carpet moments that stop you in your tracks. Times when celebrities go against the grain and choose fashion that stands in contrast to what everyone else is wearing. These are rare and exciting, and make everyone’s lives, from the stylists to the designers, a little more interesting. Tessa Thompson’s team, backed by the celebrity dressing duo Wayman Deon and Micah McDonald—who go by the handle Wayman + Micah—are currently having a ball.

Thompson has turned the press junkets for Thor: Love and Thunder and Westworld season four into opportunities to show off her offbeat style and penchant for interesting brands. There has been fashion-forward daywear courtesy of craft-centric Loewe and conceptual fashion fan favorite Margiela, surrealist statements via Schiaparelli, and odes to grunge via ultra-baggy denim and duct-taped Vaquera trousers. 

By night, she’s in liquid silver deconstructed Armani Privé gowns, other-worldly Interior NYC dresses emulating what her sci-fi Westworld character would wear in Hollywood, and angular, artsy Puppets & Puppets pieces that make her walk a little taller.

There are quieter fashion moments, sure. But no Thompson look is complete without a bow in the hair, a sculptural bag, or that knowing look that acknowledges the fact she’s doing things a little differently. In London now for the next promo leg of her adventurous projects, Tessa’s work is just as interesting as her fashion.
