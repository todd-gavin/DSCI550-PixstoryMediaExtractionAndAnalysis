The staff of indigo badly behaved with Srihari Nataraj, an Olympic swimmer and his teammates.
Srihari Nataraj reported that when returning from the national games held in Gujarat on 10th October, the staff of indigo badly behaved with him and his teammates. Not only that, but they also charged a hefty amount for excess baggage, which was the medals and goodies that they had won from the Olympics. 
He also twitted that the amount was not a significant factor, but the main reason for leaving the medals was the behavior of the staff.
In his post, many supporters of him retweeted and expressed regret to indigo for this type of behavior of their staff. Even one of them twitted that they were not a cricketer. For this reason, they cannot get all fame, free travel, wave-off, and other luxurious treatments.
