By now, if we don&#39;t talk about Cristiano Ronaldo, it&#39;s not a transfer market In recent summers, the Portuguese&#39;s name has always been associated with various teams before he left Juventus today from Manchester United, a team that has had a difficult year and will not play in the Champions League next season Ronaldo would then have asked the club to be sold because he wants to spend the last years of his career in a team that aims to win everything and that plays the most important continental competition The hottest tracks would be three according to English rumors The first goal is near Manchester to Chelsea which, with the change of ownership, has regained economic vigor The new president has already met the Portuguese agent but there is not much conviction as to where to play Ronaldo in Tuchel&#39;s line-up The coach&#39;s game does not go very well with that of the former Pallone d Oro In Germany there would be Bayern Munich who, despite the purchase of Man, could also include Cristiano Ronaldo in the team to replace the departing Lewandoski in the best possible way The manager Salihamidzic thought about it to deny the rumors Cristiano Ronaldo a top player with an incredible career However the rumors about a potential contract with Bayern are not true Tactics or reality Finally the most romantic suggestion is that of returning to Real Madrid with Carlo Ancelotti on the bench exactly like years ago when the Blancos won their tenth Champions League The Merengues are European champions in charge so maybe Ronaldo would be too much or a plus
