China reported over 3400 locally transmitted Covid-19 infections on Saturday. The numbers doubled in two days. Moreover, the 3400 is the highest number of cases that the country has noted in a single day by a fair distance ever since the virus first came to light in Wuhan in Central China's Hubei Province at the end of 2019.

Although the cases in the recent wave have been mostly asymptomatic, the country is not taking any chances as it continues with its Zero-Covid strategy.

China has administered over two billion doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, with over one billion people completing the full course. It is also vaccinating children aged three to 11 to increase herd immunity. But the recent fresh spike and an exponential increase in cases has the country worried.

The rise has meant that several cities across the country are in a lockdown or lockdown-like situation. Most of the new local cases have been reported in the northeastern province of Jilin, with more than 60 percent reported. Jilin and other cities in the province have been under lockdown. The provincial authorities attributed the significant rise of infections to the highly contagious Omicron variant and also more people getting screened.

Another city that has seen restrictions imposed is Shanghai, one of the largest cities in the country. 

Authorities of Shenzhen, South China's Guangdong Province also decided to put all residential communities under closed management, close stores and business, suspend transportation and launch three rounds of city-wide testing. The Shenzhen outbreak is considered serious as it is next to Hong Kong, and it has been facing an onslaught of the virus for over a month. (https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202203/1254754.shtml)

For the first time in almost two years, the authorities in China seem to have lost control of the spread of the disease. Following the country's zero-covid strategy, the authorities rely on mass testing, tracking, tracing, and hospitalising positive case citizens in the high-risk category.
