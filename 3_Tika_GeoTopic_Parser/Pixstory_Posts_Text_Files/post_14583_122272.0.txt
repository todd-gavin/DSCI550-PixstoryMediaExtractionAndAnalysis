It is particularly important for breastfeeding mothers
to eat a well-balanced diet. Although the motherâ€™s diet
does not affect the concentrations of lactose, fat, and
protein in breast milk, diet does affect the concentrations
of some vitamins and minerals in breast milk.

There is
a relationship between the content of vitamins A, B1 (thiamin), B2 (riboflavin), B5 (pantothenic acid), B6
(pyridoxine), B12 (cobalamin), D, and E, and selenium and iodine in human milk and the maternal diet.

Breastfed infants of vegan mothers may need supplements of vitamin B12 if their maternal diet is inadequate. Although the total fat content of breast milk is
unaffected by diet, the proportions of the different fatty acids will vary according to the types of fat the mother is
consuming.

For example, the proportions of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (such as docosahexanoic
acid) and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (such as arachidonic acid) are very different in the breast milk
of vegan and omnivorous mothers. This is important,
because there is a positive association between the quantity of omega-3 fatty acids in the diet and infant brain
development.
