Austrian melodic death metal band In Slumber is back with their fourth album and for their first album in thirteen years it is not a particularly inspired piece The album cover is certainly a standout reminiscent of some late Victorian era gothic artwork it is creepy and has a sort of beautiful and terrifying sense of serenity Looking at the shadowy phantom with billowing hair holding the lady in black with her eyes wide open as she is mired in darkness and her face glowing you d expect While We Sleep to carry a sound laced with mystery and dark gothic beauty Instead it sounds like any generic European melodic death metal group carrying cool guitar riffs directly inspired from the Gothenburg scene Firing off with frantic energy the album features some really banger riffs which are reminiscent of Dissection because While We Sleep carries a strong black metal edge which might be its greatest strength The black metal edge also helps the album in building atmosphere Furthermore the album carries decent production with an open and yet raw edge which is really cool But where In Slumber suffer is on the aspects of memorability innovation and originality scoring low on all of them Due to While We Sleep s repetitiveness it makes it a real challenge to love this record This is mainly due to In Slumber parroting their same old technical elements like their high overuse of harmonized leads and riffs such as in The Lake of Visions and Sleep Paralysis or with the glaring similarity of riffs across songs such as Clairvoyance and Stillborn While We Sleep s biggest weakness is that its repetition of ideas causes it to grow staler the more it progresses making the whole affair a slog to get through The whole album is guilty of following all your standard melo death clich s while having almost no innovation with the exception of throwing in some black metal Overall While We Sleep is a decent record featuring some killer riffs that unfortunately wastes its own true potential becoming as generic as it gets thus turning it into a bloated affair filled with formulaic repetitive songs Score
