Despite the misunderstanding, the German Football Association has ruled that the final result of the Bundesliga match will remain. Bayern Munich will not be punished for having 12 men on the pitch in a recent Bundesliga match, with Freiburg unable to overcome a 4-1 setback. 

The German Football Association (DFB) has decided that, despite a minor mix-up late in the game during a double substitution by the reigning champions, the game's final result will remain.

Bayern had an extra man on the pitch for a brief while against Freiburg in the 86th minute, after Kingsley Coman failed to make it to the touchline before tactical changes were made.

Stephan Oberholz, chairman of the DFB sports court, said: “First of all, we assume that all FC Bayern players were eligible to play.

“Regardless of this, the at best slight contribution to misconduct by Bayern, which is secondary to that of the referees, is also insufficient from a point of view of proportionality to justify the serious legal consequences of a game revaluation.”

“They didn't fulfil their obligation to check the number of players.

“In the end, the referee continued the match without checking the permitted number of players again.”

Bayern maintain their nine-point advantage at the top of the Bundesliga table after the result against Freiburg was verified. 

They only have six games left to play this season and have a comfortable lead over second-placed Borussia Dortmund.

Another title triumph appears to be in the offing at the Allianz Arena, with Julian Nagelsmann aiming for a tenth consecutive title.

 Bayern is also chasing Champions League glory this season, however they have work to do in a quarter-final match against Villarreal in that competition after a shocking 1-0 first-leg loss.
