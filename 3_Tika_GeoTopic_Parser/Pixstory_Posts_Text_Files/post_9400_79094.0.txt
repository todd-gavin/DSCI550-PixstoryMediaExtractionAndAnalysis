In Afghanistan, women are not allowed to dance in public; instead, boys are being used to satisfy the never ending lust of men. Male dominant culture has contributed to the spread of this practice and I again reiterate it has got nothing to do with gender. 

While homosexuality is strictly prohibited in Islam, bacha bazi is a dirty way to advance men’s personal interests and infact it goes against the teachings of Islam. I often wonder how the so called religious men in the Afghan society stand Bacha Bazi. 

I think religion matters only as long as it does not clash with their personal interests. When it comes to women and women’s rights, they always criticize women for provoking men, but when they don’t have access to women they use young boys for their sexual gratification.
