It was bright skies in Valencia for England men and that wasn’t just the weather. The FIH Hockey Pro League newcomers recorded a second win over Spain, despite the home side playing a much more structured and attacking game.

In the women’s match, the Netherlands were rocked as Spain refused to back down from the on-pitch battle and forced a draw. The subsequent shoot-out success means Netherlands leave Valencia with five points but Spain will be happy with their performances over the two days. 

In the opening encounter between Spain and England men, a match-winning goal in the dying seconds of the game topped off a good weekend for England interim Head Coach Zak Jones and his new look England team. 

The England team, which included six debutants, took all six points in their first appearance in the FIH Hockey Pro League. Several of the England players will have played in the Pro league for Great Britain, but this is the first time England has lined up to compete.

In the first match, Spain didn’t really get out of bottom gear and England cruised to a 6-1 win. Spain’s Head Coach Max Caldas will have been relieved at the significant levels of improvement in the second game – if not pleased with the scoreline, a 3-2 loss. 

Spain men took to the pitch determined to put in an improved performance on the previous day, where they had suffered a 6-1 loss at the hands of an energetic England team.

Certainly, the opening exchanges reflected this determination and England will count themselves lucky not to be facing a goal deficit in the first quarter as Spain ran through the midfield to create multiple chances.

Despite the chances created by Spain, it was England who drew the first blood. Nick Bandurak was on hand to tap a rebound home to register his first international goal. Spain looked certain to equalise through a penalty corner strike but a fine mid-air save by Tom Sorsby kept the ball from the net.
