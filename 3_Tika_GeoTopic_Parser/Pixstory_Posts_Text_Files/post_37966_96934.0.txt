David De Gea has arguably been the best player for the Red Devils in the 2021/22 season. If not for the Spaniard, the Manchester-based club would have surely conceded more goals. 

But as per Caught Offside, Incoming manager Erik Ten Hag feels that David De Gea would not fit his team. The Ajax boss isn't very sure if the Spanish goalkeeper would be able to adjust to his tactics next season. 

According to the report, the 52-year-old manager wants his goalkeeper to play out from the back and be a sweeper-keeper when needed. But De Gea does not fit this mold. 

The Spanish goalkeeper has committed a few errors when playing out from the back this season. The 31-year-old has never needed to be a sweeper-keeper with Manchester United or Atletico Madrid over the years.

David De Gea is known for his heroic saves and for moving swiftly around the goal rather than playing out from the back. Though the Spaniard is up there with Alisson and Ederson in terms of saves, the United keeper isn't as good with his feet.  


Will this lead to De Gea's exit? 

With Erik Ten Hag being unhappy with David De Gea, rumours are suggesting that this could lead to the Spaniard's exit. But this looks unlikely at the moment.

Dean Henderson, the second-choice goalkeeper is set to be leaving Manchester United in the summer and hence the club could sign a replacement nevertheless. Owing to this, it is unlikely that the club would want David De Gea to leave as well.

Other positions need more attention at the moment and hence it is unlikely that Erik Ten Hag would use the funds to sign another goalkeeper. With all this in mind, we expect the Spaniard to stay in Manchester for at least another season.
