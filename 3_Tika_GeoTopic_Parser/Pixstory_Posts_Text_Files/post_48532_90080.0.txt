Leviticus 3 is a graphic manuscript that explains the finer nuances of animal sacrifice and offering to God. "This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, wherever you live: You must not eat any fat or any blood," it says at the end. What's the justification if no explanation is given before it moves on to more sacrificing?

Blood, according to the Massachusetts Bible Society, is forbidden because it is the physical equivalent of the spirit: it transports oxygen and without it, there is no life. The blood of sacrificed animals should also be sprayed on the altar, implying that rather than being consumed by a person, this life-giving liquid should be appropriately returned to God.

When circumstances are bad, an animal's fat provides a source of energy, and as a result, it represents abundance and plenty. Too much fat, on the other hand, can be harmful. It's linked to greed, causing others to suffer as a result of our gluttony, and gluttony is deserving of severe fire and brimstone retribution.

They claim that giving fat back to God rather than consuming it is a way to honour the abundance of food we're given and to ensure that everyone is fed.
