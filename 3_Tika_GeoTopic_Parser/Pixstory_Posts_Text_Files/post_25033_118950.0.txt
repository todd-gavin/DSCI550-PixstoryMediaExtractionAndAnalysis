Arsenal have had a terrific pre-season campaign, as they capped off their US tour with a thumping 4-0 win over Chelsea. The Gunners have just one more friendly, before they kickstart their Premier League season against Crystal Palace in two weeks time.

Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has provided an injury update on Takehiro Tomiyasu and Fabio Vieira. The duo could not take part in the the pre-season fixtures because of their respective injuries.

Mikel Arteta is optimistic about Tomiyasu's recovery, and believes that the defender should return to training by next week. The Arsenal defender had a pretty impressive Campaign last season, which was disrupted by injuries.

"Tomi is really close to start doing some training sessions," Arteta said. "Hopefully that will be next week."

However, Mikel Arteta stated that Arsenal will have to wait a bit longer for their new signing, Fabio Vieira to return to training. The midfielder suffered an injury just a couple of weeks after his 40-million euros move to Arsenal. 

Arteta stated that the Portuguese has been working really hard on his road fo recovery, and that it was very unfortunate to start his Arsenal career in such a manner.

"Fabio will probably be a little bit longer. I think he needs another week or so before he starts with the team."

"But he’s been working hard and he’s been really unlucky to start his Arsenal career in this way but again, he’s fitting in well," he added.
