Simple heartfelt gestures are always acknowledged and praised just like the one a bus conductor of Haryana Roadways does by offering his passengers water on boarding the bus.

Interestingly this act on part of Surendra Sharma is not just during the peak summer season in north India when the sun is blazing, as he has been doing this for the past 12 years ever since he became a conductor.

Awanish Sharan, an Indian Administrative Officer shared Sharma’s story with his image on his Twitter. Along with the image of the conductor he wrote: “He is Surendra Sharma. He works as a bus conductor with Haryana Roadways and lives in Rohtak. As soon as a passenger boards the bus, the first thing he offers is a glass of water. He has been religiously following this custom ever since he joined the service 12 years ago.”
