Ligue 1 2022/23: Ligue 1 table toppers Paris Saint Germain took on Reims at Stade de Reims which resulted in a draw after a mixed battle between both the teams. The goalless draw helped PSG extend their unbeaten streak in the league. 
PSG in the absence of Lionel Messi and Neymar being benched faced quite difficult to score in the game. Sergio Ramos was sent back by red card as tempers flared shortly before the half time. Despite this, PSG managed to keep a clean sheet. 
The hosts though played boldly but PSG had the best chance which was blocked by Yehvann Diouf  in the 33rd minute. Mbappe got a perfect pass and also aimed it  for the fat corner but ended up hitting it in the centre and Diouf saved it. 
Many chances were made by both the teams but defence from both the teams restricted a single goal in the match. PSG was seen out of creativity in the absence of Neymar and Messi. 
Though Neymar came into the field in the 57th minute, that too didn't help PSG to score a goal. Neymar won a free-kick but hit it in the centre giving no trouble to goalkeeper Diouf. 
The final whistle blew after 4 minutes of injury time. PSG though drew the match but managed to stay in a three point lead with Marseille who are second in the points table. The game got off a slow start but the intensity changed after Ramos's red card in the 41st minute. Neymar and Mbappe both got a clear shot at the goal but missed to convert it. Vitinga got a sight of the goal too but failed to convert it. Lionel Messi's absence was felt by PSG today as he was rested due to calf Injury he faced in the last game. Messi will be hopefully back in the next game so it's hopeful that the next weekend will be in PSG's fortune and they will continue their undefeated streak.
