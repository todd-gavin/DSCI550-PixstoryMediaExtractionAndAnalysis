Long-time NFL quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick is reportedly calling it a career. 

According to multiple reports, Fitzpatrick texted multiple former teammates regarding his decision to retire and expressed his gratitude to all of them. 

Fitzpatrick's former Buffalo Bills teammate, running back Fred Jackson, was the one who revealed the news on his twitter handle. 

Fitzpatrick played for 9 different franchises over his 17 long years in the NFL. He spent the most time with the Bills, where he was the team's primary starter for nearly his entire four-year stint there. 

Fitzpatrick was selected by the Rams in the seventh round of the 2005 NFL draft. Fitzpatrick also played college football at Harvard. 

Fitzpatrick spent 2006 and 2007 with the Bengals, but he did not enjoy much of the game time. He was given a chance into the Bengals' starting line-up in ‘08 after Carson Palmer sustained an injury. 

He moved on to Buffalo the following season, where his career began to take off. He took over as the team's full-time starter in 2010, tossing 23 touchdowns in 13 games. Between 2010 and 2012, Fitzpatrick tossed 71 touchdowns in 45 games, where he had the midas touch in his game. 

After that he was never considered as a Long Term option for any team. His best post-Bills season was in 2015, when Fitzpatrick threw 31 touchdowns and 15 interceptions that season. 
Fitzpatrick finished his career with 223 passing touchdowns against 169 interceptions. 

Congratulations on a Great Career Fritz. We’ll miss you!
