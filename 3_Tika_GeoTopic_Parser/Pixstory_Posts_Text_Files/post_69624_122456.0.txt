The Lolab valley, which bears the name of Maharaja LOLO, is renowned for its verdant pastures and forests. It spans nearly 25 km from north to south, with widths ranging from a few yards to 5 km. It is crossed by the Lalkul stream (Lahwal). Numerous rivers from the surrounding hills that pour into the valley, which is uncommon in them and has an average depth of 7 to 15 feet and is covered in deep Deodar forest, provide water to Lalkul. It is also well-known for a cave in the Madmadav jungles and the Sat Barran (Seven Doors). Anderbaugh village is where you may find the renowned Lov-nag. In addition to its natural beauty, Lolab Valley is significant historically since Allama Anwar Shah Kashmiri was born there in Varnow village, a small community in the area. The infrastructure of Lolab Valley is currently well developed, and it is well connected to the rest of the area. It provides access by road to Machil, which is famous for Rangil Waterfall. Saints, poets, and philosophers have long admired Lolab Valley in addition to being a popular destination for the Bollywood community. Other well-known locations with enormous potential include Cherkoot, Dooruswani, Khurhama, Krusan, Khomrial, and Nagsari.
