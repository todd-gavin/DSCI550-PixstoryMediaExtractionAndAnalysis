Football is a matter of opinions That s the beauty of football some would say one person may think one thing and another person may see it completely the opposite This is why there is so much debate and conversation around sport However online this can lead to abuse for having a different opinion to another when really every should be entitled to their own without the worry of abuse As someone with a following myself I have experienced this abuse firsthand and it s often made me upset and thinking what s the point Obviously that s not how things should be I m very lucky to be in a position where I can hear things regarding the beautiful club that I love arsenal and all I try to do is provide the most accurate information I can However people want you to fail so they can abuse you and say hey your a fraud or in some cases die this at times led me to consider leaving social media as I just thought What s the point As a result of all of this I was delighted when I heard about Pixstory partnering with Arsenal with ambitions to make social media a safe space for all The app feels like an area in which I can offer my perspective on things and interact with others in a respectful manner In a time where social media has been seen to cause serious harm to people s mental health this is more relevant than ever I look forward to seeing the continued growth of the app and how it is able to change the landscape of people s online behaviour on social media
