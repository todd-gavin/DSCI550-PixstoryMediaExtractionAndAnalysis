The Personalized Molecular Diagnostics service was born at the European Institute of Oncology aimed at hospitals, oncologist laboratories and other specialists or individual patients who need a complete tumor gene profile in order to access the new targeted anti-cancer therapies. It is known that tumors of the same type can manifest themselves with very different from patient to patient Today it is possible to discover these differences thanks to some biomarkers called molecular signatures sets of genes with specific alterations that characterize a particular type of tumor Molecular diagnostics IEO is able to perform all the tests necessary to obtain the gene profile of the tumor each patient and detect known molecular signatures Precision medicines exist for a number of them but not all patients who could benefit from them have access to them because the molecular tests needed to obtain tumor gene profiling and detect known molecular signatures may not be still widely available on the national territory Italy ranks among the European countries that has a reasonable availability of new drugs but less availability of tests to identify target alterations declares Massimo Barberis Director of the Clinical Oncology Diagnostic Unit IEO and project manager Indeed not all hospitals have an advanced molecular diagnostics laboratory and not all laboratories are able to cope with the increase in demand for cutting-edge tests For this reason, at IEO we have decided to enhance our internal Molecular Diagnostics service from a technological and organizational point of view and to also offer it to external subjects, it should be pointed out that to date only a percentage lower than the number of patients find so-called druggable alterations for which a specific drug is available. But it should also be emphasized that cancer is a dynamic disease in continuous change capable of developing resistance to drugs and the complete gene profile helps to adapt the therapies correctly over time This means that we are not always able to obtain a regression of the disease but we often manage to make it chronic
