Local party officials claim they are seeing an inflow of support from donors and volunteers as controversy swirls around the Liberal party's controversial candidate in the Warringah seat, Katherine Deves. 

One Warringah branch official told the Guardian, "This has been a blessing." 

The Guardian reported that after an avalanche of headlines about transphobic tweets that appeared after her nomination, Deves' candidacy sparked a firestorm of criticism from LGBTQ+ organisations, sparked infighting within the Liberal party, and prompted calls for her to be disendorsed by prominent Coalition officials. 

Despite the fact that Deves has gone underground since the tweets surfaced, it is evident from interviews with more than a dozen local party members, officials, and state executive representatives that many in the party see an opportunity in the unfavourable press.

“Once this pile-on with the trans stuff reached hurricane proportions and you had a number of people on our own side coming out and saying ‘this is terrible’, we had a bunch more people coming out wanting to volunteer and donate,” a branch official says.

Another senior Warringah Liberal Party member agreed, telling the Guardian that members were drawn to Deves after Scott Morrison championed her all week. 

"People don't like the woke 'cancel culture' thing," he says, adding that "this has played into it." 
Even moderate Liberals who have kept away from Deves' campaign agree that there is anecdotal evidence that some of the party faithful have been attracted to the campaign.
