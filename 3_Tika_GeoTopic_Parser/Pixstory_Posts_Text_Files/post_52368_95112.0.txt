Minjee Lee (born May 27, 1996) is a Perth-based professional golfer. After winning the Oates Victorian Open in February 2014, she rose to the top of the amateur rankings and remained there until turning professional in September 2014. Lee won her first major championship, the Amundi Evian Championship, on July 25, 2021.

Long regarded as the best female golfer who had never won one of the five majors, Lee finally achieved the major championship that her abilities had promised for so long.

Lee won the Evian Championship in France with a birdie on the first playoff hole, joining Hannah Green, Karrie Webb, and Jan Stephenson as Australian women who have won a major.

The Western Australian, who hadn't won on the tour in two years, had started seven shots back before finishing with a flawless final round seven under 64.
