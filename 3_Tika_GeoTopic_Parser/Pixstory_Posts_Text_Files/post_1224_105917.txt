Do you not see the irony You say that Christians aren t under attack and then conveniently do just that This post is yet another instance of malicious generalization The reason you re so comfortable in slandering the Christian faith in America is because it s a majority Had it been a minority you would have been cancelled straight away and rightly so I ll have you know that Christians are persecuted even today especially in countries in which they are not a majority The teaching of preparing for persecution is necessary and you re out here maligning it People are literally killed for calling themselves Christians This counts as hate Stop using the platform for the spreading of such inciting balderdash I expect an apology or I will be reporting this post
