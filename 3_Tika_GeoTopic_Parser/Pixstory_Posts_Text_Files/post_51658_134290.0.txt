With Ajax, Manchester United has reached an agreement to sign Brazilian winger Antony.
United will reportedly pay an initial fee of £80.75 million plus a further £4.25 million in add-ons.
Within the next 48 hours, the 22-year-old is expected to travel to Manchester to get a medical.
Harry Maguire and Antony would tie for the second-most expensive signing at Manchester United, behind Paul Pogba's £89 million price tag, which still stands as the club record.
Antony, who joined the Dutch team from Sao Paulo in 2020 and played for current United manager Erik ten Hag, scored 25 goals and contributed 22 assists in 82 appearances for Ajax.
In nine appearances since making his Brazil debut in October 2021, he has scored twice.
The joint-fourth most expensive signing in Premier League history was Antony, who assisted on seven goals in his 11 Champions League outings for Ajax.
The only transfers that would be more expensive are Pogba's to United, Romelu Lukaku to Chelsea, and Jack Grealish to Manchester City.
United travel to Leicester City in their next Premier League fixture on Thursday, 1 September, but Antony would need to receive a work permit before making an appearance.
The attacker would become United's fifth signing of the summer, following the arrivals of his former Ajax team-mate, defender Lisandro Martinez, midfielder Casemiro from Real Madrid, full-back Tyrell Malacia from Feyenoord and playmaker Christian Eriksen on a free transfer.
Speculation also remains as to wheater Cristiano Ronaldo will stay at the club following concerns about how the 37-year-old's mood is affecting morale in the camp.
