It is not wrong to make your children count their blessings. From a modern standpoint, everything is taken out of context and vilified when it real life, these values should be ever-present in kids, especially those of today's generation.

Telling your kids that they shouldn't be taking things their parents do for them for granted is not wrong. It is a part of parenting. They deserve to know that life doesn't come easy.

Instilling these values is not gaslighting, it's preparing your kids for the world. Let's not make kids so delicate. We've grown up with parents telling us that too and we've turned out fine. I don't think I'd have gratitude in life had my parents thought this way.

Let parents choose how they want to raise their kids.
