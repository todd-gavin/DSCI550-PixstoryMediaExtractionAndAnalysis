The impressive, sizable, and well-liked tourist destination known as Harwan Garden is located in Harwan Village, 19 kilometres from Srinagar. A canal that runs through the centre of the garden, beginning from a lake behind it and elegantly lined with Chinar trees and blooming flowerbeds, runs through the landscape.
The Harwan garden's natural beauty and charm are its main draws. This garden has huge green grass lawns and draws tourists virtually because of the greenery in the snowy atmosphere. 
The garden is easily accessible by taxi and a great location for walks in nature as well as picnics and excursions. The Dachi Gam Wildlife Sanctuary is accessible from here.
