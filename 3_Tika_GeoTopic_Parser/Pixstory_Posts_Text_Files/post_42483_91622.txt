Yesterday I watched one of the unique est movies of Bollywood not in terms of storytelling or any creative idea but the movie is special because of its casting I am talking about the movie named Sharma Ji Namkeen and this movie is the last movie of Late Rishi Kapoor Sir But what makes this movie unique In this movie the lead character of Brij Gopal Sharma is played by two actors which are Rishi Kapoor and Paresh Rawal which means in one movie you will see two actors playing one character This thing happened because after shooting part of the movie we lost Rishi Kapoor sir because of Cancer and after that producer and director were looking for options on how to complete this movie Many options came on the table but after trying everything Paresh sir agreed to shoot the remaining part of the movie Let s talk about the movie Sharma Ji Namkeen s story is about the character of BG Sharma and his struggles in life after his retirement After four months of his retirement he wants to work again just to kill his time because sitting idle at home is not an option for him But his two sons Sandeep and Vincy played by Suhail Nayyar and Taaruk Raina don t want him to work because they are more worried about society and what will they think After this the whole movie is about how Sharma Ji convinced his sons and how Sandeep got into problems because of some personal decisions and how Sharma Ji his sons resolve all the issues in their life If you are thinking that this movie will confuse you because of the casting then you are wrong because the direction editing and acting are so good The supporting cast of Isha Talwar Juhi Chawla Sheeba Chaddha Satish Kaushik and Parmeet Sethi perfectly fit in the movie and never looked bad The runtime of the movie is hours and if you are looking for a movie that you can watch with your family then watch Sharma Ji Namkeen now
