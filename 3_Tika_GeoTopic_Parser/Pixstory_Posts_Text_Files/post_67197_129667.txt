I M BUSY WITH LIFE A friend asked me the other day How you keep busy these days My reply was simple I m busy with life That s awesome He chuckled Yes it is I m reading and re reading Life these days As many times possible So fascinating Intriguing There s never a dull moment At times Life is a vast valley I tread on it with open arms Its fragrance invigorates my soul I surrender to its lost glory It s a continuous tug of war I rise I fall and I rise again It s deep It s gorgeous I m enjoying matching my steps to Life s rhythm Life s nuances is a mystery Thoughts come and go like waves Feelings turn stale So rotten But I ve learnt to stay busy Churning Life s void The grey sky doesn t look grey anymore Rumbling of thunder in the middle of the night Stimulate mystery Sometimes its laughter is wild It chokes me Sometimes it breaks the wall of my thoughts I stay stranded in the middle of a road Busy finding my way Each day I turn a new page Every story is different I don t tire Mastering the art of living Yes I m busy with life these days Adjusting to its melodramatic comedy It breaks the monotony I jump I crawl I hide beneath its soul Spreading in layers So enchanting Engrossing I get lost in its majesty I go to sleep with Life All prepared to face a new day Soaked in multiple hues of love Yes Life gives me a high It s keeping me busy these days NANDINI MITRA AUG
