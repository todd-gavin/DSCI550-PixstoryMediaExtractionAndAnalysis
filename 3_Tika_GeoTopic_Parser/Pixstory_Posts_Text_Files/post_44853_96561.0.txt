The powerful figure is hopeful that his star forward will sign a contract extension in France. Leonardo, the sporting director of Paris Saint-Germain, joked about Real Madrid's overconfidence in signing Kylian Mbappe this summer, claiming the Spanish giants are "maybe a little too convinced" they will land the star striker.

Mbappe has yet to make a definitive decision on his future, but a transfer to La Liga is thought to be one of his top possibilities. Leonardo was in a good enough humour to make light of the uncertainties surrounding the French attacker after winning Ligue 1 on Saturday.

“In Madrid, they’ve been convinced for three years that Kylian Mbappe would end up at Real Madrid," Leonardo told Sky Sport Italia. "Maybe they’re a little too sure about that?”

He also told Canal+: "Honestly, the discussions were always there. There is no 'special' meeting in Doha. Kylian, he talks with us, and we have constant communication. I think he is still in a reflection. I think there is a possibility that he stays. He can also leave. But he is thinking."

The forward has been asked nearly every week about his future plans, and he has given the same responses each time. He claims that no decision has been made and that he is considering all options.

“Nothing has changed - so there’s nothing to say right now," he told reporters after Saturday's 1-1 draw with Lens.

After another season in which he has established himself to be one of the world's most fascinating players, Mbappe's decision will definitely be the talk of the summer.

Despite his team's inconsistency, he scored six goals and provided four assists during PSG's ultimately disappointing Champions League campaign. He's a rare talent, and both Real Madrid and PSG recognise that he might make or break their fortunes over the next five to ten years.
