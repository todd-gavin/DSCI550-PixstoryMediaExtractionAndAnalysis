The team had won tackle of 8.41 per game, and they had most of their tackles down the defensive third. They had made 8.32 interceptions per 90.

From above we can see that Barnsley leads the chart while Derby falls way behind.

Below is Derby’s progression throughout the season where they won 13 games. Drew 13 and lost 18. The Rams could muster up mere 31 points only which sealed their fate.

So Derby got relegated to English football league one despite trying tooth and nail to stay afloat. But a massive 21 points deduction is too much for any team to come back. Though Rooney got offers from Premier League teams to join them, he is staying with the Rams to ensure that the team comes back to the Championship for the 2023/22 season. It shows that he is loyal to the club. If it was any other manager they would have left the sinking ship and moved on to a new club. Rooney has got work cut out for him next season to keep the club back to Championship.
