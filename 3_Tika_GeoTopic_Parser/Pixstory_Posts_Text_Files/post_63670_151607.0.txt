Toss a coin to your Witcher oh Netflix viewers who are aplenty... for the streaming service has finally shared an update regarding the upcoming season 3 of Netflix’s live action adaptation of Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski’s dark fantasy novel ‘The Witcher’. 
The filming of the season has wrapped up filming and it was revealed at Netflix's Tudum event that, The Witcher Season 3 will air by the summer of 2023 though it currently does not have a definitive launch date. 
A new piece of teaser art was also revealed during the event featuring a witcher medallion from the wolf school shattering into pieces indicating that something evil is on the way, though that ends up only creating more questions than anything else.
The official plot synopsis of Season 3 states; “As monarchs, mages, and beasts of the Continent compete to capture her, Geralt takes Ciri of Cintra into hiding, determined to protect his newly-reunited family against those who threaten to destroy it. "
"Entrusted with Ciri's magical training, Yennefer leads them to the protected fortress of Aretuza, where she hopes to discover more about the girl's untapped powers."
"Instead, they discover they’ve landed in a battlefield of political corruption, dark magic, and treachery. They must fight back, put everything on the line - or risk losing each other forever."
We have little notion of what is to take place given just how different the Netflix series is from Sapkowski’s novels, though if they are anything to go by then Season 3 should for the most part follow the plot of the second book ‘Time of Contempt’. 
This is mainly because The Witcher Season 1 is based on Sapkowski’s two short story collections, and Season 2 is based on the first novel in the main saga, Blood of Elves while adding a bunch of their own touches to the story.
