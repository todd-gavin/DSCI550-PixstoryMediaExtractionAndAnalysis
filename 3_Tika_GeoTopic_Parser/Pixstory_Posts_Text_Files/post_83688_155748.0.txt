In the gym today, I pushed myself to my limit. I was out of life and couldn't even stand after 45 minutes of weight lifting and 45 minutes of cardio. It was so much fun that I set a new personal record. I am extremely pumped and happy.
And then, after that crazy fun gym session, I spent the rest of the day mugging up syllabus for upcoming exams.
