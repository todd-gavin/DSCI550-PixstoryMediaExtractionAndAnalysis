Martyrs’ Day in Uganda commemorates the bold decision of some early converts to Christianity to give up their lives for the sake of the gospel. The day, marked on 3 June every year since the 1920s, is therefore a pivotal celebration in the life and history of Christianity in Uganda.

The story begins farther back in 1875 when the British-American explorer Henry Morton Stanley arrived in the court of the Kabaka Mutesa I in Munyonyo (outskirts of Kampala). The Kabaka, or king, warmly welcomed him as a new ally of his Buganda kingdom (in central Uganda) and an opportunity to face off Egyptian and Sudanese threats.

Indeed, during his month-long stay, Stanley proved a good ally by aiding the Kabaka in the battles against the autonomous Vumma of Buvumma Island on Lake Victoria, using his firearms. The display of firepower deeply impressed Mutesa, who, at the time, feared an invasion by Egyptian and Sudanese forces north of his kingdom. Though not a missionary, Stanley taught the Kabaka some rudiments of Christianity, while discrediting Islam. He proposed that Mutesa should invite Christian missionaries who would teach him and the people of his kingdom about the new faith.

Mutesa enthusiastically accepted the idea, believing that more foreigners in his kingdom would add significantly to the firepower he was getting from Arab traders – mainly arms and gun powder.

In 1875, Stanley wrote an open letter in the name of the Kabaka Mutesa, inviting missionaries to the Kingdom of Buganda. Two missionary groups, the British Church Mission Society and the French White Fathers, arrived in 1877 and 1879 respectively.

But their arrival did not settle the Kabaka’s anxiety and increasing sense of insecurity. Rather their arrival increased it. He now had four different competing groups to deal with: the traditionalists, the Muslims, and the two Christian groups.
