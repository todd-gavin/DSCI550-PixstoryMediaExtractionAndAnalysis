REAL MADRID WON THE MATCH AGAINST CHELSEA BY A 1-3 SCORELINE.

Yes, what you are reading is true. Nobody could ever believe that Real Madrid will play this match with such comfort and secure the win against the former UCL Champions, Chelsea.

Whoever missed this match, I tell you that today the miracle happened on the pitch, today Karim Benzema played like he IS the best football player in the world right now.

He scored the hattrick against Chelsea and became the second footballer after Cristiano Ronaldo to score two back-to-back hattricks in UEFA Champions League knockout stages.

As a football fan, usually, I take the first 15 minutes of the match to predict what the result will be, and most of the time I predict it right.

In this match, the first 15 minutes are very even for both the team, Real Madrid and Chelsea were trying to attack as much as possible but Madrid was patient, their off-the-ball movement was awesome and when they got the ball, they attack full throttle.

And in the 21st minute of the match, that blip from Chelsea's side came, and we saw amazing gameplay from Modric, Vinicius, and Karim Benzema and Real Madrid scored the first goal.

By the time Chelsea get settled after conceding one goal, Real Madrid scored another goal on a counter-attack in the 24th minute and Karim Benzema score the goal with a beautiful header.

I think after the second goal, Madrid took Chelsea very lightly because in the 40th minute of the match, Chelsea scored the only goal of the match with an amazing set-piece and the score was 1-2.

Just after halftime, a blunder moment between Rudiger and Mendy happened. Mendy passed the ball to Rudiger but Benzema intercept and take the ball away from both the players and scored the third goal for Real Madrid and settled the match.

The second leg between Real Madrid and Chelsea will be on 13th April at the home of Real Madrid and I think that Madrid already has one foot in the semifinals.
