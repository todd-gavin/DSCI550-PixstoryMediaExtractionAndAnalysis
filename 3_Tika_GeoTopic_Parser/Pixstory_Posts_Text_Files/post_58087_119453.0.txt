Solo levelling artist Seong -rak Jang known as Dubu passed away at the age of 40 on Monday,  25 July . According to Redice Studio on Twitter, Jang died as a result of an unspecified health complication that resulted in cerebral haemorrhage. A private funeral was held and no other information has been released. 

Redice Studio which is overseeing Solo Leveling animations refused to comment how his death will affect the project. 

Dubu began his career as a manga artist in Japan and South Korea. His earlier publications include Space Dandy, The Island of Giant Insects, and Beautiful Legends, for which he is both credited as an artist and author.
