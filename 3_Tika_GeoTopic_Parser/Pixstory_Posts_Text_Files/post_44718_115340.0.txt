of Venus
continues....

The Jyotish gemstones representing the positive powers of the planet Venus according to Vedic Astrology and Navagraha Gemology are diamonds and white sapphires. 

Venus is the planet representing the power of love, compassion and divine knowledge. Venus or Shukra is considered as a Guru/preceptor and all things associated with Venus can be categorized by one single word—“Abundance”. 

All things which are beautiful and luxurious are ruled by Venus. This planet represents the bond of love between two souls. Venus controls fine arts, careers which require a lot of creative talents like acting, music, and entertainment. 

An individual ruled by the positive powers of Venus will have, “Panache” and will have a taste for good things in life. 

In ancient cultures diamonds were used as a protective talisman and were supposed to reflect the ultimate victory. It is a well known fact that an individual wearing a diamond is protected from evil eye, negative spells and spirits. Bhargava Ratna as a diamond is called in Sanskrit is a Jyotish gem for the truly blessed. 

We will analyse ascendant wise the combinations in which diamond gemstone/white sapphire are suitable as per Vedic astrology.

Diamond and White Sapphire for Aries ascendant Diamonds and white sapphires are not auspicious gem stones for the individuals of the Aries ascendant as Venus becomes the lord of the death inflicting houses in this ascendant. In this ascendant-Venus becomes the lord of the 2nd house and the 7th house. Secondly, it is an enemy of the ascendant lord-Mars.

 The gemstones of Venus should not be worn unless Venus major period or sub period is operating. Those individuals with the placement of Venus in 2nd house, 7th house and 12th house can wear diamonds and white sapphires only when the Venus periods are operating and that too after a trial.
