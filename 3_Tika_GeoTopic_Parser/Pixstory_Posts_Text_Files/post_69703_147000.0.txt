Bts Jungkook leaves the army squinting
On 21st September Jungkook shared two Instagram stories that leave Army squinting. Recently jungkook posted a video on his Instagram stories. It was a very small video on the background.
ARMYs were left confused and trying to figure out what it was. So, many were squinting in an attempt to make out what it was they were seeing.
An ARMY even posted an enlarged version. Unfortunately, it was very pixelated that way. It appeared to be a driving shot of the sky.
Jungkook didnâ€™t stop there, though. He uploaded another video about an hour later; this time, the video was even tinier!
Again, when one zooms in, the video is so pixelated that you can barely understand what it is.
But in the case of this video, it appears to be a video of himself!
