It doesnâ€™t take much time for certain things to trend on social media. And if a celebrity or a popular figure takes up a certain challenge, the particular trend goes viral on social media. Something similar has happened with the #KalaChashma challenge with the cricket teams and social media gimmicks making it viral.
Here we bring you three cricket teams that took up the #KalaChashma challenge:
1. India
It all started with team India, led by KL Rahul, taking up the #KalaChashma challenge after winning the three-match ODI series against Zimbabwe 3-0. Senior players were rested for this series while Rahul made a comeback from injury. While India sealed the ODI series with a win in the first two matches itself, the visitors had to work extremely hard for a win in the final game of the tour.
Sikandar Raza smashed a brilliant ton that took Zimbabwe within touching distance of victory. But India managed to get over the line to win the contest by 13 runs. It was after this win, that the Indian team took up the #KalaChashma Challenge to celebrate the series win over the home team.
The video went viral as the fans drooled over the likes of Shikhar Dhawan and Ishan Kishan among other tapping their feet hilariously over the popular Bollywood number.
