Scrubbing is a good way to keep the dead skin cells away and give your skin a little rejuvenation but can over-scrubbing cause problems?
Yes it can
Over-exfoliating is very harmful to your skin as it can remove other cells and dead ones.
This can cause irritation, redness and inflamed skin.
Eventually, your complexion can become dry and flaky. You may even develop a rash-like texture, leading to uneven tone (like patchy, red blotches). Breakouts are another common reaction, especially small, rough, and bumpy pimples.
Signs of over-exfoliating -
-irritation, burning or peeling
-redness and inflammation
-breakouts, especially small pimples
-increased sensitivity to other products in your routine
