True, animals in zoos are confined to small places and are unable to adapt to their artificial surroundings but they're still protected. Animals are also poached in national parks and sanctuaries despite careful vigilance. As a result, certain species are in jeopardy of becoming extinct. In zoos, they are at least safe. Zoos should not be outlawed.

Only zoos can help children develop a knowledge of animals. They're also suited to care for sick animals whose food habits and well-being can't be monitored in the wild. Another significant issue is that only well-run zoos or sanctuaries can breed rare and exotic animals on the verge of extinction.

A good zoo provides an enriching environment for the animals, ensuring that they are never bored, are properly cared for, and have lots of space. Seeing an animal up close and personal is a far more intimate and unforgettable experience than watching it in a nature documentary, and it is more likely to establish an empathic attitude toward animals. Some zoos assist in the rehabilitation of wildlife and take in exotic pets that people no longer desire or can care for.

Not to mention, The federal Animal Welfare Act, which defines standards for animal care, regulates both accredited and unaccredited animal exhibitors.
