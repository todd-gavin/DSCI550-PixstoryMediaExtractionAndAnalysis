Ann Patchett once said, “Reading fiction is important. It is a vital means of imagining a life other than our own, which in turn makes us more empathetic beings.” And I believe that's very true.

Reading fiction opens the door to a whole new world to you with every book you start. It's like living multiple lives without leaving your own. Unlike TV, where you have a face, a concrete surrounding, in a book, you only have your mind and someone else's words. You're free to mold them your way. The author will tell you there's a garden, you'll plant your own orchids in it. That's the power of fiction.
