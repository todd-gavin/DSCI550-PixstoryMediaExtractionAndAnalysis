In order to truly manage our mental health effectively we must combine both individual healing AND systemic change Right now a lot of therapy and mental health and health in general focuses only on individual change They tend to emphasize individual healing because it s often what we feel as though we have more control over However the ability to focus solely on individual healing is a complete privilege because the truth is many MANY people especially POC are trapped in a system that prevents them from meeting their basic needs If you don t have access to food shelter safety medical care a support system etc it is nearly impossible to heal We like to believe that a few stories about people who make it out mean anyone can but this is just not true So this is a reminder about the importance of both In order to heal trauma individuals must feel safe To maintain mental health folx must be able to take breaks and rest The current system we live in prevents many people especially Black and POC people from having access to healing And then when they struggle people may feel guilty for not being able to heal when the truth is it literally may not be possible Self care journaling and boundaries can only take some of us so far depending on what someone is dealing with Real mental health requires individual healing and also changing the systems that prevent people from having access to resources basic needs and support
