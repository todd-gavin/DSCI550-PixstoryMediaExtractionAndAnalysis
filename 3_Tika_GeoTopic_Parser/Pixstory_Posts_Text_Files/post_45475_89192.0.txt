Because of his unrivalled success in the league at both a team and individual level, Ronaldo is dubbed "Mr Champions League" by some.
He won his first Champions League trophy with Manchester United in 2007-08, then went on to win four more with Real Madrid during his career-defining spell there.

Ronaldo has not only helped his sides win the Champions League five times, but he has also smashed record after record in the competition.

He is, for example, the all-time leading goalscorer in the tournament's illustrious history, overtaking Lionel Messi in 2021, and has also made the most appearances, surpassing former Madrid teammate Iker Casillas in 2021.

Ronaldo's 17 goals in the 2013-14 Champions League season set a new record for goals scored in a single season, and he is the only player in the modern era to score in three different finals (2008, 2014, 2017) - though it should be noted that Alfred Di Stefano scored in five European Cup finals prior to the 1992 format change.

Before leaving Old Trafford for Real Madrid, the Portugal legend claimed that winning the Champions League was "the high point" of his career, and he has undoubtedly thrived in the tournament since then, as evidenced by the aforementioned list of records.

Indeed, Ronaldo's enthusiasm for Champions League games was well illustrated in 2017 when cameras caught him singing along with the tournament's anthem before one of Real Madrid's games.

Clarence Seedorf, who was dubbed 'Mr Champions League' long before Ronaldo's love affair with the game became a thing, deserves a special mention on this subject. Seedorf got the moniker after winning the Champions League three times with three different teams: Ajax, Real Madrid, and AC Milan.

Others have been dubbed 'Mr Champions League,' with Lionel Messi receiving the honour from Barcelona's official website, but few can argue with Ronaldo's affinity with it.
