He arrived in Turin as a young, talented promise, and now he bids Juve farewell, taking with him a wealth of experience that have made him the champion he is now.

Seven years in black and white for Paulo, made up of 293 appearances, 115 goals, 45 assists and 12 trophies won. Now his career will continue outside of Turin.

Those numbers, if examined in detail, tell much of the shared story together. For example, Paulo is ninth placed in the all-time scoring charts in Juventus history in all competitions; he is the tenth top scorer in Serie A, third all-time for Juventus in Europe with 18 goals scored in the Champions League. And still speaking of goals, Dybala is the player who has scored most often at the Allianz Stadium (68 goals) in all competitions and is the Bianconero who has scored most goals from outside the box (25 goals) in Serie A.

The seven years together were not only made up of goals and victories, there were flashes of skill, unforgettable nights, and performances of absolute quality.

And for all this we will always thank him.

Good luck, or should that be, suerte, Joya!
