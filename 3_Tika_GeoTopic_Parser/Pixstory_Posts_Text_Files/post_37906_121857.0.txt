Manchester City won back to back Premier League titles after winning the 2021/22 PL title over Liverpool on the final day. But would things be a lot tougher for Pep Guardiola's side this time around? 

The Sky Blues have had a significant revamp in their squad in the transfer window. The likes of Raheem Sterling, Fernandinho, Gabriel Jesus and Zinchenko have left the club exluding Fernandinho, the trio have switched loyalties to City's direct rivals. Out of the mentioned players, Sterling would be the biggest miss for Pep Guardiola. But the Spaniard has new players in his kitty. 

Julian Alvarez, Erling Haaland, and Kalvin Philips are three major boosts that City have gotten to bolster their squad. Its safe to say that Guardiola would'nt have to play a false nine this term around.  But would these signings be enough? Well the Community Shield loss to Liverpool surely puts a question mark on things. 

Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal have significantly improved their squads. Liverpool too have added Darwin Nunez to replace the outgoing Sadio Mane. Hence the initial days of the league could be very crucial to City. There is no doubt that the Sky Blues will hit their stride mid season. But Pep Guardiola would need to be vary of threat the likes of Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur could pose in their title defence this season.
