Hopscotch is centuries old and dates back to the days of Ancient Rome. Even though there is no conclusive evidence to prove this, it has been said that the game was invented to train Roman soldiers and the courts spanned to over 100 feet. The Hopscotch court was used to help Roman foot soldiers to improve their footwork as they ran the course in full armour.

Roman children are said to have taken inspiration from the game played by the soldiers. They played a smaller version of the game and added a scoring system. Soon enough, the game became popular.
