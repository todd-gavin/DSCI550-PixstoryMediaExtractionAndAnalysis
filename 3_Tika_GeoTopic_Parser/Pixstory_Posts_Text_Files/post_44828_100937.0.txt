Emmanuel Dennis of Watford is the subject of a £20 million bid from West Ham United. This
season, the Nigerian forward was a standout for Watford, scoring 10 Premier League goals in a
team where no one else scored more than five.

Dennis, 24, was named Premier League Player of the Month in November after scoring a goal
and providing two assists in Watford's 4-1 victory over Manchester United. It was the undisputed
highlight of Watford's season and the final nail in the coffin for United manager Ole Gunnar
Solskjaer at the time.

When Watford lost to Crystal Palace earlier this month, they were relegated from the Premier
League with four games remaining. Dennis' contract stipulates that he must accept a wage cut
to remain with the Hornets as they seek to return to the Championship.

Dennis was purchased for £3 million last summer and has four years left on his deal, so despite
Watford's terrible season, he might bring a good financial return. According to the Mirror,
Hammers boss David Moyes will have money to spend this summer and hopes to add at least
one striker and two central midfielders.

This season, Jarrod Bowen and Michail Antonio have both been outstanding for West Ham,who
have had another successful league campaign and reached the Europa League final.

The pair have combined for 30 goals in all competitions, although West Ham's depth has been
questioned following their failure to reach what would have been their first European final this
century. Dennis could be crucial if the Hammers are to improve their European performance
next season.
