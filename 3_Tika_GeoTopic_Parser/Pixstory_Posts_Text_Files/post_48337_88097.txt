Dawn Staley has a sheepish look that transforms into a smile after a quick glimpse at the women s NCAA Tournament Greensboro Region U S News reported that five of the dozen Black female coaches in the women s tournament including Staley are from Greensboro The coaches are more than double the amount of Black women who coached teams in the NCAA Tournament last year Despite the fact that there is still much work to be done Staley sees this as a sign of progress This is what happens when you give individuals an opportunity they don t normally receive and they succeed I believe it is now popular When Coach Jolette Law took the Illinois position it was probably like it was popular Staley said of her Gamecocks assistant in During that time a lot of Black coaches had opportunities he says Staley continued Three four years later percent of them were no longer head coaches and they weren t recycled like other coaches As a result I believe Black coaches are now better equipped because they have had to prepare In a hallway of the arena Staley had a fleeting exchange with a fellow black coach that said more about what could be than what was said All we did was say hello because the teams were passing through and we were glancing up as they walked by She just said she was thrilled we were here and she was happy for me Grace explained She wished me luck I said I ll see you on Friday she said Staley wishes she could say that to a Black female coach more frequently
