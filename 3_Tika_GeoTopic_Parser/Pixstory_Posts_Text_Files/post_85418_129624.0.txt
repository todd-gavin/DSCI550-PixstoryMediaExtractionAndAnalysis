Dependent on donations and goodwill, animals are abandoned or put into kennels every day. These organisations which support homeless animals are under extreme stress and are frantically trying to bring attention to the situation of abandoned and homeless animals. 

The purpose of International Homeless Animals Day is to raise awareness of domestic animal neutering, pet abandonment, and feral animals. 

You can celebrate this day by spending some time or money assisting homeless animals worldwide, whether it's by feeding them, neutering or spaying them, or aiding in rescue and adoption operations.
