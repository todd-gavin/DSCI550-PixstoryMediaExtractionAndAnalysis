Gallagher is just 49. So how unusual is it to develop such severe arthritis before old age? Well, it depends on the type of arthritis.

While there are a number of different types of arthritis, osteoarthritis is the most common. Osteoarthritis is common in older people, but it is possible for it to develop in younger people.

A number of factors have been associated with the development of osteoarthritis, including ageing, being overweight, having an injury (such as having a torn anterior cruciate ligament in the knee – a common affliction among footballers) and genetic susceptibility. In Gallagher’s case, it may be linked to Hashimoto’s disease – a thyroid condition he was diagnosed with a few years ago. Hashimoto’s disease is associated with arthritis.

Unlike rheumatoid arthritis – which is an autoimmune disease that can occur in younger adults – osteoarthritis develops when the shock-absorbing cartilage that covers the end of the bone wears away. Osteoarthritis is often referred to as a “disease of the cartilage”. In fact, the absence of cartilage is how doctors confirm the presence of osteoarthritis. However, it is actually a condition that affects the whole structure of the joint, including changes to the bone and soft tissues, such as ligaments.
