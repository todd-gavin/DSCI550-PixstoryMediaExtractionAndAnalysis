Paying my tributes to Stephen Hawking, one of the most brilliant cosmologists and theoretical physicists in history.

He was best known for his work on the origins and structure of the universe.

Do you know?
When he was a teenager, Stephen and his friends built a computer out of old clock parts, telephone switchboards, and other recycled items.
