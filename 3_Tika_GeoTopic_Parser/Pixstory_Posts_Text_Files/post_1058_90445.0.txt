Part 2 of acceptance speech 


Art imitates life. I look like the crazy father, just like they said about Richard Williams. But love will make you do crazy things.

And my mother… a lot in this moment is really complicated for me but to my mother, she didn't want to come out. She's had her knitting crew who she's in Philly watching with. Being able to love and care for my mother, my family, my wife… I'm taking up too much time… Thank you for this honour. Thank you for this moment and thank you on behalf of Richard and Oracene and the entire Williams family. Thank you. I hope the Academy invites me back. Thank you.•
