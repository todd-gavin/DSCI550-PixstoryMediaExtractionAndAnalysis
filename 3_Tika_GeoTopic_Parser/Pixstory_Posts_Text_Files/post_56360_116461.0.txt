ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental ailments in childhood. It is usually first diagnosed in childhood and often lasts into adulthood. 

Children with ADHD may have trouble paying attention, controlling impulsive behaviors (may act without thinking about what the result will be), or be overly active.

A child with ADHD might:

•	daydream a lot
•	forget or lose things a lot
•	squirm or fidget
•	talk too much
•	make careless mistakes or take unnecessary risks
•	have a hard time resisting temptation
•	have trouble taking turns
•	have difficulty getting along with others

Causes 

In addition to genetics, scientists are studying other possible causes and risk factors including:
•	Brain injury
•	Exposure to environmental risks (e.g., lead) during pregnancy or at a young age
•	Alcohol and tobacco use during pregnancy
•	Premature delivery
•	Low birth weight

What can you do?
