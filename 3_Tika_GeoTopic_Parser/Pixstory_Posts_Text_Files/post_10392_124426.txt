The archival and book heritage often compromised by deterioration processes of paper materials caused by a rich array of biotic agents such as molds and insects Various physical-chemical methodologies have been tested to counteract this phenomenon but none has proved to be effective, non-invasive and at the same time safe for the operators Research published in the journal International Biodeterioration Biodegradation has improved the knowledge of the antibacterial, antifungal and insect repellent action of some components of essential oils extracted from plants and their volatile organic compounds Voc The study coordinated by researchers from the Institute of Chemistry of Organometallic Compounds of the National Research Council Cnr Iccom together with researchers from the Institute of biosciences and bioresources Cnr Ibb of the Institute for the sustainable protection of plants Cnr Ipsp of the Institute of cultural heritage sciences Cnr Ispc and with the collaboration of the National Central Library of Florence of the University of Parma and the University of Palermo For a long time, ethylene oxide gas was used which however proved to be extremely toxic and carcinogenic to humans Among the physical methods used, gamma irradiation is the most successful but can compromise the structure of the paper recalls Andrea Ienco of the Cnr Iccom who co-directed the study The essential oils extracted from plants and the volatile organic compounds Voc, their main components, constitute a class of substances with multiple biological properties including a marked antibacterial, antifungal action and insect repellent effect. However, the volatility of these substances affects long-term efficacy is a non-negligible aspect for the purposes of their use. Here the experimental part of the research intervened with evaluations on some species isolated from a deposit of books of the Forte Belvedere in Florence. The volatile organic compounds contained in essential oils such as thymol, carvacrol and eugenol are been stabilized within crystalline networks of cyclodextrins and phenazine-based co-crystals forming a crystalline solid These formulations obtained thanks to solvent-free methodologies allow their antimicrobial activity to be exploited as a valid tool for the control of paper degrading agents such as easy-to-clean powders to handle and suitable for the indirect contact treatment of paper items continues the Cnr ICCOM researcher
