Do you feel like something is wrong The most important indication of needing additional assistance comes from your sense of need Do you feel you are not grieving because you cannot talk about it During the grief process it is essential to be able to express your thoughts and feelings through words and actions Do you put your grief on hold to take care of others For example are you taking on the role of caregiver for the rest of the family Is this additional responsibility making you feel resentful and angry Are you engaging in risky behaviours to cope with painful thoughts and feelings For example are you drinking more using drugs including prescription or over the counter medications or having thoughts of harming yourself or others Are you experiencing a pervasive fear that prevents you from having close relationships For example after losing someone you loved and felt close to you may not want to get close to anyone again for fear of losing them Do you need to keep busy so you don t think about or feel your grief It can help to find things to keep you alive while grieving However this can also become a way of pushing grief aside and not dealing with it Are you constantly preoccupied or experiencing constant thoughts of death over a long period Soon after the end it is normal for your ideas to be focused almost entirely on your loved one and their death however if this continues for an extended period you may need additional help
