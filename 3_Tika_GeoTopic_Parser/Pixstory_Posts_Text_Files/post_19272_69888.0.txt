A player of Indian origin making it big in European league, especially in England has to be the talk of the town. When you look at it carefully, a situation like this arises very rarely and once in a while.

The player in question is Dilan Markanday of Tottenham Hotspur, having come through the ranks of the North London club, making quite a few appearances for them in cup games and the league. He features mainly for the club's U-18s, U-19s & U-23s has been linked with a move to try for more game time and opportunity to make it to the bigger, grand stage of the sport.

One such club showing interest in him is Blackburn, owned by Indian owners. This move if it goes through will have a thing of it's own to it. Blackburn Rovers, currently on a dream run in the Championship (England's second tier league) might land in the Premier League for the next term after a long period of gap and a player of Indian background helping them for the same cause would create some story around the football world.

A move that has a certain thing alongside it, considering everything around and then helping the club achieve it's ambitions is something we are here for. Surely.
