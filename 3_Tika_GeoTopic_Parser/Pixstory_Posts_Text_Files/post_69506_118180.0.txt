According to officials, girls outperformed boys in the class 12 CBSE examination even though the total pass rate decreased from 99.37 percent to 92.71 percent from the previous year. 
Due to the pandemic, exams could not be held last year, so the results were announced using a special assessment system. This year, exams were held over two terms. 
According to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), the pass rate in 2020 was 88.78%, compared to 83.40% in 2019. 
This year, too, the board declined to release a merit list. Since the schools were shuttered due to the epidemic in 2020, the merit lists have been discontinued.
