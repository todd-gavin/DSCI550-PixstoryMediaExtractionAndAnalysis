Newcastle owners left shaken by scary motorbike incident outside Anfield
Newcastle co-owners Mehrdad Ghodoussi and Amanda Staveley were left shaken after a bike ridden by two people headed towards them before the Premier League game on Wednesday.
Fortunately, the bike didn’t hit them and the pedestrians escaped a serious threat. Describing the incident, Ghodoussi told the Daily Mail:
“The bike flew right by us and could have hit us easily. It was a scary incident. Amanda was pretty shaken up but calmed down once we got inside the stadium. Thankfully, it appears serious injuries were avoided. But it could have been far worse; the bike drove straight into the crowd."
As per Merseyside Police, the bike was involved in a chase with an electric bike close to Liverpool’s ground before the match at around 6:30 PM. They released an official statement which read:
"There are no reports of any members of the public being seriously injured. One of the riders of the bike suffered facial and shoulder injuries and has received medical treatment. The rider of the bike, a 30-year-old man, was arrested on suspicion of S5 RTA (drug driving), causing serious injury by dangerous driving and suspected theft of a motor vehicle”
"The passenger, a 23-year-old man, was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class B drugs, suspected theft of a motor vehicle and other driving offences. The bike has been recovered and enquiries into the incident are ongoing,” he added.
Merseyside Police on Friday said the two men have been released under investigation pending further enquiries.
Speaking of the game, Alexander Isak handed the lead to Newcastle in the 38th minute. However, Roberto Firmino scored an equalizer in the 61th minute only for Fabio Carvalho to seal the game for Liverpool in injury time.
The Reds registered their second win of the season and the Magpies are still lacking behind in the race with just one win to their name.
