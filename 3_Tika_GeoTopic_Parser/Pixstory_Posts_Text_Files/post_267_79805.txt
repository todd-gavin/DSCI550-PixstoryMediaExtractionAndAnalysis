 The text in this story is essentially the same as the text in GA SB as the two bills are almost twin copies of each other a common theme in these coordinated attacks by Republican representatives against trans youth One difference is that SB puts in more emphasis in invalidating transgender people by its attempt to unscientifically impose a binary on gender The so called Save Girls Sports Act by senators weaponizes language to invalidate transgender and intersex people through an imposed binary on the term gender in an attempt to ban trans youth from school sports in Georgia The proposed act would let cisgender students file a grievance complaint if they are playing or anticipate playing with trans students These laws do not care about protecting women sports like most of the Republican sponsors claim They are a reproduction of bio essentialist hierarchies through white supremicist patriarchy that invites a policing of all bodies The binary system of gender and sex goes against science and is used to perpetuate harmful narratives that validate discrimination against trans and intersex folks Arguments attempting to uphold differences based on biological sex fall apart as you dig into the science of how genes gonads and hormones keep sex subject to change The truth is your biological sex isn t carved in stone but a living system with the potential for change Neurobiologist Dr Sim n e D Sun writes As long as we continue practicing a binary system to classify people toxic masculinity and patriarchal femininity will continue to inform how we treat each other regardless of any of our genders Most sponsors behind anti trans sports bans don t know any trans athletes in their states and their legislative attacks follow a repetitive theme of erasure they doesn t use the word transgender and intersex even once Excluding trans girls and femme youth from participating in sports has negative outcomes for all youth and this politics is a policing and surveillance of all bodies GA SB was read for the first time and referred to committee on February nd
