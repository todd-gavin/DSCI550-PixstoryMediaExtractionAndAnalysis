US Soccer and its women's team reach an agreement to terminate the equal pay issue; US Soccer will pay the players $22 million, plus an additional $2 million for post-career development and philanthropic purposes; US Soccer also promises to pay men's and women's players equally in the future.

Sky Sports reported that US Women National Team players have ended a six-year legal battle with their federation over equal pay, agreeing a deal worth $24m (£17.7m) plus bonuses to match the terms of the men.

The US Soccer Federation and the women's team announced the deal Tuesday, which will see the players receive $22m, around a third of the figure they had originally sought.

"For our age, knowing that we're going to leave the game in an immensely better place than when we found it is everything” expressed USA midfielder Megan Rapinoe said. 

"That's what it's all about because, to be honest, there's no justice in this unless we make sure it doesn't happen again.", she was reported as saying.

“Winning a World Cup, especially in the manner we did with all we were battling for off the field, is a monumental undertaking, and this felt just as herculean, if not more so, in so many ways. I'm looking forward to taking the next step."

In April 2016, five American celebrities, led by Alex Morgan and Rapinoe, filed a lawsuit with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 

Three years later, they filed a lawsuit, alleging violations of the federal Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.
