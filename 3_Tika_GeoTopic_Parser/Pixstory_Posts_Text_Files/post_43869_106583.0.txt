In UEFA Nations League action on Wednesday, Scotland will face Armenia at Hampden Park.


Scotland is coming off a 3-1 defeat against Oleksandr Petrakov's Ukraine in their most recent match. Ukraine won thanks to goals from Andriy Yarmolenko of West Ham United, Roman Yaremchuk of Benfica, and Artem Dovbyk of Dnipro-1. Scotland's consolation goal was scored by Celtic midfielder Callum McGregor.


Armenia, on the other side, recently defeated Stephen Kenny's Republic of Ireland 1-0. Eduard Spertsyan of Krasnodar scored the game-winning goal for Joaquin Caparros' Armenia in the second half.Caparros will not get carried away at this point, especially given their priority of surviving in the second tier, but one more win in their next five games might be enough to fulfill that goal.

Scotland vs Armenia:Probable Playing XI

Scotland: Craig Gordon, Scott McTominay, Grant Hanley, Jack Hendry, Stephen O'Donnell, Callum McGregor, Stuart Armstrong, Andrew Robertson, John McGinn, Che Adams, Ryan Christie

Armenia: David Yurchenko, Hovhannes Hambardzumyan, Taron Voskanyan, Varazdat Haroyan, Arman Hovhannisyan, Kamo Hovhannisyan, Khoren Bayramyan, Hovhannes Harutyunyan, Eduard Spertsyan, Vahan Bichakhchyan, Sargis Adamyan

Scotland vs Armenia:Prediction

Given their previous history, this might be a far more competitive match than many people anticipate. While Scotland may need some time to recover from their defeat in Ukraine, we still anticipate the Tartan Army to win this match, maybe by a single goal.

Prediction: Scotland 1-0 Armenia
