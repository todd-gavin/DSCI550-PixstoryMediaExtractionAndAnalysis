If Indian football is in the news it is mostly for wrong reasons The last few days had been no exception Mumbai City FC raised hopes after the unexpected victory over Air Force Club Iraq in the Asian Champions League group tie but they were rudely brought down to earth by Riyadh s Al Shabab Club almost immediately The defeat not only dashed whatever slim chance the Mumbai side had of qualifying for the next round but also exposed the true standard of Indian football In the first leg against Al Shabab the Indian team conceded three goals thus taking the aggregate to Now the question is how correct was the decision of the AFC to allow an Indian club in ACL main rounds On the other hand things are going from bad to worse at the administrative front in Indian football One of the latest controversies in All India Football Federation is the reported resignation of its technical director Savio Medeira A reputed midfielder of the s who also represented the country Savio was allegedly humiliated by a senior federation official for disagreement over the choice of venue for the AFC Pro License coaching course Poor Savio it is claimed was made a scapegoat and was blamed for a mess that was actually created by two other senior officials While the federation vehemently denied the news of its TD s resignation Savio surprisingly hasn t contradicted the news of his putting down the papers in a haste Hardly the Savio incident died down Indian football was further hit by a bombshell dropped by a club official from Chandigarh who accused a senior AIFF functionary of sexually harassing few women employees of the federation The federation of course refuted the allegations strongly and said legal action would be taken against whosoever tried to malign the senior official it truly left a bad taste in the mouth What is more disturbing is the fact that the allegation of sexual harassment was levelled at a time when the high profile Indian Women s League was in full flow in Bhubaneswar It hardly helped in promoting women s football in India
