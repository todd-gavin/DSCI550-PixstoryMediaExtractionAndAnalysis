I have always heard - If it makes you happy , then it doesn't have to make sense to others . And that's True ! ❤️
You will always find people telling you what is right for you and what is not . They'll tell you that you doing something wrong will land you in trouble , but you still do it . Well , because it makes you happy ! There might be times when you decide to give up on someone and people tell you not to , they may tell you that you're making a mistake . Leaving someone never makes anyone happy , but if you feel that's the right thing to do , go ahead and do it , without caring what others will think ! Always remember , it's you who knows what made you come to the decision to leave and not them . ✨
If you love spending time with someone , do it even if people tell you not to . We live in a very unpredictable world , we don't know what might happen next and when you might lose someone . So , if some things make you happy , it need not make sense to anyone else ! ✨
Don't blame yourself if your friends told you not to do something and you did , but things did not go well . Don't blame them when they told you not to do something and everything went well . Be lucky to have people who look out for you , people who give you advice and still support you if you choose to take a different path . ✨
It's okay to do some things even when people tell you not to , if it makes you happy . But, be ready to face the consequences if anything goes downhill and if they go all well , you're in for a treat . Remember , you don't need to bend over backwards to please anyone . ✨❤️
This is what life is ❤️✨
