Your argument would make sense if it were true. Unfortunately, it isn't. Why should one deserve a home if they don't want to participate in society, you ask? How do you know they don't want to contribute to the community? They want to, they do it, but it's the country that hates them instead of how you're framing it.

The minimum wage for the workers of our country stays standing still. There's barely any increase in their salaries but the rents? They're going up, rising tenfold. In this situation, it's not the worker that's responsible. They are working, they are working hard and they're working full time. They are not being paid fairly for their efforts. And the inflation just doesn't stop!

Oh, also, do I have to remind you just how much everything is owned by private, rich firms and not by communities? Because if it were communities handling it, there would have been a lot less homelessness.

And let me bring this back, people don't need to work to exercise their human rights. Get over it. It's crazy how much kindness has depleted.
