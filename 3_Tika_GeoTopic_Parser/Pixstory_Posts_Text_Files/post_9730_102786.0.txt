Biggest difference in men vs women mental health issues is prevalence. Men typically have fewer mental health conditions and are also less likely to seek treatment. 

Another obstacle in men’s mental health awareness is the stigma. Guys are supposed to be “strong,” and issues such as depression are viewed as signs of “weakness.” However, this male mental health stigma is actually killing men. 

According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, in 2019, men died by suicide at a rate of 3.63 times higher than women. With over 6 million American men struggling with depression, it is crucial to know the signs of mental health struggles and end the stigma that stops men from getting help.

Types of Mental Health Conditions in Men

Mental health issues do not discriminate and affect both men and women. However, there are mental health conditions that men commonly struggle with. These mental health struggles include:

Depression

Bipolar Disorder

Social Anxiety Disorder

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

Schizophrenia

While women struggle with mental health issues more than men, it doesn’t mean men aren’t affected. This is especially true with depression. 

Complex factors play a role in how men vs. women experience mental health issues. Hormonal differences play a significant role, but so do internalized gender stereotypes. These stereotypes include coping strategies, clinical bias, among other factors.
