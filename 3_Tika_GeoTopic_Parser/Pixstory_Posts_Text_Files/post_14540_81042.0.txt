Mansukh Mandaviya, Union Health Minister on Saturday said that Covid-19 vaccination for children in the age group of 5 to 15 years would be administered as soon as it receives recommendation to that effect from a group of experts.

He said the group of experts has so far not made any recommendation on the vaccination of this category.

"When to vaccinate and to which age group is decided on the basis of recommendation of a group of scientists. We had implemented its recommendation for the precaution group within one week. We will surely implement its recommendation (for 5 to 15 age group) as and when we receive it," he said in a press conference. 

The country-wide Covid-19 vaccination of children in 15-18 age group began last month.
 "Today, vaccination is not an issue. We have enough vaccines, there is no shortage of doses. We will definitely follow the recommendation of the scientific community," Mandaviya added. 
The government has so far not received any such recommendation, and a decision in this regard will be taken in the coming days on that basis. It is not a political decision. Sero survey and sero prevalence survey in July-August last year showed that 67 per cent children also developed anti-bodies, and children remained asymptomatic, he said. 


"Ultimately, these are biological things. Therefore, scientists study before making recommendations. Earlier we used to follow the world (for recommendations regarding vaccination).
 Today, our scientists conduct their own analysis, they have their own study, and make opinions based on this," he said. He also said that India used vaccination very effectively to fight the pandemic during its third wave.
