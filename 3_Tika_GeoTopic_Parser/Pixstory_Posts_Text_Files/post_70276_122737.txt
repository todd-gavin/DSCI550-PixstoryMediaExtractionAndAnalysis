After my marriage I continued looking for a job In the meantime my father in law started looking for a lecturer s post in different colleges He was prepared to pay money donation But there were issues There were a lot of politics and management issues too So I gave up and started looking for a job elsewhere Being a bright student many people advised to go for civil services I discussed with an old man who suggested that it is better to go to Delhi and then prepare for the civil services exams But the compulsion of a job forced me to abandon the plan to go for IAS IFS IPS After marriage I was dependent on my father in law s money and that was very tough on me He was very generous but still there is a limit So I came to Delhi for a job and got this job in Parliament and have lived here ever since In a way I have made it my home now I have three sons and all of them are well settled I have a house in Kerala and we go there every year Last three years we haven t been to my native place because of the Covid pandemic That is something very special about the Keralites Wherever they are they might be on the Moon but the pull of the roots is so strong that they go back to their roots To be continued
