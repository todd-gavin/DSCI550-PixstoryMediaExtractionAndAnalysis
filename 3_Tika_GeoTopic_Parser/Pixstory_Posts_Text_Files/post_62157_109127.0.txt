Sadio Mane has completed a £35m move from Liverpool to Bayern Munich on a three-year contract.

The Reds will receive 32m euros with an additional 6m euros based on appearances, plus 3m euros for individual and team achievements as reported by Fabrizio Romano. 


Liverpool turned down two bids from Bayern before agreeing a fee for the Senegal forward, who was under contract until next summer, before accepting the deal from Bayern for the desired price tag. Many experts would find it appalling that Mané was let go by Liverpool for such a low price. Mané has been magical for Liverpool and this comes off as a bad decision by the management. 

Mané wanted a new challenge and to step away from Liverpool, and Bayern was looking to replace the Barcelona bound Lewandowski, so all in all, all the parties concerned would be very happy with how the situation worked out!!
