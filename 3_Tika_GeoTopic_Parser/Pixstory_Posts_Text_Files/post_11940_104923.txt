I have heard it many time that Woman s have direct contact with Environment And Now I know It s Soo true I will tell you why Women have direct contact with natural resources like fuel food and fodder forest water and land especially in rural areas where of Indian population reside and directly dependent upon natural resources Women are also responsible for using these resources to satisfy the basic needs of their families I still remember Before in th and th century it was considered that women have no role in environmental conservation and promotion as well as they were avoided in all major sphere of social life But now after spreading awareness about their rights and duties they consciously tried to raise voice against environment degradation Women play a critical role in managing natural resources on community levels and are most affected by environmental degradation Besides that woman even played a leadership role for conservation and enhancement of environment In communities around the world women manage water sources for fuel and food as well as both forests and agricultural terrain From the high level to the grassroots the UN Earth Summit India s Chipko movement and Kenya s Green Belt Movement all highlighted the role of women s voices and perspectives in sustainable development Similarly nowadays Medha Patekar a social worker Menaka Gandhi an environmentalist and politician are playing key role for the conservation and promotion of the environment Therefore conservation of natural resources and promotion of environment cannot be done without involving the women in planning and training for promoting the values for conservation and promotion of environment Happy World Environment Day to all
