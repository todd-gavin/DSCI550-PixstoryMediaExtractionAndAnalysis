The Last monarch of the Colonial Era is dead at last! And while the people of England are mourning their Queen, the Irish are out on the streets partying like it's St. Patty's day!! 
The bloody history of Ireland with the Crown needs little introduction to anyone. The Irish people on Twitter are celebrating like crazy. 
The Crown committed atrocious crimes against the people of Ireland, induced famines and food shortages, so it's a little surprise to anyone that the Irish are having a ball tonight!
