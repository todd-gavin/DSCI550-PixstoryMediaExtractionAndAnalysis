Shakira has spoken publicly about her shocking split from Barcelona defender Gerard Pique for the first time.
The couple announced their separation after being together for 12 years. They also share two children: nine-year-old Milan and seven-year-old Sasha.
In a recent interview, the 45-year-old Colombian singer reflected on how difficult her life has been post the split.
"Oh, this is really hard to talk about personally, especially as this is the first time I’ve ever addressed this situation in an interview," Shakira said.
"I’ve remained quiet and just tried to process it all. Um, and yeah, it’s hard to talk about it, especially because I’m still going through it, and because I’m in the public eye and because our separation is not like a regular separation. And so it’s been tough not only for me, but also for my kids. Incredibly difficult," she added.
The singer also spoke about her priority in life now, which is to protect her kids from unpleasant news and consequences.
"So it’s hard. And I’ve tried to conceal the situation in front of my kids. I try to do it and to protect them, because that’s my number one mission in life. But then they hear things in school from their friends or they come across some disagreeable, unpleasant news online, and it just affects them, you know?," she said.
What’s next for Gerard Pique?
The Spanish footballer, who has already retired from the national team, is warming the bench under Barcelona's new manager Xavi Hernandez this season. Things aren’t going to get any better for him as other defenders have been given priority so far.
The Barca board has also asked the 35-year-old to consider taking retirement at the end of the season. But the defender doesn’t seem very keen to execute this idea as he has refused to do so.
It will be interesting to see how this chapter unfolds as age is not on Pique’s side and Xavi has made it clear to give opportunities to new bloods.
