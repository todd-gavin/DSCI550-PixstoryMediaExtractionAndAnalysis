Anti-fandoms have become a medium for harassing or abusing women online.
And to understand this, we don't need to go back and see some examples in the past; instead, we can look at this very vivid and new case even now when we speak of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's trial.
The way devoted fans stood against Amber for defending Depp could tell it all appropriately. And yes, they use social media to do it because there they can portray their direct aggression, which couldn't be shown so freely through other mediums.
They create a group as strong as the communities of fans, but the difference is that they have a deeply rooted negativity that only aims to spread the ideas of misogyny.
It can even go on body shaming or putting their private matters online just to create a bad reputation.
It is done more easily and frequently with women, as they're often subjected to harassment and violence.
The worst part about it is that women themselves can be part of these toxic groups.
