Unemployment in America is a problem we often talk about but why overworking and burnout is not discussed? 

In America, overworking is passed off as “hardwork” but that’s utter nonsense!

We need to ask ourselves if this is really the healthy way of living? Increased working hours with no rest can cause stress which can adversely affect our health and lessen our span of life. Even when our work is something we like and we are passionate towards it, in order to be at our best, we need a work life balance. We need time to relax, engage in our hobbies, travel and socialise in society. 

No amount of pay can justify poor mental and physical health and in order to live a balanced life workplaces need to reevaluate the rules and regulations of work hours, paid vacations and even the amount of work.
