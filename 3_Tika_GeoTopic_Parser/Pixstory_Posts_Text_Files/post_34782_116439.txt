Even someone who is an established champion today may have suffered bullying when he was young. This is the case of Sebastian Vettel, four times F world champion with Red Bull and yet a victim of his peers when he was a teenager and had his first successes. He spoke about it himself in an interview on German TV Spiegel TV I once brought a trophy to school but they destroyed it immediately and called me an exhibitionist A dated memory when Vettel raced go karts and won his first races when he was just over eleven He was already a promising youngster and had attracted the envy of some kids who went to school with him Envy and grudges that resulted in the episode told by the former Ferrari driver Fortunately the bullying episodes didn&#39;t make the young Vettel stop Nine years after the episode told at the age of just twenty he would have run his first season in F with the BMW Sauber E in just years and days would have won its first world championship and is still today the youngest to do so
