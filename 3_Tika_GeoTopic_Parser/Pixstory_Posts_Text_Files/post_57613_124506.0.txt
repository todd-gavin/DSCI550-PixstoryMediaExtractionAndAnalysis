Of course not; the range and types of therapy differ from one another.
It depends on what and how you choose to seek help.
Most commonly, it is divided into these four to five categories, which involve different techniques and ways of dealing with the person's problems.

One of its types is behavioural therapy; as the name suggests, this therapy is mainly used to help people change their malignant behaviour, often termed self-destructive or unhealthy. Behavioural therapy often uses classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and social learning to help clients alter problematic behaviours.

Cognitive therapy is based on the cognitive model, which states that thoughts, feelings and behaviour are all connected and that individuals can move toward overcoming difficulties and meeting their goals by identifying and changing unhelpful or inaccurate thinking, problematic behaviour, and distressing emotional responses. It works by replacing negative thoughts with positive and more realistic ones. It works on changing the beliefs of the person.

CBT( cognitive behavioural therapy) is another umbrella term that follows different tricks and techniques to deal with the person.

We have also heard about the psychoanalytic approach developed by Sigmund Freud; it was Freud's way of delving into a person's thoughts and past experiences to help the person by analysing them.
