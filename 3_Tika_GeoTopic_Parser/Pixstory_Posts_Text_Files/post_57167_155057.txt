Well I don t want to harm your beliefs and liking for this thought but I can t refrain from saying that most of the work of literature is completely destroyed and degraded when it is adapted into a movie You know it s a skill and barely people do it perfectly Instead what I feel is that films hinder and spoil the reader s imagination Being a bibliophile I know what it means to truly caress each and every page of the book and devour it but when it is put into movies it not only disappoints the readers but it also disparages their love for characters and narratives publicly Also it isn t easy enough to put a page book into a movie there people need hard core skills to critically analyse and cut the portions and depict something that still looks complete where most people fail And if this is not done exactly the way it should be then the entire work is put down from the pedestal where it was kept earlier by the readers for its grandeur and art So I completely dislike the concept of making a movie out of great works of literature
