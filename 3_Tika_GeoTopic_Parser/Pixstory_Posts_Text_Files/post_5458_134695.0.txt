Greens are good for your health 🥦

And apparently it goes great with my skin tone. When I was growing up I really didn’t notice such things like if this colour goes with my skin tone or not cause you know I was busy playing and studying two priorities before 18, but now when I’ve to get up every morning for work I care a lot what I’m wearing everyday so here is one of my new hobbies to buy colour which compliments my skin ♥️
