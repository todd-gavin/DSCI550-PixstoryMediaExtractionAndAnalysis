 Quiver Distribution and Myriad Pictures have unveiled the trailer for their upcoming Western action film ‘Dead For A Dollar’. Carrying the vibe of a 90s Western with some of the early 50s-60s Hollywood Spaghetti Western, so for fans of the Western genre, this ought to be a treat.
Co-written by director Walter Hill (Aliens, 48 Hrs.) and Matt Harris, here’s the official synopsis for Dead for a Dollar:"Veteran bounty hunter Max Borlund is deep into Mexico where he encounters professional gambler and outlaw Joe Cribbens – a sworn enemy he sent to prison years before. Max is on a mission to find and return Rachel Kidd, the wife of a wealthy businessman, who as the story is told to Max, has been abducted by Buffalo Soldier Elijah Jones. Max is ultimately faced with a showdown to save honor."
Releasing theatrically on September 30, Hill will debut Dead For a Dollar on September 6th at the 79th Venice Film Festival, and he will be honored with the Cartier Glory to the Filmmaker Award. The prize is given to personalities who have made one or more particularly original contributions to the film industry.
Produced by Jeff Sackman, Berry Meyerowitz, Kirk D'Amico, Jeremy Wall, Carolyn McMaster and Neil Dunn, the film stars Christoph Waltz, Willem Dafoe, Rachel Brosnahan, Brandon Scott, Warren Burke, Hamish Linklater and Guy Burnet.
