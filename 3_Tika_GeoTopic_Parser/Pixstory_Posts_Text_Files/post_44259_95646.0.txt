Luis Diaz was praised by Jamie Carragher for his outstanding performance in Liverpool FC's 4-0
win over Manchester United at Anfield.

After scoring a goal and setting up another in Liverpool FC's 4-0 win over Manchester United at
Anfield on Tuesday night, Jamie Carragher singled out Luis Diaz for particular appreciation.

The Colombian international joined Liverpool from FC Porto in the January transfer window and
has made an immediate impact on Jurgen Klopp's squad.

When Diaz was found in the area by Mohamed Salah, he tapped in the opener in the fifth
minute, sending Liverpool FC on their route to victory.

Salah then increased the advantage for the home side in the 22nd minute with a close-range
strike.

Liverpool FC started the second half cautiously, but Diaz's low cross found Sadio Mane in the
area, and the Senegal international scored a fantastic first-time finish in the 68th minute to help
the Reds retake control and get the third goal.

Salah added gloss to the scoreline with his second of the night in the 85th minute, when his
dinked finish past David De Gea.

Diaz put up a strong overall performance before being replaced in the 70th minute, and
Liverpool great Carrager praised the January acquisition after he scored the game's third goal.

"It's Sadio Mane who gets the goal, but Liverpool have got a man here [Diaz] â€” a true top
talent," Carragher stated on Sky Sports, referring to footage of Diaz's goal.

Since arriving at Anfield in the January transfer window, Diaz, 25, has scored three goals in
eight Premier League outings.

Meanwhile, Gary Neville, a former Manchester United defender, said he was not shocked by
what he witnessed at Anfield from his old team.

"Liverpool are obviously in terrific form, so it was always going to be a challenge." At this point in
time, Manchester United is a shattered team.
