Sleeping is essential for our health and knowing the correct way to fall asleep early is even more critical.
You may have heard about some tricks to help you fall asleep. For example, you don’t have to count sheep—you could try counting slowly to 100. Also, some people find that playing mental games makes them sleepy. For example, tell yourself it is 5 minutes before you have to get up, and you’re just trying to get a little more sleep.
Some people find that relaxing their bodies puts them to sleep. One way to do this is to imagine your toes are completely relaxed and your feet and ankles are completely relaxed. Then, work your way up the rest of your body, section by section. You may drift off to sleep before getting to the top of your head.
Use your bedroom only for sleeping. After turning off the light, give yourself about 20 minutes to fall asleep. If you’re still awake and not drowsy, get out of bed. When you feel sleepy, go back to bed.
