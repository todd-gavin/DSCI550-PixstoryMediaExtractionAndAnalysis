Bipolar disorder (Manic Depressive) is a mental illness characterised by persistent and/or unusual mood swings that can impair a person's quality of life.

If you suffer from it, do not worry you are not alone. Here is a list of five celebrities who suffer from the disorder. 

1. Demi Lovato: The singer was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when she entered rehab at the age of 22. She had struggled with bulimia, drug addiction, and cutting prior to her diagnosis.

She has chosen to use her celebrity to help eliminate stigma and advocate for treatment, taking part in the "Be Vocal: Speak Up for Mental Health" campaign in 2015.

2. Mariah Carey: The singer claims she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder for the first time in 2001. In an April 2018 interview with People magazine, she revealed her diagnosis and stated that she now feels she is in a good place in terms of managing her mental health.

3. David Harbor: Stranger Things actor Finn Wolfhard was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after having a manic episode at the age of 25. On Marc Maron's podcast, the actor stated that he believes his mental health is linked to his early interest in spirituality.

4. Carrie Fisher: Our beloved Princess Leia battled drug and alcohol addictions. It is difficult to diagnose bipolar disorder in someone who has a history of substance abuse. After a year of sobriety, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 29.

5. Frank Sinatra: The American singer, actor, and producer was one of the twentieth century's most popular and influential musical artists.

He sold over 150 million records, was a Las Vegas headliner, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in From Here to Eternity. 

"Being an 18-karat manic depressive and having lived a life of violent emotional contradictions, I have an over-acute capacity for sadness as well as elation," Sinatra was quoted as saying.
