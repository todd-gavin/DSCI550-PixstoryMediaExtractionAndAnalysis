One of those titles you’ve probably seen floating around in the past decade with the qualifier “critically acclaimed,” Jack Irish — both in its original film incarnation and in its latter-day TV one — is a perennial hard-boiled favorite. 

Adapted from Peter Temple’s Jack Irish novels and starring Guy Pearce as the titular ex-lawyer turned private investigator/debt collector, the series revels in sending the hard-knock Irish tumbling through the darker corners and meaner alleyways of modern-day Melbourne in pursuit of conspiracies, cons, and downright bad dudes. 

A “pretty blokey show,” to hear one professional Irish devotee describe it, Jack Irish might not act like it’s interested in being everyone’s cup of tea (or rather, pint of the prince of Prussia’s finest), but the rough-and-tumble contemporary-noir genre has fans in every corner. If you count yourself among them, maybe give Jack Irish a look.
