On Sunday, Bulgaria will host Georgia in their second UEFA Nations League group stage match
at the Stadium Ludogorets Arena.

The host squad will attempt to bounce back from the draw with two more games left this month.

Meanwhile, Georgia will go to Razgrad hoping to build on their recent victory.

Georgia vs Bulgaria: Prediction

You had to expect a comeback from Bulgaria after such a poor outcome earlier this week.

That
is not to suggest that it will be sufficient, and our entire support goes to Georgia, who are
beginning to appear like a force in the race to qualify for Euro 2024.

Prediction: Georgia 2-1 Bulgaria
