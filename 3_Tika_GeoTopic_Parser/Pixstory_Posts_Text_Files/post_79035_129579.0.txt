Arsenal travel to newly promoted side Bournemouth, with 3 points absolutely essential, in the Saturday 5:30 kick off. With the chance to achieve maximum points from out first three games, the antithesis of last season, Mikel Arteta’s side cannot afford to take their foot off the gas. Here’s the lineup I would field to give us the best chance of winning:
 
Formation: 1-4-3-3
 
GK – Aaron Ramsdale
LB – Oleksandr Zinchenko
CB – Gabriel Maghalaes
CB – William Saliba
RB – Ben White
 
DM – Thomas Partey
Left #8 – Granit Xhaka
Right #8 – Martin Odegaard
 
LW – Gabriel Martinelli
ST – Gabriel Jesus
RW – Bukayo Saka
 
A rather unexciting and very predictable lineup, but why attempt to fix something that is not broken? Consistency is key in football, and having the ability to field a fixed first XI for the opening stretch of the season is a privilege that should not be underestimated.
That being said, I do understand the argument that Tomiyasu should come back in – and if that does materialise, I would not be disappointed. Don’t get me wrong, Ben White has done an excellent job filling in at right back, but ultimately it is not his best position. A Tomiyasu return, however, would cause selection problems in the centre of defence. Saliba, Gabriel and White are all top options to have, and we should feel lucky to have them, but ultimately one of them will have to miss out.
That’s why, for now at least, I’m happy for Arteta to stick with the side that has taken 6 points from 6 so far this season. I am, however, hoping he starts to give the likes of Nketiah, Lokonga, Vieira and Smith Rowe more minutes off the bench. We want to see them come on after 65 minutes, not 80. Give them a chance to earn a starting place.
 
Let me know your thoughts on my lineup, and any changes you would make!
