Sasuke is the epitome of the ultimate emo kid who you want to punch in the face, simply because he is too emo. For those who have not seen Naruto, suffice it to say he is that whiney punchable junior in your office who thinks he is cool, but is in reality is the total opposite.
 
Sasuke is the dude seen wearing the blue shirt and has black spiky hair. For those who have seen the anime, not knowing Sasuke is a piece of good luck they don’t have. Why am I blasting Sasuke, or Sausage as I like to call him right now? Well that is because I tried to re-watch Naruto Shippuden a few nights ago, and the moment I saw 16 year old Sausage I wanted to pull my hair out, I had to immediately shut it down.
 
Masashi Kishimoto was clearly inspired to create Sasuke from Vegeta, when he wrote Naruto though just how, what and why did he ever think that a whiney little kid could ever match the glory of the prince of all saiyans as the greatest antihero ever.
 
 While the story of Naruto is nowhere close to DBZ it is enjoyable, and Sasuke was not even that much of an emo kid in the first Naruto series when he was a kid. Don’t know what Kishimoto was smoking when he decided to turn a decent enough character into the most annoyingly horrible piece of trash I have ever seen in a manga.
 
 Fortunately, though he at least he was redeemed in Boruto, somewhat since I never could bring myself to finish that borefest .
 
“Oh Naruto, you never knew your family, my family was killed by my older brother. I am so much more hurt and emo with my serious gaze.” Oh please!
 
This is something that has been played to death, that and the forced similarities he has with Naruto. For those who want to defend this punchable emo, just don’t. Bottom line, Naruto is a good show despite its many plot holes and writing problems, though its biggest problem is Sasuke.
