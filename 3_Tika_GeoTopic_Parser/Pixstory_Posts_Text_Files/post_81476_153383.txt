Ahead of one of this season s biggest tests against Liverpool Mikel Arteta spoke to the press about our opponents our start to the season and the positive transformation of the club over the past couple of years Here is everything he had to say Again it s another really exciting game to play against one of the toughest opponents in this league It s going to be a really demanding match and it s gonna require us to be at our best again Every game is the same Obviously it s a big match It s a fixture that everybody s looking for against an opponent that has shown in the last five or six years the level that they have And we have to show those opponents again that we have reached the level and we are ready to compete against them I m very conscious that we can get much better than where we are today And not only that we have to do better to be a team that wants to win and the challenge now is to do that every three days We will have more news tomorrow We have another training session and we will know more tomorrow Well we know that the fixtures that we ve been given have no precedence in this league because of the World Cup and with everything that we have to play in between And then every team is different every squad is different And if you start to risk you make the situation much worse If everybody s available and you have robot players that can play every three days life is much easier So it s something that we have to experience and test because at the moment we don t really know how it s going to play out
