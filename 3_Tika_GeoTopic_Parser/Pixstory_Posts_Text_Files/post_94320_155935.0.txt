On 15th October (yesterday), the last set of Matchday 2 matches for Group C and Group D took place in the ongoing U-17 Women's World Cup and we witnessed a number of encounters. While the results of the Group D matches provided more clarity regarding which two teams will qualify for the next round, the Group C matches just complicated things and everything now depends on Matchday 3. Let us now discuss last night's matches and see how they affected the points tables. 
Let us talk about the Group D matches first. France took on Tanzania in a thrilling encounter in the first match. Tanzania got a 2-0 lead and after France scored their first goal in the 77th minute via a penalty, it seemed like they had a real chance of drawing the match. However, Tanzanian players showed real conviction and defended well. Despite being reduced to 10-men in the 90th minute, they maintained their structure. With this win, Tanzania rose up the the second spot on the Group D points table. A draw in their last match against Canada will now be enough for them to secure qualification. France on the other hand, are placed third with 1 point. 
In the other match, Japan thrashed Canada 4-0 to remain table toppers with a perfect record. Canada, on the other hand, are at the very bottom of the table with 1 point. Japan have already qualified for the knockouts.
Let us now move on to the Group C matches. Firstly, Columbia beat China unexpectedly by a 2-0 margin. On the other hand, Mexico beat Spain by a narrow 2-1 margin. As a result, all the teams of Group C now have 3 points each and thus they have an equal chance of qualifying. Everything will now be decided in the last Matchday, i.e, in their last group stage match of the tournament.
