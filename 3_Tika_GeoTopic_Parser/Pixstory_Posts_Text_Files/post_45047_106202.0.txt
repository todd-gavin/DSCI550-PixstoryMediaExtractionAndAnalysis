The Belgian striker continues to be linked with a move back to Italy but the Blues
advisor expects him to stay at Stamford Bridge. Romelu Lukaku has been backed to
succeed at Chelsea next season by club legend and advisor Petr Cech, despite the
striker’s desire to leave this summer.

Lukaku rejoined Chelsea from Inter for a club-record fee of 122 million dollars last summer but has been tipped to return to San Siro after a disappointing first year back at Stamford Bridge.

Cech, however, has suggested the 29-year-old will remain with the West London side, highlighting that his struggles with injury and Covid-19 explain his poor performance throughout the 2021-22 campaign.

What did Cech say about Lukaku?

“I believe Romelu Lukaku will have a great season,” Chelsea’s technical and
performance advisor and former goalkeeper told Sky Sports News.

“Last season we saw how strong he can be when he came. Unfortunately, the long term injury he sustained against Villa showed everything down and then he had Covid-19 as
well.

“We could see towards the end of the season when Romelu Lukaku was fit and ready to
go how strong he is. We had a peculiar season with the Covid-19 issues around
Christmas.”

Will Lukaku leave Chelsea?

A report has mentioned that the Blues are willing to let Lukaku leave on loan ahead of
the coming season. Inter are the favourites to land him again but are reluctant to pay a
large fee to sign him outright.

The Nerazzurri would have to pay around 27 million dollars to get him on loan, while Belgium International is willing to accept a significant pay cut to escape the Stamford
Bridge club.

Lukaku, who returned to Chelsea, last year after two years at Inter made 44
appearances for Thomas Tuchel’s team the last term and scored 15 goals.
