Blue heaven eyeliner is one of the best eyeliner that I have tried till now The best part about it is that it does not smudge like other eyeliners It is not too light and not too dark it has a perfect shade which is another good thing about it Very smooth and silky liner The quality is really good and in terms of money it is cheap and best I love the small bottle and also the smooth texture of it Loved it
