Akshay Kumar’s Raksha Bandhan will now release on 11th August this year. Aamir Khan’s Laal Singh Chaddha is already slated to release on the same date. While the stories of both the movies are very much different, the current position of both Akshay and Aamir is almost similar. Both the superstars are desperately looking for a big hit.🤑🤑

When it comes to working Akshay and Aamir follow different ideologies. While Akshay does 4 o 5 movies every year, Aamir mostly does one or two movies in a couple of years. Akki’s last release was Samrat Prithviraj which tanked at the box office whereas Aamir Khan’s last release was Thugs of Hindostan released in 2018 which was a big dud at the box office.🔥🔥🔥

Before Corona pandemic hit the world, Akshay was the biggest superstar in India delivering back-to-back multiple superhits. However, things have changed post-COVID situation. His last few movies, including Bachchan Pandey, Laxmmi Bomb, and more, were a big disaster. The big-budget movie Samrat Prithviraj produced by YRF was made with a budget of 300 crores. But it struggled to recover even the first 50 crores at the box office.📉👎🏻👎🏻😵‍💫😵‍💫

So definitely he will be expecting Raksha Bandhan to do well in the theaters so that at least the tag of superstar stays with him. On the other hand, the trailer and character of Aamir Khan in Laal Singh Chaddha have been mercilessly trolled on social media with many comparing it with the superstar’s earlier character in the movie PK.⁉️⁉️

So when Raksha Bandhan and Laal Singh Chaddha fight it out in the theaters it will be a test of star power for the big superstars Akshay Kumar and Aamir Khan. Yet another flop can make big damage to the standing of either of these stars as Bollywood’s A-listed superstars.🤯🤯
