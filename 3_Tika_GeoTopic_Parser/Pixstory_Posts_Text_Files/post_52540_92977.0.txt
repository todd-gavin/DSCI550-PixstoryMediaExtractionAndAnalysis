The global pop sensation Jennifer Lopez and people's favourite Batman Ben Affleck are one the most decorated and loved couple in Hollywood as well as all over the world. Although they ended up their relationship in 2004 but as they say love never dies, Both of them involved into a romantic relationship again in 2021. And now there is buzz all over as they have been engaged once again. It's always a beautiful thing to find love where you lost it but does that happen everytime? 
In this modern world it is very easy to find attractions and move on from certain situations in life. But a person who has been filling his heart with love and emotions, can never be over someone who he really loved by all his heart and soul. At times, people get separated because of situations and choices. Not because they didn't love someone enough. Even if we part are ways with someone. They are constantly crossing our minds. We can always hate them for their habits, stop liking them for their behaviours, even stop being in touch because of certain toxicity. But we can never stop loving them. There will always be a soft corner for that single person whom you once loved with pure intentions. Maybe it's not strong as it was earlier. Maybe it's faded. But it's not over. We can never truely stop loving someone with whom we share a connection of heart. Even if we don't want to get back again, even if we just want to keep our ways apart. The feelings, the emotions will never die. We will always love them because we never stopped. Thats how Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez found their ideal match in each other once again because they never stopped loving each other.
