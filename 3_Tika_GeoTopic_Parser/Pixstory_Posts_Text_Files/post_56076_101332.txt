Shall I compare thee to a summer s day Thou art more lovely and more temperate Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May And summer s lease hath all too short a date Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines And often is his gold complexion dimmed And every fair from fair sometime declines By chance or nature s changing course untrimmed But thy eternal summer shall not fade Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow st Nor shall Death brag thou wander st in his shade When in eternal lines to time thou grow st So long as men can breathe or eyes can see So long lives this and this gives life to thee William Shakespeare In the sonnet the speaker asks whether he should compare the young man to a summer s day but notes that the young man has personalities that exceed a summer s day He also notes the qualities of a summer day are subject to change and will eventually lessen The speaker then states that the young man will live forever in the lines of the poem as long as it can be read which is a common themes in the Sonnet There is an irony being expressed in this sonnet it is not the actual young man who will be eternalized but the description of him contained in the poem and the poem contains scant or no description of the young man but instead contains vivid and lasting descriptions of a summer day which the young man is supposed to outlast
