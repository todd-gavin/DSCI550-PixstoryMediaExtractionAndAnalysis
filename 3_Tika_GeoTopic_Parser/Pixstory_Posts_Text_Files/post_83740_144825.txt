Okay so here s some relationship advise that I ve just just now figured out And it hurts because you often do things like this wrong especially when you re trying to do them right Similar to the proverb that the road to hell is paved with good intentions When you really love somebody you don t want them to suffer You don t want them to be unhappy or sad And so when you see that they re struggling when they re having a bad day you try to do everything to cheer them up Essentially you re trying to fix them But they don t need activity they need empathy It s like when your partner tells you about a problem they don t want you to fix it They want you to acknowledge that it s a problem So if you start treating them as if they re a problem they ll start feeling like a failure How could I not fix the fact that I m not feeling well They start feeling bad because they do not want you to be unhappy So instead of trying to fix them sit with them Wipe away their tears Say I ll sit with you and hold you until it passes
