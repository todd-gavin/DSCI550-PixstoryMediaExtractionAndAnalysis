Donald Trump raised the idea that he would personally lead a march to the capitol on the following Jan 6. Trump brought it up repeatedly with key advisers in the Oval Office, according to a person who spoke with him about it.

 He wanted a dramatic and artificial moment for the tv that could navigate Republican lawmakers to support his pressure to throw out the electoral college findings showing that Joe Biden had defeated him, the person said.

Trump has conceded his foiled effort to reach the Capitol. “Secret Service wouldn’t let me,” he told The Washington Post in April. “I wanted to go. I wanted to go so badly. Secret Service says you can’t go. I would have gone there in a minute.”

But as Trump repeatedly floated the idea in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6, several of his advisers questioned whether he meant it or to take the suggestions seriously. The senior administration official said Trump put forward the prospect repeatedly but in a “joking manner.”

The chief of staff, Mark Meadows, examined plans to bring Trump to the Capitol with Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) and lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who was directing the campaign’s actions to overturn the election results, according to testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson, a close aide to Meadows.

“I remember hearing a few different ideas discussed between Mark and Scott Perry, Mark and Rudy Giuliani,” Hutchinson said in videotaped testimony to the Jan. 6 committee played during Tuesday’s hearing. “I know that there were discussions about him having another speech outside of the Capitol before going in. I know that there is a conversation about him going into the House chamber at one point.”
