Writers are the voices of conscience More than a thousand of them have signed a letter released by PEN International condemning Russia s war on Ukraine and calling for an end to the bloodshed It is a humane gesture even if it is destined to be ignored However such interventions merit less attention also because they paint the situation in black and white and bound to miss the details Addressing the missive to our friends and colleagues in Ukraine the signatories say We writers around the world are appalled by the violence unleashed by Russian forces against Ukraine and urgently call for an end to the bloodshed Svetlana Alexievich Margaret Atwood Salman Rushdie Orhan Pamuk Elif Shafak and others condemn the senseless war which they say is due to Putin s refusal to accept the rights of Ukraine s people to debate their future allegiance and history without Moscow s interference Their support to writers journalists artists and all the people of Ukraine who are living through their darkest hours would certainly be appreciated More than Russian scientists and science journalists also have penned a similar letter to Putin Their courage is noteworthy though when Putin is not bothered about the censure of the UN General Assembly he is not likely to take heed of the call that peace must prevail More importantly such gestures from well intentioned individuals Nobel laureates and others are bound to miss nuances Today the Ukraine situation presents itself in stark contrasting terms but its back story stretching back over the years was no so In the past the West too erred often In the weeks before the invasion Putin said what coincidentally the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky was also saying that the West led by the US was goading Russia into a war Also But the run up to the war is not an occasion for signed petitions calling for peace When the military action is underway signatories are forced to put nuances aside This is not to question their intentions but to argue that a letter signed by thousand plus people would have no place for on the other hand
