The security of brown women particularly from South Asia and the Middle East have never been much of prime concern in the US While they are marginalized on racial basis because of their ethnic background and un american culture From their bindis to their accent everything has been made into some Halloween costume which is sadly a form of racism we all neglect which leads to further persecution of these women However brown women face much more than that The overlapping oppression from people in the west white people and from men of their own community makes them one of the most marginalized groups in the country One such marginalization tactic is Transnational Marriage Abandonment Transnational abandonment is a type of spousal abuse in which the husbands of marginalized immigrant women leave them in their country of origin The South Asian community and marriages where victims experience marital abuse emotional abuse cultural alienation or financial exploitation are particularly prone to this issue Their dependence and passivity rooted in rigid customs fuel a cycle of violence towards intimate partners or in laws These women lose their legal protections rights to their houses assets and even children after they are purposefully expelled from the United States The worst part about this is how the mainstream media underreports these stories and when they do brown women are barely mentioned The pandemic brought a disturbing surge in these cases We need to make a safer community for south asian women who we often ignore in our activism
