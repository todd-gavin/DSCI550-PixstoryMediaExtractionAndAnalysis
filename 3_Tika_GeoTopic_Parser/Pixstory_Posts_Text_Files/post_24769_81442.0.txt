Paris Saint Germain President Nasser Al-Khelaifi in 2014 said within 1 year. He repeated it again in 2017 when Neymar arrived in Paris. Neymar took the team close to winning in 2019-20 losing in the final to Bayern Munich.


As the Parisians prepare for their Round of 16 tie on 16th February against Real Madrid, who have won the  UCL 13 times, they have a star studded squad including Messi, Mbeppe, Di Maria, Sergio Ramos, Donnarumma Marquinhos etc. As the 67th Champions league season progresses, Olympic Marseille remains as the only French club to win the prestigious UEFA Champions League title in 1993, defeating Milan 1-0. 


Even though the team is at the top of the Ligue 1 table, with a 16 points lead (59 points-24 matches) and just 1 loss, their recent French Cup defeat to Nice brings doubt in the hearts of fans about advancing against European giants. PSG lost in Round of 16 failing to score and losing in penalties 6-5. Fans were missing Neymar, who has been injured since November. Neymar, who just resumed ground practice, is doubtful of playing the big clash. Since his arrival in 2017, Neymar has missed 5 out of 8 round of 16 matches due to injury or suspension. On the other hand, Messi has scored just 2 goals from 14 matches for PSG. Former PSG chief wants Pochhetino to adapt to Messi style of play to get more from the 7 time Ballon D'or winner. 


On the other hand, Ancelotti is bringing a full set team for the match - confident, strong and determined. Vinicius is in top form and an experienced midfield is very effectively performing for the club. 


PSG, who are the most successful club in France with 45 trophies, are yet to add a European title since 1995-96 UEFA Cup Winners cup. But, they have been regular in UCL from 2010-11 season, with 4 rounds of 16, 4 quarter finals, 1 semi final and 1 final. Last season they lost to Manchester City in the Semi Final. 1970 born, 9th valuable club in the World is not expecting anything less than title this season.
