This is my Kabul the city where the walls of honesty and truth joined hands and built a nest with hope and love Kabul is a heart wrenching that has stolen the song of its heartbeats and made its residents homeless a Kabul that even its animals are waiting for peace I see my Kabul drowned in inequality and discrimination Kabul was also my dream city A city where I was excited by its wonders every time I looked at the pictures and listened to its stories One of my fantasies was to live and disappear in the amazing and legendary peace and quiet of this city Kabul From my point of view the province and the city are a dream amazing full of legends and secrets and a symbol of the genius of humanity Seeing your dream city in a heap of sadness inequality and injustice makes your dreams meaningless and makes people suspicious of an equal future and the slogan of equality and brotherhood in this land missing you my home Kabul Afghanistn
