We have all had incidents we regret that happened in the heat of the moment. How can we define heat of the moment? 
Its committing an act without stopping to think about what you are doing or saying, because you are angry or excited. I know what took place last night was out of hurt, we never know what our fellow human beings are going through, but violence can never be justified. Let's refrain from passing judgement and/or negative energy to this incident and instead send positive and healing energy while making it a teaching moment for our youth on how to better handle an uncomfortable situations.
