First off I enjoyed Maze Runner the movie quite a bit nbsp It s got a great pace stunning visuals and strong performances all around but there are some significant differences between the book and the film and simply put the book does it better nbsp One of the biggest challenges of adapting a book to film is condensing it and more so than ever when you re working with a narrative that goes down in a brand new environment like The Glade Not only did director Wes Ball have to develop a Glade full of multidimensional characters but he also had to set up a brand new world and convey the rules that govern it nbsp The situation is actually pretty straightforward there are kids trapped in a maze and they have to figure out how to get out but then you re wondering why are they there nbsp Who put them there nbsp What s going on in the outside world nbsp It isn t easy answering those questions in less than two hours and that s where the movie pales in comparison to the book but there are other elements that are strong enough to make The Maze Runner one of the more successful YA adaptations we ve got nbsp Hit the jump for the ups and downs of the adaptation process I just feel he went a bit softer on certain elements rather than polishing them a bit more So like the general rule the book is better than the movie adaption
