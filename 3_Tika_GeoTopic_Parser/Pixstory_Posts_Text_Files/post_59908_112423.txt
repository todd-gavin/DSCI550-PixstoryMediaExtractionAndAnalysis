Prahlad is a devoted follower of the well known Indian deity Amba who is said to have survived for years without consuming In light of this he was kept under constant observation in for days during which time to everyone s utter shock he survived without food or water He showed no signs of hunger even at that point For many people the act of his survival is still a great mystery Daily clinical examinations blood tests and scans were used to study Jani According to reports many CCTV cameras and personal observation were used for hour surveillance According to the researchers Jani was pulled from the tightly closed space for examinations and sun exposure while being continuously videotaped The toilet in Jani s room was sealed to test his claim that he did not need to urinate or defecate and the researchers state that Jani s sole interaction with any type of fluid was when gargling and occasionally taking a bath beginning on the fifth day of observation All medical tests on Jani were reported as normal after fifteen days of observation during which time it is said he did not eat drink or use the restroom Researchers also stated that he was in better health than someone half his age The doctors noted that although while Jani s bladder volume changed and he appeared to be able to generate urine in his bladder he was unable to pass urine The DRDO researchers hypothesised that Jani might be exhibiting an extreme kind of adaptation to fasting and water restriction based on Jani s reported levels of leptin and ghrelin two hormones that are connected to appetite Further studies including inquiries into Jani s body s mechanisms for disposing of metabolic waste products where he obtains his energy for nourishment and how he maintains his level of hydration were claimed to be planned by DIPAS in It was a huge mystery how he is managing without food and drink
