Items allegedly seized from Native Americans killed at Wounded Knee Creek have been recovered from disorganised display cases where they had been kept for more than a century in a rural Massachusetts museum, as reported by USA Today. 

These included moccasins, necklaces, garments, ceremonial pipes, tools, and other!

It was a key step in returning scores of items displayed at the Founders Museum in Barre to tribes in South Dakota that have sought them since the 1990s.

“This is real personal,” said Leola One Feather, of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, as she observed the process as part of a two-person tribal delegation last week. “It may be sad for them to lose these items, but it’s even sadder for us because we’ve been looking for them for so long.”

Well, better late than never I guess!

For tribes, recent initiatives to repatriate human remains and other culturally significant objects, like those at the Founders Museum, mark important and solemn events.
