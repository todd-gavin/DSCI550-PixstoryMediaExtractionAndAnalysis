Zinc and itâ€™s effect on women with PCOS.

Zinc deficiency is more common in women with PCOS than those without the condition. This is especially true in cases of insulin-resistant PCOS. In fact, one study found that zinc levels were the most accurate predictors of PCOS
even more than body mass index (BMI) or cholesterol levels.

Since women with PCOS are  more likely to have inadequate zinc levels, there are some research-based benefits mentioned in the post for using zinc supplements for treating PCOS.

To increase the zinc intake naturally, high zinc fruits like avocados, blackberries, pomegranates, raspberries, guavas, cantaloupes, apricots, peaches, kiwifruit, and
blueberries can be taken in moderation.
