Communal tension broke out in Telangana’s Yadadri Bhongir district on February 22. A group of cow vigilantes clashed with members of the Muslim community at Rachakonda’s Karmanghat area. Telangana Today reported that stone-pelting also took place during the violence. According to The Indian Express, cow vigilantes staged a protest near a temple, demanding the arrest of those allegedly transporting cows illegally. The report added that some cow vigilantes claimed that they were chased and attacked.

In the backdrop of this, a 30-second clip that shows a Hindu man saying in Telugu — “Namaskar… In case the police don’t come on time, our vehicle… [inaudible] I’m making one request brother… Just now those these men came and attacked us. While we were trying to protect gau rakshaks they directly attacked us. CCTV [footage] still hasn’t come out. All of you come to the temple proudly. Jai Shri Ram”, has been shared widely. The video has been shared with the claim that Muslims attacked the Karmanghat Hanuman Temple during the violence. Right-wing propaganda account squineon posted this video on Twitter and gained over 40,000 views.

Temple officials refute the claim
It is worth noting that in the 30-second clip the man doesn’t claim that the temple was attacked. He said that a group of people entered the temple to allegedly attack gau rakshaks. Rachakonda police tweeted a detailed version of the incident. This also doesn’t state that the temple was attacked. It lists the names of seven people who were arrested for allegedly attacking cow vigilantes. As per the police, the purported illegal transportation of cattle was the root cause behind the communal conflict.
