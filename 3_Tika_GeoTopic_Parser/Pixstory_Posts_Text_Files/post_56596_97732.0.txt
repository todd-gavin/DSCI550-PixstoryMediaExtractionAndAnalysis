In Cabramatta, Dai Le is pulled up by locals on a walk through its bustling laneways.

Many just want to say "hello" or have a chat. 

The south-western Sydney suburb lies at the heart of the city's Vietnamese community and forms part of the federal electorate of Fowler, one of the nation's most culturally diverse.

It also takes in other areas, including Liverpool, Warwick Farm and Fairfield East.

According to 2016 Census data, more than 70 per cent of people have both parents born overseas.

About 16 per cent have Vietnamese heritage.

Ms Le, the deputy mayor of Fairfield and a former refugee, is running as an independent candidate in the upcoming federal election.

She said her links to the area would help her campaign.

"When my family came here as refugees from Vietnam, we were resettled in Bossley Park, which is part of Fowler … I've grown up and seen the transition of the city," she said.

"I live and breathe this community. This is my community."

Labor has held the seat since its creation in 1984 and holds it by a 14 per cent margin.

Retiring MP Chris Hayes — who has represented Fowler since 2010 — had backed Vietnamese lawyer Tu Le as his replacement, however, Labor senator Kristina Keneally was parachuted into the safe seat.

Ms Keneally was facing an uncertain future after being unable to rise above third place on Labor's Senate ticket for the 2022 federal election. 

The move was criticised — both within the Labor Party and externally— with Ms Le saying she was disappointed "for herself and for her community".

Ms Keneally relocated to the electorate last year from Scotland Island on Sydney's Northern Beaches.

"This is a diverse community, absolutely. It's one I know well from my time as premier of New South Wales. I've got the experience and the strength to stand up for this community," Ms Keneally said.
