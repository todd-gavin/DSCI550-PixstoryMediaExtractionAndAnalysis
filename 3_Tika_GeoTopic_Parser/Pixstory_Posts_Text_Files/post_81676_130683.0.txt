Vijay spoke also spoke on cancel culture and 'Boycott Laal singh chaddha'trend. He said, "I just think on a film set, other than the actor, director, and actress, there are many other important characters, there are 200-300 artistes working on a film and all of us have staff members, so a film gives employment to many people and is a source of livelihood for many. When Aamir khan sir makes a Laal singh Chaddha, it is his name that stars in the film, but there are 200-300 families that are being provided for. "
He also further added, "when you decided to boycott a film, you are not only affecting Aamir khan you are affecting thousands of families who lose work and livelihoods. Aamir sir is someone who pulls the crowd to the theatres. I am not sure why this boycott call is happening, but for whatever misunderstanding, this is happening, please realise you are not affecting Aamir khan alone but the economy . It is much bigger. "
