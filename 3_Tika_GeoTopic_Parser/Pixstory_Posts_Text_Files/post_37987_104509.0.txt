Paul Pogba will not be extending his contract with Manchester Unted. The Frenchman has played his last game for the Red Devils and his contract is set to end this month. 

Owing to this, Pogba would become a free agent and any club that signs the 2018 FIFA World Cup winner would not have to pay a transfer fee. This is certainly a major boost for any club that is looking to get the Frenchman's services. 

Juventus and Paul Pogba are no strangers to each other. The Frenchman played for the Serie A side in a successful spell between 2012 and 2016. Pogba won four consecutive Serie A titles during his tenure with the club, also helping the Old Lady reach the UEFA Champions League final in 2015. 

The Italian side now reportedly want Paul Pogba back. For this, they have reporedly offered the Frenchman a weekly salary of around €135,000. This totals up to about €8m per year. 

Paul Pogba is yet to make a decision regarding his future as of this time. Apart from Juventus, the likes of Real Madrid and Paris Saint Germain are also interested to sign Paul Pogba. 

Hence it has to be seen what decision the 29-year old makes regarding his future in the coming days!
