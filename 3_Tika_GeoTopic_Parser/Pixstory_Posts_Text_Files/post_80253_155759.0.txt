Supreme Court breaks the order of Bombay High Court:
NDTV post a news on twitter where they had written that 'Academic GN Saibaba to stay in jail in alleged Maoist links case, Supreme Court suspends Bombay High Court's order'. But here we need to remember about those brave security forces and civilians martyred who are in Maoist attacks. By keep this in mind one twitter user cursed to NDTV & have written, 'He is a Maoist who is convicted... By using the words 'Alleged Maoist' or 'academic', you are insulting the brave security forces and civilians martyred in Maoist attacks. He is not alleged but convicted.'
