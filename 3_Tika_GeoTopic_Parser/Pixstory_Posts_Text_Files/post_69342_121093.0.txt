MDr. Noor ul Owase Jeelani, a phenomenal surgeon from Kashmir, is once again making headlines around the world after performing the most difficult surgery to date to separate conjoined twins whose brains were fused. According to accounts in the international media, this operation took place in Brazil. 

Three-year-old twins Bernardo and Arthur Lima were finally separated after a 33-hour operation in Rio de Janeiro that included seven different operations. A vast team of 100 surgeons, engineers, and other personnel participated in the intricate procedure under the direction of Dr. Noor ul Owase Jeelani of the GOSH in London. 

Dr. Gabriel Mufarrej, director of paediatric surgery at the Instituto Estadual do Cerebro Paulo Niemeyer, assisted Dr. Jeelani. For the past 30 months, the twins have been under the care of this institution. 

The procedure was really tiring. The final treatment, which ultimately separated the twins, lasted 17 hours. Dr. Jeeleni claimed that he only took four 15-minute breaks for food and water. But once the surgery was finished, he added, "it was lovely to see the family feeling over the moon."
