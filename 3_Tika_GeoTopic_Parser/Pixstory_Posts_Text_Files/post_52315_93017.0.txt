Cricket is regarded as Australia's national sport. If I'm being honest, I didn't think I'd be the biggest fan if my group decided to go see a professional cricket game. I imagined it would be similar to going to a baseball game, where I would get a hotdog, barely watch the game, and then end the night before all of the innings ended with some ice cream.
The game began with a loud roar, synchronised clapping, and the singing of the national anthem. Cricket is a very different game than sports in the United States, so a group member of mine, who had read "Cricket for Dummies" quickly before arriving, gave me a quick rundown of the rules and how each team could gain points. The crowd roared the first time the Melbourne Renegades did something spectacular, and I just went along with it. As the game progressed, the rules and scoring began to click, and I was the one the other girls on my programme asked about the rules and how the game was to be played. I was usually the first in the group to hold up the red coloured point signs that they distributed, and I could usually predict how many points a batsman would receive for a specific hit.
I was able to interact with the other spectators as well as enjoy and learn about the game of cricket. When the game's rules didn't make sense, those around me ("cricket experts") stepped in and politely explained why or how things happened. Overall, the experience was far from what I had anticipated. Despite the fact that I did get some chocolate covered pancakes, I paid close attention to the game, had a good time, and most importantly, got to experience a big part of Australian sports culture.
