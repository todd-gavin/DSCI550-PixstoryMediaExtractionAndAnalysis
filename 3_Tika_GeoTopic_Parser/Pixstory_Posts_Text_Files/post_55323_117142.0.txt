Ryan-International-School, NCR, believes that “Earth Day encourages us to reflect on what we are doing to make our planet a more sustainable and liveable space.“
To sensitise the young minds to create a greener and cleaner tomorrow, a special assembly was conducted at Ryan International School, Sector 25 Rohini, on the occasion of Earth Day, 22nd April. The assembly started with a prayer, followed by a mellifluous song by the school choir to demonstrate the support and concern for environmental protection. 
The tiny tots of the Ryan garden recited beautiful poems based on the theme “Save Earth.” Students of class 12 expressed their views to motivate the students to come together and get into action in protecting Earth. 
Kuvira of class 2 F inspired everyone by making Eco friendly bricks. Her small contribution to save Captain Planet is a big motivation to each Ryanite. The assembly culminated with the students taking a pledge to value the generosity of our home Earth and create awareness to keep our Earth Clean and Green.
