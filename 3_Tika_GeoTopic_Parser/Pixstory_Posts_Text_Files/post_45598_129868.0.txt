Robert Zemeckis and Eric Roth collaborated on the comedy-drama film Forrest Gump, which was released in 1994. 

As movie web points out, truth be told, we can't imagine anyone else starring in the lead role other than Tom Hanks. John Travolta, Bill Murray, and Chevy Chase probably regret passing on the chance to play the titular Forrest. 

The story, which spans several decades, centres on the slow-witted but good-hearted Alabaman Forrest Gump, who unintentionally affects significant American historical events. 

It wouldn't be overstating things to claim that most people have at least heard of the goody two shoes Forrest Gump or have heard a reference to the movie in various pop culture contexts. 

Forrest Gump has established himself as such a It's practically impossible to work in the film industry without coming into some component of this well-established fixture. 

And if the tale somehow failed to move you, you've probably grown accustomed to some of the movie's life maxims, such as "Life is like a box of chocolates" and "Stupid is as stupid does."

Forrest Gump has also been selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. The movie earned six Academy Awards, with Best Picture, Best Actor (for Hanks), and Best Director (for Zemeckis) included.

Needless to say, it is a very prominent movie in the history of cinema!
