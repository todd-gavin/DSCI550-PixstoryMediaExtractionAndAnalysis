Arsenal legend, Martin Keown has disclosed that it is still early to start considering the Gunners as Premier League title contenders.

Keown who praised their 2-1 win over Aston Villa on Wednesday, said it is “ridiculous” to label his former club “title contenders” after just five games.

Mikel Arteta’s men maintained their perfect start to the season with the victory and kept their place at the top of the Premier League.

Keown said he “hopes this is the start of something special”, but says it is too early to consider Arsenal as a genuine threat to defending champions Manchester City.

“It’s step by step with this Arsenal team. It’s so early in the season, it’s ridiculous [to call them title contenders].

It’s a new team but hopefully it’s the start of something special,” Keown said.
