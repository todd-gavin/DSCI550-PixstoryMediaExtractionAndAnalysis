A dating coach has revealed the five words that may be sabotaging a single woman’s chance of finding love.

Louanne Ward, a matchmaker from Perth, says the mantra “I don’t need a man” can actually do more damage than good if you’re looking for a serious relationship.

“Ladies, this is five words you need to stop saying if you actually want to meet somebody and get into a relationship,” she says in her Instagram video.

“Every time you say ‘I don’t need a man’, what you’re doing is you’re putting out there exactly what you’re attracting back.”

The relationship expert agreed that a strong, independent, successful woman can live life without a man.

Ridiculous words

But she quickly pointed out the missing things women actually need from men - like the physical and emotional connections.

“It’s true. You don’t need a man. You earn your own money, you can support yourself, you’ve got your own life. You’re happy,” Louanne said.

“So you might not need a man but you actually need all the things that a man can give you.

“The affection, the support, the love, the laughter, the sex, the caring... So you need all of those things.

“Saying that you don’t need a man is just a ridiculous thing to say.

“You do need him for all the things he can give you.”

No shame

She says there shouldn’t be any shame in wanting a man.

“Start being brave enough to say actually I do need a man for all the things that I can’t give myself,” she said.

“There’s no shame in having a need which is very different than being needy, even if something is getting something that you can’t get for yourself.

She added: “So lose those five words.”
