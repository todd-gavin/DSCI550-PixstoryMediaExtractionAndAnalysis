Ruud van Nistelrooy, a former Manchester United and Real Madrid striker, has been named the next head coach of PSV Eindhoven.
Nistelrooy, who is now in charge of Jong PSV's young team, will succeed Roger Schmidt at the end of the season. 
The Eredivisie club has extended the Dutchman's contract until 2025.
Van Nistelrooy remarked after completing the contract with PSV:
"It has always been my dream to be the head coach at PSV. I've worked intensively with Toon Gerbrands, PSV's current General Manager, the past few seasons."
"I was convinced I could pursue a professional coaching career and originally thought I needed one more year to gain experience. But sometimes things do go their way and you find out that life is not completely manageable. This is the right moment to take the next step," he added.
Between 1998 and 2001, Van Nistelrooy scored 62 goals in 67 appearances for PSV before joining Manchester United, where he won the Premier League, the FA Cup, and the League Cup.
He came to Real Madrid after five years in the Premier League, where he won La Liga twice. After seasons with Hamburg and Malaga, he terminated his illustrious playing career in 2012.
Van Nistelrooy scored 35 goals in 70 internationals for the Dutch team.
Van Nistelrooy coached PSV's Under-19s from 2018 to 2021 before taking over as coach of Jong PSV, the club's reserve team, last summer. Jong PSV is 11th in the Dutch second-tier after winning ten games, drawing six, and losing 14.
