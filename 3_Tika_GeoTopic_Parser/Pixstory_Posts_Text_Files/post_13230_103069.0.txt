You can't see me beautiful, I have ugly moments, times when I fall too short of my ideal way of being, times of stress, times of loosing the connection with the higher divine awareness. However you can see me beautiful, if you make the best version of me as the peminent picture of me in your mind, that is impossible if you do not experience the best version of me, and that is not happening when we do not connect heart to heart. So what I can do is to express my self in way that you can connect with, and you do the same, it will become much easier. A short cut is to discover the best version of yourself and see how hard you try to let it be seen, and still you are not successful most of the time, then you understand others, how hard they try to be seen beautiful, and how beautiful they must be.
