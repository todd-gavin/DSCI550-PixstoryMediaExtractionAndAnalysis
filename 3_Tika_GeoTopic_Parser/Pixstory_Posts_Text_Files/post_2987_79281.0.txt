As Vice President in 2016, Joe Biden launched the Cancer Moonshot, a mission to speed up the fight against cancer. On Wednesday, he reignited the mission setting a new goal to cut cancer death rate by at least 50 per cent over the next 25 years and improve quality of life of those living with and surviving cancer.

At an election campaign rally in Iowa in 2019, Biden had vowed to “cure cancer” if he is elected as president in 2020. Improving cancer care has been his long-time focus as he lost his 45-year-old son Beau to brain cancer in 2015. Some medical experts had raised questions about his lofty goal and termed it aspirational because there are over 100 types of cancer and a single “cure” for them all is most unlikely.

Now he renewed his pledge to fight the disease but in a more pragmatic way and the word “cure” was not used in the agenda. He reminded that cancer is one of the reasons he ran for president and it remains his priority since it’s “still the number two cause of death in America”. In the last two years of the pandemic cancer claimed lives of 1.2 million Americans, far more than deaths due to Covid.

The president urged healthcare administrators to get cancer screenings “back on track and make sure they’re accessible” as nearly 9.5 million cases of cancer were missed in the past two years of Covid-19.  

The renewed moonshot will build a “cancer cabinet” to coordinate between federal departments, various agencies and experts. He urged Congress to fund the new Advanced Research Project Agency for Health (ARPAH), a new autonomous entity within NIH, and appealed to private drug companies to make more affordable drugs. However, no fresh funding commitments were announced.

Despite the president’s ambitious goals, some critics argue that prevention is still the best way to tackle cancer; initiatives to reduce smoking and rates of obesity are sure shot methods to cut cancer death rate.
