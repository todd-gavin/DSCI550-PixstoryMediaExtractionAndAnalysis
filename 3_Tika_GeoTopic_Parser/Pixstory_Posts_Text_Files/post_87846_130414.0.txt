The placebo effect is my favorite science theory. 

The placebo effect is when a person's physical or mental health appears to improve after taking a placebo or 'dummy' treatment. Placebo is Latin for 'I will please' and refers to a treatment that appears real, but is designed to have no therapeutic benefit.

For example, if you're regularly given the same arthritis pill to relieve stiff, sore joints, you may begin to associate that pill with pain relief. If you're given a placebo that looks similar to your arthritis pill, you may still believe it provides pain relief because you've been conditioned to do so.

It’s science’s way of saying, “ it’s all in your head” because truly it might be. To be able to trick your brain into believing the unbelievable, is something even the world of science can’t comprehend.
