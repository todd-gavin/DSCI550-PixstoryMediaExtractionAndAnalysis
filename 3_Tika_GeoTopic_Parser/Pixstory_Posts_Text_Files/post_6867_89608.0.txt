More than 150 religious leaders from 30 countries and a range of faiths came together in London this week, to set six safeguarding principles that aim to protect LGBTQI+ folks from harm, at the 2022 Global Interfaith Commission on LGBT+ Lives Conference.

The conference started with the urgent need to ban the harmful practice of so-called ‘conversion therapy’ which baselessly claims to change someone’s gender or sexuality, and has been found to make LGBTQI+ youth twice as likely to be at risk of suicide.

The principles set by the leaders are:

1. EMPOWERMENT: We believe all individuals are made in the image of God, whom many call the Divine, and should be free to live a life of dignity consistent with their sexuality and gender identity within their faith communities without fear or judgement.

2. PREVENTION: We believe that we have a duty of care towards all LGBT+ people and so we commit ourselves to listen to the experiences of our LGBT+ members in order to identify and eradicate any harmful practice that inhibits the flourishing of us all.

3. PROPORTIONALITY: We recognise that for too long the needs of our LGBT+ members have often been ignored and side-lined, and so we commit to ensuring that LGBT+ people are always given fair voice.

4. PROTECTION: We recognise that many LGBT+ people face significant discrimination, rejection and hatred, and so we commit to work to protect all LGBT+ people from harm, wherever it occurs fu both religous and secular contexts.

5. PARTNERSHIP: We recognise that for too long those of us who are LGBT+ have been excluded from decisions that impact our lives and so we commit to always work in partnership so that together we can work to prevent, detect and report spiritual abuse.

6. ACCOUNTABILITY: We believe that no one is above the law and that there must always be transparency in all areas of safeguarding and so commit to work with our LGBT+ members to regularly monitor progress.
