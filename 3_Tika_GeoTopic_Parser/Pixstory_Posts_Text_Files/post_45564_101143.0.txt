For a new drama about a journalist working in Alaska, ABC has teamed up with actress Hilary Swank and the writer of the 2015 Oscar-winning picture "Spotlight." 

US News reported that "Alaska," a Thursday series, is the highlight of a fall lineup released Tuesday that also features an hourlong celebrity edition of "Jeopardy!" and a heavy reliance on returning favourites. 

Swank will play Eileen Fitzgerald, a "recently humiliated" New York reporter who flees to the north for personal and professional atonement. Tom McCarthy scripted the screenplay, which is based on the Boston Globe's investigation into sexual abuse by Catholic priests.

“Telling stories about journalists as heroes is something that's going to get a lot of conversation,” Erwich said in an interview Tuesday. “It's a very optimistic look at the profession.”
