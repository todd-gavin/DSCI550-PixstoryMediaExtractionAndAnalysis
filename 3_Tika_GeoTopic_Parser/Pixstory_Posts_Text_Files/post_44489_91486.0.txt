After Olga Carmona, Maite Oroz, Kenti Robles, and Teresa Abelleira, the goalie is the team's
fifth player to be renewed.

Misa has quickly established herself as one of the team's most popular players, dazzled fans
with her stunning diving saves and daring movements off the line.

Aside from a rare off-night against Barcelona in the last Clásico, Misa has been the team's most
consistent performer. How she recovers from that performance will reveal a lot about her
resilience and character, but Madrid and the fans appear unconcerned.

Even if the information coming out of Misa's camp indicated that she was totally committed to
Madrid, there was still concern that the contract discussions might fall through. The level of
dissatisfaction with the seeming lack of development reveals a lot about how highly Misa is
regarded by Madridistas and their desire for her to be a long-term fixture at the club.

Mara Isabel 'Misa' Rodrguez, the Spanish goalkeeper, has extended her contract with Real
Madrid until June 30, 2024, according to the white club, which will retain the international player
for the following two seasons.

“We have agreed to extend Misa Rodríguez’s contract until 2024!” The merengue entity
announced through its Twitter account. The Canarian goalkeeper also showed her satisfaction
after signing the extension of the contract.

“Happy to announce my renewal for two more years at the club of my life. With many to continue
fulfilling dreams and goals with this shield, this shirt and our fans. Hala Madrid!”, wrote the
22-year-old goalkeeper, who arrived to Real Madrid last season from Deportivo de la Coruña.
