 Nuclear plants are unpredictable and disastrous Several countries have upcoming decommissioning during and countries are set to have less nuclear power in than they do today While some of these are decommissioning old nuclear plants and do not have new capacity coming up some countries are proactively phasing out nuclear power and shifting to renewables We can take the example of the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident In the months after the accident all nuclear reactors in Japan were shut down indefinitely eradicating the production of almost all of the country s carbon free electricity and about per cent of its total electricity production Naturally carbon emissions rose and future emissions reduction targets were sliced Carbon emissions have subsequently dropped due to the brilliant plan of Japan to switch to renewable energy and propagate energy efficiency It turns out that relying on nuclear energy is a bad strategy for combating climate change It is hazardous expensive and unreliable and vacating it wouldn t bring on climate doom just because the pollution it causes is invisible doesn t mean it is clean Renewable are better because it is good for the economy and doesn t come with a fear of apocalypse Nuclear energy is deflecting attention and investment from the sustainable energy solutions we need
