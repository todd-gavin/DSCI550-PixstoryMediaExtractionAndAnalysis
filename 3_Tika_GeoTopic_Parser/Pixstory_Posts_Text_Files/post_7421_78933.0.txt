Actor Michael K. Williams’ tragic overdose death last year resulted from a narcotics conspiracy carried out by callous drug dealers who knew they were peddling a deadly product, officials said Wednesday.

Four people were charged in Manhattan Federal Court in the death of the popular “The Wire” actor, who died in September from a deadly mix of fentanyl, heroin, and cocaine.

Among those arrested on federal charges of participating in a narcotics conspiracy was Irvin Cartagena, 39, a Brooklyn man accused of selling to Williams the deadly dose of fentanyl-laced heroin.

“This is a public health crisis,” said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams. “And it has to stop. Deadly opioids like fentanyl and heroin don’t care about who you are or what you’ve accomplished. They just feed addiction and lead to tragedy.”

The top prosecutor, who is not related to the actor, vowed to keep the pressure on.

The (Manhattan-based) Southern District of New York and our law enforcement partners will not give up. We will bring every tool to bear. And we will continue to hold accountable the dealers who push this poison, exploit addiction, and cause senseless death.”

Williams, an East Flatbush native who publicly struggled with addiction, was found dead on Sept. 6 in his Williamsburg, Brooklyn penthouse.

Police found a glassine envelope containing drugs inside his apartment, according to sources.
