At the end of the match Igor Tudor in a press conference analyzed the victory for his Hellas Verona against Venice We deserved to win this match even with a few more goals They lasted for half an hour at our intensity us nineties When there was to be inside we weren&#39;t there for the match They didn&#39;t create any chances except from set pieces I congratulate the lads they tell me we&#39;re safe I have to believe it Now I hope to win as many games as possible You have to try to win in Florence as well as with Napoli We have to base ourselves on performance also because the last few games are always very difficult everyone is fighting for something It seems we are somewhere in between but not so I want to win even when I play cards with my daughter I am there but I also think the players I think there will be no problems and I we&#39;ll sit down we&#39;ll work in the same way Then we&#39;ll see what we collect There will be good matches with teams fighting for the Scudetto this is an extra stimulus Facing these teams in such a positive moment because you definitely want to win We haven&#39;t missed any matches with the big names Today was also a question mentality if you concede goals it becomes a different game I liked the fact that they were all in They are good they run a lot but then we went out because we were better
