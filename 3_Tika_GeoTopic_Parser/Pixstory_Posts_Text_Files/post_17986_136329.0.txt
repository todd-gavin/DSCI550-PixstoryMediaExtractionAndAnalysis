Timothee Chalamet is making a fashion statement on the red carpet at the 2022 Venice Film Festival!
The 26-year-old Oscar-nominated actor wore a backless red outfit while attending the premiere of his new film Bones and All on Friday night (September 2) in Venice, Italy.
Timothee was joined at the event by co-stars Taylor Russell, Chloe Sevigny, and Mark Rylance, as well as director Luca Guadagnino.
Bones and All is based on the novel of the same name by Camille DeAngelis. It follows a woman on a cross-country trip as she searches for the father she’s never met in an attempt to understand why she has the urge to kill and eat the people that love her.

Luca recently responded to people connecting the movie to his Call Me By Your Name star Armie Hammer, who has faced cannibal headlines recently.
