I’ve watched over 40 or so K-dramas and they completely shook my world. These dramas have the potential of taking control over someone’s life so effortlessly that it makes one question, how did I not know about them earlier? It’s not just the pretty and handsome actors but just everything that makes k-dramas a force to reckon with, from the country and its language to the storyline and so much more.Today, the Korean Wave with K-pop and K-dramas as it’s drivers has taken over the world, making South Korea a hub of economic and soft power. If you delve deeper, it’s interesting to note how such a small country(geographically) has had such tremendous growth in all respects- social indicators and GDP per capita- in such little time as compared to the US or UK.
