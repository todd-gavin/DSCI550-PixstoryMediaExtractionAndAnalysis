The offensive midfielder's latest artwork has sparked a debate on the internet. Emile Smith
Rowe, an Arsenal kid, has attracted attention for his new tattoo, but perhaps not in the way he
had wanted.

The midfielder's most recent piece features a lion beneath a cracked clock with Roman numerals. However, the 21-year-new old's tattoo has sparked some debate among followers,
who believe they have noticed an error.

Smith Rowe's newest tattoo appears to have a typo in the Roman numerals at first inspection.
The clock features 13 numbers instead of 12, and the number four is written as IIII rather than
the more common IV.

The tattoo appears to have been inspired by the cover image of a Nancy Drew point-and-click
adventure game called 'Secret of the Old Clock.' Despite this, many fans have criticised the design on social media, with some even asking for Smith Rowe to seek recompense from the
tattoo artist.

Furthermore, social media pictures showcasing the body art appear to have been erased, leading fans to wonder if the Gunners star is dissatisfied with the finished product.

Arsenal lost for the third time in a row in the Premier League, losing 1-0 against St Mary's to
drop to sixth place in the table. When you thought things couldn't get much worse.

Arsenal came to Southampton on Saturday in what appeared to be the last chance saloon in the
race for the top four after two consecutive defeats in the Premier League.

 Tottenham's shock
defeat at home to Brighton in the midday kick-off, however, has thrown the door open for Mikel
Arteta's team to qualify for the Champions League once more. With time running out, it was a
risk they couldn't afford to pass up. Instead, they fluffed their lines once more.
