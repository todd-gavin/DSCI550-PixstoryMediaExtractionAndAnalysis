I truly believe that from an early age just like my mom did we as parents need to show our children What eating right looks like so that they can imitate it setting their nutritional foundation for life These are often advertised tips that I wouldn t pass onto your children Eating fat is bad for you Fruit juice is a healthy drink Cook with vegetable oils instead of fats Butter is bad rather use margarine Whole grain food is good for you You need to eat meals a day the worst thing to do You must have breakfast Don t eat if you not hungry That is key If you hungry in the morning protein first Most of us only get hungry around listen to your body Don t eat carbs at night Yes avoid processed carbs but healthy carbs are NB Sweeteners are healthy as they don t raise insulin In fact they do just that and make for craving more sugar Calories are everything This is so wrong their bodies need nutrients so focus on this and their health instead I can out exercise my bad diet Exercise is crucial for health but they must focus on enjoying it Encourage them to be consistent and rather resistant training vs treadmill workout Also focus on NEAT non exercise activity such as play walks outdoor activities that are fun This saying comes to mind do as I do not as I say Lead by example parents
