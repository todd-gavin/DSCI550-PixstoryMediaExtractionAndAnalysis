Romantic Dark label Women Female Label Arts distribution Artist First ISOTTA&#39;s debut album available digitally starting from tracks in which the Tuscan singer-songwriter recounts her life human bonds daily difficulties fragility violence in all its forms At the same time it will be in radio rotation the fourth single from Psicofarmaci with the participation of Claudia Gerini off-screen voice A record in which ISOTTA pours all her feelings and moods What I write appears to me like a flash the author explains not the fruit of the conditioned mind but the my most sincere and spontaneous part to speak that often so obscure and hidden from me but essential to express the deepest emotions I sing words that hit me like lashes and shake me leaving me breathless seemingly meaningless and on this drive I write my songs Writing cathartic and through words I want to free myself from every inner trap that suffocates and holds me back it&#39;s me who belongs to my music not vice versa I struggle to gain courage every day maybe only so I can really know who I am It takes more courage to have courage and today never the day to surrender
