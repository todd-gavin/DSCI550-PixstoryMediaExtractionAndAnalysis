WHEN it comes to expressing feelings of love, finding the right words can be tricky - so a heart emoji can do all the talking for you.

The white heart symbolises purity and love

Meaning
The white heart can be used to show a pure love, which cannot be destroyed.

Use
This heart could be used to represent a parent's love for a child, or a love that will stand the test of time. You can send this to close family, but would avoid sending this emoji to someone you've just met.

Quite recently I came across a poet expressing his opinion on the idea of ‚Äú safed ishq‚Äù which means ‚Äú white love‚Äù, love which knows no dirt, and is so pure and so unconditional. Ever since the white heart ü§ç has all of my heart.
