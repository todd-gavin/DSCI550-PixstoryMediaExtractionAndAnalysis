Ancient grains for new healthy products is the project by the ISA and Ipsp of the National Research Council with the involvement of Irpinia companies which, starting from the experimentation on Carosella Risciola and Saragolla seeds, intend to enhance the flours obtained from varieties of grains widespread in the past The greatest advantages content of fiber and polyphenols remarkable antioxidant activity high presence of amylose which contrasts degenerative pathologies The results were presented today at Citt della Scienza in Naples Greater content of polyphenol fiber and a higher antioxidant activity than commercial counterparts These are some properties of the flours obtained from the ancient Carosella Risciola and Saragolla cultivars obtained from primary Irpinia companies using sustainable protocols drawn up by the National Research Council as part of the project Ancient grains for new welcome health products presented today in Naples at the City of Science partner of the initiative The production of cereals obtained in the first year from experimentation about tons in total on the farms are interesting above all for the soft wheat and the Risciola and Carosella varieties which have exceeded the quintals per hectare without the use of fertilizers and weeding This is an important result because Italy imports its needs of soft wheat from foreign countries especially France and Hungary The challenge of the scientific activity of the Cnr is to enhance agricultural biodiversity by focusing on healthy products as a driving force for the local economy The project coordinated for the scientific part by Maria Grazia Volpe of the Institute of Food Sciences of Avellino Cnr Isa with the participation of the Institute for the sustainable protection of plants Cnr Ipsp and the involvement of eight Irpinia companies represented by the leader Ottavio Lucifero owner of one of the main cereal companies in Campania We are talking about ancient grains but surprisingly it is a very modern project as it deals with such as environmental sustainability, food education and food health, said Ottavio Lucifero
