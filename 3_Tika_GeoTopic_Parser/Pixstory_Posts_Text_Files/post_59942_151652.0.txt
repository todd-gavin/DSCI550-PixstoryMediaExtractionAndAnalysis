Sambo Lapung of Arunachal Pradesh, the new gold medalist in the men's 96 kg division, uses weightlifting as a means of independence from his boxing coach Rupak's beatings and the bloody noses he gets after each bout at the Sports Authority of India's Naharlagun facility.
Lapung won the gold medal for his overall effort of 346 kg, which included the 198 kg record in the Clean and Jerk. For the upcoming season, he intends to use that as a launch.
