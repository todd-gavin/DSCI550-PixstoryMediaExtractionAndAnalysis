If I have to recommend one book to everyone it would be Human Kind A hopeful history by Rutger Bregman In many ways this book is like a lifeboat the world needs now more than ever in such turbulent and disturbing times when humans are each other s biggest enemies It makes you see humanity from a whole new perspective one that is not stained with hatred It challenges the fact that humans by nature are bad Do try to get your hands on it and share your views
