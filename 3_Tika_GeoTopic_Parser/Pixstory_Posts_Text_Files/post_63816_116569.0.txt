 Based on Valve's popular DOTA 2 video-game franchise ‘DOTA: Dragon’s Blood’ is returning to Netflix with its third season ‘DOTA: Dragon’s Blood’ Book 3 on August 11. Designed by Studio Mir, Netflix released the new trailer for Book 3 of ‘DOTA: Dragon's Blood’ on its official YouTube Channel, and while fans have been eager for season 3 of Dragon Blood, it seems they’ll have to wait a while longer for any more information.

 Regarding the new season, Netflix has shared the following description: "A conflicted yet courageous Dragon Knight must use the power of the dragon within to stop a deadly demon in this epic fantasy based on the online game."  
The video game franchise of DOTA, standing for Defense Of The Ancients, first arrived on the scene in 2003 and has since then blown up to become a full-fledged gaming juggernaut . The third season of the animated series hasn't been confirmed to be its last, so there might be more magical adventures coming to fans of the franchise on the streaming service.

 DOTA isn't the only video game adaptation that is making waves for Netflix, as Castlevania is set to return with a new series with the title of ‘Castlevania: Nocturne’. Before that we also saw season 2 of The Witcher based on the Andrzej Sapkowski novels which led to a highly successful gaming franchise by CDProjektRed while new animated adaptations of Far Cry and Devil May Cry are currently in the works.
