Konstantinos Mavropanos’ loan move from Arsenal to Stuttgart will be made permanent in a 4.5 million euros deal, this summer. 

The Greek defender has spent his last two seasons with Bundesliga outfit, who dramatically sealed their top-flight status for another season with a last-minute goal against Cologne. 


Reports have suggested a permanent move to the Mercedes Benz Arena for the 24-year-old was dependent on Pellegrino Matarazzo’s men staying in the top division of German football. 

There are certain reports as well that claim that an obligation to buy if Stuttgart secured their Bundesliga status was written into the loan contract, the German side had already told Arsenal weeks ago they wanted to complete a permanent regardless of where they finished. 

The report adds that Stuttgart- who paid an initial loan fee of five hundred thousand euros to sign Konstantinos will now fork out another three million euros, with bonuses worth upto another one million euros. 

The fee is considered low due to the attention the Greece international has received since moving to January, with Borussia Dortmund and West Ham United reportedly having kept track of him. 


Konstantinos joined Arsenal in 2018 from PAS Giannina in his home country as one of the first signings under former head of recruitment Sven Mislintat. 

However, despite initially impressing Arsene Wenger- notably in the 2-1 defeat at Manchester United in 2018 Kostantinos struggled for game time at the gunners partly due to injury. 

Having played just nine matches for the Gunners, he spent the second half of the season 2019-20 on loan in the 2. Bundesliga with Nurnberg, before moving to Stuttgart in summer 2020. 


It is there, that he has excelled, featuring in 55 games during his two-year loan spell and scoring five goals in the process. 


Marseille has expressed an interest in keeping the 21-year-old, while Atletico Madrid are said to be among several top clubs tracking him.
