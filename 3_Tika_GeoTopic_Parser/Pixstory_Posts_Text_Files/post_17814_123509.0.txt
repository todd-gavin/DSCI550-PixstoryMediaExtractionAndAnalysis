Beyoncé's Renaissance debuts at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart (dated Aug. 13) with 2022's highest week by a woman - and the year's second-largest week overall - as the set earns 332,000 equivalent album units in the United States in the week ending Aug. 4, according to Luminate.

It's noteworthy that Renaissance, Beyoncé's seventh No. 1 solo album, is the first female-released record to top the Billboard 200 in 2022. Adele was the last female number one with 30, and she held that position for the first six weeks on the chart (charts dated Dec. 4, 2021-Jan. 8, 2022). Notably, Renaissance was issued through Parkwood/Columbia whereas 30 was distributed by Columbia Records.

Beyoncé's seventh solo studio album, Renaissance, is her first since the highly lauded Lemonade in 2016. She and her husband Jay-Z collaborated on The Carters' Everything Is Love (2018), published Homecoming: The Live Album, and provided the vocals for The Lion King: The Gift soundtrack since then (both in 2019; all three reached the top five of the Billboard 200). In addition, every one of her seven solo studio albums since Dangerously in Love in 2003 has debuted at number one (excluding her work with Destiny's Child).
