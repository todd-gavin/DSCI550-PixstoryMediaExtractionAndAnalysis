A decision was made before the independence of our country and the decision was that the Indian flag must be acceptable to all community and parties. Earlier charkha was drawn in the middle of the flagÂ  later it was replaced by Ashok Chakra. Ashok Chakra represent the eternal wheel of law. The saffron colour is always on the top. One should never use the National Flag for our household works like covering tables. The national flag of India is the pride of our nation. We feel very happy when we see a national flag flying. It deserve respect of every citizen of India. It is also called 'TIRANGA'. Every Nation has their own flag like India has also our own flag called Tiranga. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³
