A salvation that now seemed compromised was suddenly back within reach for Cagliari Engaged on the field of mister Alessandro Agostini&#39;s already relegated Venezia l had his destiny in his own hands thanks to the great success of Udinese on the Salernitana field The Sardinians for not they have gone beyond what condemns them to Serie B Agostini has not hidden his bitterness I certainly experience the biggest disappointment of my life represented by not having managed to obtain salvation with these colors I am very sorry and regret it went perhaps in the worst way and we can no longer do anything we had to get the result we needed on the pitch today we didn&#39;t make it despite trying until the last minute I apologize to the fans to our people as a coach I take responsibility for not being able to save us
