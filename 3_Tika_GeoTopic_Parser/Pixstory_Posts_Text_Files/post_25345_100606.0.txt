I just said that I'm not a foodie in the last post but here I am posting another one, but hear me out peeps. I know its not healthy that's why it is my guilty pleasure, during my periods, ice cream is a treat not just to my stomach, but to my soul. Too much of an exaggeration probably but it is what it is.
