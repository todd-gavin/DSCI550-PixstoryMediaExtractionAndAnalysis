You're worthy at every age, you're beautiful with every wrinkle. This whole concept of "anti ageing" makes me uncomfortable. Why do we want to look younger than we are? And most importantly, why is it that women are primarily the target of such products?
While both men and women are affected by ageism, women face greater hurdles when it comes to cultural perceptions of the link between looking youthful and looking beautiful. Many anti-aging commercials are geared toward women, implying that natural signs of ageing are particularly unattractive to men and thus women should be acquiring it. It is weird, don't you think? Just how much the worth of a woman is put on her appearance. On whether she is fat or skinny, fair or dark, old or youthful?
The deeply embedded ageist and gender prejudices that have a negative impact on women's self-perception, leading them to believe they need to acquire anti-aging treatments and products further intact the glorification of feminine youth. Being told you looked younger than you are is a strange type of flattery. A bizarre construct of a praise that we look what are not. The societal importance placed on women's age has made us ashamed of the most human experience ever â€“ growing old.
This needs to be challenged. The idea of wanting women to look younger than they are is misogynist and needs changing.
