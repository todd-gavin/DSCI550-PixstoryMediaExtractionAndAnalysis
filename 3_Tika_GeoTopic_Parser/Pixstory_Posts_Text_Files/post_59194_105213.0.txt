When you're having a very important day like your presentation or job interview or a stage performance having a little makeup on can pull off the day. 

And do you know I read somewhere In a scientific study, researchers put female undergraduate students into different groups, and they were asked to complete a series of tests Before the test, some groups were asked to put on makeup and others werenâ€™t. When the study was concluded, the data results showed that the group that wore makeup performed significantly better than the groups that did not.

Make fun of people for putting on makeup sorry people if you cant pull it off then don't make fun of it.
