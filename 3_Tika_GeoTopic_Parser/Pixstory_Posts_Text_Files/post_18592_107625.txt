The slip in the first round at the Queen&#39;s Club had led to fear the worst for Lorenzo Musetti The injury and withdrawal did not however have serious consequences The MRI did not show any injuries or other serious problems therefore after a little rest he will be able to return to the field E above all I won&#39;t have to miss Wimbledon Today I had an MRI after the fall the other day to see if there were any injuries or other problems but we didn&#39;t find any type of injury Musetti himself wrote on social media I wanted to inform you that I will definitely be at Wimbledon I have decided to skip next week to recharge the batteries a bit and to recover at best The next appointment will certainly be on the London courts In the last few days the classy tennis player had to walk on crutches but it was just as a precaution Just as he will miss the Eastbourne tournament to introduce himself in the best possible conditions at Wimbledon
