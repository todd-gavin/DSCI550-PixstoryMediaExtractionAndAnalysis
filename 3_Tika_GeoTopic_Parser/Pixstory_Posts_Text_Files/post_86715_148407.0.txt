Australia became the penultimate team to qualify for World Cup 2022 after they defeated Peru in a penalty shoot-out in Qatar.
Victory in the inter-confederation play-off against the South Americans meant Australia maintained their record of reaching every World Cup finals since 2006.
However, it was a far from convincing performance in the AFC qualification process as the Socceroos finished third behind Japan and Saudi Arabia in the second stage and then narrowly defeated the UAE to reach the play-off final.
Australia manager Graham Arnold's decision to replace goalkeeper and captain Mat Ryan with Andrew Redmayne just before the shoot-out against Peru turned out to be an inspired one. The Sydney FC keeper saved Alex Valera's final kick to seal victory.
“He's a very good penalty saver and I did something that could affect them mentally,” said Arnold after the match. “They were probably asking themselves the question, 'Why is this guy being brought on, he has to be good'.
“Maybe that was the reason they hit the post. It's a one per cent mental effort to trouble the Peru penalty takers. It was a risk but it worked out.”
In Qatar, Australia were drawn in Group D alongside France, Denmark and Tunisia.
