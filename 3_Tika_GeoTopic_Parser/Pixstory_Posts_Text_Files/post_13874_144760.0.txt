Reminiscing over university days gone by. The stroll from campus via Thandi Sadak, a deodar-covered road towards home, used to make us halt for an evening snack of fresh buns and tea at Verma Tea Stall, popularly known by the appellation "Kewal Ka Dhaba." The scrumptious flavours of buns with maska used to stimulate the body and put an end to fatigue.
Since 1931, Kewal Ka Dhaba has served as the renowned Verma tea kiosk. They sell everything a roadside tea shop sells, including tea, bun-butter, and bun-jam. The simple and basic taste of these fresh buns manages to be the ideal time-pass snack for the majority of locals. Today as well, there are large groups of young university students enjoying their pleasant conversations with a glass of tea in their hands.
It is anticipated that this tea shop, popularly known as "Kewal ka Dhaba," which is situated amid the Chaura Maidan's dense forests, impressed Shimla's former British viceroys. Due to its proximity to the former Viceregal Lodge, now known as the Indian Institute of Advanced Studies, it is reported that the late Lord Mountbatten frequented this kiosk. Today also the stall's famous butter bun and tea entices customers from all around Shimla, keeping it busy from seven a.m. until ten p.m.
