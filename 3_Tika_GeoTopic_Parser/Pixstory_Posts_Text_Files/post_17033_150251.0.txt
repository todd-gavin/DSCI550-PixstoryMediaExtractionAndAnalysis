A few moments back, Priyanka took to the story feature on Instagram and shared a new picture with Malti. In the photo, the Barfi actress can be seen taking her baby daughter on a walk, while she carried her in a stroller. Priyanka looked pretty as she donned a knitted white dress and left her hair open. She wore a pair of white heels to match her outfit and accessorized with a matching bag. Little Malti can be seen dressed in an adorable white dress as well. Sharing the photo, Priyanka wrote, “Just two girls walkin’ 5th av.”
