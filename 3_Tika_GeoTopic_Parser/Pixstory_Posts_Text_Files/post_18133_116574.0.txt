Baz Luhrmann’s “Elvis” topped $100 million at the domestic box office on Friday, becoming one of the rare films without superheroes or dinosaurs to reach that mark. Globally, the Warner Bros. film has made over $170 million, an impressive result for this kind of material.

To be fair, “Elvis” was expensive. The movie which looks at Elvis Presley’s rise to become one of the hottest acts in rock ‘n’ roll, as well as his struggles with drugs and changing tastes, cost $85 million to produce and tens of millions more to market.
