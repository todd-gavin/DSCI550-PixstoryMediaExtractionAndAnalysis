JBS is a name you may not be familiar with. 
But, as ABC News says, you're probably consuming JBS products if you buy Primo ham, Huon salmon, McDonald's burgers, or meat from Coles, Woolworths, or Aldi. 

It's the world's largest meat firm, as well as Australia's, and it's eating our food industry at an alarming rate. 

However, Four Corners disclosed that bribes paid in Brazil and two billionaire brothers eager to breach the law to get what they want were behind the food giant's early expansion in Australia.

JBS was backed financially by the Brazilian government, which Wesley Batista claimed was a "typical financial structure" at the time. However, in 2017, he set off a corruption scandal in Brazil, testifying against top-level connections he bribed. 

Joesley, Wesley, and several of their top employees laid devised a massive operation involving more than 1,800 lawmakers.  JBS' parent firm agreed to pay a $US3.2 billion penalty in exchange for the Batista siblings' immunity. 

Joesley admitted to paying bribes to Brazil's finance minister in exchange for the minister convincing a state bank to support JBS enterprises. This money was used to help pay for the acquisition of Australian Meat Holdings.

An empire built on corruption, it is.
