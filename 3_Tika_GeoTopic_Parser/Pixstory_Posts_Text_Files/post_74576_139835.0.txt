Apart from her film projects, if actress Kareena Kapoor Khan is known for anything - it is her sass. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Be it giving befitting replies to trolls targeting her for giving her sons names of her choice or reacting to her peers’ comments, the actress has never shied away . Actress Kareena Kapoor Khan recently gave a sassy reply on why her son Jehangir Ali Khan, also called Jeh, 'appears grumpy' on camera. 😳😳😳😱😱

Just like his brother Taimur, Jeh also sends the shutterbugs on a photo clicking spree every time he steps out with his parents. He has also been one of the most talked about celebrity kids. Jeh's pictures and videos often go viral on the the internet. 🫠😇

During an interview Kareena was asked why Jeh always appears grumpy on camera. ❓❓❓❓

Kareena replied, "You can ask him that whenever he’s 18 or 20 and if, at all, he’s ready to answer these questions. Maybe, he appears grumpy because he wonders why people keep photographing him." 😳😳😳😳
As the conversation moved ahead, the 3 idiots actress mentioned that it’s paramount that her boys grow up in a household that’s all about equal parenting and they realise that mothers, much like fathers, can be working professionals too. ✅

Elaborating on the same, the 41-year-old actress asserted, “My kids have to understand that because both Saif and I are working parents. And it’s something I’ve always told Taimur. ✔️
I’ve been going to work since he was seven months old. I make it a point to tell him that while on some days, I need to go out, on others, his father has too. It’s something that he has understood and both he and Jeh have to grow to understand that both of their parents work so that we all can have a good life”. 👍👍👍

The star couple got married in 2012. Later, they welcomed their son Taimur Ali Khan in 2016 and Jehangir Ali Khan in 2021👍
