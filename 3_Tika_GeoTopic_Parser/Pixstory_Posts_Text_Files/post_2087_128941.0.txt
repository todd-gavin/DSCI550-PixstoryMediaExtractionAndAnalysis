The death penalty is a contentious issue that seems to have resulted in the majority of first world nations prohibiting it, while the majority of third world countries support it. In the United States, the Supreme Court has ruled that the death penalty may be imposed only in situations of treason and acts in which a victim died, and the victim's death was intended. This decision was made when the Supreme Court considered whether the death sentence could be applied for the rape of a child.
 
Whether or not one agrees with the constraints on the death penalty in the United States, and despite the fact that I favor the death penalty in specific situations, it is easy to see how a very broad application of the death sentence might go awry.

 In many third-world nations, for instance, individuals are executed for quite minor offenses. Even throughout history, there have been instances in which theft, regardless of motive, has resulted in the death penalty.

Although I wouldn't presume that our country will devolve into a third-world country, I would ask you to think about this for a second. Do you believe that a school shooter who murdered children being killed by police is a better outcome than him being prosecuted and imprisoned for the rest of his life - sentenced to die behind bars?  After all, we will all die someday; thus, is it a fairer punishment for someone to suffer and spend their remaining days in a cell and ultimately die in prison? Perhaps your response is no. You may be correct. However, whenit comes to the death penalty, the question we should ask ourselves is not whether they deserve a certain punishment, but what they deserve.
