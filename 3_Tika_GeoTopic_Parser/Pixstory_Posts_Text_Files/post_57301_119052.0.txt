Sugar is a guilty pleasure that most of us enjoy but regret later as we are unaware of the right amount of intake.
With growing age, people pay attention to what they should eat or shouldn't, which is necessary for their well-being.

The problem is not to take sugar but when you take added sugar. 
Too much sugar can have some harmful effects.

Firstly it will make you gain weight quickly. This is because consuming fructose increases your hunger and desire for food more than glucose, the primary type of sugar in starchy foods. Additionally, excessive fructose consumption may cause resistance to leptin, an important hormone that regulates hunger and tells your body to stop eating.
In other words, sugary beverages donâ€™t curb your hunger, making it easy to consume many liquid calories quickly. This can lead to weight gain.

Consuming too much-added sugar increases heart disease risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure and inflammation.
A high-sugar diet may lead to obesity and insulin resistance, risk factors for type 2 diabetes.

A diet rich in added sugar and processed foods may increase depression risk in both men and women. Also, sugary foods can increase the production of AGEs, which can accelerate skin ageing and wrinkle formation.
