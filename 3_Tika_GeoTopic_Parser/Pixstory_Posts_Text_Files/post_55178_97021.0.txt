Australia is blessed with some of the most magnificent natural environments in the world, from the red sands of Uluru to the brilliant blue seas of the Great Barrier Reef and the flora and fauna-rich rainforests, so it's no surprise that Australians enjoy being outside, as official guides say. This love of environment runs deep in Australia's veins and is rooted in the country's past. 

Swimming with whale sharks one month and manta rays the next is possible due to seasonal fauna. Locals, on the other hand, are keen to explore their own backyards. Sydneysiders love sunrise ocean swims, Canberrans like weekend bike rides around the lake, and Perth's King Park is a popular picnic spot.

Moreover, as reports tell us, people from all over the world have lived in Australia's bustling cities and breezy smaller towns, increasing the country's multiculturalism and diversity. Everything they eat, from the food to the celebrations they share, is influenced by Australia's diverse backgrounds, cultures, and communities.

So, whatâ€™s not to love in Australia?
