Almost 14 years back, Germany had proposed Switzerland’s name on a proposed OECD blacklist of tax havens alleging that it was encouraging some German taxpayers to park their money illegally. 

Similar demands are now being made after the Credit Suisse scandal recently brought to light billions of dollars of money laundering by politicians, business persons and others. These demands have risen in the European Parliament that the EU review its relationship with Switzerland and consider whether it should be added to its list of countries associated with a high risk of financial crime.

The European People’s Party (EPP), the European parliament's largest political grouping, has been in the forefront of such a demand. It has said in a statement that bank privacy laws “must not become a pretext to facilitate money laundering and tax evasion.” The group has said that the scandal points to “massive shortcomings” in the Swiss banking system that this should change.

Switzerland has been considering tightening rules for unhindered parking of money in its banking system after a series of scandals that came to light last year, but it is yet to move on the front. According to bankers, Swiss rules only allow directors to be punished only if they are directly involved in wrongdoing rather than lapses in the system.

The recent scandal came to light after an investigation by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), a consortium of 47 media outlets from across the world, and it is based on data from more than 18,000 bank accounts hosted since the early 1940s and until the late 2010s. According to the leaked documents, some of the names in them include the sons of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan’s King Abdullah II, spy chiefs and army generals of authoritarian regimes from various parts of the world.
