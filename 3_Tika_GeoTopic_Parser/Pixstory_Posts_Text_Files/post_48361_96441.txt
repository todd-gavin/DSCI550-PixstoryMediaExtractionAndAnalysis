A birth certificate is an important factor for the transperson as a Birth certificate that does not match their gender identity puts them at the hazard of humiliation discrimination harassment or violence if they are asked to provide their birth certificate What if it is so tricky and difficult to obtain Law in Montana requires a trans person to provide evidence that they went through a surgical procedure to change their sex to modify the sex designations on their birth certificates Currently this law was halted by a state judge This is an important issue to be addressed because every trans person doesn t have the financial capability to undergo surgery also what kind of surgery Many hormonal treatments and surgercies are making the process of issuing birth certificates more complicated Surgery doesn t determine whether a person s sexual orientation This new addition of surgery was included last year by Republican Gov Greg Gianforte when he signed into law SB which required transgender Montanans to undergo a surgical procedure if they wanted to amend their birth certificates sex designations to match their gender identity This bill was sued by transpersons claiming the new law infringes their constitutional right to privacy and due process as well as the th Amendment s Equal Protection Clause They argued that the law was ambiguous and didn t sufficiently describe the types of medical procedures required to satisfy the state s definition of a sex change Hence the court halted the law It s good to see the change in the courts towards lessening the burden on the LGBTQIA community Thanks to the radical judges in the courts
