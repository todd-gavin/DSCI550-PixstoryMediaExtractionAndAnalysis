Arsenal s Norwegian captain and number eight is undoubtedly one of their most important players Against Fulham and Aston Villa he omnipresent always an option to play the ball in to and always finding passes to play to his team mates Odegaard has an ability to keep the ball that only the best possess When surrounded by opposition players he can drag it away slip it through his opponents legs or find a pass through a tiny crevice The midfielder is incredibly intelligent and often sees passes that fans just don t His technique is exceptional and any free flowing attack Arsenal possess usually is down to Odegaard A common criticism of Arsenal s previous attacking midfielder who was similar in ways to Odegaard Mesut Ozil was that the German often chose to find an extra pass rather than shoot Ozil collected tonnes of assists but could ve had plenty of goals too had he chosen to shoot in some of those positions Odegaard has been criticised of similar notably choosing to pass when a shot was on in Arsenal s opener against Crystal Palace However he seems to have taken on those criticisms scoring two against Bournemouth and one against Fulham which clawed the game back for Arsenal Odegaard has showed a captain s mentality for Arsenal in past games and will need to do so again if the Gunners are to win at Old Trafford
