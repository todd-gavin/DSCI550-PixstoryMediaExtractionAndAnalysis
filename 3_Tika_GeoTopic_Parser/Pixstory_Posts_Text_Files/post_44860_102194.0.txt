The Rossoneri secured the first Seria A title in 11 years when they beat Sassuolo in the
final game of the season.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic flipped over a table in the AC Milan dressing room as he gave a
passionate speech after they won the Serie A league title.

Milan beat Sassuolo on Sunday in the final game of the season to secure the Scudetto
for the first time since 2011.

The Swedish striker gathered his teammates in the dressing room to give a speech to
kick off the celebrations.

What did Ibrahimovic say?

“Guys stay calm, I am not about to say goodbye. Guys, from day one when I arrived,
then others arrived afterwards, very few believed in us.”

But, when we understood that we needed to make sacrifices, suffer, believe and work
when happened, we became a group and when you are a group you can achieve the
things we have achieved.

“Now, we are the champions of Italy.”

“First of all, I want to thank all the players.”

“Now, I am talking on behalf of the whole team, we also want to thank Paolo Maldini,
Ricky Massara and Ivan Gazidis.”

“It hasn’t been easy but we have been a real group this season. At the beginning of the campaign, no one believed in us, but through these principles, we became stronger. I
am proud of all of you.

“Now, do me a favour: celebrate like champions because it isn’t Milan that belongs to
AC Milan.”

“Italy belongs to AC Milan!”

Ibrahimovic then flipped the table up, sending the players into some wild celebrations.
