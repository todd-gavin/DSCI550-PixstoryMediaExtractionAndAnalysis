Pride is emotional response or attitude to something with an intimate connection to oneself, due to its perceived value. 

Pride is a chance for LGBTQIA+ people to show they are proud of who they are â€“ because in lots of countries it used to be illegal to be LGBT, and in some countries it still is. So by going to Pride events the community gets to celebrate that they can be who they are, and love who they love, without fear that they will be punished for doing so. 

Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) Pride Month is currently celebrated each year in the month of June to honor the 1969 Stonewall Uprising in Manhattan. The Stonewall Uprising was a tipping point for the Gay Liberation Movement in the United States. In the United States the last Sunday in June was initially celebrated as "Gay Pride Day,"
