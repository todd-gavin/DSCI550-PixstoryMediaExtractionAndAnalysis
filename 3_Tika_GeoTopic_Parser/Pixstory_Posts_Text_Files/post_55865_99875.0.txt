We all know what caused the Ukrainian Invasion-Russia's Fear of NATO. Finland’s leaders have announced that they will seek NATO membership in reaction to Russia’s war on Ukraine — this is a move that would cause a major change in the military alliance and Europe’s security order and will pose a threat to Russia’s security.


‌The war started by Russia jeopardizes the security and stability of the whole of Europe,” Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto told European lawmakers “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has altered the European and Finnish security environment." Niinisto and Marin said that Finland’s membership in NATO would enhance the entire defence alliance.
‌
‌As Vladimir Putin has referred to NATO expansionism as a reason for his invasion of Ukraine. Finland’s accession to the alliance would double its land border with Russia.
‌
‌The green light from Finnish President Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin is the first step toward a formal application from a country with long-standing military nonalignment. Sweden is considering a similar move, and Washington has said it would strongly support both. 
‌
‌Russia has shortly come up with a statement that defined Finland's move as "a radical change in the country's foreign policy".

"Finland's accession to Nato will cause serious damage to bilateral Russian-Finnish relations and the maintaining of stability and security in the Northern European region," it said.

"Russia will be forced to take retaliatory steps, both of a military-technical and other nature, to neutralise the threats to its national security that arise from this."

Russia is threatening every country that comes against them! Finland and Sweden have shown Russia that they don't fear any of their power play and hence ignore the threats of Russia. This brave move gives NATO a strong move against Russia.
