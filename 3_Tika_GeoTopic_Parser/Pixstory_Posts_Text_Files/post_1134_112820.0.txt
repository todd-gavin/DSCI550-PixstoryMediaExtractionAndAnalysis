Have you ever wondered why men fall asleep fast after sex, while many women don’t?

The link between sex and sleep is one area that has been overlooked by both medical science and researchers for a very long time. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb was a notorious enemy of sleep. He invented the light bulb to stop his employees from sleeping. Edison even deputed security guards to drag people who slept for more than four hours back to work.
Today, research is unanimous that sleep deprivation (less than seven hours) can lead to a host of neurological and sexual disorders, including dementia, cognitive decline, stroke, erectile dysfunction and even infertility. In this video, I take a look at how better sleep and can lead to better sex and better sex to better sleep, and most importantly, why so many women struggle to sleep after sex.
