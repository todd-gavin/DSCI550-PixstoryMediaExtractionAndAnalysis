There are substantial long term impacts from the gender pay gap for faculty at Canadian universities Recent research from our multidisciplinary team which includes expertise in equity policy political science and cognitive science with mathematical modelling shows that over the course of a career and retirement this pay gap leads to a difference of roughly half a million dollars The gender pay gap for faculty in Canadian universities is significant and persistent Women professors earn on average per cent or per year less than men for the same work This gender pay gap can result from bias in determining starting salaries and subsequent merit pay from differing rates of promotion and from the punitive effects of parental and caregiving leave Focusing solely on pay differences however leads people to underestimate the long term financial consequences of gender inequities as the pay gap also has implications for pensions Case study Quantifying the effects of the gender pay and pension gap research not done in over years poses a challenge given the many variables at play To address this challenge our team used King s University College as a case study Using King s made the challenge more tractable because potential bias was confined to starting salary and promotion decisions Unlike many universities King s does not offer merit pay and faculty have a defined benefit pension plan We were able to examine the effects of bias in starting salary based on the determination of how many years of relevant experience people had at hire and in promotion to full professor Women faculty at King s made nine per cent less than men on average This calculation was based on all full time professors including both racialized and non racialized faculty We took this nine per cent average difference as our starting point We then calculated the pay and pension gap across a year career and year retirement for different career trajectories Read more
