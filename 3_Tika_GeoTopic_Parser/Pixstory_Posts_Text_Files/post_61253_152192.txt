Prabhas Kriti Sanon s film is all set to release in four months but now the film is in trouble for the wrong depiction of the characters Hanuman and Ravana According to the trolls the makers have Islamised the look of Ravana with a beard kohl smeared fierce eyes and a buzz cut hair On the other hand the portrayal of Hanumant also seems to have went wrong with a long beard no moustache and leather attire this character too is receiving lots of criticism and troll Commenting over Saif s Ravana look people tweeted that his look seemed to be inspired by the Mughals and that Ravana was never a maniac but Saif s acting as seen in the teaser seemed like a psycho which very much resembled the role of Ranveer Singh in Padmaavat as Khilji The Vfx on the other hand was another let down With a budget as high as crore the visual effects obviously could have been way better The quality of the graphics doesn t seem to be up to the mark and netizens can t stop making memes about how unprofessional and cartoon like graphics look on screen
