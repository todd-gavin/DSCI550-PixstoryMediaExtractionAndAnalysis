According to the National Center for Trans Equality's 2015 poll, roughly one in every five trans adults in the United States has done sex work. This number can be as high as 40% for Black trans people, demonstrating how a public official's policy on sex work can be interpreted as an extension of their policies on the LGBTQ+ community. Here are some of the things Vice President Kamala Harris said and did to trans people and sex workers.


1- A proposal to decriminalise sex work was described by Harris as "completely ridiculous."

While serving as the district attorney of San Francisco in 2008, Harris campaigned against Proposition K, which sought to decriminalise sex work. “I think it’s completely ridiculous, just in case there’s any ambiguity about my position,” Harris said at the time. “It would put a welcome mat out for pimps and prostitutes to come on into San Francisco.”


2- Harris opposed initiatives to decriminalise sex work, stating that it aided in HIV/AIDS transmission.

As Attorney General of California, Harris continued to defend the prohibition of sex work. According to an op-ed in Out magazine by activist and ACLU attorney Chase Strangio, Harris defended her pro-criminalization stance in a 2015 case by arguing that, “[p]rostitution is linked to the transmission of AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases.”

In reality, multiple research from the time suggest that criminalization exacerbates, rather than prevents, the link between sex work and sexually transmitted illnesses, such as HIV/AIDS. The use of condoms as proof of sex work — a practise that was banned in California in 2019, two years after Harris left her job as attorney general — is a great illustration of how criminalising sex work leads to higher prevalence of STIs.
