Some people say that waking up at 5 A.M. will change your life. It will give you a new sense of clarity, boost up your confidence and promote better health. Now let’s look at various benefits of such a routine:

1. Helps build discipline- Getting up at 5 a.m. is definitely a tough task. If you can manage it, you’re building up self-discipline.

2. You get better sleep- A sleep schedule usually goes hand in hand with getting up early. The routine helps you prepare your body for a better night’s sleep.

3. Literal quiet time and increased productivity- You’re getting work done while everyone else is sleeping. That means there’s no one awake to bother you. Since you are fresh in the morning you will work more efficiently as well. Therefore, your concentration power will be more leading to increased productivity. 

4. Better for your mental health- Some people say the way you start your day ends up being a sign of how the rest of your day will go. When you’re focused and productive, the rest of the day seems to fall into place. It will also lead to a positive and happy mindset.
