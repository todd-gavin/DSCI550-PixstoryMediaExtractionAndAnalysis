4) 6-8th May- United States

The Miami Grand Prix is all set to make its F1 debut this year. It’ll be the second race on American soil alongside the one in Austin. The circuit is built around the Hard Rock Stadium and is said to feature 19 corners. The layout is evocative of Albert Park with a similar street circuit vibe. With an estimated top speed of 320 kmph, the Miami Grand Prix should make for a thrilling inclusion.

5) 20-22nd May- Spain

Touted to be one of the oldest races in the world, the Spanish GP has been a regular feature in the F1 race calendar since 1968. It holds the distinction of being the first choice for pre-season testing, thanks to a combination of long straights and twisty corners. This circuit in particular has remained a stronghold for Hamilton. In fact, he’s tied with Schumacher for the most race wins with 6.

6) 27-29th May- Monaco

Easily the most star-studded race in the whole of the calendar season, Monaco GP has earned the moniker of “Jewel Crown of Formula One”. With the race being held on the narrow streets of Monte Carlo, it’s also one of the most challenging tracks to drive on. The Monegasque Charles LeClerc will be keen to rake up some points here after a heartbreaking exit following a driveshaft issue despite starting from pole in 2021.

7) 10-12th June- Azerbaijan

At a circuit length of 6 kilometers, the Baku City Circuit is one of the most taxing races in the whole of the race calendar. With extremely tight corners, Baku is notorious for high-speed crashes. The 2021 Azerbaijan GP was one of the most memorable races of the season with Max first retiring following a real-wheel failure and then Hamilton dropping to last with the finish line in sight after getting his brakes locked up.
