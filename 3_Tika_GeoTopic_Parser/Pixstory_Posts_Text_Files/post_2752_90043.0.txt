It's been well over a year since the relations between China and Australia started going downhill after Canberra asked for a probe into the origin of the coronavirus. Retaliation from China was swift. It imposed anti-dumping duties on various imports from Australia. After Canberra cancelled a deal that one of its states Victoria had struck with China for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), it almost reached a point of no return.

One of the Aussie exports that suffered the most because of China's anti-dumping tariffs was the famous Australian wine. Till end of 2020, nearly a third of Australian wine exports went to China, but they have nosedived after China imposed over 200% tariffs on Australian wines. From AU$325 million a year earlier, according to industry figures, it had dropped to a trickle by 2021.

 Australia even filed formal complaint against China with the World Trade Organization (WTO) over imposing anti-dumping duties on Australian wine exports.

But South African winemakers were quick to jump on the chance to impress the Chines with their wines. For instance, AM Vineyards, a wine-making brand in South Africa has created two new red wines "specifically to meet the needs of the Chinese palate."

According to the latest figures, the value of South Africa's wine exports to China has increased by over 100% in the last two years thanks to the wine from Australia taking a nosedive. From having almost 40% of the wine market share in China, it has dropped to less than 4% for Australia. It is not that South Africa is the only country to grow; others like Spain, Italy, and France have gained. But South Africa has provided to be the highest garner of the wine market.
