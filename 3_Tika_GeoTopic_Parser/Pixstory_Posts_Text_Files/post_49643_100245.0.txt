Mitch McConnell, has joined the list of US politicians making visits to Kyiv. Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed McConnell’s visit as a significant signal of bipartisan support for Ukraine.

McConnell led a delegation, which included the Republican senators Susan Collins of Maine, John Barrasso of Wyoming and John Cornyn of Texas, to the Ukrainian capital where he was hosted by Zelensky at the House of Chimaeras inside the presidential administration compound.

Zelensky recently stated that Ukraine was fighting for all the other nations which choose their future freely.

He said “Thank you for your leadership in helping us in our struggle not only for our country but also for democratic values and freedoms. We appreciate it,” 

He pointed out again that Russia was committing genocide against the people of Ukraine.

The visit comes as a $40bn US military aid budget has slowed in the Senate over demands issued by the Kentucky senator Rand Paul for a watchdog to track the spending.

In a rare bipartisan request, McConnell and the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, offered Paul a vote on his amendment to the package. That offer was rejected with Paul saying he wanted alterations to the underlying bill.

The support extended by Republicans is a sign that the war will continue and maybe some people need the war to go on or else why isn't anyone suggesting a compromise rather than draining even America's economy, forgetting about its people and funding war, rather than stopping it. It's high time we doubt the intentions of the politicians.
