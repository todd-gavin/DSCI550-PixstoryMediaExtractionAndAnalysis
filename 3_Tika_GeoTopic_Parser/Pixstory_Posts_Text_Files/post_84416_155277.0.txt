On the 3rd of June, 2000, a 19 years old was appearing as an unused substitute for the Spanish International Team against Sweden, only to reign as one of the best Spanish goalkeepers for the next 20 years. 
Iker Casillas Fern√°ndez, popularly dubbed as "San Iker" for his spectacular saves, is my Childhood Icon, inspiring me to take up goalkeeping. 
With 881 appearances, he played for Real Madrid for 16 years with 725 appearances. 
In 2015, he signed for FC Porto, remaining to play there until his retirement on August 4,2020.
Let me know your Football Icon.
