‌After a few days of the Brooklyn Shooting and Biden's laws against ghost guns, gun violence continues. 14 people were either dead or injured in a shooting at a South Carolina shopping mall by a 22-year-old individual. 
‌
‌The bruised ranged in age from 15 to 73, with nine suffering gunshot wounds and the remaining being injured while trying to escape the violence. 
‌
‌When violence increases day by day in some places laws are becoming more lenient. Supreme Court will in the coming months possibly strike down a century-old New York law restricting permits to carry arms to those who demonstrate a specified threat or a heightened need for carrying a gun in public. Such a decision could easily lead to more guns on New York’s subways and New York streets. This happens even after the Brooklyn violence. 
‌
‌I don't know what world of fantasy the gun advocates are still in the name of jingoism. We have gained independence and this is a democracy. This radical agenda would only trigger anarchy, not democracy. The vision of guns for everyone and everywhere is misleadingly interpreted as “constitutional carry,” which would not only make New Yorkers less safe, it would suppress many other constitutional rights in the process — including the free right to exercise religion, the right to assemble and the right to travel free of fear. People need to use public transport systems and malls without the fear of death. It is the least that the government, law enforcement officials and judiciary to assure the people of our country in this issue.
