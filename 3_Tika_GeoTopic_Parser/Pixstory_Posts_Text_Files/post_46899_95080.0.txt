Elizabeth Cady Stanton proposed the first concerted demand for women's suffrage in America. Education was her superpower due to which she learned of the discriminatory laws under which women lived and inferred to win equal rights for her sex. She even rejected the word obey in her marriage vow! She was also a  frequent speaker on the subject of women’s rights and circulated petitions that helped ensure passage by the New York state legislature in 1848 of a bill granting married women’s property rights. She wanted to remove the secondary status of women in America. 

During the Civil War, Stanton worked for abolitionism. In 1863 she organized the Woman's National Loyal League, which gathered more than 300,000 signatures on petitions calling for immediate liberation. 

Stanton was the primary author of the first three volumes of the History of Woman Suffrage, a huge effort to record the history of the movement, focusing primarily on her wing of it. She was also the primary author of The Woman's Bible, a critical analysis of the Bible that is based on the premise that its attitude toward women reflects prejudice from a less civilized age.
