Maduka Okoye is set to become the youngest number one Watford have had during the Pozzo era. You have to go back to the years immediately preceding the Italian takeover when Scott Loach was in goal to see another 22-year-old as first choice. Loach cost £50,000 from Lincoln City, Okoye closer to £5 million from Sparta Rotterdam. These are different times, with a different approach — albeit in the same division.

Gino Pozzo’s preference was experience: first Manuel Almunia, then Heurelho Gomes and, more recently, Ben Foster — all 30-somethings — in between the sticks.
