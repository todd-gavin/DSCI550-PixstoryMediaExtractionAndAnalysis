Try rereading an old favourite book: It always works for me! Reaching out to the old ones that you adore can bring you joy. By doing so, you can recall what made you fall in love with the art in the first place, as well as experience the tale and characters.

Concentrate on reading short stories: Short stories are likely to be easier to read than a lengthy novel. Read stories by a variety of authors. Short tales have the advantage of allowing you to skip the ones you don't like and read your favourites over and over again because they take up less time and are just as gratifying as novels.

Seek references from friends: Your friends may be able to provide you with good references. Don't discuss your preferences or interests; instead, look at what they have to give. You'll learn about new literature, and the monotony will dissipate.

Research new books and blogs: This does not require reading the contents of a book, but rather information about the book and its author. You can read what other authors have to say. Who are the most popular people and what do they write? Examine the feedback and opinions. Read blogs that are similar to or dissimilar to your preferences and see what they have to say. This exercise will assist you in diverting your attention away from your worries.

Focus on completely new genres: Most people have a limited range of reading interests. It's possible that you've read all of the novels in that category. That way, you won't even notice that you're becoming tired of reading the same novels over and over again. If you buy a variety of books from various genres, you will be able to conquer your disinterest.
