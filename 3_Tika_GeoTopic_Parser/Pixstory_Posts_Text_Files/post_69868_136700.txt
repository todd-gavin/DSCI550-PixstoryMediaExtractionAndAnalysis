In a post the year old said she has non Hodgkin s lymphoma Fonda described it as a very treatable cancer so I feel very lucky She wrote she felt lucky because I have health insurance and access to the best doctors and treatments I realize and it s painful that I am privileged in this Almost every family in America has had to deal with cancer at one time or another and far too many don t have access to the quality health care I am receiving and this is not right Non Hodgkin s lymphoma is a less common cancer which develops in the lymphatic system the vast network of vessels and glands in the body Fonda wrote that she will undergo six months of chemotherapy but will not let any of this interfere with my climate activism The Oscar winning actress made her debut in becoming famous for starring in films including Barbarella Nine to Five and On Golden Pond Fonda is also well known as a political activist In the s she vocally opposed the Vietnam War More recently she became a campaigner against climate change In she spent Thanksgiving among the protesters at Standing Rock demonstrating against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline In her post Fonda said her diagnosis has highlighted the importance of community to her Cancer is a teacher and I m paying attention to the lessons it holds for me One thing it s shown me already is the importance of community Of growing and deepening one s community so that we are not alone And the cancer along with my age almost definitely teaches the importance of adapting to new realities We re living through the most consequential time in human history because what we do or don t do right now will determine what kind of future there will be and I will not allow cancer to keep me from doing all I can The midterms are looming and they are beyond consequential so you can count on me to be right there together with you as we grow our army of climate champions she wrote
