In an interview with The Times, Giorgio Chiellini returned to talking about his career goals and the European Championship. The Champions something that I miss and that Juventus has also been missing since. We got very close but a tournament where the best team doesn&#39;t always win. We were eliminated by Porto Lyon and Ajax we cannot be satisfied This year but we can try to win it Retirement Maybe I have to call Ibra and decide with him We could make a video where we say what you want to do No, what do you want to do Ok then let&#39;s decide together Then back to reliving the emotions of that July blue-tinged In the final, the English had more pressure than us and sometimes the pressure gives you energy but it happens to be an obstacle We sensed their fear Maybe not fear but their nervousness their tension At half-time we were calm if we keep the ball we will definitely score Then on penalties we were lucky
