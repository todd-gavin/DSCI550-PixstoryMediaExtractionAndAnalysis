 With Pokemon Scarlet and Violet just a month away from its November 18th launch, Nintendo has decided to give us some more information about the upcoming game.
 In an extensive 14 minute gameplay trailer, the game decided to squeeze in as much detailed information as it could before the launch, highlighting a bunch of new gameplay and mechanics.
The trailer follows four separate Pokémon trainers exploring the new Paldea region with in depth exploration, battles, different storylines, and trading, alongside a bunch of downtime with your fellow Pokemon and not merely treating it like a battle creature. The downtime features include; bathing your Pokémon, making sandwiches for them as well as playing with them.
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is the ninth generation of the storied franchise, bringing players to the new Paldean region and loaded with tons of new Pokémon to catch. 
The Pokémon Company has revealed more than a dozen of Paldea’s new creatures, including Grafaiai, Fidough, Paldean Wooper, Cetitan, Cyclizer, Smoliv, Lechonk, and Pawmi. There are the new starters, too — Sprigatito, Fuecoco and Quaxly— alongside Legendary Pokémon Koraidon and Miraidon.
These Pokémon, and plenty more, will inhabit Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Paldea with an “open-world experience,” which The Pokémon Company says will allow players to forge their own path through the world, in whatever order they’d like. 
It’s a departure from the developer’s previous mainline series games, where there’s a set order for Pokémon trainers to work through gyms and opponents.
