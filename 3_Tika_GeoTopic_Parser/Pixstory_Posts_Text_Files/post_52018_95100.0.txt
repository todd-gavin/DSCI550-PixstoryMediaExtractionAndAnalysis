Former Cronulla flyer Nathan Stapleton has been hospitalised with a serious spinal injury after fracturing his neck while playing country rugby union.

Stapleton was hurt during the second half of his Boorowa club's opening game of the season against West Wyalong on April 9.

The match was immediately abandoned while the 32-year-old was treated by a nurse at the ground.

He was taken to the spinal unit at Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney, with a welfare officer at his former club, Cronulla, also checking on Stapleton and his young family's wellbeing.

"During our game last Saturday at West Wyalong, Goldies Men's player Nathan Stapleton suffered a significant injury during the second half which led to the match being abandoned," Boorowa Rugby Club posted on Facebook.

"Unfortunately, during contact, Nathan fractured his neck and injured his spinal cord, requiring significant medical assistance.

"Through an incredible effort from members of each club, Nathan was given first aid until paramedics could arrive.

"Nathan has begun his recovery at hospital in Sydney and, whilst he shows improvement each day, the extent of his injuries and long-term impact remain unclear."

Stapleton scored 17 tries 61 games for the Sharks between 2009 and 2014, before being released to join the Sydney Roosters.

He later moved to England to play with London, and has started a family since moving back to Australia.
