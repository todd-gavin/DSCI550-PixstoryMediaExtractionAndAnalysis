Happy Birthday Khabar Lahariya! 
Happy Birthday Meera Chitrakoot ! 

Khabar Lahariya, the Oscar going, award winning, radical, grassroots, women run media revolution has turned 20! As they begin their second innings, a second chapter of writing feminist history, we look back, quite proudly, at the seminal contribution of Meera Chitrakoot who sowed the seeds of this feminist revolution in a society still shackled by caste and patriarchy. 

Khabar Lahariya, may you bloom and grow forever !
