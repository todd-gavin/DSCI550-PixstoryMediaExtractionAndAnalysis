The Bible tells us that prostitution is immoral. Proverbs 23:27-28 says, "For a prostitute is a deep pit and a wayward wife is a narrow well. Like a bandit she lies in wait, and multiplies the unfaithful among men."

God forbids men and women from having relationships with prostitutes because He understands that such relationships are harmful to both men and women. Prostitution kills not only marriages, families, and lives, but it also destroys the spirit and soul, resulting in physical and spiritual death. God's desire is for us to remain pure and to use our bodies as tools for His glory (Romans 6:13). "The body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body," states First Corinthians 6:13.

Despite the fact that prostitution is a sin, it is not beyond God's forgiveness. According to the Holy Bible, He used a prostitute named Rahab to help Him carry out His purpose. She and her family were rewarded and blessed as a result of her obedience (Joshua 2:1; 6:17-25). While Jesus was visiting a Pharisee's home in the New Testament, a woman who had been known for being a sexual sinner—before Jesus pardoned and cleansed her from sin—found a chance to serve Jesus. Recognizing Christ for who He is, the woman presented Him with a bottle of expensive perfume. The woman sobbed and poured perfume on His feet, wiped it away with her hair, as an act of regret and repentance. When the Pharisees chastised Jesus for accepting the "immoral" woman's show of love, He rebuked them and embraced her worship. Christ had forgiven all of her sins and welcomed her into His kingdom as a result of her faith (Luke 7:36-50).
