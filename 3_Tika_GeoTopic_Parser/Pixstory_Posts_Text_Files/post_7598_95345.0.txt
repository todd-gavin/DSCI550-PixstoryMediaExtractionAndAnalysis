After another colossal defeat at the hands of Liverpool, the difference between between Manchester United and the competition is staggering. Fans have known a rebuild is necessary ever since Ole failed with the team he had, even though they brought Varane, Sancho and Ronaldo in this season.

The Interim Manager Ralf Rangnick even before the game said they need to bring in new players in almost every area of the team. After the game he just went off at the team again. The defence before the first goal had let go of the plan and played a high line which wasn't to he done. Rangnick confirmed that there will be a complete overhaul in the team.

He said, " There will be a rebuild for sure, that was obvious in the first three or four weeks for me...This team needs to be rebuilt, it is clear. A game like today showed in a very drastic way that this rebuild is necessary...There could be six, seven, eight, maybe ten new players."
