ABC News reported that as the death toll from COVID-19 in the United States nears the 1 million mark, members of the tribe are trying to cope with the devastation caused by the virus, which knifed swiftly through their community, killing scores and leaving few families untouched by death.

The death toll included many Choctaw tribal elders, storytellers, musicians and artisans who were the keepers of traditions that have shaped the tribe's history and culture for centuries.

COVID-19 has taken a disproportionate toll among Native Americans due in part to widespread chronic disease in their communities and the historic underfunding of Indian healthcare systems.

By attacking the elderly, COVID-19 threatened the very essence of native people â€” their traditions and languages of which the elders were the guardians.

From Latin America to Canada, tribes moved to shield their culture keepers as much as possible, barricading villages and prioritising the elderly for vaccinations. Still, many died carrying with them their people's knowledge.

But the younger generation is stepping up! 

Crosby, an anthropology student, is not the only member of her tribe who wants to preserve the tribe's traditions after it lost so many custodians of its culture over the past two years. 

Mag Willis, 35, said the pandemic inspired her to create a Facebook group for Choctaw artisans where people could connect with the crafters, watch tutorials, and buy pieces such as beaded sandals, elaborate necklaces and colourful earrings.

"I think there's a lot of people [who are] starting to realise, 'Hey, I think I need to learn'," said Willis, who lost her grandfather, one of the tribe's fiddle players, to COVID-19.
