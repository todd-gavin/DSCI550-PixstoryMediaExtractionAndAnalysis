Chennai (Tamil Nadu): Rajya Sabha MP and a vocal critique of the government on financial matters, Subramanian Swamy has unleashed a no-holds-barred attack on Finance Ministry over the daily hike in petrol and diesel prices.

The 83-year-old BJP MP took to Twitter to critise his own government for its policy related to fuel prices. 

“The daily rise in Petrol, Diesel and Kerosene prices is creating a situation of revolt in the country. It is the intellectual bankruptcy of the Finance Ministry to do this. It is also anti-national. Financing Budget deficit by raising these prices is sheer incompetence,” Swamy tweeted.

Responding to a query, Swamy suggested the government to cut taxes instead. “Cut taxes. No other country has 60% of sale price going for taxes.”
