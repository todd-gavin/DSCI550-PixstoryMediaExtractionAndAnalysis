Match Report: Tottenham Hotspur defeat Everton 2-0 to steer clear of Chelsea on points table 
Tottenham registered a fine win over Everton in Matchday 11 of the premier league. The Spurs with this win are now placed third in the table with 23 points in 10 matches. The Hugo Lloris lead side delivered a quality performance to bag three more points as they marched off to a second consecutive victory with the loss to Arsenal being their only defeat so far this season. 
Everton on the other hand is now in a spot of bother after succumbing to their second successive loss and now sits 14th in the table with 10 points in as many matches. 
Tottenham started off things in convincing fashion as they were awarded a free kick with just seven minutes on the clock which was taken too quickly by Harry Kane who played Perisic down the left. Perisic's cross found Richarlison who ended up heading the ball over the bar.Â  
Everton too had a brilliant chance in the 23rd minute when Demarai Gray managed to outrun Bentanchur and went for a goal himself only to see his shot fly over the bar. With neither of the sides being able to convert their chances into goals, the first half ended 0-0.
5 minutes into the second half, Richarlison went to the ground due to a calf injury which he eventually couldn't deal with and had to be subbed off. Tottenham almost opened the scoring with Kane smashing a beautiful volley, only to be denied by Pickford who pulled off a fine save. 
However, Kane had the edge a few minutes later when he was impeded by Pickford after the strike caught him napping. The home side was awarded a penalty which was converted by Harry Kane for his 258th goal in style to mark his 400th appearance for the Spurs. 
Hojberg doubled Tottenham's advantage 4 minutes before the 90th-minute mark when he slotted in his team's second goal which went in after a deflection. The match ended 2-0 in Spurs' favour who clearly were the better side at converting the majority of their chances.
