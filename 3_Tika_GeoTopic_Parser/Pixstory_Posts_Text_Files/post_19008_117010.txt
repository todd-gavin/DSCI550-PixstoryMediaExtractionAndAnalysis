After the painful withdrawal from the Athletics World Championships of Eugene USA Marcell Jacobs must necessarily think already about the next goal which in this case will be the European championship in Munich scheduled from to August About what happened in the States with the pain in the adductor that prevented him his coach Paolo Camossi spoke to Ansa about racing in the semifinal It wasn&#39;t easy until the last second we evaluated what to do Before the World Cup we worked well the pains had gone away but we knew that the unknown factor would be the high intensity In the heat Jacobs had he already felt a twinge in his adductor and was unable to run as he would have liked Physiotherapy was useless to make the pain disappear as demonstrated by the ultrasound he underwent The ultrasound showed a contracture and we know that compromising the adductor would mean ending the season he said Camossi again Given the numerous injuries after the gold medal someone is already talking about Jacobs as a meteor But his coach is not there Marcell will go back to putting so many people behind Jacobs now a reality of world sprint The final in Eugene says that with him on the track there would have been no American hat-trick. We are optimistic for the European Championships, we have a month to be ready
