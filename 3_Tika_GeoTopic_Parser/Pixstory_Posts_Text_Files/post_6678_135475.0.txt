A video of a tribal woman, who worked as a domestic help in Jharkhand, accusing her employers of brutal torture and abuse has surfaced online. In the video, the victim, Sunita painstakingly recounts the details of the torture allegedly inflicted upon her by her employer, Seema Patra.
As the videos went viral, several major news media outlets covered this story wherein they identified Patra as the “wife of an ex-IAS officer”. ANI tweeted, “Police team rescued a 29-yr-old woman working as a domestic help at the residence of an-ex IAS officer on Aug 22, after she was allegedly physically tortured by her employer.” (Archived link)

The English caption reads, “Wife of Ex-IAS booked for torturing maid, a tribal woman, used to force her to clean toilet with tongue”, and the Hindi caption reads, “Domestic help tortured with a frying pan, thrashed with an iron rod, forced to clean faeces with her tongue: if the son objected, he was called ‘crazy’ and was sent to a mental hospital.” (Archived links- 1 and 2)
