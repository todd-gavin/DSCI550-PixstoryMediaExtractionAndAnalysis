Toni Kroos:

Toni Kroos, a top-tier midfielder for Real Madrid, will go down in history as a legend of the game. With his passing and incredible vision, the German has been absolutely great for the Blancos and has been a blessing for them.

He was acquired by Real Madrid in 2014 for Â£25 million, and the price is still viewed favourably now. Two La Liga championships, two Supercopa de Espaa crowns, and three consecutive Champions League crowns have all been won by Kroos.

On the field, Kroos is never the fastest player. But his extraordinary passing range and precision with both feet more than make up for it. He was recently one of the most feared midfield combinations in Europe, along with Luka Modric. Another expert in set-pieces is Kroos.

Juninho Pernambucano:

Juninho, arguably the best free-kick taker of all time, was a superb playmaker who went on to 
become one of Olympique Lyon's all-time greats, registering over 100 goals in his career and generating a tonne of assists.

The arrival of Juninho inspired the Lyon team, which had never won a domestic championship before. Later, Juninho would guide his team to 7 straight Ligue 1 championships . He was named to the Ligue 1 team of the year three times and received the Ligue 1 Player of the Year award once.

It would be reductive to limit Juninho to being a superb free-kick shooter. With his superb 
passing, Juninho could open up attacking opportunities, which is why he has piled up a tonne of assists. He could score goals from a distance and had excellent vision and football knowledge.
