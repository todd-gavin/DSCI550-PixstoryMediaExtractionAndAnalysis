The fine line between constructively criticizing and offending a player is thin A prime example of this was shown throughout last season when Los Angeles Lakers point guard Russell Westbrook was consistently hated on for having a disappointing year The nickname Westbrick was popularly used throughout the NBA community and sports media to humorously describe the poor shooting performance of Westbrook Even though he shot percent from point range last season the nickname to talk about his inefficiency from the perimeter got out of hand quickly Towards the end of last season Westbrook stood behind his wife Nina Westbrook after she tweeted about how the name calling and public shaming of her husband had an effect on their family as being harassed on a daily basis The Westbrick movement went too far and it was time for the media and fans to end it When talking about how Lakers rookie Max Christie will fit with the team Fox s Skip Bayless used it an an opportunity to take another shot at Westbrook drawing a response on social media from the Lakers point guard Westbrook s wife Nina also once again came to her husband s defense Discussing the lack of perimeter shooting the Lakers currently have is one thing but for Bayless to once again bring up a nickname and shaming technique that Westbrook and his wife have requested to be stopped is unprofessional The nine time NBA All Star has been under enough scrutiny since he first suited up for the purple and gold so his decision to stand up for himself and the potential backlash that will continue if he does decide to stay in Los Angeles should be expected With Westbrook reportedly expected to opt in his million player option he has a chance to prove the doubters wrong by working together with new Lakers head coach Darvin Ham to craft a system around him LeBron James and Anthony Davis to get back in playoff contention
