Yes, it sounds beautiful, but have we ever thought about the hardships of Opera singers off stage?

Opera singers, in comparison to other kinds of music, employ more resonance when singing in order to fill a full auditorium with their sound. They don't use microphones, therefore they employ a developed vocal technique to turn their bodies into amplifiers. 

According to NYTimes archives, almost every opera singer is obsessed with keeping their voice in shape during their offstage time. When a breeze blows, some people wrap themselves in scarves. Some people see their doctor before each performance, which could be two or three times a week, 52 weeks a year. Some people are downright hypochondriac, according to coaches, professors, managers, and impresarios. However, because even a small cold can result in the cancellation of concerts - and a significant loss of cash - the fixation is recognised as a necessary part of the art. 

Moreover, Julius Rudel, the former director of the New York City Opera, regards the patient-throat-doctor relationship as ''pathological and fraught with demonic implications.''

''Opera singers are certainly among the most hypochondriacal of beings,'' he said recently. Conversely, he added, they are not always among the healthiest of the species.

So, is it all really worth the struggle? Passion and career are good as long as they do not affect your physical health adversely. What is the use of a talent that drives you towards self destruction. There are the questions that we need to ponder upon.
