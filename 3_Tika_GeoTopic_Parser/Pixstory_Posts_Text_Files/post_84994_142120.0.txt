Choosing players from Real Madrid and Barcelona for your combined XI is the mostchallenging task, as both clubs have unearthed some of the greatest players in theirhistories, and attempting to put all of the players who played for both clubs in the sameline-up is indeed a burden.

In this article, we will line up the all-time Real Madrid and Barcelona XIs and see who made
the cut for this combined XI.
GK - Iker Casillas

Having done so much for Real Madrid, Casillas has spent 25 years at Real Madrid. Hestarted his career at just nine in youth academy, made his senior team debut at 18 and wasone of the consistent goalkeepers between the sticks until 2015.
In his 25 years stint at the club, he claimed five La Liga titles and three Champions League titles and appeared for 725 games for Real Madrid.

RB - Dani Alves

Barcelona is still looking for a right-back to replace Dani Alves. That's the kind of stature hecultivated at Barcelona over the years; he's the only player in history to have won 40trophies, half of which he won in Barcelona. And despite being a right-back, Alves was like aplaymaker for Barcelona, who provided 131 assists and scored 22 goals in 408 matches.
During his tenure at the club, the Catalan giants were unbeatable, dominating Europe for 2-3 years. Under every manager, he was regarded as one of the best attacking-full backs and overlapping runners.
