Chris Evans played one of the most iconic comic book characters ever written. He played the live action version of Steve Rogers, when he donned the iconic red white and blue costume representing the Captain America. 

Chris Evans left a huge void in MCU, after his departure announced after Avengers Endgame. This boots were filled by the man who took up the mantle of Captain America in Anthony Mackie. 

While we all have grown to love Mackie as Cap, there will always be the lingering nostalgia, that Chris can come back as Steve Rogers. 

Evans recently while promoting his new movie Lightyear, said that, he doesn't know if he'll ever come back, coz his time is over. He also iterated that the character is very special to him and that it would take a lot for him to come back and it has to be something special. 

Chris Evans is a very sought after actor and his MCU returns seems unlikely day by day. But hey this is the show business, so never say never
