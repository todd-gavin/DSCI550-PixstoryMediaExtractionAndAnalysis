I guess some of you guys already know where I belong to and where I do live right now. But for someone new who's reading this may think where is this girl fromðŸ˜‚? So let me tell you, I'm from Shimla, Himalaya Pradesh and currently living in Delhi for my study purposes. So if someone now asks me what place is my favourite for going on a vacation, my answer is always Shimla â™¥. I know I lived my entire life till now there but after staying far from home I feel that I don't want to go anywhere else but only Shimla. My family lives there. I can say that where my family is that place is my favorite holiday destination. I find peace when I'm with my family. I know some of you guys can't relate to me but some of you who live far away from home can feel me.
