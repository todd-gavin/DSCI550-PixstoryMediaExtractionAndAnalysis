Kabul a city of love, happiness and an incomplete story. 
Kabul a city of light in the darkest days.  
Kabul is the smile of innocent children and Kabul a city full of love stands.
Kabul is a city of poetry that has the hearts of thousands of people with it. 
You are the only city of light that always shine brighter in the heart of Afghanistan. 
Kabul is a city of hope for thousands of disappointed people. 
Kabul is a city where thousands of innocent mothers' hearts are buried. 
Kabul is a city where thousands of innocent people's tears have fallen into the soil. 
Bring us all back to the happy days and hope of life, Kabul.
