Near dinner I do not know what to write I am stuck in my commotion Exactly the neighborhood that is currently my second temporary home the dormitory Because this is where we have only food and shelter otherwise we would not have known in which alleys we were displaced Life has its beauties and its evils How do we reopen all these ups and downs I wonder how creatures live on this planet and how different it is from me how different it is from yesterday Yes a lot I see changes in my peers spiritually emotionally and their views that is what caused all these changes We can say change of mind growth of thought I do not know Around me those creatures are no longer simple they all got into relationships and got involved in their commotion and how pleasant and how challenging The challenge I really do not know what to call it These events and these events are these cumbersome torches What can I say I am so immersed in myself I stay what and what to write with whom how to speak with whom how do I not know All around me was the exact word Creatures around me have the gentle spirit of pure creatures but unaware of the world of cunning and hypocrisy They are simple they look at the world from their small point of view they do not know to what extent there are two faces and a thousand faces Near dinner the wind of writing blew over my head like the morning wind and how beautiful it is near dinner and I stayed I said no but today I say yes Growing up is associated with internal and external changes I do not know if one day someone will read these stories of mine Wednesday night By zohal Rahimi
