In this article, we have scouted the top ten players who have scored as many goals for Arsenal and are still remembered.
 
 
#10 David Jack
David Jack was the first player to make his name in Arsenal and became the club's first leading scorer. He was one of Arsenal's most expensive signings at the time, as the Gunners made the first five-digit signing in world football, nearly doubling the previous record, from £10,000 to £10,890 to £11,500.
He was signed to replace then-captain Charlie Buchan, and David Jack made his debut against Newcastle at Highbury. He was a prolific player for the club and was a top-scorer almost every season. David Jack, in contrast hand, scored 124 goals in 208 games for Arsenal after retiring.
 
#9 Joe Hulme
The great Hulme spent 12 years at Arsenal and was unquestionably a part of the Arsenal of the 1990s, as he was one of the best forwards in their history, unrivalled and kept defenders at his feet with his goal-scoring abilities. He was on the scoresheet in every game and established a routine of scoring goals.
He ended every season with 20 or more goals, and as he grew older, he switched positions and became a playmaker, winning three first division titles and scoring 124 goals in 374 games.
