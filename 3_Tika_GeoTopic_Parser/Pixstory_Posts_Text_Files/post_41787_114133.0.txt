Australia’s talismanic opener and former vice-captain, David Warner can miss the upcoming Big Bash League season in Australia if his leadership ban imposed by Cricket Australia is not removed.
Warner’s partner, Candice recently spoke on the matter at the Triple M’s Deadset Legends with Dan, Richard and Candice.

“Yeah it (the ban) bothers me, I don’t like injustice so it does bother me,” she said.

“But it doesn’t really bother him because he can go and captain in the UAE, he can go and captain in India where people appreciate his cricketing brain and what he can bring to a team.”

Further, Candice also said that the final decision to play in the Australian T20 league summer is something the family will take in the coming.
