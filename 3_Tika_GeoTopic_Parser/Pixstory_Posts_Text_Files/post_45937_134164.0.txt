You are so right with your last point. These “heroes” destroy more than they save and yet everyone seems to worship them?

As TOM says, one of the reasons why heroes in comic books and movies are overrated is that they frequently inflict more harm than they are trying to stop. They frequently risk the lives of many other people in order to save one individual. 

There are many justifications for why it's still crucial to prioritise saving the one over the many.

However, no at the same time. Heroes are frequently people who put themselves in harm's way to safeguard the safety of those who are unable to defend themselves. 

Morally speaking, this is the proper thing to do, but when one extends the lens, things take a very different turn. 

From a practical perspective, things change drastically when one realises that for every person a  hero in comic books and/or movies saves, they're probably also forgetting, disregarding, or even bringing harm to other individuals in some way.

What do you think about this?
