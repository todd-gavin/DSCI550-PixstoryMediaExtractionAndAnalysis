Manchester City took on West Ham United away from home at the London Stadium in their first
match of the new Premier League season, i.e, the 2022-23 season. It would be right to say the
defending champions have set the mood for the season with a sensational win tonight.

Pep Guardiola's men won the last two seasons of the Premier League and if they manage to do
it again this year, they will have the very unique achievement of winning a hat-trick of Premier
Leagues. However, for that to happen, they would have to up their game as all the Big 6 teams
have strengthened their squad considerably this season and thus it would not be an easy task
for them.

However, City, being the big spenders they are, have successfully signed the players that they
needed and the biggest name among them was definitely Erling Braut Haaland. The Norwegian
goalmachine was the hottest asset in this transfer window and Manchester City secured his
signature by paying his release clause to Borussia Dortmund. He is one of the best strikers in
the world right now and he has proven it in the very first Match.

Haaland made his debut tonight against West Ham and was simply phenomenal. He scored two
goals - one in each half. The first goal came from a penalty in the 36th minute. It does not take
away the credit from him though as he had dribbled past the goalkeeper when he dragged him
back and fouled him. The second goal came from a brilliant through ball by Kevin De Bruyne
which was converted wonderfully by him with a calm composure.
