Everyone's favorite fungi!!

Just kidding, no one likes a candida overgrowth :*)
The most important thing to remember about candida is that it's an OPPORTUNISTIC microbe.

What does that mean?
It means that when candida goes into overgrowth, there's usually a driver behind it that needs to be addressed in order to tackle it. Some drivers can include stress, impaired stomach acid, stealth infections, diet, antibiotics, diet and hormone imbalances (like high estrogen).
