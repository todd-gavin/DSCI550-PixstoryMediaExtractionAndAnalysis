The Matrix Is one of the best Classic Sci Fi Action Film ever It depicts a dystopia future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called the Matrix created by sentient machines to subdue the human population while their bodies heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source Computer programmer Neo learns this truth through mentor legend Morphius and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines which involves other people who have been freed from the dream world Written and directed by the Wachowski brothers this classic sci fi action film stars The reality within a reality is a concept that s done before but never like this The Matrix requires absolute attention from his audience least you ll be completely lost in a few minutes With the help of supporting cast members Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Anne Moss The slow motion bullet time effects as they re known today were groundbreaking and revolutionary when we first saw them years ago It s no wonder this film spawned two very successful sequels and dozens of copy cats The Matrix Visually revolutionary and mind blowing Keanu Reeves was well fitted for this role for me because this accent pauses in dialogues made the story our own in a way Laurence Fishbourne s Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting Carrie Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving however in his portrayal of Agent Smith It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger sense of dread hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category ahead of even Star Wars
