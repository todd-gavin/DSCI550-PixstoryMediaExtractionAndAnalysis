As many as 7.1% of the US adults identify themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or under any gender identity other than heterosexual. This number, from a Gallup survey, is the highest ever and is also the double of the 2012 figure. What accounts for this rise? The increasing acceptance of the LGBTQ people in society is an obvious factor, which adds to another factor: A fifth of those identifying themselves as LGBTQ are from the Gen Z. From this point, the two factors can feed into each other and the proportion of alternative gender identities can keep only growing.

Gallup poll of 2021:
https://news.gallup.com/poll/389792/lgbt-identification-ticks-up.aspx

Main findings:

*LGBT identification up from 5.6% in 2020
*21% Gen Z adults identify as LGBT
*Bisexual identification is most common
*86.3% say they are straight or heterosexual, 6.6% do not offer an opinion

The driving force behind the trend is, of course, the Gen Zers who have now entered the adulthood – those born between 1997 and 2003, according to the Gallup definition. Among other cohorts, 10.5% millennials, while 4.2% of Generation X, 2.6% of baby boomers and 0.8% of traditionalists self-identify as LGBTQ. (Some of the older people might be less inclined to self-identify as LGBTQ, but self-identification is the defining parameter here.) The figures sliding in accordance with age groups reflect the increasing awareness in society.

As Gallup senior editor Jeffrey Jones explains, the youngest adults have grown up in an atmosphere where being LGBT is normal, whereas earlier generations grew up at a time when this was considered something embarrassing, something to hide. Now, the new generation/s will keep adding numbers and also as older generations die, their numbers will go down and the LGBTQ proportion in the overall population can only go up.

This is a welcome development, cheered on social media: https://twitter.com/sarahkateellis/status/1494366147650670593

Though it captures the trend, it is still a limited survey – only 12,000 respondents. What’s needed is more government data on this crucial matter. It was only last year that the US Census Bureau included a question on gender identity and sexual orientation.
