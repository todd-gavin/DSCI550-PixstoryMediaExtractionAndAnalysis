It wasn t a great show but it brought three points and smile on the face of the coach After losing three back to back matches in the international circuit all friendly ties India finally returned to the winning track when they defeated lowly Cambodia in the Asian Cup qualifiers in Kolkata Both the goals were scored by skipper Sunil Chhetri who has now taken his tally of goals for India to It was yet another amazing show on part of seasoned Chhetri but his team didn t impress to the extent it should have Nonetheless the Croatian coach Igor Stimac looked happy and relieved as India logged full points in their first match of the four team group No doubt the three points are going to help India but to what extent is the question After all only the group toppers will clearly make the next grade and at least three teams India Afghanistan and Hong Kong will go all out to grab that spot Cambodia are no good and are likely to finish at the bottom In the first match of the qualifiers Hong Kong edged Afghanistan and now they too have three points like India Afghanistan are serious contenders and they will do their best to quickly forget about their defeat against Hong Kong and come back to winning ways in the next match against India Finally it might go down to photo finish when hosts India take on Hong Kong in the last match of the group Now back to the match India took the lead when winger Liston Colaco was brought down inside the box and the referee pointed to the penalty spot Chhetri made no mistake In the second half after missing a couple of easy chances Chhetri was again on strike this time through a fine header Well a victory after many months but that is not going to ease the headache of Stimac Afghanistan will come on India all guns blazing the Indian defence will have to be prepared for that
