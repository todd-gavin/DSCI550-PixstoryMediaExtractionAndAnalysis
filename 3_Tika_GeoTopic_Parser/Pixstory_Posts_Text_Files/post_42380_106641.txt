I just finished watching Ranveer Singh s new movie Jayeshbhai Jordaar which is available on Amazon Prime Video and one thing I want to say after watching the film is that Jayeshbhai Jordaar is an underrated movie yet there are many flaws When the movie was released in theatres the response of both the critics and the box office is so underwhelming and the producer s last hope was that film will do well and will get its due credit when it will release on OTT Platforms And when I watched Jayeshbhai Jordaar one thing I realised that why the movie didn t work was because of one reason which is that the movie felt more like social message advertisements and there is very little scope for entertainment in that Talking about the movie this movie revolves around the character of Jayesh played by Ranveer and his struggles to convince his father that a girl child can take forward the legacy of the family and that having a son is not necessary for that In Jayesh s family we got introduced to his wife Mudra played by Shalini his daughter Siddhi played by Jia his mother Jashoda played by Ratna Pathak Shah and his father Mithilesh played by Boman Irani After having one daughter already Jayesh and Mudra are trying to have a son but because of that Mudra had five abortions because Jayesh s father forced them to go through a gender checking procedure and every time they find out that they are having a girl But now Jayesh decided that he will not let go of his wife with all the trauma and after knowing that Mudra is expecting a girl again and now Jayesh trying to find a way to escape from his father and if I tell you what happened next will be a spoiler from my side If I want to sum up Jayeshbhai Jordaar in one phrase then it will be Jack of all trades and master of none because the movie tried to touch on so many social issues but didn t succeed in any
