Miguel Van Damme, a Belgian footballer, died after a long battle with leukaemia. Van Damme, a goalie for Cercle Brugge, debuted in the Belgian first division in 2014, but his career was cut short after he contracted the disease.

In 2016, he was diagnosed with leukaemia. He recovered, then relapsed, and in September 2020, he declared that his treatment was no longer working.
"It is with great sadness we report that our friend and team-mate Van Damme has fought his long and uneven battle against leukaemia," the club said.

"Words are not enough to describe what we feel, even though we knew that things had not gone well for a while.
"Miguel, your perseverance and strength to go for it [again] over and over, setback after setback, was admirable.

"You are an example of positivism, persistence and fighting spirit. A source of inspiration for everyone who fights. Forever in our green-black heart, #16."
Dobbelaere wrote on Instagram: "Our dearest darling, daddy left for his last match last night, a match that can no longer be won. You left us very slowly, yet you did it again in your own way... very strong.

Van Damme, who was 28 years old at the time of his death, is survived by his wife Kyana Dobbelaere and daughter Camille.
"You fought like a lion. We are so thankful for who you were. An example for many. You have made me realise that there is no such thing as giving up, even if there was only that one small glimmer of success, time and again you got over it.

"Rest now darling you have more than earned it, you are now freed from all pain."
The Belgian Pro League said: "Our thoughts are with his family, friends and everyone at Cercle Brugge.
"Your fighting spirit has been inspiring. Rest in peace."
