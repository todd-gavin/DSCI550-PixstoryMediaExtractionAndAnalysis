The leaders of Australia, India and the US issued a rare joint statement on Saturday to mourn the death of former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, describing him as a transformative leader for Japan’s relations with their countries.

In their statement, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, US President Joe Biden and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said they will honour Abe’s memory by enhancing their efforts to ensure a peaceful and prosperous region.

“We, the leaders of Australia, India, and the United States, are shocked at the tragic assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Prime Minister Abe was a transformative leader for Japan and for Japanese relations with each one of our countries,” the statement said.

The three leaders recalled Abe’s pioneering work in the establishment of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad, which groups Australia, India, Japan and the US, and in pushing a vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific region.

“He also played a formative role in the founding of the Quad partnership, and worked tirelessly to advance a shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific,” the statement said
