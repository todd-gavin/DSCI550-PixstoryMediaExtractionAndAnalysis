When someone we know is struggling with their mental health, we try to comfort them with our words but sometimes our words can come out in a hurtful way.
Comforting someone isn't always easy so we have compiled a list of things you SHOULD NOT say to anyone with a mental illness -
1) Some people have it worse
2) It's in your head
3) Stop thinking about it
4) Try to be happy (what does this even mean tbh?)
5) Wake up early everyday and hydrate yourself (something our parents would say)
6) But you've everything and you seem so happy everytime
7) Stop being an attention seeker
8) Everyone has bad days sometimes, you'll get over it.
9) Even I was feeling sad the other day so I just went out for a walk.
10) Think positive 

Here's a list of things that you CAN say - 
1) I'm so sorry you've to go through this. 
2) I'm here for you. Talk to me. 
3) What can I do to help? 
4) You're not alone in this. 
5) Are you looking for my perspective or do you just want to vent out right now?
