In an unfortunate news for PS owners waiting for the upcoming remake of Dead Space the survival horror classic won t be coming to the PS contrary to rumours One of EA s Dead Space trailer for its Latin American channel which suggested that the game will come out on previous generation consoles is a mistake Instead it looks as though Dead Space will remain a next gen remake launching on PS as well as Xbox Series X S and PC on January EA recently showed off some the remake s gameplay that clearly shows that a lot of respect for the original has been poured into the game First we honor the legacy said senior producer Philippe Ducharme We look at the original game with the utmost respect So the core foundations will remain the same However we are making several enhancements to the experience to make it enticing for both new players and returning ones The remake consists of some new combat mechanics graphical improvements improved audio aesthetics as well as improvements in interface and inventory management Furthermore it will also bring back Gunner Wright to voice the game s protagonist Isaac Clarke who was a silent protagonist in the first game while Gunner voiced him in Dead Space and so it will be a very interesting and amazing addition
