Stewart Downing

Downing joined Liverpool in a £20 million deal from Aston Villa that day, but he failed to
duplicate the form that earned him an England call-up, notoriously failing to register a goal or
assist in his first Premier League season with the club.

Luis Suarez

Suarez had joined Liverpool in January of the previous year and had a mixed day against
Sunderland, firing a penalty over the bar after five minutes before scoring eight minutes later.

Raul Meireles

Meireles, the striker's successor at the time, was the reigning PFA Fans' Player of the Year, but
he departed Anfield to join Chelsea before the transfer window closed, continuing a perplexing
career that we are still trying to figure out.

Andy Carroll

Craig Bellamy contrasted Carroll's approach to that of Henderson when addressing why the
striker struggled to establish himself at Liverpool.

“My conversations always with Andy were… I don’t believe he worked hard enough during the
week to be the player he wanted to become,” Bellamy told Sky Sports’ The Debate in 2018. “I
never saw an inch of that, like with Jordan Henderson."

“He was going through a difficult period at that time as well, but he just trained and trained and
trained, he kept improving, going to the gym."

“He worked, and I knew, I remember saying to him, ‘You’re going to be a top player. I know it,
just by your attitude, and the ability you have, it will come’. I never felt that was going to be the
case with Andy.”
