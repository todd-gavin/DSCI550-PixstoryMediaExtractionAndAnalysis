The FIFA Referees Committee announced the names of the selected match officials for the
FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 on Thursday.

36 referees, 69 assistant referees, and 24 video match officials (VMOs) were chosen in close
collaboration with the six confederations,based on their quality and recent performances at FIFA tournaments as well as other international and domestic competitions. The FIFA Referees
Committee has appointed three women's referees and three women's assistant referees for the
first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup.

“We are very happy that with Stephanie Frappart from France, Salima Mukansanga from
Rwanda, and Yoshimi Yamashita from Japan, as well as assistant referees Neuza Back from
Brazil, Karen Diaz Medina from Mexico, and Kathryn Nesbitt from the USA, we have been able
to call up female match officials for the first time in the history of a FIFA World Cup," said the
chairman of the FIFA Referees Committee Pierluigi Collina.”

FIFA's Director of Refereeing, Massimo Busacca, assures that the match officials will receive all
necessary support from FIFA, as their preparation is critical. All match officials can be closely
and intensively supervised by FIFA referees' instructors this year, thanks to an innovative
tracking and support programme.

This is a critical factor, and we anticipate significant
improvements and progress in preparation for the FIFA World Cup 2022.

The selected match officials will attend several seminars (Asuncion, Madrid, and Doha) in early
summer, reviewing and analysing video clips of real match situations and participating in
practical training sessions with players, which will be filmed so that participants can receive
immediate feedback from the instructors.
