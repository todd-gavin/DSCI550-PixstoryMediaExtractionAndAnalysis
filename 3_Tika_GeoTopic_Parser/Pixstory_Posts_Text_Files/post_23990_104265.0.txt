An unceasing chain of targeted killings—as many as seven in May and that of Vijay Kumar, a bank manager from Rajasthan on June 2 at Kulgam—has warranted the Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s detailed review of the Kashmir situation, his second in a month. On June 3, Shah is scheduled to preside over a high- level meeting on the security scenario of Jammu and Kashmir which would be, among others, attended by the National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and the Union Territory’s Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha. 

Like the one on May 17, senior officers of the security and intelligence apparatus, including J&K’s Financial Commissioner for Home, R.K. Goyal, and Director General of Police, Dilbag Singh, are expected to attend the meeting with their presentations on the current situation. Those killed in the targeted terror attacks in May included three off-duty Police personnel, one Kashmiri Pandit teacher, one wine shop salesman, one Hindu lady teacher from Jammu and a female TV artiste.
