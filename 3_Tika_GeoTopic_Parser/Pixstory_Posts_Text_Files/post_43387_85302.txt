Meet LEO my first kid I have rescued dogs Leo is the eldest and the most pampered one and also the shortest of all He has those cute pink lips of his He gets excited whenever anyone comes at my place or whenever I take him out for a walk as he loves people Anyway I m pretty sure atleast once in your life you have wondered if your pet could talk Right What they would have talked about How would it feel like Would they be annoying or super cute For now let me expand a bit of my imagination about Leo and about how he behaves normally According to me if he could talk then he d say Stop kissing me you annoy me at times because trust me he runs away whenever i try pampering him and also he runs away only from me You are annoying but i love you because sometimes he actually comes to me and rests on my lap Where is my food like all the time Treatos would do if not food definitely all the time Did I smell other dog s scent on your clothes if I meet some other dog and then come home I don t need a bath I ll just lick and clean myself everytime I d take him for a bath And most importantly he ll behave self obsessed praising himself all the time because he s my kid What do you think your dog would talk about if he could have Do share your views
