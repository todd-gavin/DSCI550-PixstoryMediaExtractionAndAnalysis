Yes, it can.
I mean why not? It's a form if exercise and doing exercises during pregnancy is really important. 

So how does it help one would ask, righ?
Well, for starters, it helps by

Reducing Back Aches and Pain.
Provides you with strength during Labor
Eases tension in shoulders and back
Strengthens Legs and Pelvic Floor
Improves Circulation of fluids in body
And there are much more.

But the main thing that I want to emphasize is that it helps.

Some recommended exercises are:
Cat/Cow Pose
Elevated Head exercises 
Butterfly
Etc.

But don't forget to first consult your doctor.

Be safe and keep doing Yoga
