My journey of photography and drawing started with this wooden doll It is an artistic dummy used mainly for practicing autonomy drawing I found this so useful not only as a cool showpiece but also for shoots making videos like stop motion films and also drawing fictional characters This post could be considered a self recognition for this dummy
