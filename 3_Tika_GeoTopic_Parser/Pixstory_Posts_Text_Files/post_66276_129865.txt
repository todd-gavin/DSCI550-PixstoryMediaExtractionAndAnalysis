Ultimately this is a story about the fierce love between a parent and his children It explores the power of the intangible unquantifiable feeling of love the good of the man versus the good of mankind and the certainty that there s more in the universe than we can possibly understand The opening lines from Dylan Thomas poem Do not go gentle into that good night are repeated again and again as a reminder to not be complacent or accept death when there s a possible solution that could save your life Cooper encourages his children to look hard for the answers to their questions Interstellar is a visual masterpiece that has a human touch that propels it to greatness It is perhaps one of the best space movies ever made Food is running out The world is becoming overpopulated The Yankees look nothing more than a high school baseball team A crop blight is threatening the very existence of the human race Nolan drops into this terrifyingly realistic future plagued with dust storms and the risk of the world simply ending within grasp With this the nation turns its attention to farmers and away from the sciences and engineers to save the world While wormholes and other worlds seem like the work of science fiction the science is very real Though throughout the movie it sometimes gets a little confusing with a little thinking you can piece it together Essentially it s the Neil DeGrasse Tyson of movies The science is explained in a non condescending way We have an innate desire to survive That s why the people on earth in Interstellar begin to lose faith in the dream to leave the planet They are thinking of how they can solve the problems on Earth The very idea of the movie is thinking of a way to save our race However the movie explores the selfish motivations we also innately have The way it is explored is surprising and devastating
