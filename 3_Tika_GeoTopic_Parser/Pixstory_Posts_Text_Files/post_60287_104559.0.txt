Instagram Reels now has new features.
Instagram is raising the duration of Reels from 60 seconds to 90 seconds with the new updated capabilities.
In the extra 30 seconds, creators will have more opportunity to communicate with their audience, capture behind-the-scenes clips, or demonstrate any sort of creativity they like.

Fresh sound effects, such as air horns, crickets, drums, and more, have been added to Reels to allow producers to add emotions to their Reels. Reels now allows creators to import their own audio. 

This will allow them to add commentary or background noise to any video on the creator's camera roll that is at least 5 seconds long.

Reels will now include interactive stickers that were previously only available for Instagram Stories.

Poll Stickers to gather their audience's opinion on various themes, Quiz Stickers to test their audience, and Emoji Slider to allow their audience respond to the Reels are now available to creators.

The Amber Alerts tool on the social media site was recently established to assist in the search for missing children. The feature was created in collaboration with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children in the United States, the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children in the United Kingdom, the National Crime Agency in the United Kingdom, the Attorney General's Office in Mexico, the Australian Federal Police, and others.
