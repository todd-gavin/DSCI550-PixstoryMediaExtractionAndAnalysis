The United Nations Mission in Kabul has informed its staff that Taliban commanders have tried to impose their mandatory mandatory cover on UNAMA female staff by entering the office.

Heather Barr, a Human Rights Watch official, reposted the announcement on Twitter.

Ms. Barr, in charge of the Women's Human Rights Watch's office, asks the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) how she will protect the safety and freedom of her colleagues.

The Taliban claim that the new laws on women's clothing are a "recommendation", but they impose them compulsorily, including on Afghan women working in the UN office, the Human Rights Watch official wrote.

Heather Barr issued a statement to the UN office saying that a team of Taliban commanders went to the UN office on Monday and demanded that the hijab be observed by female UN staff.

According to a UNAMA statement, the agents even asked to enter the workplace of the UN staff to see if the female employees observed the hijab required by the group.

Taliban officials have said that if female employees do not wear the hijab, they are politely asked to do so.

A UNAMA statement to its staff said that officials from the Taliban's Ministry of Promoting Virtue and Prohibiting Virtue had erected two posters outside the organization of what they knew to be the Islamic veil.

The poster states that according to Islamic law, Muslim women must observe the hijab required by the Taliban.

The Taliban recently issued a decree requiring women to wear headscarves to stay at home as long as possible and to cover their entire bodies, including their faces, if they leave.

The decree also provides for punishment for those who do not comply, including that men in their families be punished.
