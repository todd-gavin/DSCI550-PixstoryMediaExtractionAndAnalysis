Aitoliko, also known as 'Greek version of Venice'. The aquatic town as it is called, or officially Aitoliko, is situated in the middle of Messolonghi Lagoon, 10km northeast of the historic town of Messolonghi. 

It began as a complex of many small islets that the local fishermen would join together with small wooden bridges. In time, works of embankment gave Aitoliko in 1972 its final shape. 

It is connected to the shore both on the east and on the west side with two arched, stone bridges of initial length of about 300m each, which have been declared historical and protected monuments.
