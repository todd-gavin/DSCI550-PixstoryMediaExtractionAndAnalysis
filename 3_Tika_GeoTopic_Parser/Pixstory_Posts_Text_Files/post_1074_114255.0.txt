Setting a new benchmark of honesty and integrity, a college professor in Bihar has returned his salary of two years and nine months worth nearly â‚¹24 lakh as students were not attending his Hindi classes since he joined the college in 2019. Dr Lalan Kumar, who teaches Hindi in Nitishwar College under Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar Bihar University (BRABU) in Muzaffarpur district, said he fears "academic death" unless shifted to a different college by the affiliating university. Out of 131 students, he claimed that none of them attended his class. "Why should I accept salary when I have not taught the students enrolled in the department?" he said, according to The New Indian Express. He has returned his salary by sending a cheque and a letter to the university vice-chancellor. -1:0-5 / 0:10
