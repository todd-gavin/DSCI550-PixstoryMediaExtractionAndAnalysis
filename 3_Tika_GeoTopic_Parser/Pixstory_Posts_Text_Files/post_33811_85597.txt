Manchester City full-back Aleksander Zinchenko is back speaking to the BBC about the outbreak of conflict in his home country of Ukraine At midnight my wife woke me up crying the invasion in Ukraine started I was in shock He showed me videos and photos of what was happening Maybe the worst feeling when someone you know is dying because you feel the pain inside But this is so much worse one week that I am crying all the time Even in the car while driving from the training ground to home everything in my head Imagine the place where you are born and raised was thrown down I will be honest if it wasn&#39;t for my daughter or my family I would be there I know the people of my country and their mentality they prefer to die and they will die but they will not give up My mission is to show the world what is happening In some cities Russian citizens are coming to stage fake demonstrations saying they want to join Russia People are starving they are trying to survive they sleep on the ground in bunkers they cannot have a real life I am surprised how no Russian footballer I have said nothing Some play for the national team and have thousands of followers They can do something to stop the war because people listen to them I know they are afraid but what about them Nothing will be done to them They could at least take a stand but instead they ignore it all I don&#39;t understand why
