Tomorrow the Italian football team will play against the Argentina football team the football world will get the third champion of The Finalissima Yes you heard it right The Finalissima is the one off fixture played between the Euro Champions and CONMEBOL Champions and because of that Italy Euro champions will face Argent CONNEBOL champions on nd June and timings of the match will be am The Finalissima will be a one off fixture which will play over ninety minutes and there will be no extra time which means if the match is level at the end of ninety minutes then the match will be decided by the penalties shoot out Before The Finalissima happened only twice which was way back in and when France defeated Uruguay in Paris and Argentina defeated Denmark on penalties in Argentina respectively As a neutral fan I think UEFA and CONMEBOL joined hands to organise The Finalissima just to pull more crowds and because of that they will earn more money from ticket sales and television rights
