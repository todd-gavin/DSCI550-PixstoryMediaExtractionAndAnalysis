Last night, we extended our excellent start to the season with a comfortable win in the Europa League at the Emirates Stadium. Letâ€™s take a look at some player ratings from the gameâ€¦Turner - 7 - Made some nice saves in the second half but wasnâ€™t tested too much. Tierney - 7 - Getting back to his best. Great shot to create Eddieâ€™s goal.Gabriel - 7 - Thought he made some excellent tackles after his mistake on Saturday.Holding - 8 - Scored a nice goal. The Europa League Van Dijk.Tomiyasu - 7 - Very solid at both right and left back.Lokonga - 6 - Decent on the ball and wasnâ€™t too threatened defensively. Solid.Xhaka - 7 - Solid performance from the captain. That yellow card was classic Granitâ€¦ ðŸ¤£Vieira - 8.5 - MOTM -  Scored and got an assist, but he could (and probably should) have had a few more goals. Had a couple of really nice chances. Exciting player nonetheless.Martinelli - 6 - Fairly quiet but understandable. Heâ€™s had to play Premier League and Europa League this season.Nketiah - 8 - Another good display for Eddie - but like Vieira he probably could have scored a few. Unlucky that Jesus is so good, because Nketiah could start for loads of Premier League sides.Marquinhos - 6 - Quiet. Didnâ€™t seem to quite click today.Subs:Jesus - 8 - Unbelievable assist for the third goal.Ã˜degaard & Saka - 6 - Didnâ€™t do a whole lot but way too good for Europa League football.White - 5 - Didnâ€™t have much timeNelson - 6 - Looked good when he came on. Hope he can offer us something this season.
