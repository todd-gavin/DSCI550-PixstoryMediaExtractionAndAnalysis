Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has left several Indian students stranded in different parts of the war-torn country. While many have been able to return, there are numerous others unable to cross into the borders of neighbouring countries due to intense fighting. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has said that it is deeply concerned about Indian students in Sumy, however, all students from Pisochyn have been successfully evacuated.

Data journalist from The Hindu’s Business Line, Parvathi Benu, tweeted on March 4 that the Tamil Nadu (TN) government arranged for transportation to evacuate students from Pisochyn. It paid for the transportation of 35 students from the state.

Benu had been tweeting about the plight of students. On March 3, DMK MP Kanimozhi Karunanidhi asked for the contact details of the students and the next day, a bus was arranged.

However, a counter-claim suggested that the students were evacuated due to the efforts of the central government under ‘Operation Ganga’. TV9 executive editor Aditya Raj Kaul tweeted that the Tamil Nadu government had “nothing to do” with the evacuation.

Alt News spoke with Dr Yazhini PM, State Deputy Secretary of the DMK’s NRI wing. She said that the Tamil Nadu government paid for the transportation of 35 students from Pisochyn to the Romanian border. “I was in touch with the students. They were unable to board the buses as they were being charged $500 per person,” she said.

Dr Yazhini further informed that the Tamil Nadu government made a payment of $17,500 dollars to the bus contractor through Dr AP Vijayakumar, a former medical student of the Vinnytsia National Pirogov Medical University. Dr Vjayakumar was coordinating with state government bureaucrats, including IAS Jacintha Lazarus, Commissioner of Rehabilitation and Welfare of Non-Resident Tamils.
