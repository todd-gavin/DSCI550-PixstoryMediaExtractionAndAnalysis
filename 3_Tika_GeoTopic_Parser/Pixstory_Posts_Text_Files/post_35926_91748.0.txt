President Biden has again found himself at the receiving end of criticism after a major faux pas during a speech on April 2. During the Commissioning Commemoration Ceremony of the USS Delaware, Biden referred to Michelle Obama as the ‘Vice President’ by an unfortunate mistake.

During the address, what Biden wanted to convey was a note of gratitude to his wife and the First Lady of the US, Jill Biden, for the work she had been doing. Instead of saying, “I’m deeply proud of the work she is doing as First Lady with the Joining Forces initiative she started with Michelle Obama when I was Vice President and now carries on”, Biden referred to Michelle Obama as the Vice President.
