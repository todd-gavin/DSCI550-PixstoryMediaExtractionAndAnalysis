The late mangaka Kentaro Miura’s Berserk has already established itself as a gem among gems in the anime and manga community. But what makes the series so special among a myriad of great mangas? 


For one, this is probably the only time a manga has barely ever acted out like one and has instead portrayed itself as almost a sort on novel in comic form. From a tale of dark blood infested revenge to letting go and protecting what matters to you, and going deeper into the philosophical elements of fate and human will, and exploring deep questions.

Does man have any control over fate or are we just another pawn in life’s dark and twisted game, created to be manipulated by this abstract entity known as fate? Does human will have any strength and significance at all and if it is strong enough, can it defy the machinations of fate? 
Berserk was a stroke of intellectual, creative and philosophical genius and few mangas have ever matched it in that regard. Or whether it is the detailed and unique art style which is sick that it certainly does not play out like any manga I have ever seen.

With a sweet story, great characters from those you like and love to those you hate and despise, Berserk made you remember about every single character in the exact way that it wanted.
 And the fact that Kentaro Miura left the world has created a horrible gap in the world of manga and anime which will never be filled again. 
There are many beautiful mangas out there worthy of praise, but Berserk is not just a manga, it is the pinnacle of a dark fantasy novel which just has the form of a manga.
 If The Lord Of The Rings is the greatest fantasy novel ever created and J.R.R Tolkien the greatest fantasy writer of all time, then Berserk is the LOTR of mangas, and Kentaro the Tolkien of all mangakas. With its beauty and details unsurpassed and the fact that it is on a hold and its creator gone, is a great loss and simply nerve wracking. RIP Kentaro Miura.
