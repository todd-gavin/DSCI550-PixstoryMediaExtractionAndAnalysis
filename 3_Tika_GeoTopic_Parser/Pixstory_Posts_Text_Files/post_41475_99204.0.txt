The Minnesota Twins beat the Oakland Athletics 4-3 on Sunday, with Jorge Polanco hitting another critical hit and the bullpen combining for 6 2/3 innings of scoreless work. 

US News reported that since starting the season 4-8, the Twins have swept three of their past five series and won 14 of their last 17 games. 

A day after an early exit, Minnesota star outfielder Byron Buxton did not play for the AL Central leaders. He is on the mend from a minor right hip strain. Despite shortstop Carlos Correa's injury to his finger, the Twins have continued to win.

“It’s been different guys stepping up and that’s a little bit of our identity right now,” said Minnesota bench coach Jayce Tingler, who is acting manager while Rocco Baldelli is out with COVID-19.

“We know nobody’s going to feel sorry for you. Other teams have guys that are out, whether it’s pitching or in the lineup and so we kind of understand task at hand and everybody’s got a role to do and they’re doing a great job of doing their jobs right now," he said.
