World Vitiligo Day started on 25 June 2011. On this day a voice was raised to oppose the discrimination and bullying of the people with Vitiligo disorder. Judging someone because of the color of their skin is a kind of prejudice that should be opposed and ended in this day and age. We should educate each other and understand the fact that this is a common medical condition and nothing else. On this World Vitiligo Day, let's take a pledge to spread awareness about vitiligo and move in the forward direction together.
