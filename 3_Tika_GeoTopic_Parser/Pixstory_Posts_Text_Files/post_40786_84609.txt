My apologies Sona Journeying through the terrain of my verse in these rains inconvenienced you Unseasonal are the monsoons here The alleyways of my poetry are frequently damp Water gathers often in the ditches If you trip and fall here you run the risk of spraining a foot My apologies however You were inconvenienced because the light in my verse is somewhat dim The stones at my threshold are imperceptible as you pass I have often cracked a toenail against them As for the streetlamp at the crossroads it has remained unlit for aeons You were inconvenienced My apologies my heartfelt apologies Gulzar
