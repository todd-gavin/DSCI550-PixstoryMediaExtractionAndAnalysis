After spending his entire career under the WWE banner Bray Wyatt might want to seek greener pastures away from the sports entertainment juggernaut Perhaps he would consider following in his late friend Brodie Lee s footsteps and making the jump to AEW There he would have a brand new roster to work with and the potential for dream matches is mouth watering Imagine a supernatural rivalry with Malakai Black Both wrestlers draw on dark elements similar to Wyatt and would make for natural rivals Alternatively Wyatt could also take over the Dark Order faction and shape it in his image as a tribute to his late friend There are also other potential dream matches with The Elite and a chance to face an old rival in Jon Moxley which harkens back to their Wyatt Family vs The Shield days During a recent interview on WFAN s Moose Maggie Show Tony Khan was asked about Windham Rotunda aka Bray Wyatt potentially joining his company and he had this to say He s a great wrestler and I have to be honest we haven t talked at all said Tony Khan I ve known him in personal life but in reality we haven t talked But you never know H T PWInsider Tony Khan is a big believer in letting talent take ownership of their characters and promos which sounds like heaven to the ears of someone like Wyatt The fact that Bray was able to thrive in a stifling WWE environment would make wrestling fans even more excited to see him fully unleash his creative freedom in liberating surroundings such as AEW
