Incredible what is happening in Moto Gp The motorcycles of the pilots should have arrived today in Argentina where the next grand prix will be held Instead they will not arrive before tomorrow afternoon because they are blocked in Kenya due to the breakdown of the cargo plane that was transporting them A problem not just given that there will be free practice on Friday The bikes risk not arriving on time given that the crates that were supposed to transport the materials from Lombok to Tucum na a few kilometers from Termas de Rio Hondo are currently stopped
