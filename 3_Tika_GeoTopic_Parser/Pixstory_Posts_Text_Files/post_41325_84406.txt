The Conservative Political Action Conference or Cpac for short is a fantastic method to get a sense of the Republican Party s grass roots activists mood BBC reported that if the four day gathering in Orlando Florida on Sunday night is any indicator the party s conservative base is far more concerned about defeating Democrats in November s congressional mid term elections than they are about Russia s invasion of Ukraine Some of the party s highest ranking officials like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Florida Senator Rick Scott made no mention of Ukraine in their addresses Donald Trump who took the stage on Saturday night quickly condemned the invasion but spent more time defending his interactions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky which led to his first impeachment as well as his earlier this week statements calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a genius He went on to say that Nato countries and the current US administration were both stupid Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz one of Mr Trump s most ardent backers went even farther questioning why the US should be footing the bill for Ukraine by applying sanctions that could harm the American economy Others such as Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana warned of evil people in power without addressing Mr Putin by name Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was very cautious in his remarks about Ukraine
