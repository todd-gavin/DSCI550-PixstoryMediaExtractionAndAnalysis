Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has accused his predecessor Scott Morrison of orchestrating an "unprecedented trashing of democracy", revealing the former PM secretly appointed himself to five ministries during the term of the previous government.

Mr Albanese said that in addition to appointing himself to the health, finance and resources portfolios, Mr Morrison also gave himself joint responsibility for home affairs, treasury and industry.

He said Mr Morrison took joint responsibilities for the health and finance portfolios in May 2020.

He took on home affairs and treasury in early May 2021, and industry, science and the resources portfolios the following month.

Morrison accused of misleading parliament

Mr Albanese said the former prime minister had undermined the checks and balances crucial to the Westminster system of government.

"[He was] operating in secret, keeping the operations of the government from the Australian people themselves," he said.

"He was misleading parliament as to who was holding what portfolios and who was responsible." 

Mr Albanese said he would receive advice on the matter from the Solicitor-General next Monday.

"This is a sad indictment of not just Mr Morrison but his cabinet colleagues who sat back and allowed this to happen," Mr Albanese said.

"The implications are still being worked through.

"I cannot conceive of the mindset that has created this ... the way the government has functioned that has led to a point where.that occurs and how a cabinet allows that to happen.

"Once you go down that road of creating a cabinet committee with one member on it, so as to avoid scrutiny, it's not surprising that further steps will made."
