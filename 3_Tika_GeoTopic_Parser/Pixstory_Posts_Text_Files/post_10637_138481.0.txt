Reigning FIA Formula One World Champion Max Verstappen secured his 30th Grand Prix victory and 10th win of the 2022 season with a brilliant drive for Oracle Red Bull Racing on home soil in the Dutch Grand Prix, with team-mate Sergio Pérez claiming firth place at the Circuit Zandvoort

Verstappen started his home race from pole position and was totally dominant after making a perfect start and leading the field away on the short run to Zandvoort’s first turn.

Despite a Virtual Safety Car and later Safety Car throwing potential spanners into the works, Verstappen was simply too good for the rest of the field and cruised to victory over Mercedes driver George Russell by 4.071s, much to the delight of the massive Dutch crowd.

With Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc finishing in third place, Verstappen extended his lead in the Drivers’ Standings to an impressive 109 points over both Leclerc and team-mate Sergio Pérez, who both started and finished the race in fifth position. The pair are now tied on 201 points each after Zandvoort.

It was a tough day for Scuderia AlphaTauri after a promising qualifying session on Saturday. Both drivers lost positions at the start and then Yuki Tsunoda suffered a car malfunction late in the race that resulted in a DNF, while Pierre Gasly just missed the points-scoring positions in 11th.

"Today was quite eventful and not a straightforward race at all. We had to make the right calls and it all worked out well in the end. Mercedes were very quick on the harder compound, which we didn't expect, so it made it more difficult for us as we were less compatible with the hards. We managed everything quite well and we made the right calls on the strategy, so well done to the team here and back at the factory. It's always special to win your home Grand Prix, but this year I had to work even harder for it. It's incredible to win again in front of this crowd, we've had unbelievable support here and I'm proud to be Dutch," said Verstappen.
