The structures seen adjacent to the main temple are also historic and were in existence in the times of Buchanan as they are today. Buchanan traces the origins of these structures, which in his words is:-

“The largest heap now remaining is at the north east corner, where there is a very large terrace on which are two modern small temples. The one to the east is called Bageswori, and was erected by one of the Mahants of the convent. The image was dug up from the ruins and obtained an orthodox name. It had been employed before as an ornament, not as an object of worship. The temple of Tara Devi is towards the west, and its history is the same.”

Cunningham (1861) has mentioned that the Tara Devi temple contained only a standing male figure with a short inscription over the right shoulder of about 1000 A.D. The Bageshwari temple contained a seated male figure, holding a lotus in his left hand, and a sword in his uplifted right hand, with a Buddhist tope on each side of him. The temples were erected by the ancestors of the Mahant of the Bodh Gaya Math. The site of Bageswari has been pointed out to be the site of the Animesh Lochana Chaitya or “fixed gaze shrine” of the Buddhist tradition, where it is believed, Buddha stood steadfast gazing fixedly on the scene of his enlightenment in the second week after the memorable event. Cunningham, however identified this sacred spot with a large basement immediately to the north of the Ratn Chakraman Sthala and on the other side of the railing.
