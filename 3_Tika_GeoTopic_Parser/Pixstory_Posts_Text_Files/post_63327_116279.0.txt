What's the best way to support our minerals? Including nutrient-dense foods every day.
When we make these foods staples we provide our bodies with a consistent source and can heal imbalances and prevent them in the future.

My Top 5 Mineral Supportive Foods:

1. Beef liver/organ meats: Beef liver is rich in copper and other minerals like zinc and selenium. It also contains 100% of our needs for vitamins B12 and A. Most people do not get enough vitamin A--it's important for thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and our sex hormones.

add beef liver to ground meats once a week but also
supplement with the organ complex from Paleovalley.

2. Bone broth: A great source of calcium, sodium, and
potassium. You can make your own and add leafy greens during the cooking process to extract even more calcium and add some magnesium.

3. Fruit: Rich in potassium and vitamin C (which gives us copper). High potassium fruit: coconut, guava, kiwi,
banana, melon, papaya, pineapple, oranges, peaches,
grapefruit, and mango.

4. Dairy: This is our best source of calcium since it also
contains vitamin K2, which helps ensure calcium gets to our bones and teeth. Dairy is also rich in fat-soluble
vitamins, which are important for overall and hormone
health.

5. Starchy veggies: All potatoes and squash are rich in
potassium and provide nourishing carbohydrates to
support thyroid and hormone health. I also love plantains-| saut√© them in butter or coconut oil with sea salt. So delicious!
