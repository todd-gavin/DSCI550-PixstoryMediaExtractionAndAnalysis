One of the best ways to celebrate this day and honour the lives of world leaders who have won their battles without violence, we could choose one of these people and read their biography—find out what motivated them to act as they did, what helped keep them strong even when they saw terrible things happening all around them.Such people include Civil Rights activists Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, Beatles star John Lennon, humanitarian activist and “King of Calypso” Harry Belafonte, and of course anti-apartheid movement leader Nelson Mandela. The life stories of each of these people is fascinating and inspiring. If you have children, this day could be the perfect time to teach them the virtues of bravery, compassion, and perseverance.Moreover, in order to prevent your children from becoming cruel to one another as they grow up and become deserving successors to the people named above, it is crucial to inculcate in them a strong sense of right and wrong. Children will ultimately influence history; they are the future. Make sure to do your part to remember the courage and goodness of people like Mahatma Ghandi and carry on their legacy, no matter how you choose to mark the International Day of Non-Violence.
