By BestMediaInfo Bureau Launched in December 2019, Bhojpuri movie channel Zee Biskope has managed to bag 100+ marketing awards in the last two quarters. The channel aims at instigating a brand love for itself through various social media and on-ground initiatives. These activities have resulted in the channel carving a niche for itself in the category, as per Amarpreet Singh Saini, Chief Channel Officer, Zee Ganga and Zee Biskope and Samrat Ghosh, Cluster Business Head - Zee Bangla and Zee Bangla Cinema. “If you look at the culture on which the Zee Network has been built - it is consumer centricity and innovation. This is what we have embraced across all our channels including Zee Biskope. Over the last three years, it has transformed itself into a brand of love and kindness. For us, it is more important than the viewership that the brand should be at the top of the mind of the consumer and should touch their hearts,” said Ghosh. “With the launch, it has not only claimed the leadership position but it has also expanded the category. Along with the innovative content offering, we have also been able to raise the viewer experience and have given them a niche experience,” he addedAs per Ghosh, the audience today has evolved. He said none of the viewers wants the engagement to stay only passive in nature. “They want to engage with the content because the audience themselves are content- generators today. For them to do that you have to give them an experience which is beyond viewing. We have brought Bhojpuri, as a language, to the limelight, and therefore the efforts are getting appreciated not only by viewers but also the industry,” he explained. Saini also said that while other channels use advertising to just announce movie titles, they use it for making people realise the value of the brand.
