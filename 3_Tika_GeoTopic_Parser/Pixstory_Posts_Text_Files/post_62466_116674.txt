Cats are far more individualistic than dogs They will pack up and move out if they don t like their current home or their housemates They choose to be present therefore they are Furthermore cats are also naturally solitary they thrive in isolation I believe that preventing a cat from being who they are can be extremely cruel to the animal like Mr Campbell said In some circumstances it reveals a mentality that views the animal as a possession rather than a living thing with rights of its own BUT BUT BUT What you said is absolutely correct too Outdoors are extremely dangerous for indoor cats who are not used to the challenges of the outside Or for that matter outdoor cats too if there are predators around There is no hard and fast rule about whether a cat should be taken outside or not If you live in an area that is dangerous for the cat then don t if your surroundings are fairly safer for them why not Cats like the outside even though they are perfectly capable of staying indoors without much a problem You can have a sunbath area for them and they ll be more than happy If they want to go outside it s always a good idea to leash train them Even though it s not easy to train all cats to be in harness because like I said they love their freedom it s fairly worth it They get to go out and get to be safe too
