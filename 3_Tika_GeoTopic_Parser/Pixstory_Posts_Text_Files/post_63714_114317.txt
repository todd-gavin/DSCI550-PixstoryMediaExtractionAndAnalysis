There are many shows out there which do not meet their online hype but the one show which is one of the biggest victims of being overhyped and ultimately being overrated is Stranger Things While definitely a good show it simply does not meet its reputation as being one of the greatest horror mystery shows of all time Most of the time Stranger things has the same plot There is some Lovecraftian monster who appears from a parallel universe into the town of Hawkins because a gate between the two dimensions exists there All this happens whilst teenage kids fight the monsters and one of them has psychic powers and ultimately they all survive the horror through the power of friendship or whatever Probably the biggest problem here is that the entire show seems to ride on Eleven s powers And if you want to say that Stranger Things is all about the power of that sweet friendship love and courage then sorry to say but you have other movies like Lord Of The Rings which do that a lot better Furthermore a big chunk of the show seems to survive on s nostalgia with all its American pop culture references and for that part of the audience which was neither born in the s nor is American such a crucial aspect of the show is going to make little difference Again it is not that Stranger Things is a bad show it is actually pretty good In fact the first season is brilliant but after that it just messes up bad The second season is whatever and the third season outright sucks It is not until the fourth season that we get any sort of redemption because season is simply awesome So while Stranger Things is a good show which deserves to be successful its hype is overblown by gargantuan proportions Stranger Things is almost like a messy concoction of many fine ingredients with the main theme being sci fi and thriller with a strong dose of mystery and some horror ultimately giving tribute to legends like H P Lovecraft Steven Spielberg and Stephen king
