The Bournemouth and Wales midfielder David Brooks has been given the all-clear after cancer treatment. The 24-year-old announced in October that he had been diagnosed with stage two Hodgkin lymphoma and was due to start treatment immediately.

“It has been a few months since my last update and in that time I have thankfully completed my cancer treatment,” Brooks tweeted. “I would like to say a huge thank you to all of the incredible medical staff for their amazing work and support throughout the process.
