Ms Marvel made way into our homes on th June when Iman Vellani s Kamala Khan started her superhero journey The episode started off pretty decent setting up the characters The family setting of the Khan family was something that we don t often see in American households and so that was something spectacular to see As the episode progressed we slowly started to realise why our Asian friends always bailed out on our predetermined plans Khan family created a setting which resonated with many Asian families as they made sure that they detailed the struggles that a Brown Teen has to face in an household We could all understand the dilemma that stood before Kamala when she chose to go to the AvengersCon rather than obeying her parents while we all loved the rebellious little cinnamon roll we just couldn t help but think of the Khans and how they might feel when Kamala doesn t show up before the curfew time The episode ended with a tussle between Kamala and her mom after Kamala discovered her new powers at AvengersCon The first episode while being fun wasn t very exciting Hence the credits scene was the only thing that saved the episode for me The scene saw what presumably could be SWORD to start an investigation on Kamala Khan While the first episode isn t a total indication of how a series might fair but it still cannot be ignored Here s to hoping that that the next episodes are better than the series premiere
