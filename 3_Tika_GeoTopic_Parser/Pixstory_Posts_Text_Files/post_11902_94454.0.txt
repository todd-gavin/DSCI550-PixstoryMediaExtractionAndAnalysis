Mothers to be have always started prepping from the moment they realise they are going to bring a new life. And to maintain their health and their food in takes are all monitored frequently through check ups and so forth. 

And new study proves on how maternal exercise during the carrying period improves the metabolic health of the child even when the mother is experiencing obesity or is on high fat diet. 

As the mother exercises a placenta secretes the key protein named as SOD3 which results in lower risks of diabetes on the child. 

A worrying trend 

A current trend that's turning into a great concern is maternal besity and type 2 diabetes which are on rise. For over 30% of women in the childbearing age in Western and Asian countries are categorised ad obese. 

There will be almost 630 million people expected to be living with type 2 diabetes by 2045. Mothers who are obese or who have type 2 diabetes their children are at higher risks of having diabetes even if they lead a healthy life. 

The team of researchers did previously prove that exercise during the pregnancy period has great effects on the offspring's metabolic health. 

The placenta derived SOD3 that stands for supuroexide dismutase 3 has a pivotal role in transferring the benefits of maternal exercise to the offspring. 

The team learned about how SOD3 puts a stop to the negative effects of obesity that could be passed down to the child from the mother.
