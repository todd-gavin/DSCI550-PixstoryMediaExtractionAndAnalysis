A Manhattan woman was found dead with head trauma in the bathtub of her East Harlem apartment, and police were questioning a niece who tried to stop officers from coming in to check on the tenant, cops said Saturday.

Police arrived at a third-floor apartment at E. 100th St. near Third Ave. about 6:15 p.m. Friday and found the 56-year-old victim dead and fully clothed in the tub, with blood on her face and bruises on her head.

The medical examiner will determine how the woman died, but police referred to her death as a homicide.
