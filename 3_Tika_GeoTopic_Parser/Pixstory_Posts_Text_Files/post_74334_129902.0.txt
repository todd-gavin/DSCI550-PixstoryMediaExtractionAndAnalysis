Arsenal fans were made to wait 3 years to watch Saliba play in their red & white but oh boy was it worth the wait. Man of the match in his first Premier League start. Away at Crystal Palace? Something special was brewing.

Against Leicester, still very solid. But an unlucky own goal was made the key talking point. The Emirates though, instead of putting the player down, rose & cheered him on. A sign of respect for their centre back.

That respect was justified today. A rolls royce performance at the back against Bournemouth, Saliba completed 100% of 75 passes. The first Arsenal defender to do so since OPTA records begun in 2003. 

With Arsenal fans chanting his name all game, he added his first goal. Top bins, caressing the ball into the top corner, on his weaker footâ€¦ 

Early it might be but William Saliba looks every bit of the TRUTH!
