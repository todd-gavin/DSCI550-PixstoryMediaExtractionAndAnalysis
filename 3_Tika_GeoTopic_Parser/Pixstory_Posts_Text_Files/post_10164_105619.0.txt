At first, it was too difficult for me to convince her because she didnâ€™t want to post her pictures on social media. And I have the idea of her wearing the traditional dress to show the world the beauty of our culture. And then come up with the idea of the burqa, wearing it is a choice, not force.

For most Afghan parents a girl posting pictures on social media is an awful thing. This is a matter of great importance and hence they take it strictly.

We went to Masjid Moath at 5:30 am to just have beautiful pictures of portraits of this afghan beautiful girl. And it was quite an amazing experience for me.
