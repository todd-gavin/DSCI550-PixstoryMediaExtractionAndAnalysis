Bhumi Pednekar exactly knows how to set temperatures soaring high with her bold looks. The actress did the same with the series of pictures she shared on social media on Sunday (July 03). "Birthday Month," captioned Bhumi on Instagram, adding a crab emoji indicating that July marks her birthday and she belongs to the Cancer zodiac sign. 🎂🎂🥳🎊🎉🍾

In the first picture, the actor looked quite dreamy, donning an orange-textured bikini top, knotted down the waist, as Bhumi struck an appealing pose with eyes closed and hands behind her head. She had worn a multi-coloured satin shrug on top of her swimsuit which had wave-like patterns.
Bhumi acted coy 😍❤️❤️

in the second picture, seemingly hiding her face with both hands, smiling broadly. She kept her hair in a bun, however, she braided a small lock of hair which looked quite unique.🔥❤️‍🔥

In the third picture, Bhumi surely stole the hearts of her fans with a piercing look, as she posed in front of the camera, placing both her hands behind her neck. Her no-makeup makeup look, with a shiny nude lipstick shade, enhanced her looks further.🔥🔥😍
