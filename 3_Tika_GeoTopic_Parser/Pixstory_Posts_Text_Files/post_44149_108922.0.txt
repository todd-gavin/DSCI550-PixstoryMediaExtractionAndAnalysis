Raphinha is a target for Arsenal, and the Gunners are likely to make an official approach to Leeds United about a deal. Raphinha, 25, is out of contract after two years and is unlikely to sign a new contract at Elland Road. Barcelona is also said to be interested in Raphinha, whose agent is former Barcelona player Deco.

In October 2020, the Brazil international signed a four-year contract with Leeds after joining from Ligue 1 club Rennes. In his debut season, he scored six goals and added eight assists in 29 Premier League games, while last season he scored 11 goals and added three assists in 35 league appearances.

Meanwhile, Arsenal is still in talks with Manchester City to sign Gabriel Jesus. The Brazilian international's asking price is reported to be Â£50 million.

The first north London derby will take place on October 1 at Emirates Stadium, with the return game at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium scheduled for January 14.
