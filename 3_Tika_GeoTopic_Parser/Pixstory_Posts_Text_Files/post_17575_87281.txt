The Lakers were very rarely within striking distance during a point loss to the Suns and it spoke to a larger point about the Lakers game to game mentality this season as James discussed I think when we get down we ve lost so many games that we feel like we can t get out of the hole at times Teams go on a run or run tonight we were up and then they went on a quick run after that I don t even know the run it was but they just started blitzing us after that and we just as a collective unit we haven t been in the foxhole enough to be able to say OK we can get out of this It s something that s hurt us all throughout the season
