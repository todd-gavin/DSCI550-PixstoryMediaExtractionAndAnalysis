When we discuss women's suffrage, we only refer to what it was like in the early 1900s. No one brings up the topic of modern women's suffrage. 
It feels like we're always talking about the past, as if women in today's culture aren't suffering. 

As Gabby Miller talks about, when it comes to Women's History Month, no one talks about what women face now. Instead, they recall a time when women were not permitted to wear pants because they were considered too masculine. This argument does not imply that you should never discuss the past. Talking about history, on the other hand, helps others comprehend what someone is going through.

It is critical to discuss the past, particularly to educate individuals who do not know or grasp a historical topic. Furthermore, it raises awareness among those who are unaware of a challenge that various people have suffered throughout history. 

It's a different story if someone only talks about the past. 

Ms. Miller rightly points out that women still face challenges in today's culture, and if people continue to focus on the past, there would be little place to address the current. 
Women have been pushed to the outside of society for decades. In some ways, this is still going on today. 

Instead of focusing on the past, Women's History Month should highlight the various problems that women face now.
