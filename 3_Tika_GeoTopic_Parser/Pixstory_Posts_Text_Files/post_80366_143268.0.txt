#8 Ezequiel Lavezzi
Lavezzi might have a prolific career at PSG regardless; he was deemed as a valuable player for the French team. The Argentine joined from Napoli and was thrust into the starting line-up. He played alongside Cavani and Ibrahimovic. 
In his four years at PSG, the player made 161 appearances for PSG and registered 36 goals. He lifted four Ligue 1 trophies and two Coupe de la Ligue in his PSG career. 
#7 Guillaume Hoarau
PSG saw his talent in Ligue 2 and decided to sign the player; the signing was fruitful as Hoarau demonstrated his goal-scoring prowess in the games. Hoarau struck 20 goals and 47 matches in his first season at PSG but couldn't take the same form as next season. However, in 2010/11 campaign, he came back firing on all cylinders. 
Hoarau left the club in 2013, racking 56 goals in 161 appearances and winning the Ligue in 2012/13. 
#6 Pauleta
The Portuguese became a recognised player in Ligue 1 when he joined Bordeaux and there he evolved into one of the best strikers in Ligue 1, scoring 92 goals for the club. PSG were quick to cash in and landed the player in 2003. 
Every penny was worth it as the player reached the double figure in every match. Pauleta left his mark on the mark and won Coupe de France twice. He starred in 211 games for PSG and struck 109 goals.
