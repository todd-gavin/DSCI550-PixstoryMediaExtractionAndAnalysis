There comes a moment in everyone's life which changes the way they have lived their lives till then. Vijay Barse was a physical education teacher in Nagpur. He had always been conscious of social inequalities that prevail in our society but the moment to change in his life had not arrived.It came one day while going back home when he saw slum kids playing football. 20 years down the line iconic actor Amitabh Bachchan is going to play Barse in the movie, Jhund, releasing on March 4. So what exactly happened that one day, in his own words....

My father worked as a head constable in police before India's Independence. He was from Nagpur but was always being transferred. He looked after a big family of ten kids. My father used to be transferred to far off places a lot. Father had an innate nature to help people, he used to do it a lot causing strife from his seniors. It would result in suspensions or dismissals for months, these were periods of struggle and we had nothing to eat sometimes. Still he was proud of this and I believe that poverty makes strong people.
My father was talking to a friend, his friend told him shouldn't spend all the money on his family at once but save it for rainy days. He had an interesting response, saying if he manages to save 110 rupees and distributes it among his children, they might fight for the remaining 10. He doesn't want that and he said that he just wants to keep his teachings for them. They should become good humans. What is the difference between animals and humans? 
For that father had a good analogy, he said that a dam (Mother of puppies) will send her children away by barking at them when she's drinking milk. He compared this to the situation at his home and said his wife wouldn't eat herself if her children were starving and she'd give the food to them. He said that his children should care and help others and this was imprinted on my mind.
