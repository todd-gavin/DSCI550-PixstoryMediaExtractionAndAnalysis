It was in May when i met Shivamurthy Murugha Sharanaru the head of the Chitradurga based Sri Jagadguru Murugharajendra Math one of the powerful Lingayat centres in Karnataka I was in Karnataka to cover the assembly elections The then chief minister Siddaramaiah had accorded minority religious status the power Lingayat community including the Veerashaivas The move was viewed with scepticism as many described it as an attempt to divide the Hindus Lingayats constitute of the state s population and influence the outcome in of the total constituencies They have for years supported the BJP after moving away from the Congress in when the then party president Rajiv Gandhi unceremoniously removed Veerendra Patil as the chief minister For years now they have been backing former chief minister BS Yediyurappa and had been upset with BJP after he was removed from the post in July last year There are several Lingayat maths across Karnataka and they run institutions and provides education and food to thousands of students irrespective of their religion all of them have a huge following across the state s political and social spectrum Before the elections the then BJP president and now union home minister Amit Shah had met Sharanaru to seek support for his party Siddaramaiah had also kept him in good humour That was the political clout Sharanaru wielded Over four years later reports about Sharanaru being arrested for allegedly sexually abusing minor school girls have shocked the entire state He had been charged under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences POCSO Act after two teenage girls alleged that they were abused for years When I met Sharanaru he came across as a very soft spoken but politically correct seer who would not open his cards despite repeated provocation Was that a facade Well if the charges against him are proven right it would cause a huge damage to the reputation of such institutions That would also show how religious leaders indulge in such immoral practices due to political patronage We have already seen one such example in Gurmeet Ram Rahim whose Dera Sacha Sauda wielded enormous political clout in Punjab and Haryana
