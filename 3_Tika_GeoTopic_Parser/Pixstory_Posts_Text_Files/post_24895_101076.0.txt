A man has been detained after Sheffield United captain Billy Sharp was assaulted by a fan at the end of the second leg of their Championship play-off semi-final at Nottingham Forest.

A fan charged Sharp during a pitch invasion while the player stood on the sidelines, according to television footage.

Forest won on penalties 3-2 after the two games were tied 3-3 on aggregate.

The former Forest player was knocked to the ground during a pitch invasion following Steve Cooper's team's Championship play-off semi-final triumph on penalties.

Sharp, who missed the match with a ruptured calf, required stitches due to the unprovoked attack, which occurred when he was standing on the sideline and ignoring his teammates' attempts to leave the field amid tens of thousands of jubilant home supporters.

The Nottinghamshire Police have detained a 31-year-old suspect in connection with the incident, after launching an investigation swiftly.

Chief Inspector Paul Hennessy of the Nottinghamshire Police stated, "A 31-year-old male has been detained on suspicion of assault in relation to this incident." Officers will question him while he remains in detention.

Sharp, who did not play due to injury, was on loan at Forest during the 2012-13 season.

Forest announced in a statement that the offending fan will be banned for life.
