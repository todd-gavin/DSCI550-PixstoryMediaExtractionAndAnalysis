this isn't a review because will never be able to properly review this book just know that emily henry wrote poppy wright for me and she's the light of my life and no man will ever be alex nilsen.
i know most emily henry readers rate this book as their least favorite, but its honestly still my favorite one. call it attachment because its the first one i read, but honestly just love it so much. i'm a friends to lovers person at my core, and something about alex and poppy will forever hit me so hard. maybe its the fact that i resonate with the way poppy feels like she doesn't belong idk but something about it is just so, so personal
