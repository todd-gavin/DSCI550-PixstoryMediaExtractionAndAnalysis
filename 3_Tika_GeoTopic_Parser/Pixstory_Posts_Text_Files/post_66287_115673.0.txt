The Burger at my college canteen is delicious and the best item that is found in the canteen. Numerous students come to the canteen to chat and eat this popular burger. It's popularity is due to it's unique set of recipe.

It includes Chicken & chorizo patty with a four-pepper relish, avocado-lime cream, crunchy pickled slaw, melted sharp cheddar & Oaxaca, and fried green tomatoes. This makes it really tasty as well as healthy.
