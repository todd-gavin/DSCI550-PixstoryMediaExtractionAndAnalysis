A new trailer for Top Gun: Maverick just released and Tom Cruise is looking amazing in it. In this sequel he's going to be teaching the graduates of Top Gun for a specialised mission. Tom reprises the role of Pete "Maverick" Mitchell. In the trailer, we can see Val Kilmer's Iceman being referred to and he will make an appearance. Jennifer Connelly is also seen in the trailer. Miles Teller is playing the role of Bradley Bradshaw, call sign "Rooster", he's the son of Maverick's late friend and Radar Intercept Officer, Lt. Nick Bradshaw, "Goose", who died in a training incident while flying along with Maverick. 
In a very dramatic sequence, Bradshaw tells Mitchell, 
"My dad believed in you. I'm not gonna make the same mistake." It's as intense as it gets. Jon Hamm also appears in the trailer but all the attention is on Tom Cruise, according to me after a long time he's doing a role that isn't in a complete action flick. He's going to be showing his amazing ability to the fullest extent as his character drives through the different emotional spectrum. 
The movie is set to release on 27th May 2022.

Here's the link of the trailer:
