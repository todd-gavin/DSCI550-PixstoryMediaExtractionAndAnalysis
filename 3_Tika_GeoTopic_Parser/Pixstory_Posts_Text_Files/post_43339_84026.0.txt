Sea turtles are an important component of marine ecosystems because they assist to maintain the health of seagrass beds and coral reefs, as well as providing a safe haven for a variety of marine animals. Sea turtles are also a source of food for animals on land and at sea. Human actions have made sea turtles susceptible to extinction during the last 200 years. Poaching, habitat damage, plastic pollution in the oceans, unintentional entanglement in fishing nets, and rubbish on the beaches are all factors that contribute to the mortality of sea turtles. You're connected to the sea with every drop of water you drink and every breath you take. It doesn't matter where you reside on the planet. The sea, like the ecosystem, has to be safeguarded since we rely on it as much as it depends on us.
