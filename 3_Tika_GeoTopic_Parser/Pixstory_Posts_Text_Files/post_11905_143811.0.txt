Underboob sweat season is officially upon us . Let's face it - to be clear , we've got nothing against a bit of sweat . After all , it's an entirely natural , biological process , which helps regulate our body temperature and literally keeps us alive ! ✅
But one of the biggest bugbears is the itchiness that goes hand in hand with underboob sweat , especially when you peel off a sports bra only to uncover an unsightly rash ! " Underboob sweating is your body’s natural way of regulating heat " . ✅
When can it happen ? 🤔
1 Large breasts
2 Wearing synthetic material 
3 Humid weather
4 Vigorous Workout
What can we do about it ?? ✅🤔
1 Ditch the synthetic material 
2 Use a moisturising powder to help prevent chafing and rashes 
3 Avoid tight tops and bras 
4 Try using a gentle exfoliant 
5 Stock up on foods that reduce body heat  
6 Use panty liners to mop up sweat 
7 Keep a bottle of argan oil handy

If you're silently dealing with the issue , remember that while sweating under your breasts is annoying , it's also totally normal and nothing to be ashamed of . 
Instead , embrace underboob sweat as it shows you’re working out hard and you’re well hydrated . ✅❤️
