Before our Europa League game, Martin Odegaard faced the media.𝐎𝐧 𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐡𝐞’𝐬 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐝 𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐢𝐧 𝐍𝐨𝐫𝐰𝐚𝐲 𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐠…I played for the under-21s and the national team but it’s been a while since I played here.𝐎𝐧 𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐞𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐢𝐧 𝐍𝐨𝐫𝐰𝐚𝐲…There were a lot of kids outside, training on the pitch next to the stadium. I saw a lot of Arsenal shirts, it’s good to see this reception and hopefully we will see them tomorrow and hopefully the atmosphere will be brilliant again. I think the fans here are really good, they did a good job at the Emirates as well so I’m looking forward to the game and the atmosphere.𝐎𝐧 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐬 𝐡𝐞 𝐥𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐚𝐬 𝐚 𝐜𝐚𝐩𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐦 𝐭𝐨 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭 𝐰𝐞𝐥𝐥…Same as always really. The same mindset as always, we want to affect the game and start strong. We always want to do that so we’ll try to do that tomorrow again.𝐎𝐧 𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐢𝐭’𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐛𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦 𝐨𝐟 𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐫 𝐬𝐨 𝐟𝐚𝐫…Yes I think so. I think I’ve developed a lot in the last few years. I’ve always been good on the ball but I feel like I’m developing a different side of my game now as well, without the ball. How to improve and affect the game in different ways, so yeah I feel like I’m doing well and of course when the team is doing well it makes things easier for me as well. I’m really happy to be part of this team and happy with where we are at the moment, but we want more of course.𝐎𝐧 𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐛𝐞𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐚𝐩𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐡𝐚𝐬 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞𝐝 𝐡𝐢𝐦…I haven’t thought too much about it to be honest. I try to do the same things, help the team as much as possible. I enjoy the responsibility and just try to do the best for the team always and hopefully that’s good.
