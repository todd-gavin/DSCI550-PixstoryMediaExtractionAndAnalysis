The Team of young superheroes formed by the Justice League to perform covert operations were assigned Black Canary superheroine and memeber of the JL to be their trainer and later counsellor The Team consists of prodigies wards and mentees of the JL members and thus aware of the complications and issues that arise with their line of work specially for those heroes who keep their identities hidden therapy with Black Canary is a scheduled thing for all the young heroes As a DC fan might know the heroes both young and adult in their own teams and outside form various bonds and friendships that help them live through this life they ve chosen Perhaps this line of work became their chosen path due to the tragedies in their lives as we know from the origin story of heroes like Batman Green Arrow Nightwing Red Robin Red Hood Batwoman Spoiler and many more But those tragedies have not been eradicated from their lives no matter how hard they work to keep crime at bay they still suffer at the hands of criminals murderers death in the family They go through Phases of coping of trying to survive while grieving just like many of us normal humans do but that s the point even though they re fictional they re human too in these regards Learning to grieve cope continue and move on with our lives in a healthy and right way is of the utmost importance for our own health We give in to the things that tempt us by telling that they ll be better to help make us forget and let go of what is hurting us but often times it turns out to be the opposite like in the case of Roy Harper or Jason Todd Fictional and real stories about life help us understand ourselves more we get help in identifying what we re feeling sometimes through these spells of reading and watching things Because sometimes help isn t forthcoming from the places you expect but that doesn t mean you can t get help elsewhere You can and you should because it s for yourself and your happiness only
