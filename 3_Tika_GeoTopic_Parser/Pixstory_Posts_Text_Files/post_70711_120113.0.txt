As we enter what appears to be the 21st century's equivalent of a cold war that has set China against the West, this hi-tech race is maybe the new "arms race."

The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved yet another revival package of 1.64 lakh crore to boost Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited's (BSNL) overall competitiveness in the challenging domestic telecom market and de-stress its balance sheet. After 2019, the second reform package will be implemented during the following four years. In order to improve the state-owned operator's services, reinforce its fragile balance sheet, and expand its fibre network by combining Bharat Broadband Nigam Limited (BBNL) and BSNL, three initiatives are included in the revival package. It is anticipated that the package will aid in a turnaround so that BSNL begins to produce a profit in FY2026-27.
