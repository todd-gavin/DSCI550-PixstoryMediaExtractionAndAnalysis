JOHN HERDMAN

You Might not have heard this name much, but he made Canada dream about FIFA World cup qualification and achieved it. Canada became the first team to qualify from the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF), ahead of the USA and Mexico. Canada has qualified only once in the world cup, 1986. 

John Herdman is an English coach, who has never played any senior professional matches. Instead, he started attending coaching lessons at the age of 16. For some time, he went to Brazil to learn coaching methods and started his own academy after returning he set up a Brazilian soccer school. Players from Sunderland started sending their kids there, which led to a job offer in the Sunderland academy. He spent three years there, working with a young Jordan Henderson, now a Liverpool and England star.


He used to take classes at the University for 4 days and a coaching session in the evening. His senior at University moved to New Zealand and suggested a coaching opportunity. Herdman took the Kiwi under-20 team to the 2006 and '08 FIFA-20 Women's World Cups before leading the senior side to the World Cup in 2007 and 2011(2006-2011). The Kiwis were in a down situation, after finishing last in the 2011 World Cup in Germany.

From there, he moved to Canada, where again worked with the Women 's team. He made the team win Olympic Game Bronze in 2012,2016 and 2011 Pan American Games gold. 

He changed football in Canada. After a successful period with the women 's team (2011-2018), he was given charge of the men's team, which was at 75th rank in 2019(now 33). 

"We're going to qualify for 2022 Qatar," he told a news conference in February 2019.

Using players like Bayern Munich star Alphonso Davies, Lille signed Jonathan David, experienced Atiba Hutchinson(94 Matches- captain) and goalkeeper Milan Borjan(63) he made the team strong and powerful in attack. Kyle Larin, who has netted 13 goals is the CONCACAF top scorer. Jonathan David has scored 9 goals in qualifiers. 
Canada have been CONCACAF Gold cup winners in 1985 and 2000.
