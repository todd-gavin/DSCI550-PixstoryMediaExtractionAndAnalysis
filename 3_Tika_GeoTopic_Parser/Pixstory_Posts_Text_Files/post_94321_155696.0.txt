After a one day gap, Matchday 2 of the ongoing U-17 women's World Cup kicked off yesterday, i.e on 14th October. Four very important matches between teams belonging to groups A and B were played yesterday while Group C and D teams will be playing their matches today. 
The 4 matches that took place last night were Brazil vs USA, New Zealand vs Nigeria, Germany vs Chile and India vs Morocco. There were no significant changes in the Group A points table after yesterday but things stirred up significantly in Group B. 
The much anticipated faceoff between the two giants of this tournament, namely USA and Brazil ended up in a 1-1 draw. Although the USA had better chances, it was a pretty even match and thus the two teams shared points. Before the match, USA were No.1 on Group A's points table whereas Brazil were No.2 (due to GD) and it stayed the same after this match. Both of them now have 4 points. 
In the other match from Group 2, India took on Morocco in a lost cause. The hosts suffered back to back defeats as Morocco thrashed them 3-0 and kept their hopes alive in the World Cup. With this win, Morocco now have 3 points and are right behind Brazil on the third spot. 
Let us now move on to Group B's matches. Nigeria took on New Zealand and thrashed them 4-0 to move up to the second spot in the points table with 3 points. In the other match, Germany defeated Chile by a whopping margin of 6-0. Chile dropped to the third spot while Germany maintained their position at the top of the table. 
As it now stands, USA, Brazil, Germany and Nigeria are the favourites to qualify for the knockouts from Groups A and B.
