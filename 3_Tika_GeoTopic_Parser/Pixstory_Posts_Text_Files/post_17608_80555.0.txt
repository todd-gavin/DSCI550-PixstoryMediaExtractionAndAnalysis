The Lakers’ Russell Westbrook experiment is a colossal failure, and it appears at least some within the organization have realized the same thing. But among the few other NBA teams that could be willing and able to take on a washed-up former superstar point guard who’s making $44 million this year and has an even more expensive player option for next season, there appears to be next-to-zero real interest in helping the Lakers undo their mistake.

The two teams where a deal involving a contract of Westbrook’s magnitude make at least an iota of sense—the New York Knicks and Houston Rockets—don’t appear all that willing to facilitate a Westbrook deal, for obvious reasons.

The rebuilding Rockets have discussed a trade with the Lakers centered around Westbrook and Houston’s own max contract albatross point guard, John Wall, but Houston has always wanted the Lakers’ 2027 first-round pick in return. The Lakers haven’t been willing to give it.

As we get closer to the deadline, talks remain at an impasse, with the Lakers refusing to trade the rights to select a current middle-schooler, according to NBA insider Marc Stein.

So with just around two hours to go until the deadline, it sounds like the Lakers aren’t really going to make a Westbrook deal.

Wall is a longtime Klutch sports client, and appears to be healthy currently, but has yet to play this season as the Rockets would rather focus on developing their young guards like 2021 No. 2 overall pick Jalen Green.

A trade sending Westbrook to the Knicks instead also seems a bit plausible on paper, as struggling former Lakers lottery pick Julius Randle appears done with New York just one season after an apparent breakout year in 2020-21. The Knicks also have a gaping hole at point guard as Kemba Walker’s injuries and decline have resulted in his own ill-fated homecoming in the big apple.

But as of last night, the Knicks were not having any conversations, nor showing any interest in dealing for Westbrook.
