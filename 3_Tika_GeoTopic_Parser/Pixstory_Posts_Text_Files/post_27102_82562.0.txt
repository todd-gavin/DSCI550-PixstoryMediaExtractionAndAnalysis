Jake Gyllenhall has finally broken his silence over the re-release of the hit song, “All too well” by Taylor Swift. 
Taylor had released a 10 minute version of the song along side a 15 minute short film. 

Jake still refused to call it love, saying that “It has nothing to do with me, it’s about her relationship with her fans. “
He further added that, “It’s her expression, artists tap into personal experiences for inspiration, and i don’t begrudge anyone for that. “
