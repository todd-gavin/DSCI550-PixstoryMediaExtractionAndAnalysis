Cheslie Kryst’s hearbroken grandfather struggled Monday to figure out why the former Miss USA, “a light that shined so brightly,” would kill herself.

“To be extinguished so fast is just devastating,” Gary Simpkins told the Daily News by phone from South Carolina. “So hard to imagine one minute they’re here and one minute they’re not. And you know that the only [way] you’ll ever see them again is when you yourself pass away.”

Kryst, 30, jumped to her death Sunday morning from the Orion, the W. 42nd St. building where she lived, leaving behind a note indicating she wants to leave her possessions with her mother but providing no reason why she committed suicide, police said.

Her grandfather said she was born in Michigan but she grew up in Rock Hill, S.C.

“She had a laugh that was infectious,” Simpkins said. “I can still hear it echoing in my mind. And I don’t know. But I do know that we’ll get through this. We will, but right now this is just devastating.”

Kryst — who won the 2019 Miss USA pageant, had a law degree and worked on as on-air correspondent for “Extra” — seemingly had everything to live for.

But the day of her fatal jump she posted a mysterious message on Instagram: “May this day bring you rest and peace.”

In a March 2021 essay in Allure, Kryst provided a window into what might have been a cry for help.
