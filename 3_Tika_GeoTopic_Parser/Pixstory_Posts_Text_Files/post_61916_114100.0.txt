Ms. Marvel was a highly anticipated show, but it has been nothing more than a huge let down. 

From casting actors no one has ever heard of to storylines that seem so obscure, the show has certainly been a flop. 

It has tried to cater to an audience that is very niche. And not many people have found Kamala khan to be a relatable superhero. 

The show has been mediocre at best, with there being no interesting storylines and with the show being marketed to Asian audiences, there haven't been any real response from them in respect of the show.
