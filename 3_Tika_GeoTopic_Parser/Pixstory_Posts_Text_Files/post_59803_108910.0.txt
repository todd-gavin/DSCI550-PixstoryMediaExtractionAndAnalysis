Urfi Javed admitted in one of her chats that she enjoys being a meme. The girl is an outspoken diva who doesn't give a damn about what other people think about her. She's come a long way, ignoring and ignoring all the bad in her life and living it the way she wants. Urfi, who was spotted in town again again, was heavily mocked for her attire. She elected to wear a nude-colored cut-out body-hugging dress, and she was mocked as a result. The haters who love to criticise, notably Urfi, dubbed her the Sasti clone of Poonam Pandey.
