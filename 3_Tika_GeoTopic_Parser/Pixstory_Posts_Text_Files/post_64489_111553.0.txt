Are you an avid reader of poetry? Or are you someone who hasn’t read much poetry, but are interested in the topic? Whichever category you belong to, this post is for you.

I have been reading and writing poetry since before I was in 8th grade. English lessons were always fun for me, and I used to listen to the English teacher explain a simple poem for half-an-hour, captivated at the flow of the words and the unique meanings they created.

But after a point, I had to stick my head out of textbooks. I tried reading poetry anthologies, but only one or two books seemed to strike the right chord. Then I moved on to poetry magazines, both in terms of writing and reading – and the experience has been enriching.

Poetry magazines are easy to access, making reading a seamless and easy-going activity. The poems they publish are written by diverse authors with different types of voices, lending a uniqueness to each poem you encounter. The aesthetics of the magazines also help – the font, theme, and background all interact with each other to make reading poetry a pleasant experience.

Here are 3 online magazines of poetry that I like. Check them out – you might like them too!

1) Thrush Magazine

2) Thimble Literary Review

3) The Adroit Journal
