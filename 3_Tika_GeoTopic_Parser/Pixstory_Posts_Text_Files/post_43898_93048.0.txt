After his last underwhelming performance in the Bundesliga, the German head coach was frank
in his appraisal of the winger. Julian Nagelsmann has stated that he has no idea why Bayern
Munich's Leroy Sane isn't doing well at the moment.

Sane made his 40th appearance for Bayern against Augsburg on Saturday, but he was replaced
in the 65th minute by Kingsley Coman after failing to make an impact. The reigning Bundesliga
winners went on to win 1-0 courtesy to a late penalty from Robert Lewandowski, and after the
game, Nagelsmann commented on Sane's recent form.

"I like Leroy very much, as a person and as a player. Everyone knows that he has incredible
qualities," Nagelsmann told GOAL and SPOX.

"He is self-critical enough and knows himself that he hasn't recently played well. I don't know
exactly why.

"He's had ups and downs throughout his career. I support him completely."

Sane appeared to be unhappy after being replaced and only gave Nagelsmann a half-hearted
handshake before heading to the bench, but the German coach won't dwell on his attitude.

"I'm not angry, we don't have to make a headline out of it," he added.

Since replacing Hansi Flick in the Allianz Arena management hot seat last summer, Sane has
been a vital component of Nagelsmann's ambitions.

So far this season, the former Manchester City star has a total of 14 goals and 15 assists, but
he has now gone five games without a goal contribution in the Bundesliga.

Bayern fans will be hoping that Sane can reclaim his best form when they face Villarreal in the
second leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday, with the Spanish team leading
1-0 on aggregate following the first match.
