The coronavirus pandemic began in separate viral spillovers at least two but perhaps as many as two dozen from live animals sold and butchered in late at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan China according to two papers published Tuesday in the journal Science The publication of the papers which underwent five months of peer review and revisions by the authors is unlikely to quell the rancorous debate about how the pandemic began and whether the virus emerged from a Chinese laboratory And the authors acknowledge there are many unknowns requiring further investigation most notably which animals were involved Everything upstream of this which animals where did they come from how it s all connected is completely unknown at this stage Kristian Andersen an immunologist at Scripps Research said in a media briefing Tuesday Have we disproven the lab leak theory No we have not Will we ever be able to No But there are possible scenarios and there are plausible scenarios Possible does not mean equally likely Andersen said A natural origin of the pandemic a zoonosis has long been a favored theory among scientists for the simple reason that most pandemics including the SARS coronavirus outbreak of have started that way Andersen and his colleagues believe multiple lines of evidence including the clustering of early cases of covid around the market make a market origin not only a likely scenario but the only one that fits the data
