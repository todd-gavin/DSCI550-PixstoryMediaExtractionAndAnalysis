Steven Gerrard

Probably the greatest Liverpool player and one of the best in the Premier League, Steven Gerrard had a glittering career. The English international, won 114 caps for his national team between 2010 and 2014. He was Man of the Match in the famous 2004-05 Champions League finals when Liverpool overturned a 3-0 deficit to defeat the mighty AC Milan team on penalties. 


 Mesut Ozil

This might be an unpopular choice, but in my opinion, Ozil was one of the finest playmakers the football world has seen in the past decade. His career was affected badly by injuries and matters not relating to the pitch. Ozil at Real Madrid and Arsenal in his peak, was magic to watch. His charisma and creativity on the field could be matched by only a few around the world.


 Andrea Pirlo
 
The Italian player was Serie A’s most decorated player. Having played for Juventus, Inter and AC Milan, the top 3 sides of Italian’s domestic circuit, his credibility in the footballing fraternity is unquestionable. He was a mainstay in the Italian national team and helped them lift the 2006 World Cup.
