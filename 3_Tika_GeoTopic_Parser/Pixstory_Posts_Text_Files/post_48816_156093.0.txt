Seriously?? Are you for real, dude??!
Your argument reeks of male privilege! You're basically just like, "well men will harm women, so it's women's fault if they can't defend themselves." If men are such uncontrollable, wild creatures, keep them chained! Keep them away from civil crowd if they can't have that much control on themselves.
Women shouldn't have to learn anything only so they won't get raped or killed. And I literally mentioned all the reasons why learning self defense might not be able to help women that much.
Once again, if men "will" attack women, keep them away from women. There's no need for men to get out of their house, stay the hell inside.
