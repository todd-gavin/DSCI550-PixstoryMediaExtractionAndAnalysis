‌Eating meat products causes irritable bowel or fatty liver in adults. This could be completely controlled by finding a vegan diet. 
‌
‌A vegan diet lessens the chances of developing kidney stones and gallstones. Diets high in animal protein cause the body to excrete calcium, oxalate, and uric acid—the main components of kidney stones and gallstones. A vegan diet lessens the risk of heart disease too. Eating meat increases the risk of getting type 2 diabetes in women, and eating processed meat increases the risk in men. A vegan diet rich in whole grains, legumes, nuts, and soy proteins helps to improve glycemic control in people who already have diabetes.
‌
‌A study of 73,308 people found that a vegan diet is related to a 12% decrease in all-cause mortality. ‌Human anatomy has evolved to help a primarily vegan diet. Carnivores have large mouths with pointed teeth, and short intestines (three to six times body length), and their livers can detoxify the surplus vitamin A absorbed from meat. Human teeth are short and flat, we have long intestines, and our livers cannot detoxify excess vitamin A.

‌For healthy living, veganism is the best choice. You have all the substitutes if you are converting from a non-vegetarian to a Vegan diet.
