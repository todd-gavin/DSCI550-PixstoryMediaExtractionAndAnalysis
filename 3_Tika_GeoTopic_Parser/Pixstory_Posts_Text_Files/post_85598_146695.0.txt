Effective Communication Even with increasing technological progress, we face so many hurdles when it comes to communicating with the other person. It can lead to some serious drama and a lot of hurt. All we need is effective communication to bridge the gap between people (much like the learning gap evident from the past two years). Some tips for ‘effectively communicating’ with others:1- Keeping it simple: A lot of times, we ought to say something but end up saying something else just because of the vocabulary, we want to show that, see how amazing my knowledge of words is. It might work but not all of us are Shashi Tharoor.2- Stick to the point: Be concise, but not too concise. Frankly, these days people generally are on a time crunch unless you’re family or best buds and have time for gossip, but yes, not everyone is interested in listening to anything and everything. Also keep in mind that if you’re too concise, people might think that you’re rude, even though to you it may seem efficient. 3- Avoid abbreviations while talking: Our generation loves abbreviations and acronyms but there are some people who are probably not that well aware due to different reasons. Unless, it’s super common don’t use it. 4- Be conversational: While talking make sure that you’re addressing the other person in front of you. Be specific to the person and open to the ideas that the same person is talking about (it’s off-putting if you disregard the person before you without even giving them a chance). This it for now. :)
