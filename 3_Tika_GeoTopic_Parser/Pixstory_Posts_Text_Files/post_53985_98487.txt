A community s sewage holds clues about its COVID burden Over the course of the pandemic wastewater surveillance has become an increasingly popular way to try to understand local infection trends Microbiologists Susan De Long and Carol Wilusz met and became wastewater aficionados in April when a grassroots group of wastewater treatment plant operators asked them to develop and deploy a test to detect SARS CoV in samples from the sewers of Colorado De Long is an environmental engineer who studies useful bacteria Wilusz s expertise is in RNA biology Here they describe how wastewater surveillance works and what it could do in a post pandemic future How is wastewater monitored for SARS CoV Wastewater surveillance takes advantage of the fact that many human pathogens and products of human drug metabolism end up in urine feces or both The SARS CoV virus that causes COVID shows up in surprisingly large quantities in feces of infected people even though this is not a major route of disease transmission To figure out whether any pathogens are present we first need to collect a representative sample of wastewater either directly from the sewer or at the point where what engineers call influent enters a treatment plant We can also use solids that have settled out of the wastewater Technicians then need to remove large particles of fecal matter and concentrate any microbes or viruses The next step is extracting their nucleic acids the DNA or RNA that holds the pathogens genetic information The sequences contained in the DNA or RNA act as unique bar codes for the pathogens present For instance if we detect genes that are unique to SARS CoV we know that the coronavirus is in our sample We use PCR based approaches similar to those used in clinical diagnostic tests to detect and quantify SARS CoV sequences Read more
