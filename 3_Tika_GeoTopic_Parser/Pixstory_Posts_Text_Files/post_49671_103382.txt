NRA is undoubtedly the main reason for placing gun laws in our country The association strongly endorses legislation that broadens gun rights such as open carry laws which allow gun owners to carry their weapons unconcealed in most public places They provide funding for elections and whatnot Isn t that the reason why many politicians mostly republicans stay mum and blame the security and other factors when it comes to guns NRA is completely against gun control internationally the NRA opposes the Arms Trade Treaty ATT it has rejected the Canadian gun registry supported Brazilian gun rights and criticized Australian gun laws In the NRA raised a record million and spent million on political activities The NRA also maintains a PAC which is excluded from these figures The organization donated to congressional races for both Republicans and Democrats to candidates for Congress The NRA has been interpreted as influential in moulding American gun control policy The organization impacts legislators voting attitude through its financial aid and ability to mobilize its huge membership through the old fashioned American sentiments on guns The organization has not lost a major battle over gun control legislation since the Federal Assault Weapons Ban At the federal level the NRA successfully lobbied Congress in the mid s to effectively halt government sponsored research into the public health effects of firearms and to assure the passage of legislation in largely immunizing gun manufacturers and dealers from lawsuits Yet NRA has stopped efforts at the federal level to increase regulation of firearms At the state and local level the NRA successfully campaigned to deregulate guns for example by pushing state governments to abolish the ability of local governments to regulate guns and removing restrictions on guns in public places They mostly have a hold over the Republican control states where the gun lobby also flourishes
