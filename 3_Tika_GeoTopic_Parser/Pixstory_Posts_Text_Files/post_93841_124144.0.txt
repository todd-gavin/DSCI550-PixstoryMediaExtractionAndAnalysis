A true friend doesn't care if your rich or poor 🤗, if your being an ass, what you weigh, what you look like,  if your house is a mess, what car you drive, if you have a family of crazy people! 💞
Your conversations will pick up where they left off☺, even if months have passed by. They will be there for you 😇when you need them most and despite your faults, 🤩will love ❤you with all their heart and cherish the times spent with you. 🥳
