"Noragami" received favourable reviews from critics in both seasons.
"Noragami," which was first released in 2011 by manga publisher Kodonsha.
Fans of "Noragami: Aragoto" are still clamouring for more six years after the series ended.
This does not rule out the possibility of future episodes being released. A 50-50 possibility exists.
The fact that there is sufficient source material for adaptation explains why the series is receiving a sequel.
The programme hasn't been officially cancelled, it has been on hold for some time, and little is known about its premiere date.
There is no third season planned, and there is no indication that one will be released anytime near.
