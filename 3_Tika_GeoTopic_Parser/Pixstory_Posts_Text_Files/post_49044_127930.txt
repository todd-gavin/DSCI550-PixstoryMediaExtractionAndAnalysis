Yes all golf courses should be rewilded Golf is one of the most popular sports in the world and it s not hard to see why People love it But golfing isn t just enjoyable it also has serious environmental consequences Golf courses use a lot of resources including water land and energy They also produce large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions which contribute to climate change In fact each round of golf at a typical course uses around gallons of water per person and this increases to around gallons when playing in wet conditions This is more than any other sport Not only do golf courses use up valuable resources they also harm indigenous wildlife populations by removing their habitats and food sources For example wetlands are drained to make way for new golf course layouts and this destroys important breeding grounds for birds and other animals The result is that these species have less chance of survival as a result All this pollution has serious consequences for the environment Not only do golf courses damage natural ecosystems but they also create health risks for people who live nearby For example runoff from golf course surfaces can contain harmful chemicals that can contaminate groundwater supplies Additionally elements and chemicals that are common in soil can cause respiratory problems in people who breathe in large quantities of dust particles created by golf course maintenance activities So yes all golf courses should be rewilded in order to protect both the environment and people
