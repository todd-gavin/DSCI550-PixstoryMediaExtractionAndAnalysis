Barcelona is in deep debt of around 849 billion euros with the likes of Sergio Busquets, Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba having to accept a cut in their salary for over a year. 

Barcelona chief Eduard Romeu has made an alarming declaration claiming that 427 million euros are needed to save the club from the mess they currently find themselves in. 

The Spanish side is in deep financial trouble in the region of 849 million euros. As a result, Barcelona couldn’t offer Lionel Messi a new deal last summer and the Argentine subsequently joined Paris Saint Germain on a free transfer. 

Despite securing the signings of Chelsea’s Andreas Christensen and AC Milan’s Frank Kessie on a free transfer, the club is now unable to register the pair due to their salary cap. 


“The number doing the most damage is asset imbalance,” Romeu told  Sport. The negative capital of 500 million euros. You could add 150 million euros to that in losses this season if we didn’t do anything. I said it before if someone wants to give me 500 million euros. That is what we need to save Barca.”

First-team players Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba have agreed to take a salary cut to comply with La Liga’s salary cap requirements. The club was offered help by La Liga through the CVC investment deal, proposed by the league, which Romeu revealed will be rejected by the club. “It’s a bad deal,” he said. 


Barcelona reportedly still owe 98 million pounds in the transfer fees on four different players: Miralem Pjanic, Frenkie de Jong, Sergio Dest and Phillipe Coutinho. As a result, of their financial crisis, it is likely they will have to sell key players this summer.
