 In India victims have multiple options to avail remedies The Center for Advanced Research in Digital Forensics and Cyber Security ARDC recommends three options to explore They are social media websites the National Commission for Women and Cyber cells Sounds good except that all of these options repeatedly fail women over and over Take the first social media websites Twitter has had this problem ever since its inception Search for names of prominent women in India say Rana Ayyub or Barkha Dutt You will be met with a flood of disgusting tweets that are misogynist slut shamey Islamophobic or whatever else You can of course report these tweets but there will always be more Both the above women have repeatedly talked about how they face online harassment every single day At that point Twitter is useless They would have to change their entire model and UI strip it out and make it less prone to abuse in order to have a chance of ending the problem Whatever they have done is additionally not enough The same goes for other social media websites The other options the National Commission for Women and the Cyber Cells well these simply don t take the problem seriously They often say they can t trace anybody online Even when they do their recommendations are often facile Don t log on Don t read the hateful posts how is this helpful when someone is the victim of targeted harassment by an online mob They can post your number address even morphed photos of your naked body And then all you have for recourse is a system that shrugs and tells you it can t do anything at all
