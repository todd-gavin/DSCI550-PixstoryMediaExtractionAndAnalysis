Real Madrid attacker Eden Hazard will have an operation on his right leg, the club said on Friday. The Belgian winger has not played for the club in over a month and is set for a time on the sidelines following the operation.

Since a five-minute substitute cameo against Alaves on February 19, the Belgian international has not played for the Spanish side.

Since then, Hazard has been an unused replacement in every game, including the Clasico defeat to Barcelona.

What's been said so far?

The 31-year-old will not be returning to the Santiago Bernabeu side any time soon, as he will undergo surgery, according to Madrid.

A statement on the club's website read: "In the coming days, our player Eden Hazard will undergo surgery to remove the osteosynthesis plate in his right fibula."

What does Hazard's future hold for him?

Hazard has only started eight of Carlo Ancelotti's team's 21 matches this season.

Injuries have limited the ex-Chelsea midfielder's time at Madrid, limiting him to just 65 appearances since joining the club in July 2019.

The announcement comes amid rising speculation that Hazard could return to Stamford Bridge. According to reports, a return was being considered until the UK government placed sanctions on owner Roman Abramovich following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

It remains to be seen whether Chelsea will rekindle their interest in the Blues legend once a new owner takes control of the club. Hazard's current deal in Spain has just over two years left on it, after a tumultuous spell with Real Madrid since his big-money move from west London.

In the three seasons afterwards, he has only managed to score six goals, owing to a combination of poor form and injury difficulties. Hazard played against his previous team in the Champions League last season, with Chelsea winning on aggregate against Real Madrid to clinch a place in the final against Manchester City.
