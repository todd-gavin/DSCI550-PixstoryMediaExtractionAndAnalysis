House of the Dragon is not breathing fire quite yet, but at least there’s some wisps of smoke, despite the endless talking and conversations (really, it could almost be a seminar at points). Matt Smith’s Daemon shows that he deserves the screentime he gets and has finally added some spark to his snark at last. There’s a hint of the old Game of Thrones riveting madness — it’s a flash, not much, but at this point, I’ll take it.
It’s Episode 3, and King Viserys I continues to prove that he’s an inept king, a terrible father and a horrible person. We’ve jumped ahead a couple of years and now the King is married to his daughter Rhaenyra’s best friend Alicient, and has finally got the dimpled heir that he craved. Alicient is pregnant again, and everyone’s sure it’s going to be another boy. Rhaenyra — as expected from any horrified daughter — is keeping her distance from everyone and has resigned herself to reading under a tree, or giving stony glares and snarky replies to her father and former best friend. Alicient remains inscrutable as ever — do we see some signs of guilt? It’s hard to tell.
She wears her bitterness like a shroud — and its props to Milly Alcock for finally giving this character some fire. For most of the episode, a moping Viserys is contemplating her marriage as he now has a male heir, and a very familiar name from the original Game Of Thrones turns up — a Lannister. The Lannisters have come to give their regards, but it is not quite so graciously accepted. Obviously, this isn’t the last we’re going to see of the Lannisters and one hopes that they might have the same power, biting, magnetic sadism of the original characters from GoT — Cersei, Jamie, Tyrion and Tywin — characters that will remain with us forever, because of their sheer power and magnetic screen presence. Currently, the new Lannister just seems rather smarmy and unappealing.
