Self motivation is a great thing When it comes to Chris Gardner it s a way of life You will not see this man s lowly phases He shifts the storyline before you notice Pursuit of Happyness would have been a sentimental drama if Will Smith and Jaden Smith had failed to convince us their natural camaraderie in miseries They are inseparable buddies in happyness and sorrows Chris Jr is not short of questions while they walk together Chris is a responsible dad committed to find answers for his son be it any bad situation Their buddy talks are so touching and soulful get etched in our hearts forever Actually Christopher s mother is the assured breadwinner of the family She takes care of him well It was a joyous sight when Chris Jr jumps in joy when she brings that much awaited basketball for him as a birthday gift He likes to play with ball It reflects his moods He cries in rare occasions It s not a skill his peers have His father is his hero who paints their apartment in exchange for unpaid rent who questions the playschool teacher for letting kids watch adult series who shouted at a homeless jerk for jumping the queue and most importantly who taught him to protect his dreams no matter what others say Christopher learns to be cheerful even in hard days For them living in a shelter for poor or a wash room is not the end of the road Pursuit of Happyness teaches us valuable parenting lessons Kids should walk hand in hand with parents in all good and bad situations of life What matters is the unaltered care and emotional security extended to them Scenes in which Chris Jr asks about his mother who left them Chris Gardner portray her as a good person He never lets his morals down before his son The popular time machine scene in which he leads a completely disappointed Chris Jr to an imaginary cave metro wash room make us realize how magical is this duo to motivate each other in odd times
