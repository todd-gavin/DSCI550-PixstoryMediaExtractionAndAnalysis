KAMP Los Angeles 2022 has officially announced several last-minute changes to its lineup of performing artists.
"KAMP’s full statement, including information on refunds, can be found below:
To our KAMP LA 2022 ticket holders,
We regret to inform you that we learned today that the following artists are unable to travel as planned due to unforeseen U.S. work visa issues and circumstances outside of the artists’ and promoters’ control: BamBam, Jeon Somi, Kai, Lapillus, Taeyeon, and Zion.T.
Most of these artists were scheduled to appear on Saturday’s lineup.
We have increased artist set lengths on Saturday and have added MOMOLAND and T1419 as special guests on Saturday as well. MOMOLAND and T1419 will both still perform Sunday as originally planned. Super Junior, iKON, and P1Harmony will still be performing as scheduled on Saturday.
Anyone holding a single-day Saturday ticket is entitled to a full refund, or 50% refund off of a two-day ticket. For those seeking a refund, you should have received an email from guestservices@axs.com by 5PM PDT today as to how to request your refund. You will have up until 12 noon PDT on Saturday, October 15 to request your refund.
Shortly, we will share with you the revised Saturday schedule. We are doing our best to ensure that your KAMP LA 2022 experience remains an enjoyable and memorable one. We apologize for this very difficult and unforeseen circumstance. Please contact us for further inquiries."
