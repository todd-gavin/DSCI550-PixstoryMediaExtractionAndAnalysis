Cricket Australia (CA) CEO Todd Greenberg said the Australian team has voiced ethical concerns about their upcoming trip of Sri Lanka, which comes at a time when the island nation is in the throes of an economic crisis. 

Sri Lanka is experiencing its worst economic crisis since independence in 1948, with a chronic lack of foreign exchange severely restricting imports, especially necessities like fuel and medicines. 

As per IE, demonstrations have erupted around the country since late March, with violence erupting two weeks ago when clashes between government supporters and demonstrators in Colombo spurred more occurrences across the country, killing nine people and injuring over 300.

“The players are very aware of the situation in Sri Lanka,” Greenberg told the Australian Associated Press on Wednesday. “It’s fair to say there is a level of discomfort around touring in conditions that contrast those faced by the people of Sri Lanka, such as rising food prices, power cuts and fuel rationing.”

“Ultimately our players want to continue to play cricket and will take direction, guidance and advice from CA about tour arrangements and planning.”

Let’s see if this tour happens or not! What do you think?
