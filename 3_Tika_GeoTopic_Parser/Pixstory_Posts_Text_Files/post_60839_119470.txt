My friends and I look for every chance to get out of class during breaks to stretch and walk around When we have continuous classes especially block periods we cherish every bit of the short minute break we get A lot can be done within minutes We can rush to the nearest canteen to get a snack or a coffee mostly coffee because caffeine fuels us Today while we were catching a coffee break this little one walked up to us My friends bent down to give it scratches and pats like it wanted I m a little scared to approach cats but I do like to admire them from a distance We did get late and had to run back to class just in time for attendance but I suppose the kitten was worth the distraction
