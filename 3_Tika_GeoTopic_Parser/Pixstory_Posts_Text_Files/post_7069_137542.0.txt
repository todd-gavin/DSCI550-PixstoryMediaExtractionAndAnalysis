Teachers' Day
Teachers' Day is a special day for the appreciation of teachers, and may include celebrations to honor them for their special contributions in a particular field area, or the community in general.
The idea of celebrating Teachers' Day took root in many countries during the 19th century; in most cases, they celebrate a local educator or an important milestone in education. This is the primary reason why countries celebrate this day on different dates, unlike many other International Days. For example, Argentina has commemorated Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's death on 11 September as Teachers' Day since 1915. In India the birthday of the second president Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (5 September) is celebrated as Teachers' Day since 1962 and Guru Purnima traditionally observed as a day to worship teachers by Hindus. According to Hindu scriptures, it is very important to make a spiritual guru (guru), without a spiritual teacher one cannot attain salvation. The identity of a true Spiritual teacher is written in Adhyay 15 Shlok 1 to 4 of Holy Gita. Teacher's Day was celebrated as "Abhar Diwas" in 2021.
Many countries celebrate their Teachers' Day on 5 October in conjunction with World Teachers' Day, which was established by UNESCO in 1994
