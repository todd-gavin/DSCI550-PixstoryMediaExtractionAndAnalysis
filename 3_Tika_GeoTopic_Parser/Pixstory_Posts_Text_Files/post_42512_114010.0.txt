As we all know that Marvel Studios’ new movie Thor Love and Thunder is releasing tomorrow exclusively in theatres and Thor Love and Thunder is the fourth instalment of Thor’s franchise in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

As a Marvel fan, we will see many similar characters in this movie which are Thor, Jane Foster, Valkyrie, and a team of Guardians of the Galaxy but there will be the new Villain in this movie and the name of the Villain is Gorr The God Butcher and this character will be portrayed by Christian Bale.

So today, I thought why not give a brief introduction of Gorr The God Butcher and what can you expect from this character in the movie.

Gorr was raised by his parents on a planet without a name where Gorr learns that he must pay homage to the Gods to keep the family safe. Gorr questions his mother about the gods that why we can’t see them and why the Gods didn’t take care of his father when he was ill and eventually died. Soon after, Gore’s mother also dies saving him from a pair of dinosaur-like beasts.

After getting married to Arra, Gorr has sons and daughters but her wife perished while she was pregnant, in an earthquake and most of his children also died because of the same illness as Gorr’s father. Because of all these events, Gorr loses all his faith in the Gods and started believing that there are no Gods to care for them.

While walking alone in the deserts, a pair of armoured beings hurtle across the sky and land in an explosion on the ground. When the gold God asks for help from Gorr, he refuses. Just then, a substance shot up into Gorr’s hand and formed into a spearhead and with the help of the spearhead Gorr butchered all the remaining Gods.

After that, Gorr flew away from this planet and into outer space as he wondered if there were more gods out there to be killed.

Let’s see, how much brutality Director Taika Waititi will show in Thor Love and Thunder.
