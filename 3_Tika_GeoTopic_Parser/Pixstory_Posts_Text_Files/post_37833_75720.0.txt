A new study conducted by a group of researchers from Penn State College of Medicine took data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, collected from more than 24,000 U.S. adults from 2005 to 2016, and looked at two days of dietary recall to assess how often participants were consuming mushrooms. The authors then compared that frequency with reported levels of depression. Researchers found that participants who reported eating moderate-to-high levels of mushrooms over the course of the two days had lower odds of depression, as compared to those who ate low or no amounts of mushrooms
