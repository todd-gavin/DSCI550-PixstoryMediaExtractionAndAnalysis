Celtic and Rangers, two giants of the Scottish Premiership, took on each other on Matchday 06of the Premiership. Prior to this game, Celtic were the only club in the Premiership to maintain aperfect record so far and were on the top of the points table.
Rangers, on the other hand, had a decent opening to their campaign as well and had won 4 outof the 5 games they had played, bagging the 2nd position on the Premiership points table. Celticmanaged to better their record in this game as they were dominant from the word go.

Celtic smashed 3 past Rangers in the first half itself to cause a massive dent to the latter’s hopeof climbing in the Premiership points table Although Rangers enjoyed the majority of thepossession after the first half ended, Celtic had 9 shots out of which 4 were on target at thehalf-time mark.

Celtic started with their default 4-3-3 formation, the one that has helped them reap rewardsthroughout the season so far with Diego Jota on the left flank. Giovanni van Bronkhorst, theRangers’ boss, started with a 4-2-3-1 formation with Antonio Colak being the lone striker.

Liel Abada opened the scoring for Celtic with a great strike in the 9th minute of the game. Jotajoined the party too and registered himself on the scoresheet 23 minutes later. Abada smashedhis 2nd of the game in the 40th minute to help Celtic gain a 3-0 lead at half-time.

In the second half of the game, Rangers tried their level best to at least equalize, bringing on 3substitutions in just 15 minutes but this too, couldn’t help them prevent a defeat at Celtic Park.

David Turnbull slotted in a 4th goal for Celtic in the 78th minute to end Rangers’ hopes ofmaking a comeback in the match. There was no more disturbance on the scoresheet by eitherof the sides as the game ended 4-0 in favour of the home side.
