Coming with their th album with The Great Heathen Army Amon Amarth really do create the vibe that they have come once again for raiding and pillaging the distant lands of old as they have for years leaving behind a trail of bloody metallic awesomeness Amon Amarth have once again proven why they are the undisputed masters of Viking themed melodic death metal as they sing about epic tales of heroism and bloody battles of the Vikings of the North Musically The Great Heathen Army is darker and heavier than its predecessor Berserker and offers a variety of tones and styles across various tracks though the music is overall consistent and relatively predictable That hardly matters however as The Great Heathen Army knows exactly what it is and as such perfectly captures the true essence of Amon Amarth Get In The Ring is a powerful opener and followed by its self titled track The Great Heathen Army displays a more groovy and darker shade to the band Heidrun is a powerful heavyweight marking a great dance between Gothenburg melodic death metal and folk metal Oden Owes You All Find A Way is one of the weaker tracks here it is strong but often withers in front of the great ones while Dawn of Norsemen goes into full warrior mode galloping into the distance with a sword in hand Saxons and Vikings which on the other hand pairs frontman Johan Hegg with SAXON s Biff Byford is as fist pumping and bombastic as a metalhead could want Skagul Rides With Me is a bit of is a melodic cinematic track while The Serpent s Tail is a crushing melancholic and melodic conclusion to an epic story While this may not necessarily invite any new fans to the band the music is a near perfect combination of melody heaviness bombastic riffs killer riffs badass vocals and some brilliant headbangable choruses This is a brilliant display of everything that Amon Amarth is only amped up and refined to a The Great Heathen Army is epic and raging and some of the finest of Amon Amarth Score
