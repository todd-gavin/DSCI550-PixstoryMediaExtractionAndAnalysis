Interstellar is an impressive at times astonishing movie that overwhelmed me to the point where my usual objections to Nolan s work melted away In any case there s something pure and powerful about this movie I can t recall a science fiction film hard sold to a director s fans as multiplex awesome in which so many major characters wept openly in close up voices breaking tears streaming down their cheeks Matthew McConaughey s widowed astronaut Cooper and his colleague Amelia Brand Anne Hathaway pour on the waterworks in multiple scenes with justification like everyone on the crew of the Endurance the starship sent to a black hole near Jupiter that will slingshot the heroes towards colonize able worlds they re separated from everything that defines them their loved ones their personal histories their culture the planet itself Other characters including Amelia s father an astrophysicist played by Michael Caine and a space explorer played by an un billed guest actor who s holed up on a forbidding arctic world express a vulnerability to loneliness and doubt that s quite raw for this director The film s central family headed by Cooper grounded after the dismantling of NASA lives on a corn farm for goodness sake like the gentle Iowans in Field of Dreams a film whose daddy issues laden story syncs up nicely with the narrative of Interstellar Granted they re growing the crop to feed the human race which is whiling away its twilight hours on a planet so ecologically devastated that at first you mistake it for the American Dust Bowl circa or so but there s still something amusingly cheeky about the notion of corn as sustenance especially in a survival story in which the future of humanity is at stake Ellen Burstyn plays one of many witnesses in a documentary first glimpsed in the movie s opening scene and which in classic Nolan style is a setup for at least two twists
