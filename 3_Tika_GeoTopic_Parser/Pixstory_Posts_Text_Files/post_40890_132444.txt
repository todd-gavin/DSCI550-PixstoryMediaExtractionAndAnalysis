Twenty eight young men bathe by the shore Twenty eight young men and all so friendly Twenty eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window Which of the young men does she like the best Ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her Where are you off to lady for I see you You splash in the water there yet stay stock still in your room Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty ninth bather The rest did not see her but she saw them and loved them The beards of the young men glisten d with wet it ran from their long hair Little streams pass d all over their bodies An unseen hand also pass d over their bodies It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs Walt Whitman
