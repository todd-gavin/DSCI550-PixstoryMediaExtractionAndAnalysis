Germany faces Chile in today’s Group B clash in the U17 Women’s World Cup. Both teams have had a winning start to the tournament as Germany beat Nigeria 2-1 and Chile beat New Zealand 3-1 on Matchday 1. Today’s clash is likely to be the decider on who gets to top the group.  A win can send either team to the quarterfinals depending on the result of the game between Nigeria and New Zealand. Today’s clash is at the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Goa. It will be refereed by Maria Rivet from Mauritius, who was last seen in a major tournament at AFCON 2022 in the summer. 
Germany showed great character to come from behind to beat Nigeria on opening day. Miracle Usani’s freekick had sent her team 1-0 up at the break. However, four minutes into the second half, Svea Stoldt found the equalizer. 11 minutes later, Mara Alber sent the Germans ahead and her team held on to win. But for spectacular saves from point-blank range by Nigerian keeper Faith Omilana, Germany would have won by a greater margin. 
Chile’s performance against the Kiwis was altogether more dominant. Ambar Figuera finished off a Costanza Oliver cross from the right to take the lead in the 12th minute. Oliver was fouled in the penalty box ten minutes later. Tali Sima Rovner Yudelevich converted the resultant spot-kick and sent Chile 2-0 up at the break. New Zealand pulled one back early in the second half through a corner. Milly Clegg was the scorer. In the 64th minute, Chile restored their 2-goal cushion in spectacular fashion as Anais Cifuentes San Juan smashed one into the top corner from nearly 40 yards out. While the match was evenly split in terms of shots, Chile dominated the ball and territory in what was a convincing performance. 
Both teams are on 3 points which means that today’s clash is not a must-win to ensure qualification. However, both teams will be keen to establish title credentials by winning the group.
