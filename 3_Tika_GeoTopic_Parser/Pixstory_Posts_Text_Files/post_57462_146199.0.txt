In most cases, trauma can trigger the symptoms of the disorder, it is more likely to be childhood trauma, something that has happened earlier in your life and caused such a situation.
This trauma can stem from: physical abuse, 
sexual abuse, emotional neglect, psychological abuse.
In some cases, a child may not experience a clear form of abuse but may not grow up in a safe home environment. For example, they may live with highly unpredictable parents and start dissociating in response to this stress.
Dissociative identity disorder may appear alongside other disorders. This means that several mental health disorders could arise from the same cause.
Other common disorders that can occur alongside DID include: borderline personality disorder, depression, substance, use disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder.
