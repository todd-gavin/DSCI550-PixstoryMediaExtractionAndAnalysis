Australia has a new Tour de France contender on the block in gun cyclist Ben O'Connor.

Sporting News reported that after years of watching Cadel Evans win the Tour and Richie Porte contend for podium finishes, O'Connor is leading a new generation of Aussies at the world's premier cycling race.

Ben O'Connor is a 26-year-old Australian cyclist who is the team leader for AG2R Citreon at the Tour de France 2022. The Western Australian-born talent has worked his way up through the cycling ranks since making his Grand Tour debut at the Giro d'Italia 2018. His fourth-place finish at Tour de France in 2021 underlines his credentials in this year's event.

O'Connor's surprise performance at the Tour de France to finish fourth behind eventual winner Tadej Pogacar  means he is one of the favourites to reach the podium in 2022.

The Australian also won stage nine at the Tour last year and was sitting in second position in the general classification from the end of stage nine until the end of stage 11.

O'Connor has had impressive results in his major races this year too, finishing sixth at the Volta a Catalunya, fifth in the Tour de Romandie and third at the Criterium du Dauphine - which is the traditional Tour de France lead-up race.
