If you went by the movie industry, women simply cease to exist after about 35. Certainly women over the age of 40 are invisible - unless of course they are playing Shah Rukh Khan's mother/grandmother! 

Malaika Arora Khan neatly skewered this societal urge to pretend older women don't exist or feel desire. The actress - who has been famous in the past for being a sex symbol - took to Instagram to refute rumours that she had broken up with boyfriend Arjun Kapoor. 

"Normalize falling in love in one's 40s", said Malaika, referring to the fact that she was 48 and Arjun was 36. There is absolutely a double standard about these things, as Hollywood star Megan Fox pointed out. She is a mere four years older than her fiance Machine Gun Kelly, but she is still trolled for "dating a younger man." 

Men are rarely reviled for dating much younger - stars like Leonardo DiCaprio (47) refuse to date women over 25 - but older women aren't supposed to date younger men, because women's worth is supposed to lie in their looks and their youthfulness. Let's put an end to this absurd taboo.
