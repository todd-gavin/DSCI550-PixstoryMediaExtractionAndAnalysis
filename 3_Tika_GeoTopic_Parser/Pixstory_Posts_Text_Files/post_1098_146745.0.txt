Why people leaving Christianity in droves in the Unitesd States?
Since the 1990s, large numbers of Americans have left Christianity to join the growing ranks of US adults who describe their religious identity as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular”. This accelerating trend is reshaping the American religious landscape, leading many people to wonder what the future of religion in America might look like, say, 50 years from now.
According to estimates by Pew Research Center, a major nonpartisan think tank based in Washington DC, in 2020, about 64% of Americans, including children, were Christian. People who are religiously unaffiliated, sometimes called religious “nones”, accounted for 30% of the US population. Adherents of all other religions — Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists — added up to about 6%.
Now, depending on whether religious switching continues at recent rates, speeds up or stops entirely, projections show that Christians of all ages could shrink from 64% to between a little more than half (54%) and just above one-third (35%) of all Americans by 2070, Pew said in a new report, ‘Modeling the Future of Religion in America’.
