My childhood like most of ours was filled with April Fool s pranks Telling our classmates that their zipper is down lying to them that they have been called to the Principal s office scaring them with a fake spider in their lunch and many more childish pranks consisted of our April Fool s Day I remember how sad we used to get whenever this historic day fell on a holiday But that didn t stop us obviously from calling each other for the sole purpose of pranking But have you ever like me wondered about the origins of this day Who decided to attribute a whole day to fooling other people Well the real story is quite different As history channel tells us some historians speculate that April Fools Day dates back to when France switched from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar as called for by the Council of Trent in In the Julian Calendar as in the Hindu calendar the new year began with the spring equinox around April People who were slow to get the news or failed to recognize that the start of the new year had moved to January and continued to celebrate it during the last week of March through April became the butt of jokes and hoaxes and were called April fools These pranks included having paper fish placed on their backs and being referred to as poisson d avril April fish said to symbolize a young easily caught fish and a gullible person Not going to lie this sounds like a nice idea for a prank next year
