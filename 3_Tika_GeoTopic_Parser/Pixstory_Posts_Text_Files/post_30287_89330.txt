This time the adventure of Filippo Inzaghi on the Brescia bench is really over. The latter knows the environment very well having already been both a player and coach of Brescia A legal dispute is now expected between Inzaghi and the club given that there was a clause in the contract which prevented his exemption in the event of a position in the top eight The same clause had led the club to desist after the first decision to sack Inzaghi taken a month ago. Brescia are currently fifth, just two points behind Lecce
