Last night what I saw is something different I saw how lovers of cinema treat their superstars The numbers of those people who spread hate and start using boycott are very small and people who love to watch new movies are very large When I entered The Imperial Hotel students already gathered there and waiting to see the cast of RRR Alia Bhatt Ramcharan Jr NTR with their director S S Rajamouli and the special guest Aamir Khan As I had the media invitation from the RRR team I got a place in the VVIP section where I can listen to the talks of the cast and prepare the content carefully But when the cast of the movie came there the crowd got mad they were cheering applauding shouting their names dancing to the songs of the movie and the scene got crazy there When the cast settled down the crowd got another surprise and got to see Aamir Khan and then the tempo of the crowd never went down The cast played dumb charades with each other and Aamir khan tried the steps of the Nacho Nacho song with Ramcharan and Jr NTR and didn t succeed Director told the crowds how the cast prepare themselves for the role and how he had a discussion with Aamir khan about his method of preparation And after taking some questions from the fans the cast of the RRR and Aamir khan left the stage The moral of today s blog was that when lovers of cinema found their movie superstars between them they forget every tension or worry of their life and start enjoying the event they are attending You can watch the video of yesterday s event from the link given below
