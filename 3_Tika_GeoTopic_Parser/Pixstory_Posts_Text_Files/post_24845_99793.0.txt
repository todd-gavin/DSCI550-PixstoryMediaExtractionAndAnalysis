Everton is having a run of their season. They were able to get 10 points from a possible 15 in the last five games. Those last 5 games include the best team in the Premier League this season. They are currently out of the danger zone but need to get all the points from the remaining games which are left in this season.
Everton faced Watford in the midweek. 




Watford is relegated from the Premier League after just one season in the Premier League. The game was more important for Everton as a win in the game would have made them pretty clear from the relegation zone.
Everton had 16 shots in the whole game whereas the home side had just 6 shots. 





Everton was clearly looking for the winner but Watford's defence did not allow the visitor to score a single goal. Ben Foster had a crucial part in the game. The game ended 0-0 which was a frustrating thing for Everton.




They dropped 2 crucial points. If Everton would have won the game, they would have been 4 points away from the relegation zone with a game in hand. However, Everton remains in the 16th position with 36 points from 35 games.




Watford remains in the 19th position with 23 points from 36 games. They will end the campaign in the 19th or the 20th position. Everton will face Brentford on the weekend before the final week of the Premier League. They need to win the remaining games to keep the pressure on the teams below them. 





Watford will face Leicester City on the same weekend before they play their final game of the Premier League next week.
