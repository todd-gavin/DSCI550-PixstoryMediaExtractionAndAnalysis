The winds of the war in Ukraine inevitably swept away even the Formula which was on track in Barcelona last week for the first tests of the season. The team most involved was Haas which, up until Thursday, had taken to the track with the livery flag of Russia by the explicit choice of the sponsor Uralkali the chemical company of Dmitry Mazepin the father of one of the two official drivers Nikita Mazepin who already spent huge sums in to finance the season of the small US team On Friday at the Circuit de Catalunya the team fell on the track without sponsors and with an all-white color also eliminating the references to Uralkali from the garage and from the motorhome Certainly a good coup also from an economic point of view even if the team principal Gunther Steiner has assured No financial problems we will continue even without financial support by Uralkali Instagram photo haasf team
