Too bad they re not allowing phones to be taken inside Every vote counts A vote for NOTA is a vote wasted It s just my third time voting but it feels brand new everytime Although I would have to note that even though I stay in an army area I did see a group of boys standing close the entrance of the voting centre One of them holding a stick I even asked them why they re standing there with a stick They refused to answer Anyway if I hear of some mischief at this centre I know who to blame
