Australian qualifier Jason Kubler has held his nerve to serve his way into the Wimbledon third round with a straight-sets victory over Dennis Novak.

After being asked to sleep on a two-sets-to-love and 5-4 lead, Kubler returned to the All England Club on Friday to coolly close out the contest and reach the last 32 of a grand slam for the first time.

Kubler barely broke a sweat, needing only two minutes plus the warm-up to complete the 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 victory and book a date on Saturday with the winner of the all-American affair between Jack Sock and Maxime Cressy.

The 29-year-old had just broken Novak and was about the serve for the match on Thursday when the heavens opened, prompting a wry smile from the self-confessed "Australian tennis battler" as he gathered his gear and scurried for cover.

Win or lose his next match, it has been a career-best run for Kubler, who has earned more money in the past week than he has all season.

A place in the last 32 at the All England Club is worth a minimum of $213,000.

Victory over Sock or Cressy would guarantee Kubler at least $337,000 — not bad for someone who got down to his last 14 cents at one low point during his injury-ravaged career.

It would be nothing less than Kubler deserves after an inspired comeback from the one-time world number one junior, whose career has been cruelly stop-start due to five rounds of knee surgery.

With 18 wins from his past 20 outings, Kubler is finally back in the world's top 100 with seemingly his best work to come.

The Queenslander was Australia's last man standing at the French Open after also winning three qualifying encounters just to make the main draw, like he did last week at Roehampton to seal his Wimbledon spot.

He is yet to concede a set this week, having taken out British seed Dan Evans in round one without dropping even one service game.

Kubler is the fourth Australian to make the third round, joining Alex de Minaur, Nick Kyrgios and women's number one Ajla Tomljanovic.
