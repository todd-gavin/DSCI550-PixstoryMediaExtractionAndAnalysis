No life is a collection of these simplicities Go to the teahouse but don t want to drink a cup of tea Take a walk in the park but don t feel a bit of freshness In the morning you want to think good thoughts but not a single bit of good things come to your mind You want to hold a book in your hand but your mind doesn t like you Amuse yourself with your home furniture but your eyes fall on your daughter s or sister s school uniform All these simplicities are life if they give it to you Good luck to those for whom life still has meaning Kabul has witnessed sad separations in the last yearPhoto by Mujtaba Kayhan
