I think I was in the sixth grade of school when my older sister gave me a book called France I had read it several times and my sister was laughing Patience If anyone asks you about France Maybe you can answer all the cities roads culture food people places of entertainment and in short everything about it It really was like that I had even learned French sentences and sentences I was joking with my classmates that I was learning French junk I still remember although I never went to France Thanks to Ragi Gupta for bringing back my childhood memories
