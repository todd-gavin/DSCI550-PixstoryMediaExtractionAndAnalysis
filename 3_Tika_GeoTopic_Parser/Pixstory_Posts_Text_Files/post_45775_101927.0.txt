NASA has cancelled all spacewalks except the most essential ones after detecting water in an astronaut's helmet, according to agency officials.

ET reported that following a March 23 spacewalk, water was discovered in the helmet of European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Matthias Maurer, according to Space.com. 

About 20 to 25 centimetres of water in a very thin coating covered the interior surface of the helmet, according to Maurer. 

Although the suit does produce some water on occasion, "This was a little different from our usual encounters. It was the sheer volume of water that drew our attention "During a news briefing this week, Dana Weigel, deputy station programme manager at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, remarked.

The agency's extravehicular mobility unit (EMU) spacesuits, which will return to Earth in July, will be assessed, according to officials. 

The astronauts will be unable to walk outside and undertake extravehicular activities (EVAs) for several months unless the International Space Station requires urgent repairs, according to the report.
