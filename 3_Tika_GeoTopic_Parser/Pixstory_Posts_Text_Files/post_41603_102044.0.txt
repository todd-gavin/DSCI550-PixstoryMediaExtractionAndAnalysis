Disney has always displayed both men and women in stereotypical body forms. The female is devised with the perfect hourglass figure, small waist and large eyes and the males with there perfectly sculpted masculine physique. However, over the years there was a slight change in the portrayal of the Disney princesses, reason being feminism. For instance, Snow white and the seven dwarves was the first animated film produced by Disney in the year 1937. Snow White, the female lead is portrayed as a very domestic woman who relies heavily on her Prince Charming. She is also depicted as the fairest one of all with perfect features. 
In 2016, Moana was released wherein there was no clich√© element of wistful princess in who dreamt wistfully about a Prince Charming who will come and save her. Instead, she dreams about exploring, going out into the sea by herself, proving herself and saving her tribe. Her character is independent, strong, and able to deal with things when they get tough and rough. Moana is about how a successor can become an effective leader, how a person can reach his/her full potential and it is about finding purpose not love.
