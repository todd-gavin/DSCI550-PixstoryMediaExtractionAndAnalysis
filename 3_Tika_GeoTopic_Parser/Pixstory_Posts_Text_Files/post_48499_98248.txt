 For you formed my inward parts you knitted me together in my mother s womb I praise you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made Wonderful are your works my soul knows it very well My frame was not hidden from you when I was being made in secret intricately woven in the depths of the earth Your eyes saw my unformed substance in your book were written every one of them the days that were formed for me when as yet there was none of them Psalm Behold children are a heritage from the Lord the fruit of the womb a reward Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the children of one s youth Blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them He shall not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies in the gate Psalm It is impossible to credibly deny that abortion is a form of murder My heart hurts for every child that is denied the opportunity to live My heart hurts for the mother who believed she couldn t manage having a child and that the only option was abortion I am certain that Jesus came not only to free us from our sins but also to serve as an everlasting example of Christian conduct So when confronted with the issue of Abortion in America I believe we must turn to the gospels to discover how Jesus would respond We cannot advocate for women s rights without taking into consideration the effects that abortion has on the mother PAS Post Abortion Syndrome is one of the many consequences that killing a child in the womb has on a woman Often times it leads to depression in women and sometimes even suicide It is ignorant and insensitive to call for abortion laws despite all these ill effects that they can have on the society Instead what we should be focusing on is better healthcare and childcare which do not force mothers to commit this heartbreaking sin Women should be educated more about their roots and roles to keep the balance in society
