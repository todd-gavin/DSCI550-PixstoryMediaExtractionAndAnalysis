Just like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies tech stocks have also tanked over the past months The ongoing macroeconomic issues have been responsible for minimizing investors risk appetite then inflation occurred to ravage global markets and dominated critical headlines Based on reports US inflation soared nearly above which is a new four decade high that took place in June leading the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates more than once The Fed s decisions to comply with inflation are also some of the primary reasons why the investors have backed out from buying risker assets Is there still a connection between Bitcoin and the Tech Stocks Previous reports have denoted that there had been similar trading patterns between Bitcoin and stocks which is why the crypto market took a major beating There definitely was a correlation between BTC and stocks before but the correlation is much stronger now Data reveals that in August the stock market basically performed better than Bitcoin Currently at the time of writing this article the Bitcoin price is revolving around the US range and this is BTC s lowest market value in two weeks The flagship cryptocurrency is struggling to overtake its critical US k resistance which will mark its journey towards the US price range The markets are being overruled by several factors other than the ongoing economic crises hence the current connection between Bitcoin and tech stocks might be a combination of several factors and it is quite impossible to predict when this partnership will end
