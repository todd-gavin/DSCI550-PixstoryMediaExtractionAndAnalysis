The footyheadlines com site publishes a preview of the shirt that Juventus should use next season. Madam, it should seem that I will change the current shirt a lot the stripes will remain but they will not be straight and full but in zigzags and made up of many triangles as if they were not lines but lightning bolts A similar game also for the sponsor&#39;s writing which should have lightning bolts at the inside The images of the new shirt are already causing discussion on the web There are those who like it and those who really can&#39;t see it
