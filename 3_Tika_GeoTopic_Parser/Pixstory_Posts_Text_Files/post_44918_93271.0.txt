Arsenal’s search for a striker continues and as per reports, they are eager to sign Alvaro Morata and they appear to have launched a £25 million bid to acquire the Spaniard’s services ahead of Juventus. 


The former Chelsea man is currently plying his trade with Juve, on loan from Atletico Madrid, but the Italian giants are also reportedly interested in signing Morata permanently. 


As per the latest reports from Corriere dello Sport, the Spaniard himself would ‘choose’ to play under Mikel Arteta at Arsenal. 


The same report goes on to add that sources close to Atletico Madrid have confirmed that the La Liga club have received a bid of £25 million from the Gunners. 


It is speculated that Juventus would only be willing to shell out £12.5m for Morata, which gives Arsenal a major boost in their chase for a clinical frontman. 


The Gunners’ acrimonious divorce with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang earlier in January has weakened their front line, it’s reflecting on their goal-scoring tallies as well. 


In recent weeks, Arteta’s side have been goal-shy, against the likes of Crystal Palace and Brighton. Furthermore, Morata was linked to the Gunners earlier in January as well, but a deal didn’t materialize. 


As per reports, the Spanish striker isn’t willing to stay put at Atleti once his loan move at Juventus expires, and he’s willing to look for pastures anew. 


Morata’s previous stint in London with Chelsea wasn’t a very successful one, as he was often accused of missing chances whenever they came his way. With Arteta eager to add to his firepower, Morata could be the perfect goal poacher for Arsenal
