Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas have made our weekend with a piece of wonderful news. The couple announced that they have welcomed their first child via surrogacy.
According to a report Priyanka and Nick have welcomed a baby girl, 12 weeks early.
However it is being said Priyanka doesn't have any fertility issues preventing her from having a baby, but she is 39 now, so it's not getting any easier. Their busy work schedules also mean that it's difficult for them to physically be together to conceive when she is ovulating, so some time ago they went down the surrogacy route."
