I ate Idli Vada Sambar today and to be honest it was muah chef s kiss Idli Sambar and Vada Sambar are both good but Idli Vada Sambar is a few levels higher I m not sure how to explain it to you but it has the best of both worlds It s kind of my philosophy that when I m sick I eat my favourite comfort foods I know you have to avoid certain foods but eating them always made me feel better So I m not recommending it just sharing
