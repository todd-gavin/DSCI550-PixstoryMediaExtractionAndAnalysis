So we know the importance of applying sun screen, especially during those summer days. But simply applying it also won't do, as incorrectly applied can leave areas of the skin exposed to the sun and harmful UV light. Applying sunscreen rightly means fully covering all the areas of the skin that cam be exposed and reapplying them as often as necessary to maintain a safe level of UV protection. 

Follow these simple steps to easily apply sunscreen on your face and body: 

STEP 1: APPLY YOUR SUNSCREEN BEFORE YOU GO OUT 

It is important to apply the sunscreen before one's  skin gets exposed to the sun. This is because the skin needs to absorb the sunscreens before it is protected.  20 to 30 minutes prior application a good option. 

STEP 2: DOT THE SUNSCREEN ALL OVER YOUR FACE AND BODY 

The best way to apply the sunscreen to your face and body is to dot it on, evenly covering all the areas of exposed skin. Applying sunscreen to your face and body this way helps your skin to easily absorb it. 


STEP 3: GENTLY MASSAGE THE SUNSCREEN INTO YOUR SKIN 

Massage the sunscreen gently into your skin by using the circular motion with your hands making sure that it is thoroughly rubbed in and that no streaks are left. 

STEP 4: ADD AN EXTRA FEW DOTS 

Once the original application is done, you can apply few extra dots to small areas that have not received the needed coverage and massage in. Commonly missed areas are the neck, backs of hand and tops of feet and ankles. 

STEP 5: DON'T FORGET THOSE EARS! 

Squeeze a little from the tube to your fingertips and cover your ears as well. 

STEP 6: REAPPLY YOUR SUNSCREEN 

Reapplying sunscreen is also important, at least every 1.5 to 2 hours and more often if you are swimming. This will ensure you maintain an adequate level of UV protection to stay safe.
