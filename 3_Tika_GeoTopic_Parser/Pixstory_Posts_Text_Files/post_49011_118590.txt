One of the success stories of conservation efforts is the polar bear In the foreseeable future they might no longer be considered endangered As a species That s important to know As a species efforts has been successfully made fo conserve them but that does not mean human activity isn t impacting their lives as individual animals So while they may not be endangered they are still threatened They are considered vulnerable with their population constantly decreasing The major danger to the polar bear s survival is still climate change but there are other dangers as well The oil and gas sector is focusing on the arctic which raises the possibility of habitat degradation as a result of oil exploration Contact with oil spills can lessen a bear s fur s ability to keep them warm making them expend more energy to stay warm If ingested oil spills can also poison bears Through their diet polar bears may also be exposed to hazardous compounds like pesticides which may have an impact on the bears biological processes and capacity for reproduction Source WWF
