KEY TAKEAWAYS

Today, we can trace the Big Bang back to having occurred some 13.8 billion years ago, with the size of the observable Universe stretching to 46.1 billion light-years. 

But not only are units like "years" and "light-years" completely arbitrary and Earth-centric, they haven't even had consistent definitions over the history of Earth. 

There might be better ways to measure time, especially for the Universe, but every alternative has its drawbacks, too.
