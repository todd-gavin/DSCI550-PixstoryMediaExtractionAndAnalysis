Lucknow the city of Nawabs 
My city lucknow is well famous for the architect and beauty. The precisely made monument are eye-catching and a sight of attraction. 
The chikan kari kurtas are world famous. I have visited many places but none had the love my city offers. No other city ever felt like home, people in lucknow are kind and virtuous. 
With many pros, there lies some cons too. 
There is something I believe on which my city needs to work on, what is it? , it's the quality of water. Lucknow needs to improve the quality of water it is provide to the people. Water's healthiness is important for our healthiness. Though I believe my city in the future shall be able to conquer this mountain too.
