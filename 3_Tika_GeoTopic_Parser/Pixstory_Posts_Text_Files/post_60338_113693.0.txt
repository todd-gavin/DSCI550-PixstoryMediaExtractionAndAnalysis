According to Forbes' 2022 list, pop diva Rihanna is the country's youngest self-made billionaire lady.
The 34-year-old singer was just included on Forbes' yearly list of the country's richest self-made women for the third consecutive year. Her current net worth is $1.4 billion. She came in at number 21 overall and is the only billionaire under 40.

Rihanna made her money from her successful music career and her efforts into business, including Fenty Beauty, Fenty Skin, and Savage X Fenty. The Savage X Fenty lingerie company was reportedly working with advisors on an initial public offering that could value the company at $3 billion or more back in March, according to Bloomberg. That business is 30% owned by Rihanna.

The singer also has a stake in Fenty Beauty, which is reported to have brought in $440 million in revenue in 2020.

The nine-time Grammy Award winner admitted in 2019 that she never intended to become rich and that hitting certain financial milestones would make her stop working. She added that she wanted to donate the money to deserving charities.
