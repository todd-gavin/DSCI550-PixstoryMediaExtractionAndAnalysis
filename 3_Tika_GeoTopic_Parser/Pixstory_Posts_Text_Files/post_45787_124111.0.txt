As per the NASA blog, scientists will start to draw a more complete picture of the "lives"—from birth to death—of some of the more than 5,000 bizarre new worlds that have been proven to exist in our galaxy when NASA's James Webb Space Telescope focuses on a few of them. 

Exoplanets, or planets outside of our solar system, have a wide range of sizes and characteristics, according to research so far. Webb will probably put to rest decades-long arguments about how planets form and perish thanks to its capacity to use infrared light to reveal hitherto unseen features of the universe. 

The observatory will analyse exoplanet atmospheres from a million miles afar and investigate their three-dimensional structure. And it could start to paint a clearer image of planets similar to our own, which are tiny, rocky, and and what it takes to make them.
