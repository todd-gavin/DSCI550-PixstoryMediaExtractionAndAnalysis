India to launch its own 'Made in India' TB infection skin test, Dr. Masukh Mandaviya addresses 35th Stop TB Partnership Board Meeting. 

India is all set to launch its very own newly approved 'Made in India' TB infection skin test called as the 'c-TB". A new initiative was also launched named as "Adopt people with TB". 

Narendra Modi's government have been working for making India TB free by the year 2025, which is 5 years before global target of 2030. 

India effectively turns the crises into an opportunity to increase activities that eliminate TB by launching new initiatives like the 'bidirectional testing' of TB with Covid, use of Artificial Intelligence, Digital tools and decentralizing TB services to AB-HWCs.Â
