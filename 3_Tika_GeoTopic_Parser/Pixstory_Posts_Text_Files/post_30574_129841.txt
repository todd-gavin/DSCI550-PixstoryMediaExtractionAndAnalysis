Simone Inzaghi was very satisfied with Inter&#39;s performance in the home match they won against Spezia The Nerazzurri coach commented on his team&#39;s performance The performance was very good we were serious and concentrated The lads were good even though we were contracted in the first few minutes but after Lautaro&#39;s goal we broke free We could have closed it in the first half then in the second we were good at scoring immediately We did well both in possession and in the non-possession phase Spezia came from two games played very well but we prepared just as well good match Inzaghi then praised the performance of his defense and of the players who substituted in the game in progress The three defenders had a great game I changed two players compared to Lecce and I have to choose every time from all the players available Since when it&#39;s the five changes you play in and often the substitutes have to make the difference when the teams are long tonight too they were decisive like in Lecce I had excellent responses from those who came in like on the third goal Gagliardini launched an assist from Dzeko ago and a goal from Correa
