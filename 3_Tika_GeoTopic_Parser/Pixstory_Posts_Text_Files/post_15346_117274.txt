Without water from Lake Idro for the irrigation of the SOS fields for about thousand farms between Brescia and Mantua, the alarm launched by Coldiretti Lombardia in relation to the stop of irrigation supplies from Eridio in underlining that without water resources it is impossible to complete the crops and guarantee what is food production From the national president of Coldiretti Ettore Prandini affirms the regional Coldiretti comes the appeal addressed to the Interregional Agency for the Po river AIPO to the District Authority of the river PO and to the regional councilors Massimo Sertori and Fabio Rolfi so that an effort can be made extraordinary to allow water to continue to be guaranteed for the fields for at least another eight day shift In the meantime, the regional Coldiretti continues in the Lombardy countryside, a race against time to try to salvage what can be salvaged with farmers who have begun to shred in various areas of the territory fodder corn about a month in advance to avoid seeing everything dry out in the field while the tomato harvest driven by the boiling temperatures started in the past few hours a week in advance Despite this, however, Coldiretti Lombardia continues today at regional level drops of about a third for the production of barley, wheat and rice while forage losses are now approaching as well as the estimated drop in corn crop yields In the stables the cows are producing up to less milk but drought and heat also threatens the herds that go up to the mountain pastures in search of grass and cooler temperatures continues the Coldiretti with the lack of rain that risks drying out the meadows and lowering the water tables
