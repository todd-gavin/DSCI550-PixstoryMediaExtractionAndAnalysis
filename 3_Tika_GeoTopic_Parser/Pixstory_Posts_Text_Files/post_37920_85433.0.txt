Inter Miami welcomed Chicago Fire to the Lockhart Stadium in Florida for their MLS season opener. A lot was expected from the David Beckham-owned side but they lacked the cutting edge on the opening night. 

Former Real Madrid superstar Gonzalo Higuaín was leading the line for Inter Miami. But the Argentine failed to register a single shot as his side stumbled to a 0-0 draw on the opening night. 

Chicago Fire themselves have the likes of Xherdan Shaqiri in their squad. The Fire had a total of 16 shots, of which only 3 were on target. Both the teams lacked the cutting edge but the visitors did dominate the possession stats on the night. 





"F*** that Guy" ~ Fabian Herbers 

Gonzalo Higuain cut a frustrated figure in the MLS season opener. And his attitude seems to have irritated a few players including Chicago Fire's Fabian Herbers as per The Daily Mail. 

After the game, Fabian Herbers said, "He is so pathetic. He's a presence on the field. But every time a teammate of his makes a wrong pass or something or doesn't pass the ball exactly to him, he's just standing there looking in a negative mood."

Fabian Herbers didn't stop there, he would go on to add that Higuain's body language was terrible,  adding that he wouldn't want to play with him. The Chicago Fire striker concluded by saying "F*ck that guy. I want nothing, no part of it."

Gonzalo Higuain has had a long career spanning all over Europe. The Argentine has played for Real Madrid, Juventus, AC Milan, Chelsea, and Napoli. The striker has also represented River Plate in his early days. 

The 34-year old joined the Major League Soccer side Inter Miami in 2020. Gonzalo Higuain scored 12 goals and provided 7 assists in the 2021 MLS season. 

Higuain's reaction was certainly not well received by many people. This included Julian Gressel, the former D.C. United superstar. Gressel agreed to what Herbers said and added that a senior player like Gonzalo Higuain should be leading the side from the front.
