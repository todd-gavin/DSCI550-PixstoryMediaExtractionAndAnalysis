In 2017, Barcelona staged indisputably the greatest comeback in Champions League history by putting a four-goal deficit behind them by defeating Paris Saint-Germain 6-1 in the second leg of the last-16 tie.However, the refereeing decision were severely scrutinized on the night, with many claiming that the presence of a VAR system in place would have meant the Parisians left with a victory over two legs.Unai Emery, who was the Ligue 1 side’s manager at the time is revealed to have knocked on referee Tony Chapron’s door during a league game against Lorient on the following weekend to pick his brain about the controversial calls. Chapron ended up revealing what he told the-then PSG boss during their meeting.“I thought he had come to contest a not very judicious decision that he had taken, but not at all. He told me: ‘Mr. Chapron, I have a question to ask you about the Barcelona match. Can you explain the referee’s decisions to me?’When you’re a referee, you have to stick together. I lied to Unai Emery, I said, ‘No, I had not seen the game.’Surely it is what he would have liked to hear but it was not the time. So, I didn’t. Today and five years later, I can say it and perhaps, once retired, it is easier to say that we are human and we are also wrong”, he told Canal +, as relayed by MARCA.For UEFA, the result of the first leg meant that the clash would be comfortable to referee, a kind of ‘test’ without any risk. For the occasion, the body appointed a referee with little experience at the first level and an additional referee who had practically no experience in the competition, Benjamin Brand.“He shouldn’t have been there. On his first decision, the additional referee panicked. At 1-0, the first thing he did was look at the other assistant to see if he had to give the goal or not.”
