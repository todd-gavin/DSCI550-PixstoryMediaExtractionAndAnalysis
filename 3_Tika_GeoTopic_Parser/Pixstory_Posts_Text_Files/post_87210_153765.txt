Manchester City announced their arrival in the Matchday of this season of the premier league with a resounding win over Southampton at the Etihad stadium This victory helped the side reach the top of the table for the first time this Premier League season as they currently have accumulated points in matches The forwards shined along with the other departments of the team also carrying out their tasks perfectly well to hand their side a sublime win The several events that took place in the match are not possibly going to be depicted merely by the scorecard Manchester City showed great rhythm right from the early phases of the game as they showed great intent with the ball in their possession The hosts despite being in total command of the game right from the beginning struggled to open the scoring as Haaland saw his shot hit the post with minutes in the clock Finally it was Joao Cancelo who found City s first goal of the game with an incredible solo effort which involved a fake shot followed by a fine left footed shot into the back of the net minutes later Kevin De Bruyne burst open from the central midfield region to provide Foden with an opportunity which was converted into City s second goal with ease by the year old It was barely minutes into the second half that Rodri managed to find Mahrez into the Southampton box with his brilliant trivella pass as the Algerian smashed the ball into the goal to make it Haaland seemingly was having an off day since he wasn t able to convert the chances until now However it didn t take the Norwegian sensation long to find his goal as he smashed in a perfect cross from Joao Cancelo to score City s th goal with almost minutes of regular time left Southampton did have their chances towards the later half of the game but could barely come close to pulling one back The match ended in City s favour with Pep Guardiola s men reaching the summit of the table
