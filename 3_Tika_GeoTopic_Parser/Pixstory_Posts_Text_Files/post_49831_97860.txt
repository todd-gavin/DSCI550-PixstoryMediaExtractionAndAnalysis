 De Santis has promised that before he leaves his post he would draw a publicly carry firearms even if they have not previously taken a training course or gotten a permit I would like to point out the word permitless here When people are done with gun violence De Santis wants to make gun laws even lax The term constitutional carry is a name for the policy often used by the supporters who argue citizens should be able to carry weapons with or without a permit because of the U S Constitution s Second Amendment Currently Handgun owners in Florida are required to get a license to carry their weapons in most public places To get a concealed weapon permit a handgun owner has to take a firearms training class that includes instruction involving the live firing of a loaded gun According to Time Bay Times De Santis said I can t tell you exactly when but I m pretty confident that I will be able to sign constitutional carry into law in the state of Florida The Legislature will get it done I can t tell you if it s going to be next week six months but I can tell you that before I am done as governor we will have a signature on that bill Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried fired by DeSantis said This is absurd political pandering from the governor of a state that has experienced some of the worst mass shootings in our country s history and in a nation where we have the highest rates of gun violence in the world It s an insult to the memories and families of every victim of gun violence Already there are signals of backing from Republican leaders for constitutional carry before Friday Senate President Wilton Simpson R Trilby said in January he would support such a measure And in March DeSantis said he could see the policy being brought up during a special session this year
