The BCCI's revenue of Rs 48,390 crore from the sale of IPL media rights is so large that it deserves to be placed into context - which is exactly what India Today is doing. When compared to state budgets, the largest mergers and acquisitions, the most expensive government initiatives, the largest IPOs, and the most lucrative enterprises, it is clear that IPL is an astounding success story.

When the IPL media rights price is compared to the government's major scheme spending for FY23, the BCCI's earnings from the league will come in fourth place, ahead of the National Education Mission and the National Health Mission.

When compared to the corporations who made the most money in 2021-22, the price of IPL media rights alone would rank second after Reliance Industries.

The IPL media rights were sold for a higher amount than any of the top eight mergers and acquisitions that occurred in 2021.

The BCCI is expecting a windfall of Rs 48,380 crore, which is larger than the government's cost of granting incentives under the PLI programmes to stimulate domestic manufacturing.
