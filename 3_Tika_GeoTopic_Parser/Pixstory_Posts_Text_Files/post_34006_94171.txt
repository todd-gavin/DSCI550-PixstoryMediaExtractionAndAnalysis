The return of the quarter-final between Barcelona and Eintracht Frankfurt was staged in an unusual setting Blaugrana defeat and feat of the Germans in a Camp Nou filled by over thousand fans arriving from Germany An almost paradoxical situation with Xavi&#39;s Bar a house occupied for largely from the visiting supporters who painted the Blaugrana temple white In the post match Xavi and some of his players, including Arajo and Eric Garc a, couldn&#39;t help but point out the episode The atmosphere didn&#39;t help us It looked like a Champions League final with the audience divided in half The club controller what happened there was certainly a miscalculation I expected a Camp Nou with thousands of Bara fans but that was not the case During the match given the thousands of Germans present even the Blaugrana fans sparked a protest walking away from the grandstands and leaving the seats empty President Joan Laporta also intervened on the matter The most worrying thing besides the defeat is what happened It must not be repeated We have collected some information on safety and ticket sales Now we need time to process it and we will take action what happened is outrageous and shameful We will have to be tougher It all leads us to situations that should not have occurred We will take new measures Like cul I am ashamed to see so many rival fans I am sorry Xavi is right it was very serious
