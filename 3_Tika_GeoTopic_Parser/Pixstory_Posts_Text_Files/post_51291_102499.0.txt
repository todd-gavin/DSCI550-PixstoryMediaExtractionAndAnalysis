As we look at May 25, 2022 two years after the murder of George Floyd, We are still reeling from the senseless murder and massacre of 10 Black Lives. If you research racial violence against Black Lives in the United States from blackpast.org there were 10 other black massacres in past 100 years. Keeping this latest horrific massacre of Black Lives in mind remember we just celebrated Anti-Lynching Bill signing by President Joe Biden on March 29, 2022. By the way this is the first time in US history there has been a federal law to stop the murder by mob after 200 attempts to pass this law. And yet 45 days later a white supremacist commits domestic terrorist act of murdering 10 Black Lives while they shopped in their neighborhood grocery store. So again the question remains after the murder of George Floyd 2 years ago, and.creation of May 25 as Black Lives Matter Day and now this horrific senseless mass murder of Black Lives on May 14,2022 in Buffalo NY - Do #BlackLivesMatter ?

The answer is of course: Yes Black Lives Matter! But what are the solutions to making sure the attacks against the Black community and when will Living While Black mean not living in fear for our lives? 

What I am committed to doing is to talk daily about #BlackSolutions and I will be posting daily here on Pixstory with solution makers like Moses West Foundation who is bringing clean water ðŸ’¦ into the black community from the air.
