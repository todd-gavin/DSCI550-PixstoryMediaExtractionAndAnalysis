After losing her mother at a tender age and her father at a developing age, we see how Cinderella faces the odds and lives a kind and courageous life under the thumb of her cruel and manipulative stepmother and stepsisters. Cinderella was taught by her mother to always have courage and be kind, no matter the person, no matter the situation. Even after she is used and abused by her family on a daily basis, she never reacts or acts badly towards them, she does all that they command and demand without any fuss while taking of her animal friends lovingly. I believe by being her true self and not giving into the negativity of her family, Cinderella keeps herself peaceful even in the face of adversity. The one time she shows excitement for a ball where all are invited, she is humiliated and berated hideously, and in that moment of despair she finds herself being helped by a magical entity and is able to go to the ball. This portrays that even in our worst times, there exists a force, a person that will help us in whichever form that may be, to overcome our circumstance and be better, even when all hope seems lost. She goes to the ball, dances with the Prince, they fall in love, but she has to go back so she runs away. The Prince orders a full search for her with only her glass slipper to help identify her, when they reach the last hope, her house, where she's been locked away by the stepmother to not let her be with the Prince. Fortunately, she's able to escape with her good old friends' help, the mice, and show that she was the girl at the ball with the Prince. This shows how even the most timid, unassuming people in our lives can have an immense influence on us. This young girl, with such pain and tragedy in her heart, lives on with courage and kindness no matter what and is able to build a happy life for herself at the end, with people who treat her right and cherish and love her.
