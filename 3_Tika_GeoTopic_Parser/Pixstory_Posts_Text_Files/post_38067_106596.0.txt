Cristiano Ronaldo would have taken a deep breath of relief on Saturday. The Portuguese striker has been dismissed from all charges following a Rape Allegation filed by Kathryn Mayorga in 2009.

As per Kathryn, the incident took place in the USA in 2009.  The former model and teacher alleged she was assaulted by Cristiano Ronaldo in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009. The model filed the complaint in 2018 and also claimed that Ronaldo had paid her $375,000 as a settlement following the incident. 

However, Cristiano Ronaldo has maintained that he did not rape Kathryn Mayorga. As per the Portuguese Superstar, they had consensual sex. 

Judge Jennifer Dorsey threw out the case brought by Kathryn Mayorga on Saturday. As per Times Now, "In a 42-page ruling released Friday, the judge accused Mayorga's attorneys of "abuses and flagrant circumvention of the proper litigation process" and said that as a result, "Mayorga loses her opportunity to pursue this case."

Hence the former model would now be unable to revive the case. This would certainly be a big boost to Cristiano Ronaldo and his family. The Portuguese striker would certainly have a big burden lifted off his chest as he looks to head into the 2022/23 season with positivity after a tough year with Manchester United.
