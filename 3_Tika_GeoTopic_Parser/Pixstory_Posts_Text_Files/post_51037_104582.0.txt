Active transportation improves our health and the health of our communities. It is a sad state that we will see increased use of personal vehicles due to restricted / under the capacity of public transport. The place I live in is surrounded by a majority of automobile industries and also near proximity of the city also attracted people from other industries.ðŸš²

Cycle to beat air pollution:

One of the major contributor to city or town pollution is private vehicles. Others are waste burning or disposal without proper management. While waste management requires both public and govt support, other doesnâ€™t require any support from govt, perhaps no to low GST on bicycles.ðŸš´

If we can reduce the number of private vehicles on the road, we are halfway successful to bet air pollution. All we need is a bicycle and motivated minds to contribute to our surroundings as well as ourselves!ðŸš´

One of the reasons people donâ€™t commute by walk or cycle even if it is adjacent street is they find it safe to use a motorcycle or cars. If every one of us starts using a cycle for commuting, we can also make roads a safer place to walk. 

Letâ€™s do something for the environment â€” make smarter travel choices today! ðŸš²
