Nothing is nearly as graceful as a black cat; like a smaller version of an Amazonian jaguar, they sleep atop the tallest point in the region and awaken several times every day to scavenge for tempting treats. However, black cats and kittens are sometimes disregarded by animal shelters when they are looking for new homes and may stay there for a lot longer than they ought to. 

Today is the perfect day to treat your cat, especially a black one, to something extra special. We frequently forget to return some of the affection that our pets provide us on a daily basis because we are all so busy with our lives today. Therefore, purchase your cat a new toy or some yummy treats.
