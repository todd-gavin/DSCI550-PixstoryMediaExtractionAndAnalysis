Shelter from the rain by Ashleigh McCord USA Photograph Ashleigh McCord Wildlife Photographer of the Year During a visit to the Maasai Mara in Kenya Ashleigh captured this tender moment between a pair of male lions At first she had been taking pictures of only one of the lions and the rain was just a light sprinkle although the second had briefly approached and greeted his companion before choosing to walk away But as the rain turned into a heavy downpour the second male returned and sat positioning his body as if to shelter the other Shortly after they rubbed faces and continued to sit nuzzling for some time Ashleigh stayed watching them until the rain was falling so hard that they were barely visible Equipment used Nikon D mm f lens sec at f ISO wildlife photography nature
