The midfielder's current contract expires in June, but he is eager to sign a new agreement at Emirates Stadium. Mohamed Elneny has expressed his desire to sign a new deal with Arsenal, and the Egypt international is now awaiting a final decision from the Gunners on his future.

Elneny joined Arsenal from Basel for £5 million in January 2016, and he has since made 142 
appearances for the club while also winning the FA Cup.

After Mikel Arteta's arrival in December 2019, the 29-year-old slid down the pecking order in the Arsenal team, but has lately regained favour and is now playing a significant role in the Gunners' push for a top-four Premier League finish.

Elneny is poised to become a free agent in the summer, but the midfielder remains optimistic 
that Arsenal would extend him new terms because the club is his "family."

“If Arsenal say: ‘We want you’, I don’t think about leaving,” the Egyptian said after the Gunners' 3-1 win over Manchester United on Saturday. “It’s my family for six years. I love this club.

“I always love a challenge and give 100 per cent all the time. I don’t decide who plays, but I 
keep going in training to show how good I am and to make him (Arteta) play me. If I don’t play I keep going until I get my chance. The contract and stuff, I’m just waiting for the club to decide 
what they want.”

Elneny put up a strong effort in the middle of the park against United, just three days after a 
similar performance in a 4-2 victory over Chelsea in the London derby.

He had previously only made seven top-flight appearances in 2021-22, but he is grateful to 
Arteta for putting his faith in him against two of the division's biggest clubs, and he hopes to 
keep his spot in their remaining five games.
