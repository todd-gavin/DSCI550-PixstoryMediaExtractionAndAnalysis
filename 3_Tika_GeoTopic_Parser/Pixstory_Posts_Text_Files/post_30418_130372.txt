Milan didn&#39;t go beyond that at Atalanta and broke away from the leading duo formed by Inter and Milan The coach Stefano Pioli speaks openly about the points left behind by the Rossoneri We played a good match I&#39;m satisfied with the performance even if I&#39;m not satisfied with the performance result We conceded little played with spirit We were masters and lacked precision in the last portion of the pitch and however we should have been less frenetic in the second half more dribbling and lucidity would have been needed I agree if we are talking about two lost points Pioli then added We missed little to win the game Lots of small untapped chances I liked the performance Atalanta had two shots on goal it meant we had a great match in both phases
