Pride Month is a celebration of voiced being heard, about identity, breaking stigmas and a revolution for humankind. It is offensive to demean it. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), a loud member of the Republican Party’s conservative wing, appears to be doubling down on anti-LGBTQ rhetoric in the past week as she called for the end of pride month. She claimed that straight people will become extinct, and a fake statement with a lack of evidence that the Uvalde gunman was a “cross-dressing loner.”

 Greene compared “an entire” Pride Month to the “only one day each year” that Americans honour military members who died serving the country in a tweet on Wednesday—the first day of Pride Month.

She added that “an entire” Pride Month celebrating LGBTQ identity and millions in spending from corporations and the government “needs to end.”

When asked to clarify if Greene was calling for the end of Pride Month entirely, or if she was calling for it to be reduced, Greene’s communications director, Nick Dyer, said, “Her tweet is self-explanatory,”

Greene wildly claimed earlier this week that she believes straight people face extinction within 150 years during a portion of her streaming broadcast that airs on her social media accounts.

On the same broadcast, she seemed to heed the same misinformation used by Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) to contend that the Uvalde shooter was transgender, using false information and photos of another person.

There have been attacks on the LGBTQIA+ Community by the Republican state houses and many republicans including some major members who prove themselves to be Anti-LGBTQIA+ through their words and actions.
