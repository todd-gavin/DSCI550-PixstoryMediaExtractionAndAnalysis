According to me good communication means

1) Understanding the mood of the other person to whom you are presenting your ideas. You have to always change your conversation by seeing how is the other person behaving. 

2) always change your style of soeaking according to the person in front of you. If you have to sent across a message you should always try to speak in a way tge pther person understands. You have to make twists

3) I think the most important thing of communication is confidence. Always be confident of what you want to say. Be expressive. Use your body language and always carry a self respect with yourself
