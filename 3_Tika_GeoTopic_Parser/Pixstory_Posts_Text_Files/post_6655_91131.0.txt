A two-minute-long video of a man delivering a speech on stage has been shared on social media. It has been claimed that this individual is the owner of the Himalaya Drug Company. He has also been identified as a Muslim. In the video, the man can be heard calling for a boycott of Jio phones and petrol pumps owned by Reliance.

The video is also circulating on Facebook.

The same video was shared last year with the message – “This Muslim man is the owner of the Himalaya company. Listen to what he says carefully. You have been warned. This company manufactures beauty products and Ayurvedic medicine. Circulate the call to boycott everything from its Liv52 syrup to hand sanitiser. Stop buying these yourselves and spread this message. The company will go into a loss instantly. What is the difference between this Muslim man and Zakir Naik? Nothing.”
