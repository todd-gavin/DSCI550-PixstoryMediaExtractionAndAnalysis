Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James proved he is still one of the best players in the league on Saturday night against the Golden State Warriors. Desperately needing a win, James scored 56 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, carrying the Lakers to their first victory since before the All-Star break.

Scoring 56 points at any time in a players’ career is impressive. However, doing it at age 37 — in his 19th NBA season — is completely unprecedented. Despite being towards the tail end of his career, James is playing at age 37 the way many superstars play in their primes.

When asked how he’s been able to maintain himself for so long, James spoke about the off-court care that goes into keeping his legs fresh. “The No. 1 thing is sleep, rest,” James said. “Obviously I’ll be able to sleep better tonight then I’ve done over the last few games. That’s just human nature, you have your mind racing and racing and racing on what can you do to help the team get a win, figuring out ways you can be better.

“But I get optimal sleep and in between days I try to get a nap in as well, a couple hours, but also just always in the treatment room, in the cold tubs icing down, stretching, eating right, putting the right food in my body, the right fuel to be able to play a game less than 48 hours later.

“That’s what’s been going on, we’ve been playing every other day, we got another one on Monday,” James said of the hectic NBA schedule. “So just trying to stay above the curve, I’m always trying to be proactive and not reactive in anything that I do as far as what I do before a game. A lot of people don’t see what I do, but I get to the arena five hours before the game to start prepping both mentally, physically, spiritually, everything. So when I get out on the floor, I just let it go.”
