Thanks to a fantastic performance from the goalkeeper Gikiewic. The decisive goal was scored by Berisha (59'). 
77% possession. 19 shots. Champions Bayern still couldn't score and won the match against Augsburg today at WWK Arena. A lethargic performance and inability to finish cost them their first defeat after three draws. Mane, Same, Musiala, Gnabry all hit the target but failed to beat Augsburg goalkeeper Gikiewic. He made 6 saves in the game. 
Bayern Munich looked like they were still in the hangover of winning against Barcelona in the midweek UEFA Champions League tie. They can also say that they beat Inter also, but their performance, energy and passing in the Bundesliga is going to be questioned. Bayern manager Julian Nagelsmann’s job might be in danger too. 
In the previous three matches, the results were 2-2 vs VFB Stuttgart, 1-1 against Union Berlin, and 1-1 draw with Borussia M'gladbach. The most titled club, who has been winning the league for the last 10 years consecutively, will be looking to come back strongly in the coming matches. They will be facing Leverkusen, Borussia Dortmund and SC Freiburg in the upcoming matches. First and third are at home and away matches against Borussia Dortmund. 
Sadio Mane, who came to Bayern this season, got off to a fast start with the Bundesliga giants, scoring three goals in his first three league games. However, he has since gone six without another strike, including two in the Champions League. 
This was the first match after 87 games when Bayern failed to score in the Bundesliga. Borussia Dortmund are now on top of the table with 5 wins and 2 losses from 7 games.
