It doesn’t matter how safe you try to be in sports, some accidents are bound to happen!

One such unfortunate accident has disturbed me!

US News reported that Sule Kangangi, a cyclist from Kenya, was killed in a collision on Saturday while taking part in a gravel race in Vermont. 

In the Vermont Overland race, Kangangi was travelling quickly when he fell. 

“Sule is our captain, friend, brother. He is also a father, husband and son. Gaping holes are left when giant’s fall. Sule was a giant,” his Team AMANI posted on social media. “Instead of leading us at the front of the pack, he will now lead us as our guiding pole star as we press forward in the realization of his dream.”

The wife of Kenya's incoming president, William Ruto, wrote on Twitter that she was saddened to discover that he had died in an unfortunate accident. 

According to the race's website, the Vermont Overland is a 59-mile (95-kilometer) dirt road bicycle race with approximately 7,000 feet (2,130 metres) of climbing. According to officials, the race, which starts and concludes in Brownsville in the municipality of West Windsor, attracted about 900 riders on Saturday.

Let’s hope similar accidents in the future are avoided!
