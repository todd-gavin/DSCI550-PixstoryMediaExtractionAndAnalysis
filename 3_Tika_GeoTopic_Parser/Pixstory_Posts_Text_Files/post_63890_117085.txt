Instrumentals are a core component of music but their severe lack in the average person s diet today has had less than positive effects Instrumental music is any kind of music without vocals It can range from classical blues rock jazz heavy metal contemporary Instrumental music is incredibly diverse so do not restrict yourself to only one genre Many people think of classical music only when it comes to instrumentals and if they don t find classical all that appealing it s easy to discount instrumental music as a whole altogether without really understanding its true potential This is usually the case with people with narrow minds that do not wish to go beyond their comfort zone deciding not to ever give it a try because they simply don t get it Well for those who have dismissed instrumentals completely think again While vocals are undoubtedly important wordless music has its own appeal On hearing vocals we would often relate more to the lyrics than with the music Listening to instrumental music can embellish our thought process as we start to envisage the artistry and the compositional technicalities of the instrument such as the rhythm scales and notes Certain pieces can feel so intimate they can creep inside you giving you goosebumps Sometimes there s no need for words to act as a medium Some people cry because of the pure beauty of the music Some instrumental pieces can emanate feelings of loss loneliness uncertainty fear or happiness tranquility and satisfaction to name a few This is related to tone speed pitch and other factors Furthermore instrumental music also leads to infinite space for interpretation giving you greater freedom to create meaning for the song you are listening to With the lack of lyrics and vocals the experience can be a meditative one which can result in increased focus The experience can be so engrossing that it can make us lost in memories when we begin to perceive the artistry and the emotional connect in the compositions that we listen to whether it is in guitar sitar sax keyboards drums bass tabla etc Instrumental music can also positively affect cognition patience and recall
