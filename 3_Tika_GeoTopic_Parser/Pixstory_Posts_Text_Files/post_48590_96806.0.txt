The former Pelicans coach, Stan Van Gundy, said he is always dubious of hype surrounding talents "angling" to play for the Knicks in a forthright talk on the Knicks' downfall in 2021-22.

With Williamson out for the season, the Pelicans earned the No. 10 seed in the Western Conference, won two games in the play-in tournament to clinch the final playoff slot, and then defeated the Suns in Game 2 of the playoffs. They were behind 2-1 going into Game 4 on Sunday.

Rumors that Williamson wants out of New Orleans may be dispelled now that the Pelicans have proven they have a diverse roster. Pelicans GM David Griffin, on the other hand, may prefer fewer injury-prone players in a trade for the guy who reportedly weighed 330 pounds in December.

“They made a lot of moves [since I left],” Van Gundy said. “Would they deal Zion based on the success they’re having without him? Yeah, they’d be open to that but they’re not giving him away.

“Can Zion go there [to the Knicks]? Yeah, definitely could. But what are you giving them back? You’re going to give them a lot. You’re not giving them [Knicks center] Mitchell Robinson and a first-round pick for Zion. Of course you like that trade. It’s never going to happen.”

Van Gundy believes Dallas' unrestricted free agency point guard Jalen Brunson is a better fit, albeit the current drama involving Rick Brunson's son may be exaggerated.
