So lots of girls have a misconception about it that they should not go to the beach or pool during periods. you might be wondering whether or not you'll actually be able to enjoy a dip in the pool without fear of leaving a trail of period blood wherever you go. 
So my ans to this question is that yes you can swim on your periods. You should use tampons and menstrual cup while swimming 
Do not use a pad as it absorbs water. 
So girls donâ€™t worry about your periods and enjoy summers in pool ðŸ˜‰
