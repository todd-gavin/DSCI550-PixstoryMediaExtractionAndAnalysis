If you are working as a writer or you are a student who makes assignments now or then, there is one word that is very common in both the fields which is Plagiarism.

Plagiarism is a type of fraud that is taken very seriously in the academic world, mainly because using the work of others as if it were your own does not convey much respect for the efforts that other people have put into their work.

There are common forms of Plagiarism which are as follows:- 

1. The Ghost Writer:- The writer turns in another’s work, word for word, as his or her own.

2. The Poor Disguise:- Although the writer has retained the essential content of the source, he or she has altered the paper’s appearance slightly by changing keywords and phrases.

3. The labor of laziness:- The writer takes the time to paraphrase most of the paper from other sources and make it all fit together, instead of spending the same effort on the original work.

4. The misinformer:- The writer provides inaccurate information regarding the sources, making it impossible to find them.

5. The Self-Stealer:- The writer “borrows” generously from his or her previous work, violating policies concerning the expectation of originality adopted by most academic institutions.

6. The Forgotten Footnote:- The writer mentions an author’s name for a source but neglects to include specific information on the location of the material referenced. This often masks other forms of plagiarism by obscuring source locations.

7. The Potluck Paper:- The writer tries to disguise plagiarism by copying from several different sources, tweaking the sentences to make them fit together while retaining most of the original phrasing.

These are the common forms of plagiarism and please take care of these terms before writing anything professionally.
