Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said just moments ago that the US has no plans to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine for Russian military aircraft. 

The Guardian reported that Psaki was informed by a reporter that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had requested that the west establish a no-fly zone over his besieged country. 

"The reason why the president [Joe Biden] has not been willing to take that step is because it requires implementation," Psaki added. It entails the US military shooting down Russian planes and maybe provoking a direct conflict with Russia, which is precisely what we want to avoid."

"But we are not taking moves that would trigger a confrontation between the US and Russia," she said, adding that Biden has expanded support for Ukraine, including military equipment and ammunition. 

According to a senior US defence official, Russian forces have not yet taken control of the southern Ukrainian port city of Kherson, which is noted for its shipbuilding industry. 

This is in contrary to most media reports, including the Guardian's, which claim that the Black Sea port was the first major Ukrainian city to fall under de facto Russian control on Wednesday.

This came after Kherson's mayor, Igor Kolykhaiev, said on Facebook that Russian military were in charge of the city hall and that citizens should follow a curfew enforced by "armed visitors."
