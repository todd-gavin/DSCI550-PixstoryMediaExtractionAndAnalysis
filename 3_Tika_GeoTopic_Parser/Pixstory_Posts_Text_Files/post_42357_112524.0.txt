I just finished watching Stranger Things Season 04 Vol. 02 and after watching, one thing I want to say is that Stranger Things is getting better season by season and Stranger Things is one of the best web series in terms of its story writing and character building.

Volume 02 of Stranger Things Season 04 started from the same point where Volume 01 has ended but Volume 02 put the foot on the accelerator and things started happening which were leading us to the great season finale.

In total, there are 3 stories which are connected and are simultaneously in focus in Volume 02.

The first story is about Dustin, Max, Lucas, Robin, Steve, Eddie, Nancy, and Erica and they were trying to kill Vecna by going in upside down with the help of a gate.

The second story is about Hopper, Joyce, Murray, and Dimitri who are trying to come back to America but Hopper got an idea which will indirectly help the kids to kill Vecna.

The third story is about Mike, Will, Jonathan, and Argyle, and they want to evacuate Eleven from Dr Brenner once they succeed in it, now they are trying to save their friends from Hawkins.

If I write anything else about Volume 02 then it will be a spoiler from my side and will ruin your experience of watching the show.

Things I liked about the Stranger Things Season 04 Vol. 02 are its story writing and character building because the characters who were introduced in the fourth season only will connect with you very easily and you will laugh and cry for them for sure.

Season 05 of Stranger Things will be the last instalment and I canâ€™t wait for Season 05.

Note down in the comments and tell me the moments that you liked in Volume 02.
