Donald Trump has been dropping the hints of his intention to run for the 2024 presidential election for quite a while now. Addressing a crowed at American Freedom Tour he promised his supporters that he would return to the White House in 2024. According to the bookies Donald Trump is the favorite heading into the 2024 presidential elections. If the election were to be held today Trump might just edge out Joe Biden. This is in stark contrast to the 2021 predictions where Biden was a clear favorite ahead of Trump but due to recent events like the re-emergence of COVID-19, the botched American pull out in Afghanistan and the migrant crisis all made Biden lose popular support. Biden's loss has Trump's gain and the former president has become the new favorite for the 2024 elections.

Trump still remains the main protagonist for the republican party as there is no obvious person who is seen as his alternative or is ready to succeed him. The base of the party still want Trump to be involved as his approval ratings are higher than ever with 70% of republicans wanting Trump to run for the 2024 presidential elections according to a Morning Consult/Politco Poll from December 2021. Another reason for Trump's hold on the party is that there is not a long list of GOP politicians who have disavowed him and been successful.

As the 2022 midterms are getting closer, Donald Trump has become the most powerful voice in the Republican party. He has been trying very hard to affect the races. The former President has been campaigning against people in the GOP who have crossed him, such as those who voted to impeach him. He has also been endorsing candidates that have supported him throughout the various sagas of his presidency. It's not just about endorsements, either. Trump has the power to direct large sums of campaign cash. His Save America PAC in 2021 gave $5,000 each, the legal limit, to a variety of candidates.
