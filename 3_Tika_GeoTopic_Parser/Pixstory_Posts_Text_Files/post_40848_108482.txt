Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams The blue Mediterranean where he lay Lull d by the coil of his crystalline streams Beside a pumice isle in Baiae s bay And saw in sleep old palaces and towers Quivering within the wave s intenser day All overgrown with azure moss and flowers So sweet the sense faints picturing them Thou For whose path the Atlantic s level powers Cleave themselves into chasms while far below The sea blooms and the oozy woods which wear The sapless foliage of the ocean know Thy voice and suddenly grow gray with fear And tremble and despoil themselves oh hear Percy Bysshe Shelley
