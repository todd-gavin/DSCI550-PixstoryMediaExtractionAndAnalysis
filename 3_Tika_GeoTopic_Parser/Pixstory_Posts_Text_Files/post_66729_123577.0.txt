Among the most celebrated Australia tourist attractions, the Sydney Harbor Bridge is a must-visit. Rising 134 m above the harbor, the bridge is affectionately called “the Coat hanger”. This engineering marvel is also the largest steel arch bridge in the world.

Things to do: Enjoy the scintillating cityscape from the bridge, climb the bridge with a guide, if interested in knowing about the bridge’s history and its construction, visit the museum in the southeastern pier.

How to reach: The bridge can also be approached from the south by accessing Cahill Walk, which runs along the Cahill Expressway. Pedestrians can access this walkway from the east end of Circular Quay by a flight of stairs or a lift. Alternatively it can be accessed from the Botanic Gardens.
