We know if we were out of emojis we wouldn't be able to express ourselves properly, like without adding a smiley we won't be able to let the other person know what we feel like as text messages alone won't be able to set the tone of our message now. 

All the emoji enthusiasts out there, today you can celebrate the emoji you love and you can celebrate them through various ways like dressing up like your favourite emoji, indulging yourself in emoji themed delicacies and wait for the new releases of emojis and many more ways. 

And so let's celebrate this Emojis Day by getting to know about the various additions into our emoji lists soon. 

The emojis that will most likely roll out by 2023 are additions to the present ones like if you are a musical texter you can add a flute or maracas, the Sikh users will welcome the Khanda, the symbol of that religion‚Äôs faith. 

Another set of additions are shaking face to the most awaiting one which is pushing of hands which will look like someone offering to give or receive a high five. Light blue, grey and pink hearts are going to come in. The emoji zoo set will have additional members of a moose, donkey, goose, and jellyfish. And you‚Äôll be able to add ginger, pea pods and a hyacinth to your texts. 

Happy Emoji Day ü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è. Celebrate the importance of emojis in our lives and never take them for granted.
