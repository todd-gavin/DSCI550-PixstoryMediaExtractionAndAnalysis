We read daily about how racism affects everyday life of black people. However, being in the position of privilege, we more often than not ignore it or consider it false. 

“Racism is a thing of past. Nowadays no one is racist”- how many time we have heard this statement among her peer group. But the reality tells us otherwise. 

A recent example of this is the couple Paul Austin and Tenisha Tate Austin from California. They were suspicious about the low valuation of their home in Marin City, California so they asked a white friend to pose as the owner and the value surged by £345,000. 

Daily Mirror reported: Paul Austin and Tenisha Tate Austin bought their home in Marin City, California, from another black family in 2016 before giving the property a £287,000 ($400,000) makeover. The huge revamp included adding an entire floor to the house, which brought an extra 1,000 feet of space, new flooring, new appliances and a fireplace. 
However despite all their work, and expense, when an estate agent valued the property they suspected she had undervalued it at because they were black. 

The couple said the estate agent was an older white woman who used coded phrases like 'Marin City is a distinct area' when she valued the property which they believe was race-related.

This piece of news should be an eye opener for many. This proves that racism is not a thing of the past but very much prevalent today. Moreover, it is so deep rooted and institutionalised that people don’t even recognise it anymore. It maybe be cloaked but it still affects the daily lives of black people.
