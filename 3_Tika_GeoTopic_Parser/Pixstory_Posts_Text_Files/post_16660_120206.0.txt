I think Lal Singh Chaddha will be a great movie.👍🏻👍🏻🔥🎥🎥

Anyone who has watched Forrest Gump will know what I am talking about. LSC is an official remake of 1994 Hollywood movie starring Tom Hanks “Forrest Gump”.✅✅

Forrest Gump is considered one of the greatest movies of all time in cinema history. It revolves around a man named Forrest Gump who is an innocent man with a very low IQ. Many historical events take place in his time and he becomes a part of mostly everything. He was a soldier in the Vietnam War, he met two presidents of United States who were assassinated short after, he also met John Lennon (one of the band members of the Beatles) who was also assassinated shortly after his meeting with him. He survived the infamous Hurricane Carmen. He had also inspired Elvis Presley to get his signature dance step during his childhood.🥰🥰

I guess LCS will focus on the war which was fought between India and Pakistan in 1971 (like Vietnam War in Forrest Gump). It will most probably include the assassinations of Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi just after he met them (like Roosevelt and Kennedy assassinations in Forrest Gump). It may include the Fodder Scam of 80’s which ended Lalu Yadav’s reign as Chief Minister. (Like Watergate Scandal which ended Richard Nixon’s reign as the president of United States in Forrest Gump). They can include any of the major cyclones that hit India in 70’s or 80’s (like Hurricane Carmen in Forrest Gump).🤯🤯

The love interest for Forrest Gump was Jenny who was Forrest’s childhood friend. We have Kareena Kapoor as Maneela who will play somewhat Jenny’s character in LCS.❤️❤️

If the Indian audience digests the concept of this movie, it can be a commercial hit too because I am sure if they make it like Forrest Gump, it will be critically acclaimed very positive.😌😌🕊
