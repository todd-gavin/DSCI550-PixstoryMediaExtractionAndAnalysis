We may be young or old,
Regardless, we must be bold,
Against the enemy previously untold.

We canâ€™t go to malls,
Nor can we go visit the waterfalls,
Because this virus is a-scaring,
Sending our spines into a shivering.

If you have to go out, think twice,
Wear your mask, and be wise.
After coming home, properly sanitise,
And wash your hands at least twice.

COVID-19 is the name,
It is playing a hide-and-seek game.
By following the rules,
We can ensure endgame.
