The iconic logo of Chandigarh Press Club has got everything associated with journalist. Apart from each of the three alphabets of the club's name's abbreviation (CPC), the logo has got coffee mug, wine glass, ear, eye, head and pen. 

"Adding so many elements in one logo was a challenging task," says 73-year-old Manjit Singh, who designed the logo of the club in 1986. 

He got retired from Press Trust of India as a senior photojournalist in 2009.

"I did a five-year diploma in applied arts from Chandigarh College of Arts in 1980. I joined PTI in the technical department and later shifted to the photo division. Even while I was studying in the arts college, I knew some of the journalists, so when I became a member of the Club they told me to design a logo for the club,” recalls Manjit, who had covered many events of national & international prominence.  

“Then secretary general of the club Sushil Bali, who was also then heading the PTI Chandigarh, told me that the logo should have everything associated with journalist, pen to coffee mug & the club's name's abbreviation."

"It took me about a month, scribbling designs on hundreds of sheets. Finally, I came up with three designs. When I showed it to them, they left the final decision on me to select one," says Manjit. “I selected the present logo, as it has got alphabets CPC representing Chandigarh Press Club. The upper part of 'P' is also a handle of the coffee mug & also looks like an ear. Pen is drawn in such a way that there is a wine glass between the nose cone of the fountain pen. There are two circles on either sides of the nose cone (nib) and the inside part of circles are drawn in such a way that it depicts the journalist's eyes looking for a story. The inside circle also represents ‘C’, making it CPC,” adds Manjit, during the Foundation Day event of the club on July 15.

“I still have the original copy of the logo designed by me. It's a prize possession of the media fraternity of the region.”
