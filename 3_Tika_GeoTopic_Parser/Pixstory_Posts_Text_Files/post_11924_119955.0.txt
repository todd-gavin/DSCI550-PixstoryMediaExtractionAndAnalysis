Every person experiences their period differently. Though some would agree that it's not the most enjoyable time of the month, there are ways to help ease period cramping and discomfort.


The following poses are intended for use as a restorative home practice and may help relieve menstrual cramps. Choosing to do yoga may or may not feel good to you during different points in your menstrual cycle. Be sure to listen to your body and only opt to practice when it feels best for you.

1 Cobbler's Pose (Baddha Konasana)

Since the lower half of the body may feel heavy during menstruation, seated poses can be especially helpful. You may stay in each pose for several minutes. The Cobbler's Pose, opens up the pelvic region. For a gentler version, come into a forward bend using a bolster or several folded blankets to support your torso. This may help you relax even more.

2 Head to Knee Pose (Janu Sirsasana)

To do the pose:

1 Extend your right leg and place the bottom of your left foot on your right inner thigh.
2 Center your torso over the right leg and fold forward.
3 Come back through the Cobbler's Pose to set up for the other side.

The Head to Knee Pose, stretches the hamstrings. It's a simple stretch that allows you to focus on one leg at a time. It also helps you gently lengthen your hips and groin.

3 Seated Straddle (Upavistha Konasana)

Open both your legs wide into Upavistha Konasana, the Seated Straddle. If you'd like, you can do a more supported forward fold by adding a bolster or blankets. This pose stretches the hamstrings and inner thighs while also lengthening the spine. 

4 Seated Forward Bend (Paschimottanasana)

To do the pose:
1 Bring both legs outstretched for a forward bend.
2 Lengthen the spine in a seated position before coming forward. Imagine the pelvis as a bowl that is tipping forward as you come down.
