It is German for Counter-Pressing. In essence, it is to win the ball back immediately after losing it in areas high up the pitch and in the opposition half. 
Jurgen Klopp stated -"Gegenpressing lets you win back the ball nearer to the goal. It's only one pass away from a really good opportunity. No playmaker in the world can be as good as a good gegenpressing situation, and that's why it's so important. "
Coming from the man who led Liverpool FC to its fame and glory, it's safe to say that Gegenpressing is an extremely difficult play, only those skilled and volatile enough to convert the play into a goal.
