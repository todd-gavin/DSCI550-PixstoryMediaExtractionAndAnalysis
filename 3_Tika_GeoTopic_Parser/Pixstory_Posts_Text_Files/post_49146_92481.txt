Marriage is defined as the union of a man and a woman and changing that definition would be against natural law jeopardizing both the institution of marriage and the family s role in society s stability Marriage s primary role as a step toward procreation is denied by legalization For LGBT people civil partnerships are an option but marriage is a step too far Many people s religious beliefs are firmly opposed to gay marriage Legalizing it would betray widely held convictions and diminish the important role religion plays in society as a moral cornerstone Leaders from the Christian Jewish and Islamic faiths have all spoken out against gay marriage claiming that it violates sacred texts In this situation talking about equal rights makes no sense Polygamous or incestuous marriages would have to be legalised as well if this were the case Rights are always subject to limitations Legalization would be another step toward intolerance becoming more mainstream in society Nobody is preventing homosexual individuals from loving and remaining in relationships but this does not mean they can marry Considering LGBT community advocates for modernization and against conservatism from a liberal approach marriage is an outmoded oppressive institution that should have been weakened not expanded LGBT activist collective Against Equality stated Gay marriage apes hetero privilege and increases economic inequality by perpetuating a system which deems married beings more worthy of the basics like health care and economic rights It is not to say gay people do not deserve rights but to change everything in favour of a new trend would be going a little too far Why do they need marriage anyway
