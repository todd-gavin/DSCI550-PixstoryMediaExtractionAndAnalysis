I just finished watching a much anticipated movie of Adam Sandler and this time he brings up another blockbuster on Netflix and the name of the movie is Hustle After watching Hustle one thing I want to say is that Hustle is made for the people who love basketball Hustle is made by the people who love basketball and Hustle is made for those people who love the underdog story and seek inspiration Hustle is the story about Stanley played by Adam Sandler who is an NBA scout and works for the Philadelphia ers who is still seeking validation and wants to work as an assistant coach When Stanley goes to Spain to scout a young lad for team ers there he met Bo Cruz played by Juancho Hernangomez who played basketball for fun without even knowing how good he is and one night when Stanley noticed him playing he went on to talk to him and asked him to come with him to Philadelphia to become the star of NBA But the movie without conflicts feels incomplete and in Hustle both Stanley and Bo have some conflicts in their personal life and they have to overcome that if they want to succeed in their life Will Bo become the next NBA star or will go back to his home country On the hand will Stanley become an assistant coach or his job as a scout come under scrutiny To know all the answers you have to watch this movie and I strongly recommend you all to watch Hustle because Hustle is all about the journey and not the destination
