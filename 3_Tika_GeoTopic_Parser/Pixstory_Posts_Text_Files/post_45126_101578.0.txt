Bukayo Saka is hesitant to sign a new contract with Arsenal unless it includes a release clause.

The 20-year-old has had another fantastic season in north London, and the Gunners are keen
to sign him to a new long-term contract.

Saka's current contract has a year left on it, with the option to extend it for another year. Formal
talks with his representatives are set to take place at the end of the season, and while the
England international is pleased at the club, he is anxious to test himself in the Champions
League.

According to the Mail, Saka will be 'hesitant to commit himself without an exit strategy' while
negotiating a new contract. While release clauses are uncommon in English football, Arsenal
may find themselves under pressure to incorporate one and may be forced to do so in this case.

Arsenal was on the verge of returning to the Champions League, but back-to-back losses to
Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United have given Spurs the upper hand moving into the last
day of the season.

Arsenal will need to win all three points against Everton if their arch-rivals lose to Norwich on the
last day of the season on Sunday. Saka has played 42 games in all competitions this season
after scarcely taking a rest following England's journey to the Euro 2020 final last summer.

With Arsenal's return to European competition bringing a harder schedule next season, Arteta
wants the kid to have a longer vacation over the summer and plans to speak with Gareth Southgate about his international involvement.

‘He needs a break, that is for sure,” Arteta said.

‘He has played a lot of minutes this season and
he played a lot of minutes last season.

‘You expect your important players to do so, to have that ability and show the quality that Bukayo has shown consistently throughout the season.’
