Cognitive performance and clinical factors based on an adulthood-lifespan perspective


Abstract Background

The evolution of cognitive performance throughout the lifespan in bipolar disorder (BD) is understudied. This cross-sectional study aims to describe the cognitive performance across age groups.

Methods

A sample of 654 participants was recruited for this study (BD = 432 and healthy controls -HC- =222). Three subgroups, divided according to age range (18 to 35, 36 to 49, and ≥50 years old) were analyzed after administering a comprehensive neuropsychological battery including six cognitive domains. Demographic, clinical, and psychosocial functioning data were also analyzed. Generalized linear models (GLM) with age, diagnostic group, and age × group as main effects were carried out to examine their potential association on cognitive domains. Subsequently, a GLM in the BD sample was conducted to analyze interactions of several clinical variables by age on each cognitive domain.

Results

Main effects of diagnostic group and age were found in all cognitive domains. Significant group × age effect interaction was found for attention domain (p = 0.02) demonstrating a worse cognitive evolution across age in BD, driven by older age, but not in HC. Significant interaction effects of higher number of manic episodes and older age were also found in attention and verbal memory. Older age was also associated with a longer duration of illness, higher number of episodes, more somatic comorbidities, and poorer psychosocial functioning.

Conclusions

These results suggest that older age was associated with a selective cognitive decline in BD in the attentional domain. These findings highlight the importance of developing interventions targeting cognitive dysfunction throughout the BD adulthood lifespan.
