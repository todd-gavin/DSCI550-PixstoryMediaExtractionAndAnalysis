Lisa looked gorgeous as always.

Following the two members Jisoo and Jennie, Lisa was present at the airport to go to Paris to do her own schedule. The images of the female idol here surprised fans. The youngest BLACKPINK member still maintained her good sense of fashion, but it was her hair that occupied the most spotlight. At noon on March 12, Lisa appeared at the airport and attracted all the attention. The youngest member of BLACKPINK wore a simple outfit that made her look like a CEO. The combination of a blazer, black pants and a white shirt looked elegant and chic accompanied by a trendy handbag.

Lisa's airport fashion style has never failed to stand out. However, what fans noticed the most was the female idol's hair. The Thai-born beauty seemed to have dyed her hair blonde, which was even brighter than her past hair color. Is this her intention to make a big shot when doing in an international individual schedule?
Dressed in a somewhat elegant and CEO-like outfit, Lisa's expressions taken by the reporter's cameras were extremely lovely. Meeting fans at the airport, the youngest member of BLACKPINK constantly waved her fans goodbye. Not only that, she also made heart signs to show her affection and appreciation.
BLINKS were even more fluttered when Lisa showed her childishness and fooled around at the airport. Fans could see the happy look of the Thai idol ahead of this trip.
