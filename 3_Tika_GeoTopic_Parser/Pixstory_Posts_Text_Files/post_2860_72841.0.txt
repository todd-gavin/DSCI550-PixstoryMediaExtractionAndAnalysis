It's official. Indonesia will spend billions to move its capital from Jakarta in Java to Nusantara in the province of East Kalimantan. Nusantara translates as "archipelago." Indonesia itself is an archipelago comprising as many as 17,000 islands.

The plan has been in the works since 2019, when President Joko Widodo announced it for the first time. But the pandemic meant that the country had more pressing issues to attend. With a bill being passed in the Parliament, the new capital could come to fruition in 2024. The entire project costs $32billion. The new city will cover about 56,180 hectares (216 square miles) and rise from the vast jungle with government offices and homes for about 1.5 million civil servants.

Why the shift?

Because Jakarta is sinking. For years, the city has been growing in population, leading to huge pollution and many other environmental problems. For instance, it is one of the fastest sinking cities globally due to the over-extraction of groundwater.

Indonesia is Southeast Asia's most populous country and has the world's largest Muslim population. With experts saying that the third of Jakarta could be underwater by 2050, the region's largest economy had to take some immediate steps to save Jakarta. While many have welcomed the move, some say that the project could threaten the virgin forests of Borneo, which are home to several endangered species.

The Indonesian government has said that the new capital has been chosen keeping things like its strategic location (middle of Indonesian territory), closer to "global trade routes, investment flows, and technological innovation."

How the government will generate funds for the new capital is unclear. But the government has said that it would lay out the budget once the plan is cleared. Now that the Parliament has passed the law,  the government may also lay out the financial roadmap.
