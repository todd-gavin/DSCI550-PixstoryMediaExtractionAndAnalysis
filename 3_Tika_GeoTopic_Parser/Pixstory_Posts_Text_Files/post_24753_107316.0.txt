England were beaten by Hungary 4-0, heaviest home defeat since Scotland beat them 5-1 in 1928. The Nations League turned out to be a total disaster for England. 


What a night for Hungarian football. After six decades, they won on England soil, and that became an emphatic one. Gareth Southgate and the team will be under tremendous pressure, with a World cup due in months, and scoring just 1 goal in 4 matches. 2 draws and 2 losses, both by Hungary. Italy and Germany were the other teams in the group, now Hungary leading with 7 points. 

This was the last match before summer break, played at Wolverhampton. England had majority of the possession in the first half. But they couldn't turn it into a score. On the other hand, Hungary turned 4 out of 5 on target shots into goals. 


Sallai scored 2 goals, 1st from a free kick(16' min), then a superb finish with outside of the foot(70') through the legs of Ramsdale. Soon, Kane's header bounced off the crossbar. Foden, Mount, Sterling came in as second half substitutes to save England, but more agony was waiting for them. Martin Adam set up a shooting chance for Nagy(80'), whose thumping shot beat Ramsdale at first post. Soon, John Stones(82') was shown a second yellow card and marching order, which forced Southgate to withdraw Sterling to send Harry Maguire in. Substitute DÃ¡niel Gazdag finished the score with another brilliant finish in the 89th minute as the last nail on the English coffin. 

Now, England are on the verge of relegation to League B.
