Oh you get me I love gator humor just as much Here s a meme I really like too It s not humor per se but it s cute According to studies crocodiles and their relatives are highly intelligent creatures capable of sophisticated behaviour like complex communication advanced parental care and the use of equipment for hunting Research demonstrates how advanced their hunting methods can be Crocodiles play a significant part in maintaining the environment As adults they control the numbers of other species preventing overcrowding and the degradation of habitats By digging and creating nests crocodiles also provide habitat for other species of animals Now the crocodile is a carnivore You can t go near one such animal and expect coming back happy and jolly Not to mention humans have endangered crocodiles for their own insignificant benefits and greeds For example a croc skin is not made for your handbag it s made for the same reason human skin is made
