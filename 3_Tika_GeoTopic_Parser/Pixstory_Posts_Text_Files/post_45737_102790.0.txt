Boeing's CST-100 Starliner spacecraft landed at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico at 6:49 p.m. on Wednesday, May 25, completing the uncrewed Orbital Flight Test-2 as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. 

NASA reported that following a parachute-assisted landing, the Starliner settled gently onto its air bags, paving the way for future crewed landings. 

A deorbit burn at 6:05 p.m., separation of the spacecraft's service module, and successful deployment of the spacecraft's three main parachutes and six airbags preceded the landing. 

At 6:54 p.m. on Thursday, May 19, Starliner launched from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on a flight test to the International Space Station on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. 

The uncrewed spacecraft successfully docked to the space stationâ€™s Harmony module at 8:28 p.m. Friday, May 20.
