Cobra Ali first encountered UNICEF blue-collar staff distributing school supplies; At the same time, he envisioned his future in his mind
His family fled Afghanistan to Pakistan at the age of two, and arrived in Australia when he was nine.

Cobra, who has been serving in the Australian Army for almost 20 years now, will soon be wearing a blue shirt as the young UNICEF Ambassador to South Australia.
"UNICEF has always been 'Australians' or 'foreigners' coming to our aid," he said. "But as I got older, I realized where they came from."
He says he has now achieved his dream and has an "extraordinary feeling."

Cobra joined the Australian Army in 2016 as a soldier.

He most recently served as a translator in Operation Quid 19 and assisted members of the Afghan community who were evacuated from Afghanistan in the second half of last year to learn about Quid 19 regulations.

Ali became known as the first Afghan woman to join the Australian Army after being featured in Australian Women's Weekly and on SBS.

Young UNICEF Australia Ambassadors meet with children, learn about their needs, and then raise these issues with key Australian leaders in Canberra.

The program began in November 2021 and face-to-face training will begin in February.

The United Nations Children's Fund, commonly known as UNICEF, is an organization established to provide emergency food and health care to children in countries devastated by World War II.

It was established on December 11, 1946, on the recommendation of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations and with the approval of the General Assembly of the United Nations.
