I stand alone on the sandy beach my tears flowing into the sea because I know you re out of reach and no longer here with me You looked so handsome laying there In eternal sleep forever The pain I hide is too much to bare I want us to be together But I am needed on this lonely land for a little longer at least to help and guide the people I love giving them reassurance and peace so I ll be on the shoreline here to cry more tears over you On your birthday every year to celebrate our love so true Until it s time to meet once more to hold and love one another as we did all those years ago when I was your friend and lover
