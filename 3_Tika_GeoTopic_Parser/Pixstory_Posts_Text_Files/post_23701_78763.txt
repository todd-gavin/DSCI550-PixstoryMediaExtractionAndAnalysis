The Sun temple is situated in the small town of Konark situated in the Puri district of Odisha This marvel of architecture is dedicated to Indian God of Sun Surya The temple has been built in the shape of his chariot which is drawn by seven horses The temple was built in the th century by a king called Narasimhadeva There is an ancient legend attached to this temple once Lord Krishna cursed one of his own sons with leprosy To seek penance his son Samba worshiped Surya for twelve years Pleased with his devotion Surya healed him Samba made the Sun temple in return to express his gratitude The mesmerizing beauty of the place was best summed up by Rabindranath Tagore Here the language of stone surpasses the language of man templesofindia gloriouspast
