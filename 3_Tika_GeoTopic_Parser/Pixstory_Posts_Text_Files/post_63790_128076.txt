Hailing from France Upior is Polish for Revenant Formed in Upior is one of the latest metal bands to have come out and The Forest That Grieves is their full length debut Well the music in itself is awesome Upior s music is brilliantly crafted with an astute sense of perception as to the sound that the band is aiming for A new take on symphonic death metal there is quite a bit of influence from other death metal bands such as Origin Death and Pestilence as the instrumentation does tilt towards a technical progressive approach In some ways this album can be considered a mixture between Septicflesh Pestilence Rotting Christ and Moonspell The album carries a strong theatrical approach with the vocals and instruments being incredibly massive from the angle of both production and composition The keyboards add a fairy tale effect to the awesome Death metal riffing as they stand out alongside the technical work of the drums and the guitars The guttural heavy growls further add a sort of demonic presence to the whole thing The music takes a strong turn with the drums that go both on the classic blast beat route combined with a mixture of jazz technicality with a guitar playing that really catches you off guard but certainly sounds awesome mixing heavy melancholic demonic riffing with some melodic undertones There is not a single bad song here though every song does have a similar sound to it some songs go a bit more on the technical route such as the title track Dagon Sleeps Neural Decay and Haunting Memories Reality MMXX and Maruta are good tracks but a bit lacking against others Then of course there is the epic min finisher The Mountain Of Madness the best song here The Forest That Grieves seems like a dark musical designed like one complete song with creative pieces of music carrying a hint of classical merged together with death metal The keyboards combined with the drums guitars give the music a sense of harshness in the music while the vocals add a sense of horrid chaos to it Score
