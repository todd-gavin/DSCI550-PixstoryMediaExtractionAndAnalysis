Short answer, they aren't.

Instead, se gommage gels that don't contain particles and exfoliate using gentle enzymes. Use a natural lactic acid exfoliant every day because it is the least irritating AHA.

Our skin tends to have a thinner texture as we age. Climate, sun exposure, medications, and so on are additional influences. Typically, I advise my readers to exfoliate no more frequently than twice or three times per week. Face scrubs and brushes prevent the buildup of dead skin cells, sure, but there are many non damaging ways to do it. But if you still wanna do it, it's best to apply light pressure when using these face scrubs. Absolutely never use an apricot or walnut scrub that has crushed nut shells in it. These may cause microscopic skin tears! The best scrubs have jojoba beads or something similar. Your goal is to prevent redness, irritation, and dryness is moderation.
