The second stage of the Tour de France held in Denmark and characterized by the passage over the long Storebaelt bridge was full of emotions and twists Dutch Fabio Jakobsen won in the sprint who fell in the Tour of Poland two years ago risking dying mocked Wout Van Aert For the Belgian the second place of honor in two days but at least he can console himself with the conquest of the yellow jersey thanks to the bonus seconds that allow him to overtake the former leader Lampaert The progress of the stage was anything but linear with a first crash that involved Rigoberto Uran among the men in the standings and a second that instead saw the yellow jersey and the big favorite Tadej Pogacar crash just as they were crossing the Storebaelt bridge The feared wind that could break up the group remains against it and not laterally, preventing the formation of fans and so the cyclists arrive compact in the last kilometers Here another crash occurs which again involves Pogacar and also Filippo Ganna but being already inside the last km the times are neutralized The survivors play for the victory of the day with Jakobsen who takes a big risk shouldering with Peter Sagan and making a comeback mocking Van Aert and Pedersen Tomorrow third and final stage in Denmark Monday first day of rest and transfer to France
