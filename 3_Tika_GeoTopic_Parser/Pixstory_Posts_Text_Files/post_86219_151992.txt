Why If there is something I have learnt from my experiences so far it is the very fact that life is a rollercoaster When I was younger I had a fairy tale image of life with And they lived happily ever after ending However as I grew the harsh reality hit me Things didn t go as planned and I was overwhelmed with emotions I approached the situation with a pessimistic attitude and thought Why did it happen to me However I noticed a pattern While I lost something I gained something else subconsciously in the process That s when I realised that there is no right answer to that question It is a part of learning That is more valuable Now I replace pessimism with optimism and ask myself Why did this happen to me
