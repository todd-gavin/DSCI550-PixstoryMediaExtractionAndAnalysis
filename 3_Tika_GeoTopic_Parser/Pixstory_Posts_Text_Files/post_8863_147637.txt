In Retirement continues I was happy to read all your articles on Kashmir in The Hindu I think you have rendered a service to the country by the publication of the very useful information in connection with the events which led to the accession of Kashmir to the public I am sure many things which were said before the Security Council in in connection with the Kashmir question and even some things which were recently put before the Security Council would have been differently framed if the information now revealed had been in possession of the spokesmen In the year I wrote an article on the food situation in India This article was published in a number of newspapers all over India and I received an approval of the views mentioned therein particularly from Rajaji and several other friends During the year I attended most of the meetings of the University of the Punjab at Chandigarh and Jullundur I had been elected Dean of the Faculty of Commerce and later on of the Faculty of Law In the year I was asked to become vice chancellor of the University of Banaras on the resignation of Sir C P Ramaswami Aiyar I had no desire to end my days in the holy city of Banaras and thankfully declined to take over this work Later on I was asked by the President of India to be a member of Banaras Hindu University Enquiry Committee Coming from the President as it did I could not refuse the invitation The report of the committee aroused considerable criticism at the hands of a number of members of Parliament Eventually a law was made as suggested by us though with modification which took away the edge of some of our recommendations I am still busy with my work of rehabilitating the D A V institutions and also take interest in the affairs of the Punjab University Apart from these my interest mainly rests in agriculture and gardening I have tried to do my best to increase the production of food and fruit in the Punjab
