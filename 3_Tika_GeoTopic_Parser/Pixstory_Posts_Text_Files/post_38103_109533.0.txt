Paul Pogba is set to return to Juventus this summer. As per Italian journalist and transfer specialist Fabrizio Romano, the Serie A giants are set to complete a free and permanent transfer for the French superstar.

Pogba is certainly no stranger to Juventus! The Frenchman is a four-time Serie A and two-time Coppa Italia winner. To add to this, he also helped Juventus to the UEFA Champions League final in 2015. However, the Old Lady lost to Barcelona on the night. 

The midfielder has made 178 appearances for Juventus in his previous four-year stint between 2012 and 2016. During this time, Pogba had also scored 34 goals for the club. 

Paris Saint Germain were also reportedly interested to sign the star midfielder. But the former Manchester United player chose to sign for the Serie A club instead. Manchester City were also in talks to sign the Frenchman at a point of time. 

Paul Pogba will reportedly travel to Turin in July to complete his medical with Juventus before signing his official contract with the Serie A club. The Frenchman leaves Manchester United after scoring  40 goals in 226 appearances for the Premier League club since joining them for a â‚¬100m transfer fee in 2016.
