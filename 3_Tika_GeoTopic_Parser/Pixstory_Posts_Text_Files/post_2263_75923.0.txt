Kunwar Ratanjit Pratap Narain Singh, better known as R PN Singh on Tuesday resigned from the Congress and is set to join the BJP. 

Singh, 58, is a former union minister and also Congress party's in-charge for Jharkhand. 

A former Lok Sabha member from Kushinagar, Singh served as a union minister of state for home in the second term of the UPA government. 

His father, Late Kunwar CPN Singh, was also a Lok Sabha member from Kushinagar (then Hata) and a Minister of State for Defence in the Indira Gandhi cabinet in 1980.

He tweeted his resignation letter addressed to Congress President Sonia Gandhi.

"Today, at a time, we are celebrating the formation of our great Republic, I begin a new chapter in my political journey. Jai Hind," Singh wrote, sharing his letter on Twitter. 

Earlier Singh changed his Twitter bio and dropped "Congress" from his handle. "My motto India, First, Always," read his new bio, which earlier said AICC (All India Congress Committee) in-charge.

Singh's move came months after another former union minister and Congress party's West Bengal in-charge Jitin Prasad quit the grand old party and joined the BJP. 

Both of them were also members of the all powerful Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party's highest decision-making body. 

Prasada later became a minister in the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh. 

Prior to Prasada, another former union minister and Congress general secretary Jyotiraditya Scindia left the party to join the BJP. 

He was instrumental in bringing down the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh. 

Scindia is now union aviation minister in the Narendra Modi government.
