India’s first youth Olympian now the commonwealth gold medalist Jeremy Lalrinnunga  started his journey in weightlifting at the tender age of 6.

 His father helped him to explore weightlifting and helped him emerge as a professional weightlifter. While Jeremy’s father encouraged his 5 sons to become boxers, destiny had something else written for little Jeremy.


Jerry Lalrinnunga was born on 26 October 2002 in Aizawl, Mizoram, India. His father, Lalneihtluanga, is a former boxer. In the 1990s, Jeremy’s father was a national junior boxing champion who had 6 years winning streak.

Everyone expected Lalneihtluanga to become a great boxer, who will make India proud one day. Unfortunately, he failed to make an excellent impact on the world stage. But he encouraged his sons to pursue their careers as boxers. But Jeremy chose a different way for himself.

After two years of hard work, Jeremy and his father went for his admission trials at the Army Institute of Sports (AIS) in Pune. His father never opposed Jeremy’s decision to become a weightlifter and supported him at every stage of his career.

Jeremy’s coach, Malsawma Khiangte, suggested he join the Army Sports Institute trials in 2011. After looking at his performance at the World Youth Championships, where he earned a silver medal, they found Jeremy a strong competitor. Jeremy’s achievements also include silver medals which he earned at the 2017 Worlds & Asian Championships 2018 in the 56 kg weight event.
