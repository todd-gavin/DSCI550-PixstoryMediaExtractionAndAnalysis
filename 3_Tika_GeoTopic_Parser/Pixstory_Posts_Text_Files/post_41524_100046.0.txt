The biggest rugby competition in the world is finally coming to America. America is adding another feather to its cap and entering a new phase!

Now comes the difficult part for rugby's leaders: generating enough enthusiasm and long-term viability to secure the sport's place in a saturated American market. 

As reported by NBCNewYork, after been chosen as the host of the men's tournament in 2031 and the women's tournament two years later, the United States will host the Rugby World Cup for the first time. 

It's rugby's first attempt to break into the wider American sporting consciousness and tap into what World Rugby, the sport's worldwide governing body, sees as an untapped commercial and sporting potential.

“The golden nugget that everybody wants to get hold of” was how World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont described America.

“What we will leave in the U.S.,” he said, “is an extremely sustainable, vibrant sport that will go from strength to strength.”
