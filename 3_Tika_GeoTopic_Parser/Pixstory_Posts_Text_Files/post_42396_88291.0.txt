If you have a little bit of knowledge of films, then you will understand the whole movie when you will see the first frame of the movie. 

“Deep Water” starts with a shot of two bridges that are parallel and two parallels never connect and the stories of the two characters of the movie are also the same, they never were on the same page in the whole movie and they never connect. 

The movie is about Allen and Melinda (played by Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas) and their dismantled love life. Where Allen loves her wife immensely and on the other hand Melinda is flirting and having a relationship with five guys in different stages of the movie, even Allen knows everything but he’s not taking action. 

But in the latter part of the movie we got to know that Allen is not so innocent and there are some shady things he’s up to that are affecting his wife. 
The movie’s first half took too much time to develop the second act that become boring at some time but the second half is a bit gripping and the climax of the movie is not out of the box but it was fresh. 

Will Allen get rid of those boys or Melinda will give them another chance in their relationship again? To get all the answers you have to watch the movie because I am not here to give spoilers. 

Characters never got enough depth and I was unable to connect emotionally with them and the actions taken by them. 

“Deep Water” is 1 hour 57 minutes long and you can stream it on Amazon Prime Video and Hulu but I recommend you watch the movie ‘Gone Girl (available on Amazon Prime Video) which is a better romantic thriller than this and you WILL enjoy it.
