 The suspension that was slapped on All India Football Federation AIFF in the midnight of August has finally been lifted There is a sense of jubilation and of course relief in Indian football fraternity In the next couple of months several Indian age group teams both in men s and women s sections were supposed to travel for different Asian tournaments they are now back in the fray Yet Indian football had to pay a price for the day ban the Gokulam Kerala FC girls flew all the way to Uzbekistan to play the AFC Cup but had to return home without playing a match when the suspension was announced The Indian girls could have been dealt with differently by FIFA They could have made some arrangements for Gokulam to play since the team had already arrived In FIFA banned Iraq football for the second time in two years after the Iraq Olympic Committee decided to disband the football federation FIFA labelled it as a third party interference and banned Iraq But they made an exception for Iraq by allowing their female players to participate in a football festival in Jordan immediately after the ban A similar gesture towards India would have helped Gokulam girls immensely But then FIFA is never famous for maintaining a level of consistency in such matters In fact from the political point of view the governing body of world football could be described as truly inconsistent While FIFA suspended Russia in February for its aggression on Ukraine there were several instances when they turned a blind eye towards similar anti human stances taken by governments in other countries FIFA did nothing when Argentinian junta detained and executed thousands in their own country and still hosted the World Cup Nigeria were allowed to play the World Cup qualifiers despite their government s atrocities against common people FIFA of course can say it rarely punish a country for political reasons However after the Russia suspension FIFA won t exactly be in a position to ignore such things
