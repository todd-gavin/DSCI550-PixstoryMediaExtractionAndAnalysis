Every year, married Hindu women keep fast for their husbands for their long life and welfare known as Karwa Chauth. This festival is celebrated majorly in the Northern part of the country. 
To celebrate the festival of Karwa Chauth, the women do 'Nirjala fast' in which they don’t eat or drink water, not even a single drop of water throughout the day, till moonrise.
According to beliefs, the origin of Karwa Chauth can be traced back to Mahabharata. A belief say, when Arjuna went to the Nilgiris to pray and meditate for a few days, worried about his safety, Draupadi sought her brother Krishna’s help. He advised her to observe a strict fast just like Goddess Parvati did for her husband Shiva’s safety. Draupadi adhered to it, and soon Arjuna returned home safely. That’s when the ritual of Karwa Chauth started.
Rituals of Karwa Chauth start with women waking up early in the morning, taking bath, and having their Sargi before sunrise. Sargi is a thali (a plate) presented to the daughter-in-law by their mother-in-law which consists of eatables like sweets, dry fruits, coconut, and gifts like saris.
It is believed the Sargi ritual strengthens the bond between a mother-in-law with her daughter-in-law.
In the evening the women dress their best, like a new bride, wearing traditional clothes, bindi, makeup, jewelry, and performing rituals singing the Karwa Chauth Katha.
Once there is a moonrise, the women break their fast by looking at the moon and their husbands through a sieve. There are offerings given to the moon and the women break their fast by sipping water and having food from their husband’s hands. 
It is believed the festival of Karwa Chauth is just not about fasting, its essence lies in it deepens the relationship between husband and wife, and also enhances romance between them.
