 continued I had a very medically invasive procedure where I was supposed to get a catheter and it was really painful despite local anesthesia So basically the doctor was puncturing the catheter in and I was in extreme pain and there was this one nurse who just held my hand and she stroked my hair because she knew the kind of pain I was in Within that moment I wished my mother or someone else was here to give me that support And I immediately looked at her and I just had tears in my eyes and forgot about the pain Later on after the pain subsided the nurse came to ask me what I wanted to eat I wasn t able to eat with the pain and there were very strict instructions restricting the food I could consume I asked for chole rice and this very beautiful nurse brought it for me As children we always believe that our mothers can cure us they just need to stroke our hands our heads hug us and we ll be fine I was really happy that day despite the pain and I did go back to the hospital once I became much better And I keep thinking that every Christmas I have to send a cake for this nurse
