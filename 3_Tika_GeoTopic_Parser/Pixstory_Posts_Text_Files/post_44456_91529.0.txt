Pep Guardiola's Manchester City reclaimed top spot in the England's elite club competition on Saturday. Burnley's evening started poorly and remained that way, in a game City dominated with panache and to good effect. In the process, City's second goal in the first half came as something of a record-breaker.


The 25th minute golazo was Ilkay Gundogan's 34th premier league goal. The German midfielder last scored in February, when City to Tottenham Hotspur in a thrilling encounter that ended 3-2 to the visitors. Generally too, Gündoğan is a midfielder who gets involved in the final third. His time at Borusssia Dortmund was indicative of the same. 


Then BVB coach Jürgen Klopp has in the past expressed his affection for Ilkay, a player who's risen to be a prominent presence for club and Country. Mesut Özil previously held the same record, having scored 33 times in a span of 8 years in England (the final few of which were highly inconsistent). 


Gündoğan meanwhile, achieved the same feat in a little under 6 years, which again goes to show his potency and the frequency with which he gets involved in the final third. Pep deploys the German midfielder in a very balanced #6 role, which sees him make the most of his all round abilities.


Even long before he'd added goals to his game, the 31 year-old's passing ability, ball control and defensive shielding were noticeably brilliant in the Bundesliga. Just last week, Ilkay Gundogan expressed his desire to extend his stay at the Etihad. With some luck, he'll be celebrating a half century of goals in Premier league football very soon.
