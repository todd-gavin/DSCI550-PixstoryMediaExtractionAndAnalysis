Recipes in the Italian Diet are full of fresh fish, lean meat, pulses, olive oil and a load of fruits and even tho it isn't for serious weight loss, it's a natural, feel-good diet that will become a way of life <3
Some of my recs for these foods are ;

Bruschetta
Caprese Salad
Chicken Cacciatore
Grilled Calamari
Mussels in White Wine
Pasta Fagioli Soup
Pasta Primavera
Polenta
Risotto
Shrimp Pomodoro

And the list goes on and on :))
