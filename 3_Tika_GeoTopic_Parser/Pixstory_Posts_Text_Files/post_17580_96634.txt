Russell Westbrook found himself under heavy scrutiny during his first year with the Los Angeles Lakers which ended without postseason basketball Doubts over Westbrook s fit with LeBron James and Anthony Davis appeared more and more justified as the season went on Also injuries to James and Davis prevented the superstar trio from improving chemistry between them The Lakers poor performance only added to the already high pressure that fell on Westbrook from the moment he signed with L A and returned to his native California But the year old guard said he didn t feel extra pressure upon his arrival adding he welcomes pressure because a lack of it makes him too relaxed at times Instead the California native enjoyed being close to his family A lot of times when I was in other places I didn t have all my family but I was really focused on you know locked in on different things and so there was no pressure extra added pressure from there Westbrook said during his exit interview However the NBA MVP said he didn t appreciate the reception he got from people here including Lakers fans I would probably say the only thing that was a problem or issue was with just the reception I got from people here and for any reason whatever that may be you know Westbrook said Whether it s the fans or whatever wasn t so great but you know that s not up to me to judge of any sort Just kinda came to work did my job and try to find ways to be able to make myself a better player as a season prolong
