In my opinion vegetarianism is definitely not better than veganism on a global level In fact I would say it s somehow worse than eating meat The dairy cows will be slaughtered or left to die once they can t produce any more milk which would be at years old They die and they don t even feed anyone Remember veganism is an ideology vegetarianism is a restrictive diet they wouldn t care about the byproduct of the dairy industry which is the animal Not to mention it s very exploitative For both people and animals Animals will go through sexual abuse being trapped being abused killed or what not On ethical grounds vegetarianism is just as bad if not worse than carnism It s a farce to make people believe they re helping the animals when they re only contributing to the industry that exploits them Concerning the human population the amount of grain water and land that would go to livestock will ultimately cost people food and housing it will further exploit indigenous land and add to deforestation Most AnAg driven deforestation happens because of dairy Not to mention the water wastage energy wastage and what not It s just exploiting the resources more and more Is veganism the perfect solution Absolutely not As long as capitalism exists the world s problems will too but it s much much better than both carnism and vegetarianism
