Nykaa Love Struck EDP in Skip A Beat

This perfume smells like a beautiful, musky bouquet of flowers sprayed with hints of watery dew. It has notes of rose, jasmine, green leaves, moss and grapefruit, making it really clean, like a mix of shampoo, air freshener, talc and soap. Ideal for those who like light, fresh fragrances, this is a great day-time scent and smells really uplifting. Not meant for those who like strong and sweet perfumes, this is definitely a green floral ideal for those with a sensitive nose. The longevity is not a lot, but lasts longer on oily or moisturised skin.
