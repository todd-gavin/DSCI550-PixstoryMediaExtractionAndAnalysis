A few days before the end of the Beijing Olympic Games, Swedish speed skater Nils van der Poel gave one of the two gold medals won in China to a Chinese girl Angela Gui, daughter of Gui Minhai, a bookseller arrested several times by the Chinese government with the accused of illegally providing documents abroad and currently in prison serving years Mine is a clear and declared protest against China&#39;s human rights abuses, said the Swedish skater in a statement published by Amnesty International and reported by the New York Times I am not the voice of all Olympians but my friends and I have dedicated our lives to striving for excellence within sport and the Chinese government has chosen to use our dreams as a political weapon to legitimize their regime I hope the issue human rights in China better and Gui Minhai freed much to ask but the only reasonable thing to ask The Olympics are a fantastic sporting event where the world and nations meet but hosting the Games is what Hitler did before he invaded Poland and what Russia did before invading Ukraine I think it is extremely irresponsible to give the Games to a country that violates human rights as clearly as the Chinese regime does The girl accepted the medal for her prisoner father who came to visit me in Cambridge yesterday where I accepted his medal on behalf of my father I think he would feel extremely honored if he knew the gesture Nils made
