French fries ?? - Ketchup ! 
Pizza , burger , pasta ?? - Ketchup !
Poha , chilla , alu paratha ?? - Ketchup ! 😍🥫
The list goes on !  Ketchup is something we all love and it goes with everything ! Are you a ketchup lover ?? you have ketchup with everything ? Or you just hate Ketchup ?? 🤔☹️
Love or hate doesn't matter ! The thing which matters is that we all are totally unaware about the hidden Calories in ketchup ! And these hidden Calories will make you gain weight . 
Are the hidden Calories in your favourite ketchup causing you to gain weight ?? 
If you are having a balanced meal but it's absolutely drowned in ketchup , the chances are that you are consuming hundreds of calories without really realising it . But is this red condiment good for you ?? 🤔
Two ingredients of concern in ketchup are salt and sugar . Per tablespoon , ketchup contains 4 grams pf sugar and 190 milligrams of sodium . Although 4 grams of sugar doesn't seen like a lot , much of it comes from added sugar , as opposed to the natural found in tomatoes . 🥫
The same goes for the added salt - Consuming 8 tablespoon of ketchup will have you reaching your sodium needs for the entire day , so if you like to pour on the red stuff , it's easy to overload on sodium . 
This not only causes weight gain but also bloating , rise on blood pressure , intense thirst , stroke amd other long term effects . If rarely eat it , it's ok ! But its not healthy to have it regularly and in excess . 
Tell me in notes , how many spoons of ketchup do you have with your meal ?? 🥫💭
