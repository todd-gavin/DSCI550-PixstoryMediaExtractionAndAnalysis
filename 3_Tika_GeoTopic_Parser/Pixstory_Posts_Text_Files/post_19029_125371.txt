On the eve of the championship for Inter there is only one title given in the press conference by Simone Inzaghi Inter have closed the transfer market I have agreed this team with the owners and the club We only need a replacement for Ranocchia and the club and at work for this So apart from a substitute for Ranocchia, the Nerazzurri will no longer buy or sell Skrniar inclusive Tomorrow Inter will be away against Lecce An important test to evaluate the condition after a certainly not cracking pre-season Only one win for Lugano two draws against Monaco and Lyon and as many defeats against Lens and Villarreal There is a great desire for this debut Inzaghi said in the press conference We have done a good job in preparation since July playing many matches many of which are demanding But it was what we wanted We intended to measure ourselves against teams ahead of us physically. Our fear was only that of losing a few players to injuries
