On June 20, International Refugee Day, Afghan refugees took to the streets in Surabaya and several other Indonesian cities to demand resettlement in an immigrant country.

These asylum seekers, who have been living in a state of "unhappiness" for ten years, have had a hard time during this time.

According to them, in the last ten years, about 15 young Afghan refugees in Indonesia have committed suicide and a number have committed suicide. "During these ten years, the precious lives of these young people have been lost, and today they are still on the streets to raise their voices so that the hearing can hear the voices of these asylum seekers."

Afghan refugees in Indonesia have been staging street protests against their plight for months. They say that during this period no institution, including the United Nations and the International Organization for Migration, has responded to them.
