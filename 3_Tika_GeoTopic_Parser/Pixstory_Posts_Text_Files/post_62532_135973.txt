In the event that you find yourself in a bear attack there are a few things that you should do to save yourself Get as far away from the animal as possible Bears are fast and agile and will pursue anything that they think is a threat If you can get at least yards away from the bear your chances of survival will be much higher Try not to get noticed by the bear in this If they see you running they will most likely chase you Fight back If you are attacked by a bear fight back with whatever you have available Hitting the bear in the face with anything will cause it to retreat and may even be enough to scare it off You may also be able to use your arms or legs to defend yourself if necessary Remain calm and keep your head down The best way to stay safe during a bear attack is to remain calm and keep your head down Resist the urge to scream or run these actions will only make things worse for you Many yourself look as big as you can Stay as still as possible until help arrives and don t turn your back on the animal either this could lead to another attack Now should you play dead during a bear attack If a black bear attacks you DO NOT PLAY DEAD I repeat do not play dead if a black bear attacks you Fight back with anything you have Sticks rocks bags Anything If a grizzly bear trying to protect her cubs however is the attacker PLAY DEAD Reason being grizzly bears usually attack when they feel threatened if you remove the threat they retreat Black bears however are predatory They are preying on you Playing dead will make it easier for them to make you their next meal
