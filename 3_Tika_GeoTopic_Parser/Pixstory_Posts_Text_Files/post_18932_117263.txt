Telling how Gianmarco Tamberi&#39;s World Athletics Championships went gold medal in Tokyo d in the complicated high jump If it&#39;s true that he only finished fourth, therefore off the podium which was the minimum goal, it&#39;s also true that he jumped a height he didn&#39;t think he&#39;d be able to reach given his non-optimal physical conditions However, his opponents were exceptional It was his friend Essa Barshim who won the gold medal, who had shared first place with him at the Olympics The Qatari athlete repeated the measure in Tokyo and imposed himself with earned him the third consecutive title The South Korean Sanghyeok Woo and the Ukrainian Protsenko also on the podium I can&#39;t complain about how I managed the race he said to Rai Tamberi microphones Today few would have bet on the fact that I would have jumped I wouldn&#39;t have done it either I spent a lot of energy to get into the final I can&#39;t say I&#39;m happy and I don&#39;t care much about the wooden medal but I can&#39;t complain because we arrived in a difficult condition I know I&#39;m fine physically apart from these pains I knew I could jump high but I feel pain in the run-up
