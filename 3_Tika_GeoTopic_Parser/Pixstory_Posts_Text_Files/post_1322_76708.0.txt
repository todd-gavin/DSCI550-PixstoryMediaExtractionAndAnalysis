Calling all F1 fans!
Who do you think is the better Red Bull Racing driver? 
It can be argued that during Sebastian Vettel’s time in RB, the team had a better car. But we have seen his level of racing as well. 
Yes, Max Verstappen also won the moment he was given a worthy car. But we also saw how he would lose composure every time he was in a situation where he needed to defend against Lewis Hamilton.

Let’s settle this. Who’s better?
