I personally cannot agree on uniforms. Children of today should learn to express themselves through their style and their choices and uniform restrict their choices. Uniform only promotes conformity over individuality. The adherence to uniforms mostly leaves out gender non-conforming students and hinders their choices. There is no evidence that school uniforms stopped bullying or violence nor does have anything to do with academics or exams. Even if uniforms are provided and they will be differently put by students and emphasise the socio-economic divisions they are supposed to eliminate. Uniforms may have a detrimental effect on studentsâ€™ self-image. The push for school uniforms is driven by commercial interests rather than educational ones, which may be a source of income for schools or teachers. School uniforms in public schools undermine the promise of free education by imposing an extra expense on families. We all know one pair wouldn't be necessary for students and they have to buy it rather than putting the dresses they already have.
