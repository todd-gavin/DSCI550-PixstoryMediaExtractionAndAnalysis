A man whipped out a knife after getting bumped by strangers inside a Manhattan subway station, slashing one of them during the sudden wild melee, startling video released by police Thursday shows.

The slasher was walking up the stairs to the A and C train platform inside the West 4th St.-Washington Square station in Greenwich Village when there was some sort of incidental contact with a group of three men about 8 p.m. Sunday, cops said.

An argument ensued, and the attacker, knife in hand, doubled back to lean over a railing at the top of the stairs and slashed at the three men, who were still ascending, surveillance video shows.

At the same time, one of the three men raised a beverage can, hesitated, then hurled it at the slasher. The can struck the assailant, liquid flying everywhere, the video shows.

The attacker, knife still visible, is seen gesturing angrily toward the group before getting on an uptown train.

The 28-year-old can hurler was treated at the scene by medics for a minor cut to his hand.

Cops are asking the publicâ€™s help identifying and tracking down the slasher.

Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS. All calls will be kept confidential.
