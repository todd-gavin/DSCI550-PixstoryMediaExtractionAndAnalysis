Bruce Willis has been trending on twitter.

After being diagnosed with aphasia, Bruce Willis' family revealed on Wednesday that the star is "stepping away" from performing. Aphasia is a communication disorder that makes it difficult to use words, according to WebMD. It can damage your capacity to understand language, as well as your ability to speak and write.

Willis' retirement was announced in a joint statement by the family on social media.

The statement read, “To Bruce’s amazing supporters, as a family we wanted to share that our beloved Bruce has been experiencing some health issues and has recently been diagnosed with aphasia, which is impacting his cognitive abilities. As a result of this and with much consideration Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him.”

It further read, “This is a really challenging time for our family and we are so appreciative of your continued love, compassion and support. We are moving through this as a strong family unit, and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you, as you do to him. As Bruce always says, “Live it up” and together we plan to do just that. Love, Emma, Demi, Rumer, Scout, Tallulah, Mabel, & Evelyn.”

Hoping the best for him and his family. <3
