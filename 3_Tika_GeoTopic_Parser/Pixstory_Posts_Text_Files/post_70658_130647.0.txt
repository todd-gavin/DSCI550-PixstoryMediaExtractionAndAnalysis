The chairman of Wipro, Rishad Premji, took a stance against tech professionals who perform both full-time jobs and side projects, tweeting that this practise is tantamount to cheating in the sector.

Premji took Twitter and wrote, â€œThere is a lot of chatter about people moonlighting in the tech industry. This is cheating - plain and simple. 

The remark may be in reference to Swiggy, a foodtech startup that recently came under fire for its Moonlight policy, which was widely condemned by online users.


Moonlighting refers to doing a second job in addition to a regular employment without the knowledge of your primary employer. If the boss discovers that one has been moonlighting, the action is immoral and could result in job loss.

Regular employees are allowed to take on side projects or work outside of the office after hours or on their days off according to Swiggy's Moonlight policy. It resembles working a second job in addition to your day one.


The requirement for employees is that the second employment cannot interfere with the regular job hours. Additionally, prior clearance is required for any initiatives or tasks that could potentially present a conflict of interest or interfere with an employee's job duties.

Such a policy was implemented at a time when Foodtech companies were under fire for maintaining a hostile work environment for delivery personnel and paying them less than they were entitled to. Additionally, employees are calling for greater flexibility in working hours as a result of a trend that originated in high paying jobs where hybrid cultures are desired over the antiquated work-from-office norm.
