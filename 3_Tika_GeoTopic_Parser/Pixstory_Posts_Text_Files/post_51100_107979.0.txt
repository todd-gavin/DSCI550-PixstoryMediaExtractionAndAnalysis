What happens when you don’t charge your cell phone? You turn down the screen brightness, try not to check your texts, and count down the moments until your phone shuts off altogether. People function similarly to cell phones in that they require energy to perform tasks. And just like your phone, when you’re not fully charged, you don’t perform as well.

What we mean by “recharging” can look differently depending on your life, but essentially it means self-care and rest. It’s not something you do just on vacation, either; you should be taking time out throughout every day to recharge.

5 Reasons Why You Need to Recharge on a Regular Basis:
Here’s proof that you should be taking time out of your day to rest and recharge:

1. It reduces stress-When you step away from the stress by meditating, taking a walk, or finding some other way to relax, you allow your positive traits to shine.

2. It increases creativity
On a typical day, you’ve got so many things on your mind that there isn’t space for your creativity to flourish. By resting and recharging, you allow your creativity a chance to take up space again.

3. You’ll feel better
The stress hormone cortisol makes you feel panicked and on edge, but when you relax, you’ll give your “feel-good” hormones a chance to be released. Your mood will feel elevated and you’ll be more prepared to take on the day.

4. It might help you live longer
Studies have shown stress is one of the top causes of death, so when you take the time to recharge and reduce your stress, you’re helping yourself physically. That could mean avoiding some fatal health issues.

5. It can strengthen your immune system
Relaxation helps your body repair itself and that means your immune system benefits from it.
