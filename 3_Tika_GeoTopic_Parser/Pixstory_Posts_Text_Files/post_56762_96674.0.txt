Mother Earth is clearly urging a call to action. Nature is suffering. Oceans filling with plastic and turning more acidic. Extreme heat, wildfires and floods, have affected millions of people. Even these days, we are still facing covid 19, a worldwide health pandemic linked to the health of our eco system.
Climate change, manmade changes to nature as well as crimes that disturpt bio diversity, such as deforestation, land use change, intensified agriculture are the cause of destruction of the planet.
Friends do save earth by using no plastic, having more tree planted, keeping our environment neat and clean.

Respect Mother Earth
Save Earth
