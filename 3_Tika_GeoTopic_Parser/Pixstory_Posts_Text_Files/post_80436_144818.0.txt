#5 Santi Cazorla
The Spanish Player of The Year in 2006/07, Santiago “Santi” Cazorla is a class act known for his impressive shooting skills and ambidextrous dribbling. The signing of the sensational central midfielder in 2012 for what now seems like an absolute bargain of £15 million can be considered as one of Wenger’s best.
Upon the conclusion of his first season in England, he was present in every Premier League game scoring 12 goals and 11 assists. After an underwhelming start to the 2014/15 season, Santi made a comeback with his compelling partnership with Francis Coquelin in the central midfield.
With 129 games, Cazorla won the hearts of fans and teammates alike.

#4 Robert Pires
One of the greatest midfielder in Arsenal’s arsenal, Pires was another great player to thrive under Arsene Wenger. He had a flattering run with the Gunners, scoring double figure goals in every season except the first, with a career best of 19 in the 2003/04 season. The season was his finest campaign due to his phenomenal partnership with Thierry Henry, Patrick vieira and Fredrick Ljungberg. Thanks also to the left-side triad of him, Henry and Ashley Cole, a combination that was unplayable at times with a whopping 57 goals between them in all competitions.
Pires made the PFA Team of the Year thrice and a sublime 2001/02 season also won him FWA Player of the Year. With a total of 284 appearances, Robert’s contribution to arsenal is one to remember.
 
#3 Fredrik Ljungberg
The prodigious Swedish winger Freddie, with his evasive style, was a menace to the rival defenders in the late 90’s and early 2000’s, smartly sneaking in a goal for the Gunners. He stole the show when on his very debut he scored points for the team against Manchester United, just minutes into the game. He scored many important goals for the club, managing a career best 17 in the 2001/02 “Double Hat” season. The Swede gave an astonishing performance in the 2003/04 season.
Having played 328 matches for the Gunners, it was a delight to watch the top dog in action.
