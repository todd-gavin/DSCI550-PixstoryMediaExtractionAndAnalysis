Just watched episode number four of Marvel’s web series “Moonknight” which is available on Disney+ Hotstar and I must say that it’s the best episode out of four and I can’t wait to see the final two episodes incoming weak because expectations are very high.

Before talking anything about the episode, one thing I want to say is that the actions of every character are Marvel-lous and a special shout-out to Oscar Isaac because he is not acting in the series, he is living the character of Marc and Steven and in every frame he is amazing.

Now talking about the episode number four,

When khonshu left Marc and Steven in episode number three, now Steven and Layla are on the quest to find Ammit, and on the other hand, Arthur is doing everything to find Ammit before Steven and Layla.

And on the quest to find admit, Heka Priest was the biggest barrier in front of Layla and Steven and when Layla thought that they got rid of Heka Priest, Heka priest caught Layla and somehow Harrow found Layla and told her the secret about Marc and how her father died.

On the other hand, Steven finally found the Ammit inside the ‘Mummy’ of Alexander the Great but he was caught by Harrow….

You have to watch the episode to know what happened next because if I write one more word then it will be a spoiler from my side.
