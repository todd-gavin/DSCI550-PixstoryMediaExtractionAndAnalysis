Girls are being judged by the dress they wore and following are the reasons in my view Objectification of the female body From ancient times females have been treated less like human beings and more like a collection of body parts existing solely to please heterosexual males Their body wasn t attributed to them but rather it was seen as something meant to pleasure males also a possible distraction The Female body is considered to be shameful Girls have been taught to be ashamed of their body from the moment they are born They are urged to hide it Girls as young as or are told to act a certain way cross your legs when you sit child It s not appropriate otherwise You barely start developing boobs and you have your mom urging you to wear a tight sports bra so that your chest appears flatter Dressing for attention A lot of people have this misconception that women dress up to get attention Which again might be true on certain occasions but not always We like dressing up for ourselves too
