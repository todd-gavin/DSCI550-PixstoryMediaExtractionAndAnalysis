Gareth Bale was reportedly offered to Atletico Madrid. But the La Liga side reportedly didn't have interest in signing the Welshman. Hence they have declined the said offer. 

The Real Madrid winger will go out of contract in the summer. Owing to this, his agent had reportedly offered the players' services to Real Madrid's rivals. However, As per Marca, the offer has since been declined. 

Gareth Bale has had a horrendous time at Real Madrid in the past couple of seasons. The 4x UEFA Champions League winner hardly featured for Los Blancos and is unlikely to have a part in the UCL finals against Liverpool as well. 

With rumours about a potential retirement also circling the Welshman, it is unlikely that he would retire at least for now. 

Wales are on the cusp of an appearance in the 2022 World Cup. Hence, it is unlikely that their captain Gareth Bale would announce his decision to retire before that. 

Wales are set to face off against either Scotland or Ukraine in the upcoming playoff in June to determine who would play in the World Cup. However, if Wales fails to qualify, it is not known in Bale would choose to retire from Professional football. 

Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle United, and a few La Liga clubs have been linked to his name. However, a decision is yet to be made regarding his future. It has to be seen where Gareth Bale decides to play next season.
