It’s been less than a month since Australia’s federal election, but there has been a tangible change in the national climate under the new Albanese government. The challenge now is to bottle it.

The news of the world may still be scary, but it feels like the new government is approaching these looming crises as problems to be confronted and resolved rather than opportunities to divide.

Part of this change in climate is the product of more humane policy: under an Albanese government performative cruelty has been jettisoned, allowing an exiled family to return to a community that embraced them. 

Whatever its source, this change in climate is palpable, a valuable resource for the incoming government – and the broader progressive movement in general – to mine, refine and use to power long-overdue reform in this country

In three short weeks the doubters have come on board, the naysayers have opened their minds and Albanese is governing with the goodwill of a strong majority of Australians.
