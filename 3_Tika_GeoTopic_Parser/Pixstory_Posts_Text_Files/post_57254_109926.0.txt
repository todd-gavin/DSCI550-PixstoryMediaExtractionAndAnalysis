Society tends to view depression with a different eye; besides the tremendous amount of awareness that has been created for understanding depression, there are still people in the society who don't get it.

They would ask you to chill or relax because they don't know the correct way to communicate and talk to someone dealing with depression.
Instead, by many, it is termed the idea of modernity, and it doesn't exist.
For such people, depression would seem like running away from the problems and being unable to mend things.

That is the reason they fail to understand the seriousness of the situation and even disparage it if someone decides to open up.

These people need to be made aware of mental health and how essential it becomes to not make fun of it!!
