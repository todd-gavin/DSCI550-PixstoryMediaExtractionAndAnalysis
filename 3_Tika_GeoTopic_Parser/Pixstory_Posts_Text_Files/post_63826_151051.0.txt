While not fully a console game, the Valkyrie Profile is in many ways synonymous with Playstation, as the acclaimed first two games of the series – Valkyrie Profile and Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria – appeared on the PS1 and PS2 respectively. Now, after a 16 year absence from consoles, the series is back with Valkyrie Elysium. The new action RPG features an evocative world inspired by Norse mythology, thrillingly fast-paced combat, great visuals, bombastic audio, and a dark, thought-provoking narrative. Developed by Soliel and Square Enix, Valkyrie Elysium is an action RPG where players assume the role of a Valkyrie tasked with finding and purifying lost souls. Played from a third-person perspective, players explore environments and battle enemy opponents including monsters, fellow Valkyries, and boss characters using a plethora of attacks ranging from melee combat (e.g., swords, spears) to elemental attacks (e.g., blasts of fire). Released on September 29, Valkyrie Elysium is available as a physical and digital Standard Edition on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, with a digital-only Standard Edition available on PC via STEAM which will release on November 11, 2022.
