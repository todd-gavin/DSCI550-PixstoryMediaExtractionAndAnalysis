 My father Sureshpe bought a television in to watch the World Cup football Earliest memories were that of Maradona dribbling through the opponents I am not sure was it the Maradona craze or the beautiful jersey that attracted me to the team Year after Year I prayed for my favorite team The consecutive passes in Oh i thought then this is it This is the year I was awaiting my sisters admission to my college I am unsure which one was more tense her future or the penalty shots We might have lost that day a game well played after all we lost to the champions But there was a promise Messi He brought us close in I quietly retired to the bed and I remember peekayty coming to me and saying it s okay it s a game is year of hope and Messi I am hopeful
