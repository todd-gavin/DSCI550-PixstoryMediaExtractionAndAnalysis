I think it s extremely funny to think that any false allegations would harm Musk in anyway when he s gotten away with doing much worse The first thing we do every time a powerful man who is fully capable of committing the worst of acts and bury it under his influence is accused of sexual assault is try to find the reasons for why it can t be possible But why How many of those men do we know personally To be very fair even the closest ones of most sexual offenders couldn t have predicted they would do something like that And what does him having a clear record in the past have to do with any of this Just because there hasn t been a public news of him doing it in the past doesn t mean he can t do it now or does it Could it be a political stunt Sure But questioning the credibility of a pretty powerless potential victim to defend the richest man on the planet being the first thing you do after something like this happens just gives out the impression that rich men will always be supported or excused as soon as they re accused That tends to silence and have silenced a lot of victims This victim blaming attitude needs to end There s no right time for a victim to speak up If we can t amplify the voices of the victims the least we can do is sit back and not make it harder for them Especially when the accused is the said man One of the most powerful men currently As men we have a lot of privileges it s time we start using them right Not to mention Elon Musk s career is going nowhere If anything I m worried for that attendant given the history where powerful men have time and again ruined the lives of women who dared speaking against them
