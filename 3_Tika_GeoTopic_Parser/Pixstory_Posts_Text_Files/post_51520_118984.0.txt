Edu after talking about his new signings and player handling opened up on his relationship with Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and how the too agree on bringing in new signings to the club.

HOW IMPORTANT IS IT THAT YOU AND ARTETA AGREE ON A SIGNING?

Edu replied: "One hundred per cent. I'm never ever going to sign a player which Mikel is not comfortable with, never. That's not my style and for sure it's not the Arsenal style.

"If we decide to work together then the decision needs to be together. It's not Mikel's signings, it's not Edu's signings, it's the Arsenal signings so that for me is the most important thing for people to understand.

"I always say people sometimes give the credit to me or to Mikel, but the credit has to go to Arsenal. We are Arsenal, we are working together and the decision we make is together.

"Around one decision is not only Edu and Mikel, it's a lot of people around those decisions. The most important message to the fans and for people to understand is that we sign players for Arsenal and [they are] Arsenal's decisions."

Next, he was asked about his impression on Arteta and how excited was he interviewing him - a former Arsenal player interviewing another.

"Wow. When I spoke to him over the phone to introduce myself and talk to him, funnily enough, we stayed on the phone for one hour talking about everything, not just football but families, concepts, ideas and behaviours.

"When I switched off my telephone I thought that's maybe something really special and what we are probably looking for the club.

"Then when we decided to go there and to meet Mikel to talk about the ideas, he was almost prepared for everything. He was really impressive on his ideas, his style and the way he wanted to play so it was amazing - that's why he's here."
