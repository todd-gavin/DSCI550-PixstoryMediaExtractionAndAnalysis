Spain faced Mexico today in Matchday 2 of the ongoing U-17 Women’s World Cup at the DY Patil Stadium, Navi Mumbai, and it was hands down one of the most intense matches in the tournament so far. The match was no less than a roller-coaster ride Mexico ended up winning it by a narrow 2-1 margin. Well, this match has complicated the points situation in Group C a lot as all the teams (Columbia, Mexico, Spain, China) have 3 points and now everything depends on Matchday 3. 
Coming to the match between Spain and Mexico, the two sides were the epitome of their respective playing styles today. Spain played their trademark possession football. They dominated 63% possession and had total control of the game. However, Mexico were smart and were totally dependent on Counter-attacks. As Jose Mourinho once said: “Let them have the ball, we will have the three points”. This was the very crux of today’s match. 
Spain were the better side all throughout. But Mexico were just more clinical and they got the much essential goals, thus ending up winning the game. 
The first half was goalless and all three goals were scored in the second half. Mexico’s no.7, right winger Maribel Flores Hernández scored their first goal in the 47th minute. Spanish left-back Judit Pujols Parera scored the equaliser at the 74’ mark. However, there was more drama left in the match. In the 85th minute, Montserrat Saldívar Pavón gave Mexico the lead for the second time tonight and that was the deciding goal. The Spaniards tried to score another equaliser but very less time was left and they lost the match. 
This was Mexico’s first win in the tournament and they are now placed 2nd on the Group C points table. However, their fate depend on Matchday 3, as mentioned earlier.
