For the encounter at Camping World Stadium, El Tri's assistant, Jorge Theiler, will be in command.

On medical concerns, Mexico coach Gerardo Martino will miss his team's next friendly against Guatemala in Orlando.

The Argentine, who guided El Tri to World Cup qualifying in Qatar 2022 last month, will miss the match at Camping World Stadium, the Mexican Football Federation stated (FMF).

The friendly encounter, which will be part of Mexico's preparations for the end-of-year event, will be overseen by Martino's assistant, Jorge Theiler, four years ahead of their own hosting 
responsibilities at United 2026.

According to a statement released on social media by the FMF, Martino will miss his team's 
upcoming encounter in Florida for health reasons.

Due to medical directives, "[head coach] Gerardo Martino will not go to Orlando for our #MEXTOUR match [against Guatemala]," they said.

"On Wednesday, Assistant Coach Jorge Theiler will be on the bench."

Martino's medical absence is most likely related to the 59-year-old's operation for a detached 
retina late last month.

It is not the first time the Mexican president has sought treatment for the ailment, but the 
Argentine has been barred from flying as a result of the process.

President Yon de Luisa stated at the time that he would lead them to Qatar before the end of the year.
