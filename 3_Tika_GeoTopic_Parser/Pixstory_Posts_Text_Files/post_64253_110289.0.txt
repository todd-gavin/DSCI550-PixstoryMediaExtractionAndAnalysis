एक अलग सा नूर है इस शहर का 
कुछ अलग सी बात 
घूम हो जाते हैं लोग यहाँ 
पर अफ़साने है फिर भी कई हज़ार 
सदियों से चली आ रही कहानी इसकी 
अभी भी है जवां 
शायरों की इस बस्ती 
में आओगे तुम जभ भी 
करेगी ना तुम्हे यह खफ़ा 
चाहे चले जाओ कही भी 
पर कभी न भूल पाओगे 
दिल्ली की वो हसीं शाम 

I haven't seen the entire world, nor I have seen half of India but the mere thought of living in Delhi makes me overwhelmed.  My tryst with this city certainly has its involvement with the way Delhi has been portrayed in Indian cinema. Delhi is not a city, it's a feeling for me, an indescribable emotion that makes me want to explore every nook and corner of it. The chaotic streets, the hustle-bustle of the markets, the GEN Z culture, and the hurried lives of people, all of these make Delhi a phenomenal city in its way. I mean there's just so much to talk about it. You enter Old Delhi and it feels as if you are sitting in one of the Mughal Emperor's royal courts. The city had a violent history of assaults but each time it rose to life with the same vivacity. Struggling under the modern facade of the metropolis, it is still the city that Mir and Ghalib wrote about. It's the same city that writers have talked about and passed on as heritage. Nothing dies here, even today its past remains in the half-ruined building, a past that captivates me, startles me and inspires me. People either love it or hate it, there's nothing in between but all I have to say is that someone who hasn't felt its magnificence is too deep in their bad luck because Delhi is an essence of surreal belongingness, something that no other place in the entire world could make one feel so.
