Bollywood actors Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor got married at an intimate ceremony at their house in Mumbai on Thursday. They were joined by close friends and family members. Alia Bhatt shared the first photos of the couple on Instagram.

Alia shared in the caption, “Today, surrounded by our family and friends, at home … in our favourite spot – the balcony we’ve spent the last 5 years of our relationship – we got married. With so much already behind us, we can’t wait to build more memories together … memories that are full of love, laughter, comfortable silences, movie nights, silly fights, wine delights and Chinese bites. Thank you for all the love and light during this very momentous time in our lives. It has made this moment all the more special. Love, Ranbir and Alia
