Monica  Vitti was perhaps most famous for her performances in Michelangelo Antonioni's international breakthrough trilogy: "L'Avventura," "La Notte" and "L'Eclisse." She would later return to work with Antonioni once again on "The Mystery of Oberwald" in 1980.

Vitti -- born Maria Luisa Ceciarelli on November 3, 1931 in Rome -- worked with many of the giants of cinematic history, including Spanish filmmaker Luis Bu√±uel and Italian master Ettore Scola, during a career spanning more than 30 years.
