A woman grows into her limelight of her most confident self through her grit and grin of life where she identifies herself to complement her man and not compete To her outside world in her career she is an employee to her insurance she is a number to her bank she is a client all becoming a neuter existence of her undefined self Only to her men in life she is a woman The woman strives to care and nurture for him her family her close relationships giving them strength and grounding to their existence The woman lives through life achieving success and riding the rollercoasters of life to sustain her womanhood in the continuous battle of work and home Birth of her child completes her identity as mother in midst of her numerous varied roles she plays in life but inside her is still the young little girl who still wants her mom to be beside her Thus goes the sequential chain of role playing where she also balances the men in her life with adoration and care In every step she strives to be believed in her role playing where her destiny guides her in between the numerous hazards of life in mercy and sympathy Thus she quietens herself in resilience and believes that she is adored and she is believed by her family and her close ones and specially from the very men whose life revolves around her womanhood Thus she is woman only because there is man Saluting her womanhood she welcomes the men in her life loving them unconditionally
