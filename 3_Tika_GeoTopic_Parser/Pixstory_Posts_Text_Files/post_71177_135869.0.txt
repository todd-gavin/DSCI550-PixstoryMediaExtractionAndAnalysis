The trading of Chiru wool products was outlawed in 1975 by the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES). It was outlawed everywhere in 1975.

Shahtoosha trafficking was outlawed by the Indian government in 1991. In the early 2000s, the J&K government subsequently declared a ban on the production and sale of Shahtoosh wool. The statute was ultimately implemented several years later, after numerous court appearances.Â 

Every year, some 20,000 Tibetan chirus, which are antelopes, must be slaughtered to make toosh shawls. As a result, their numbers drastically decreased. By the end of the 20th century, there were only around 75,000 antelopes left, from a million or so.

Chiru became a threatened species. The Shahtoosh trade was outlawed for the reasons listed above.
