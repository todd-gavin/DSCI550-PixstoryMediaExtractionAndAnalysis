Amnesty International says media outlets once known for their independent reporting are now collapsing under Taliban rule.

Since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, a number of independent media outlets have been shut down, violence against journalists has increased, and media space has become more limited.

On the occasion of World Press Freedom Day, Amnesty International tweeted that 231 media outlets had lost their jobs since the Taliban took control, 6,400 journalists had lost their jobs and some were facing financial threats and problems.

It added that in more than seven Taliban-controlled areas, 80 journalists and media workers have been detained and harassed, with female journalists suffering the most.
