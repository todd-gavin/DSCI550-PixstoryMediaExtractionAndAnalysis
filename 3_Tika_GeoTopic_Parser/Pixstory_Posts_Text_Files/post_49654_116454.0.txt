A federal judge is in favor of the Sun Prairie School District in a lawsuit filed by two Black parents who challenged their children’s middle school assignment that asked students how they would punish a slave in ancient Mesopotamia.

Dazrrea Ervins and Priscilla Jones claimed the Black History Month assignment in February 2021 infringed their civil rights as well as those of their children.

The question was not part of the school district’s curriculum on ancient Mesopotamia. Three teachers came up with the assignment on their own, according to an internal investigation. 

U.S. District Judge James Peterson, in Wisconsin’s Western District, said the parents declined to show evidence that their civil rights or those of their children were violated by the assignment.

“A reasonable jury certainly could find that its content and timing were offensive, insensitive, and justifiably upset students and their families,” Peterson wrote. “But a hostile environment claim requires much more than a single upsetting episode.”

I believe the question if asked in the same way was inappropriate. Punishments should not be the one to focus especially in such an issue.
