Amid rumors of a potential trade, superstar guard James Harden is reportedly frustrated with the Brooklyn Nets organization.

According to Sam Amick and Alex Schiffer of The Athletic, Harden is unhappy with how he has been utilized in Brooklyn and has taken issue with the Nets as a whole rather than just teammate Kyrie Irving despite speculation regarding division between them.

Amick and Schiffer noted that while Harden has "thrown hints" he isn't thrilled with Irving being a part-time player as a result of not getting the COVID-19 vaccine, Kyrie's situation "hasn’t been as much of a problem as one would expect" since he has played hard when available.

Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium reported Friday that the Nets are "open" to discussing a trade with the Philadelphia 76ers that would send point guard Ben Simmons and more to Brooklyn for Harden prior to the Feb. 10 trade deadline.
