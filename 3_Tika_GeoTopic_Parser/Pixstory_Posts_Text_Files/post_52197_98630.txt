Federal Labor has ruled out paying superannuation on Commonwealth funded parental leave if it wins the May election It s been unclear in recent weeks what Labor would decide with senior party officials as late as yesterday insisting it was still under consideration But Shadow Minister for Women Tanya Plibersek on Friday said Labor was no longer committed to the policy in its first term of government It s not a policy we re taking to this election it s important we continue to see reform to paid parental leave she told the ABC It s Labor that introduced paid parental leave we want to see improvements in it over time It isn t possible for us to fix every problem that this government has created including the problem of the superannuation pay gap in our first term of government At the election Labor committed to paying superannuation on weeks of paid parental leave offered by the Commonwealth a move that would help bridge the superannuation gender gap and improve retirement savings for women who take time away from work to have children A government review into retirement income found the policy would cost million but the Coalition confirmed earlier in the year it would not adopt it Shadow Treasurer Jim Chalmers last week said a final decision hadn t been made We ve been consulting with stakeholders and we ve said the same thing privately that we say publicly which is that this is a very good policy idea and we need to weigh it up against a whole range of other great policy ideas he said We haven t come to a concluded view on that We consider it to be very important We ve taken that policy to elections in the past but we need to weigh it up against all the other priorities When asked on Thursday Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese wouldn t be drawn on Labor s position We announce our policies during the campaign we haven t announced that as a policy he said We support paid parental leave we can t commit to everything that we committed to during the last campaign
