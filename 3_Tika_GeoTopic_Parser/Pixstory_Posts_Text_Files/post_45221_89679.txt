As the Old Trafford club prepares to choose a new manager former Manchester United striker Mark Hughes has revealed the edge Mauricio Pochettino has over Erik ten Hag Since Solskjaer s sacking in November Ralf Rangnick has been in command of the team on an interim basis but the German is poised to take up a consultant post at Old Trafford at the end of the season Pochettino an Argentine has also managed Tottenham Hotspur and Southampton and Hughes believes his Premier League expertise will benefit Manchester United Ten Hag is the other front runner to take charge at Old Trafford having won a slew of honours since joining Ajax in The Premier League is like no other league in world football Hughes told Sky Sports It has similarities obviously with the quality of the play but I just think the intensity of the games is different If you ve had no experience of the competition either as a player or a manager then I think it can take you aback and you can have a period of transition where you re not quite sure what s hit you because it s such a different level in my view So you see the attraction of Pochettino coming in because he does know the Premier League and the strength of it but there s examples of other coaches from other countries who have come in and hit the ground running Hughes added The fact is Man Utd is one of the top jobs in world football so there will be plenty of people throwing their CVs in and hoping they re going to get a call I ve not had mine yet but there you go It s a difficult time for United at the moment and it s not easy for anybody with any connection to the club so they need to get this one right It s a huge appointment and all the due diligence and the interviews they seem to be doing at the moment you hope will lead to them getting the right guy in place
