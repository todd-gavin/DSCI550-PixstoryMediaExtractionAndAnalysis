The English rock band Led Zeppelin was formed in London in 1968. Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham made the band. They are credited as one of the forefathers of hard rock and heavy metal, owing to their powerful, guitar-driven sound, however their approach drew from a number of influences, including blues and folk music. Led Zeppelin is credited with having had a considerable impact on the music industry, especially in the creation of album-oriented rock (AOR) and stadium rock.

Led Zeppelin, once known as the New Yardbirds, had a deal with Atlantic Records that provided them a lot of creative flexibility. They were initially disliked with critics, but with eight studio albums released over 10 years, they were able to attain substantial financial success. Led Zeppelin, released in 1969, was a top-ten album in various countries, including songs like "Good Times Bad Times," "Dazed and Confused," and "Communication Breakdown." "Ramble On" and "Whole Lotta Love" were among the songs on Led Zeppelin II (1969), their first number-one album. They published Led Zeppelin III in 1970, which included "Immigrant Song." With 37 million copies sold, their unnamed fourth album, also known as Led Zeppelin IV (1971), is one of the best-selling albums in history. "Black Dog," "Rock and Roll," and "Stairway to Heaven" are among the songs on the album.
