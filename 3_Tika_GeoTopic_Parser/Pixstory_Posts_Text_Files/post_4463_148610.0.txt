Happy daughters day to all of us!! 🫶🦋I didn’t know it’s daughters day today until my dad wished me. ☺️This is the first think i saw in the morning , this feeling is precious getting a text from your dad 🥶  even thou we live together , he must be sitting in drawing room sipping tea and texting all his daughters that he loves us ! Yes we are 4 sisters , and he loves us equally, im the only one who lives with him 🫠 I love you dad, i just wanna thank him for all his hard work, struggles, compromises , unconditional love for you. ❤️🫧 I hope i’m making him proud!!
