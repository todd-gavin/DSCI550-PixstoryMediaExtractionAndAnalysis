When you re passionate about something there are a lot of clashes in priorities You want to isolate that desire from everything else Thankfully my family made it much easier for me to do that In my younger years I couldn t focus much on my studies Upon discussion with my elders they agreed to let me concentrate more on cricket Now as a professional player I have many more responsibilities In all cases mental fortitude stands to be the key I am no master at it but trying matters I ve been to many tournaments I started with Nehru Stadium as under and then went to Under IPL World Cup and so on Having played more than matches a question that comes up often is how do I maintain my concentration The fact is that every match can t be one s best There are downfalls and the trick lies in knowing how to deal with them Personally I take my better matches as inspiration and observe what I can do better in my next match As a junior player I would typically do Yoga or meditation before matches Now as a senior player I have a set routine Cricket requires a lot of concentration and it is vital to know how to maintain that across all matches A lot happens during one game In addition to wanting to win the game there s a lot of pressure from the state or country you re representing and I take it in stride Stress is there in every field and one learns how to deal with it with time Just give yourself the necessary space to learn and grow
