On Friday, a guy dressed as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un disrupted the Australian election campaign by barging into an event attended by Prime Minister Scott Morrison and MP Gladys Liu. 

ABC News reported that the imposter, who eventually went by the stage name Howard X, began speaking to the assembled reporters. 

“Thank you very much. Gladys Liu is the communist candidate for Australia,” he said, before he was interrupted by an aide to Morrison.

“Excuse me, you are going to have to leave. This is the most offensive thing I have ever seen in a campaign,” said the aide, Nick Creevey.

The impersonator responded: “Excuse me, you don't tell the supreme leader what to do. I support Gladys Liu." The impersonator left the Melbourne venue soon after.

Liu said she was focused on producing results for the Melbourne neighbourhoods she represents in a statement to The Associated Press. “I will not be distracted by my opponents and their grubby tactics,” she said.

What do you think? Was this a tactic of the opposition or a mere coincidence?
