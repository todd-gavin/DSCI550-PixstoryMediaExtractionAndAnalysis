The autumn-winter collection that Jonathan Anderson designs for Loewe has an organic vocation and a vision from the beginning of the world. The guests enter through an arch formed by the legs of this man and are placed in a square space with earth-colored carpet from which giant pumpkins emerge. the Giant Pumpkins that Anthea Hamilton made in leather in in collaboration with Loewe The dresses that are actually rigid sculptures very similar to preformed casts in leather or felt look like solidified liquid forms while the wind moves their surfaces and shapes Other dresses end with rigid sculptures in the shape of a car other very close-fitting jersey dresses hold inflated balloons or shoes with heels some leather jackets have the shape of the airbag and from bustiers in the shape of lips come long dresses in fluid jersey
