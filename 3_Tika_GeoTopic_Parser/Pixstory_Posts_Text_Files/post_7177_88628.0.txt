22 yards of deceit continues.....

I had experienced and endured similar assaults of adverse media and public opinion following sensational killings, terror attacks and serial murders on many an occasion during the 36 years of my police career. Public and media opinions are as fickle as the English weather. As soon as the murder is solved or the serial killer arrested, everything changes dramatically and sunshine returns in all its glory. In my mind, there was only one path we could tread—complete the investigation, net our last quarry and endure the disparagement in the interim. Moreover, the raging anti-police storm was largely motivated, without any rational basis, and I knew it would pass.

Tragically, on May 11, 2013, we lost Inspector Badrish Dutt, our main investigator 
of the case. He was killed in a grisly incident in Gurgaon, found dead with bullet wounds, 
alongside his paramour Geeta Sharma, a self-styled private detective. In all probability one had shot the other and then shot oneself. It was a huge setback for the investigating team but we put the loss of a good officer behind us and soldiered on.

On May 15, 2013, the live coverage of the contest between Rajasthan Royals and Mumbai Indians was watched by us with bated breath. Our police teams lay in wait to move in, both in Mumbai and Delhi. True to his word, Ankeet Chavan gave away 14 runs as he had 
promised to fixers in lieu of Rs. 60 lakhs. In a swoop-down, Delhi Police Special Cell boys 
arrested 14 accused, including bookies, financers and the three fixed cricketers during night-long raids on May 15 and early hours of May 16. Several computers, mobile phones, TV sets, handwritten diaries, papers were recovered during the raids. The lid on the first case of spotfixing in T-20 cricket had been blown.
