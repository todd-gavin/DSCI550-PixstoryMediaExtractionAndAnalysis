Vince Gilligan has done it again, he's created a series that's worthy of all the critical acclaim it gets. Alongside Peter Gould, Vince Gilligan has managed to take this Breaking Bad Spin Off to reach new heights. With the end so very close, the first part of the last season is completely out and these 7 episodes have been a treat to watch. 

Bob Odenkirk is amazing as he's almost truly Saul Goodman now, Rhea Seehorn as Kim Wexler has shown a completely different perspective of her character. Jonathan Banks and Giancarlo Esposito are true to their characters down to the dot. Tony Dalton as Lalo wasn't seen much in the first few episodes but during the 6th and 7th episode his presence was unmatched. Patrick Fabian as Howard, potrayed a very nuanced performance of someone being framed for things beyond his talents. Finally, the best performance for me is by Michael Mando as Nacho Varga, its just too poignant and beautiful, he shows range and depth in his acting and its going to remembered for a very long time. 

The best is yet to come though as it has already been confirmed that Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul will be reprising the fan-favourite characters of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman. 

Vince Gilligan didn't disappoint anyone with this great spin-off of one of the greatest T.V. Series ever and its now up to the ending to decide whether it'll be right at top with Breaking Bad or not? The fans certainly feel that it will be.
