America isn't a ruthless nation with gun laws. It does have restrictions. Many people don't know or fail to understand these laws. The Gun Control Act of 1968 prohibits certain people from buying, selling, using, owning, receiving, shipping, carrying, possessing or exchanging any firearm or ammunition. 

These individuals include: 

A person who has been convicted of a misdemeanour crime of domestic violence. 

A fugitive from justice.

A person who has been convicted by the court for offences punishable by jail for more than a year. 

A person who has been found to a mental defective or has been involuntarily committed to any mental institution. 

An unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act.

An Illegal Alien, who has been in the US, unlawfully.

A subject to a court order restraining the person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner or child of the intimate partner.

A person who has renounced his or her United States nationality.

A person who has been discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonourable conditions.

Know your laws so that you can point out the lawbreakers and can be always a law-abiding citizen.
