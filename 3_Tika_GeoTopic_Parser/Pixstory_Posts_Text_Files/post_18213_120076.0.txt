Jason Momoa said that Justice League co-star Ben Affleck will appear in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, reuniting Arthur Curry and Bruce Wayne.

After fans on a Warner Bros. bus tour presumably learned that Affleck was there filming with him, Momoa announced the news on Instagram on Thursday.

Affleck already announced his decision to step down from the Batman role in 2019 and has been candid about the emotional and professional challenges that come with it. The news that Affleck will be donning the cape once more for The Flash, a movie starring Ezra Miller and scheduled out on June 23, 2023, was unexpected two years ago. The film will also star Michael Keaton as Batman.

Since Lost Kingdom is set to release on March 17, 2023, it appears that Affleck will make an earlier appearance in the character than had previously been anticipated.

In Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, Suicide Squad, and Justice League, Affleck portrayed Batman. He briefly planned on starring in and directing The Batman before backing out.
