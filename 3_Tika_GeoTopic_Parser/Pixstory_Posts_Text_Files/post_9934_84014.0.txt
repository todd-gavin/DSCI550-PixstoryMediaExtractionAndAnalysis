Yesterday I went outside to clicked some pictures for my project but suddenly I came across with this men one was trying to sale cotton candy to earn money and feed his family at the first he ignored to take a picture of him but when I asked him a question ( what is in your pocket) he said; just my wallet and my mobile and he allowed me to take his picture then. And the other man was reading a newspaper who was sitting in the middle of park and talking to himself and enjoying his moments. When I wanted to get close to him and asked a question but he ignored me. He looked so innocent and his eyes were speaking thousands words and full of sorrow.
