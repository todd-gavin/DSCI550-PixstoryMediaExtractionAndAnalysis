As I continued my efforts to learn more about the history of Jaimanglagarh I discovered that probably the first detailed report on the site had been published in the nd Bulletin of Begusarai s Ganesh Dutt College It however had a very limited circulation and was not found available with any of the scholars or archaeologists whom I could contact telephonically during the period of lockdown between March to May enforced to contain the spread of the corona virus i e COVID However I continued my efforts to obtain a copy of the nd Bulletin and as the Unlock came into effect with certain relaxations on movements I again approached Mr Kundan in Begusarai and requested him to find out from the college library whether any copy of the then published bulletin had survived After a day long search on th June I was sadly informed that the nd bulletin was not available in the College Library and that it had probably been lost I nevertheless still did not lose hope and requested him to contact some other senior scholars of the district who may have retained a copy in some manner I was pleasantly surprised on the morning of th June to see a scanned copy of the desired report booming in my WhatsApp account having been obtained from Mr Shailesh Kumar Sinha who had retired after having served as the Head of the History and Archaeology Department at the College To be continued
