A  source  very close to Karan  Johar reveals, “Karan has shown the film to those who opinion matters  to him.Among those who have  seen the  film from within his fraternity are Shah Rukh Khan, S S Rajamouli, NTR Junior and Aditya Chopra. They  cannot stop raving about the film.😍🔥

 Of course Karan realizes that his friends from the entertainment industry  praising Brahmastra  does  not amount to  a mass acceptance of the work. ✅✅

Asli pareeksha  toh tabb hogi jab junta  dekhegi Brahmastra.”👀👀

Apparently Karan Johar is  keen to show the  film to  trial audiences. But  his co-producers  and distributors  Star Studios, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures are strictly  against the idea.❌❌

“After burning his fingers with  Liger , Karan wants to show the film to audiences outside the industry. He has  realized the film fraternity won’t  tell the truth about the quality of  films.

 Karan Johar is super-confident about  Brahmastra.He wants to  hold pre-release  ‘trial’ show for handpicked audiences  who can offer  do-able suggestions to better the  film even at this late stage when the film’s release is two weeks away,” says a source close to Karan.🎥🎥👍🏻

If  only his  co-producers would let him.
