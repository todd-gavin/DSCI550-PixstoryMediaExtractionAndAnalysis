Just two French players in history have scored more than 400 career goals:
🇫🇷 Karim Benzema (428)
🇫🇷 Thierry Henry (411)
🎙️ Thierry Henry: "In a world full of Ronaldo and Messi fans, I was a Karim Benzema fan for 15 years of my life. They laughed at me when I told them he will challenge for the Ballon d’Or with Real Madrid one day. Every hero has his day. Never stop working. Be like Karim." 🇫🇷
