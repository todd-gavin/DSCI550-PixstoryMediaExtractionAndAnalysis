Top hotel companies in Europe are recruiting people without experience or even a resume as CEOs acknowledge that years of underpaying staff have backfired and left them unable to match the demand for tourism following the outbreak.
According to Chief Executive Sebastien Bazin in an interview with Reuters at the Qatar Economic Forum last month, the largest hotelier in Europe, Accor, is testing out efforts to hire people who haven't previously worked in the sector.
According to him, new hires receive six hours of training before beginning to work.
