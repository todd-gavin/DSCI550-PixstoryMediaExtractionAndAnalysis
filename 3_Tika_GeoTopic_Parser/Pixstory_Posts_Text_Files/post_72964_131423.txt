 Bad Boys uses all of its energy to redeem an exhausted story through sheer technique This film is so visually appealing that it deserves a good screenplay rather than another trip down memory lane The film depicts a Miami filled with midnight glitz shot with the flair of a fashion photographer complete with backlit monochrome tilt shots It has relentless editing slick action sequences and really blows stuff up But what exactly is it about There are two cops Buddies Partners Narcs Whose evidence was taken during a million heroin bust who the chief yells at when they cause trouble Additionally a female employee from Internal Affairs takes them off the case and who along the way pick up a hot witty sidekick Oh and one of the police officers is a hot bachelor while the other is a family man The episodes of HRS Internal Affairs Beverly Hills Cop and Lethal Weapon provide pieces for the plot s jigsaw puzzle The film was created by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer who also produced Beverly Hills Cop parts one and two and several of the films they have plagiarised Film stars Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are allowed to talk way too much Dialogue runs on endlessly There are a lot of curious interludes in which they do verbal riffs We wish we knew them well enough to figure out what they think they re saying Plot is straight out of Idiot plots Lawrence has to pretend to be Smith for a few days while his wife gets suspicious etc Questions are raised about why Smith s apartment is filled only with photos of himself Film is well done with good special effects and takes the usual shortcuts for maximum impact The climax is ideal for those with attention span deficit especially if you re a slow wider than the average film goer Filmmakers violate credibility to give us a smart remark that is not believable funny or original What exercise in self deception inspires them to go to such effort and expense for what is obviously going to be a lame exercise in retreadmaneuver
