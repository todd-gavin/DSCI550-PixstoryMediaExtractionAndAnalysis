Twin brothers Nick and Steve Tidball are the brains behind Vollebak The Vollebak range includes jackets trousers shirts and hoodies Vollebak creates the survival clothing of the future a jacket that will protect the wearer from viruses and bacteria The Indestructible Jacket for example is made of Dyneema an ultra high molecular weight polyethylene fibre that s generally used in anti ballistic armour plating or stowage systems for container ships The four layer BC Jacket by contrast is designed to double as a mobile cave that would have elicited a rapturous roar from any caveman Then there s the Year range which is aimed at customers with a long term view of fashion items that should last years But the highlight is the Full Metal Jacket containing km of copper Copper ions kill off pathogens such as bacteria viruses and fungi so not a bad sales pitch in times like these The jacket is also highly waterproof windproof and breathable The bad news is the collection is currently just for men but Vollebak say a range for women is in the pipeline too Long lasting and durable clothing makes a lot of sense because the survival of humanity is less dependent on the clothes men and women wear and more on what happens when they take them off
