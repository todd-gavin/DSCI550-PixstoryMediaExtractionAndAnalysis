The actor-filmmaker told Bollywood Hungama that songs are an integral part of Bollywood films. He cited examples of recent pan-India films such as Pushpa and RRR and how their every song became a rage adding that Bollywood should learn from them. He further said that Bollywood filmmakers are trying to make 'so-called modern cinema' which works only with one percent of the population. "A big chunk of the audience cannot relate to it," he added.

Roshan said that earlier there used to be 6 songs in a film, now there are hardly any songs being picturised on actors. He said that these songs used to help the actors turn into superstars such as Amitabh Bachchan and Rajesh Khanna. Without songs, Roshan said that it has become very difficult to become a superstar at present.
