Many of the trees we plant originate in forested areas where competition with 
sod and grass are non-existent. Actually, our lawns are a large competitor of trees for available moisture and nutrients. Maintaining a lawn around the base of a tree also makes it very susceptible to weed eater and lawn mower damage which kills trees.One of the best things you can do for your trees is maintain a 3-4 inch layer of woodchips 
or other organic matter around your tree to help suppress weeds and grass. Start the layer 
of mulch approximately 6 inches from the trunk of the tree out to the tips of the branches, 
or further. It does not matter what size your tree is, it will benefit from this technique. 
Never pile mulch or soil up against the trunk of a tree. To help keep grass and mulch from growing in the mulch, you can safely use a product such as Roundup, but make sure to follow labeled instructions. Not all grass and weed killers are safe to use around trees. 
Supplemental water is also vital in growing vigorous and healthy trees. On an average 
year, unlike this one, our rainfall totals around Aberdeen are not quite enough so we must give our trees supplemental water especially in the hot, dry months. Give the tree a 
thorough soaking 1-2 times per week if we are not receiving rain. 
A common question that comes up is whether or not to fertilize trees. Unless you have 
found nutrient deficiencies from taking soil or foliage samples, your trees do not need 
extra fertilizer. If you are fertilizing your lawn, your trees will absorb sufficient amounts 
of that and additional tree fertilizer is not needed. Actually, by pushing too much 
fertilizer, you are forcing your tree to focus on top growth, not a strong, healthy, 
supportive root system. 

By mulching trees and giving them supplemental water when needed, you will be giving 
them a big advantage, creating healthier trees that grow faster.
