Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba has been garnering a lot of interest lately and it
appears as though Paris Saint-Germain are in the pole position now to land the French star
as per a report from Foot Mercato.

Pogba, who won the World Cup with France in 2018, has been a key cog in Didier
Deschamps' side but has repeatedly failed to replicate his international form with the Red
Devils.

Manchester United made Pogba their most expensive acquisition in 2016 after they spent a
record-breaking £94.5 million to acquire his services, from Juventus, but he has since failed
to fulfil his potential in the famous United shirt.

As per reports, the 29-year-old is set to become a free agent this summer, and the Red
Devils have tabled a lucrative deal for the midfielder which would make his one of the
highest-paid players in the Premier League, Pogba is still unconvinced about United’s future,
with a new manager expected to take charge soon.

PSG’s sporting director Leonardo has reportedly met the Frenchman, and it appears that a
move back to his native could be on the cards or Pogba.

His former club Juventus were also in the race to sign him, as per multiple reports, but PSG
seem to have stolen the march on the midfielder’s signature.

After PSG’s heartbreaking exit in the Champions League, at the hands of Real Madrid,
Leonardo seems convinced that Marco Verratti needs better support in the mifield.
Last season as well, PSG made excellent use of free signings, as they acquired the likes of
Lionel Messi, Sergio Ramos and Gianluigi Donnarumma for zilch.
