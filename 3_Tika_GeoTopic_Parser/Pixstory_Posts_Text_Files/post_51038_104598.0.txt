Living your life happily is nothing less an art. People who know the art of living are the happiest people in the world. They know what exactly they have to do to carry on with their life. Well, you have to carry on with moving forward to your life. 🚲

Therefore, the only thing that you have to do is to carry on with moving. For instance, consider your life to be a bicycle. And to keep the balance of the bike, you have to keep moving. If you stop, you will fall from it.🚲

It is estimated that every hour cycled adds an hour to your life, while also saving you money, lightening the load on public transport, and reducing carbon emissions. And using your commute to get your daily exercise fix done and dusted is the ultimate work-life hack.🚲

I promise, once you’ve ditched the train, bus or car for two wheels you’ll feel happier, more productive and more motivated at work, but read this ‘first timers’ guide’ before you take the leap.
