Taught to speak politely poised and not to raise voice Engaged in enrage marked as rebellion At times asked to speak for myself other times silenced against injustices I did only the expected but I have got a list ready to do the unexpected My voice shall spit fire when I get groped again My voice shall raise when I see moral policing again My voice shall raise when gender discrimination happens My voice will be louder when I want to speak my mind out
