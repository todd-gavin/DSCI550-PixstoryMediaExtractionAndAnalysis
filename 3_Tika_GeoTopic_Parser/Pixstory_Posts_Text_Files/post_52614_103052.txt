Australians are a proud bunch but for all our chest beating we lack two very key dates in our annual diaries to reflect this Our nation has five national public holidays to celebrate a Middle Eastern religion one to celebrate a Roman calendar one to celebrate workers and one to celebrate the Queen Oh yes Australia Day I hear someone wearing a flag as a cape yell with a mouth full of VB and lamb Well the reality is that is a day to celebrate how good the British were at sailing and lying about land not being occupied in the s and I would argue there is nothing less Australian than celebrating the Brits ANZAC Day does bring us together but in commemoration not celebration Throw in a spattering of State holidays and we have our public holiday mix Curiously there is no national day to celebrate Australia together nor our First Nations culture Canada and New Zealand are always the two countries worth turning to for comparisons They also celebrate the day Canada became independent from the Brits on July but we have not quite got there yet In fairness like us they also celebrate colonialism and generations of brutality towards First Nations people with Thanksgiving Day New Zealand has both Waitangi Day on February to mark the signing of Treaty and Matariki in late June Maori New Year We could have this in Australia too Celebrating First Nations culture on Mabo Day on June would honour the end of the Terra Nullius shame Sorry Day on May is also a worthy option Australia Day is the obvious one to replace As for the second one that is open ended The Queens Birthday appears the clear choice given we do not care about it but I would argue that is better off changing permanently to mark the local holidays it has become Then again being able to enjoy the last gasp of sun before winter sets in with extended Easter ANZAC holidays is quite nice
