Sources in Bamyan province say carvings on Buddha caves have recently been carried out by unknown individuals. The cave gates that were torn down by UNESCO have been broken.
At present, the place of the Buddha and the city of Ghalghaleh have become the place of "relief".

Recently, some foreign media reported that new excavations had been carried out around the Buddha.

In the first round of their rule, the Taliban destroyed the statues of Shahmameh and Salsal. Mullah Abdullah Sarhadi was the Taliban governor in Bamyan at the time.
