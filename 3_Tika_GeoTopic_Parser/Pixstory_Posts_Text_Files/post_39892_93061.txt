 Cherry Processing Processing must begin as soon as the coffee is gathered to avoid fruit deterioration Coffee is prepared in one of two methods depending on local resources The Dry Method is still practised in many areas when water is scarce The plucked cherries are simply put out in the sun to dry After harvesting the Wet Method eliminates the pulp from the coffee cherry leaving just the parchment skin First the cherries are pulped to remove the skin and pulp from the bean The beans are then sorted by weight in water channels The green beans float to the top while the mature beans sink They are then sorted by size on spinning drums Drying the Beans If the beans were processed wet they must now be dried to around moisture to be stored appropriately These beans may be dried in the sun by spreading them out on drying tables or floors and turning them periodically or by machine in giant tumblers The dried beans are called parchment coffee and are stored in jute or sisal bags until exported Milling the Beans Before shipment parchment coffee is milled as follows The endocarp layer endocarp is removed using hulling machines Dry processed coffee is hulled by removing the dried husk from the dried cherries Polishing removes any silver skin that remains on the beans after hulling While polished beans are thought to be better than unpolished the two are quite similar Beans are graded and sorted by size and weight as well as colour and other defects Grading is the process of grading coffee beans based on their size origin altitude preparation picking and flavour cup quality The quantity of cracked under ripe or otherwise faulty beans stones sticks etc The provenance of the beans farm or estate region cooperative is vital for the best coffees Exporting Beans It is transported in jute or sisal bags or in bulk in plastic lined containers
