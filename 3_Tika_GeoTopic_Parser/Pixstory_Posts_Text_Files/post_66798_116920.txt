I miss the good old days where we waited for a full week to catch the next episode and let the suspense linger rather than just click on the next episode Binge watching is not fun it s just convenient and that s why it yields no results no fun to anyone we just treat it like a chore and get it done like a task on our to do list Plus its mentally draining to seat in front of screen for hours continuously Wouldn t recommend it
