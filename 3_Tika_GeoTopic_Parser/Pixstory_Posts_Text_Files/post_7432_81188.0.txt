A woman was stabbed to death by a homeless man who followed her into her Lower East Side apartment building early Sunday — and then barricaded himself inside her home, cops said.

Neighbors called cops to the sixth-floor home inside the building on Chrystie St. near Grand St. about 4:20 a.m. after hearing a woman’s cries for help. Police found the door barricaded shut but heard the victim screaming inside.

After cops surrounded the building the killer, covered in blood, briefly tried to flee via the fire escape then went back inside, police said.

Members of the NYPD’s Emergency Service Unit gained access to the apartment after about an hour and 15 minutes and took the suspect, identified by sources as 25-year-old Assamad Nash, into custody.

They found the 35-year-old victim dead in the bathroom, stabbed multiple times. Cops have not yet released her name.
