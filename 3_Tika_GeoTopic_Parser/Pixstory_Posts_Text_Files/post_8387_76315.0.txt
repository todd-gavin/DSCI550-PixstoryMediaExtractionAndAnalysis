A nation's strength resides in the voice of its people,

A nation's strength is ensured by the soldiers who guards it like an eagle;


A great nation sits on the greatness of its past,

For the people and the state, the nation comes first and always at the last;


India shines like a north star in the galaxy of nations,

For the state and the people what only matters is how they fulfil their aspirations;


This republic is the blood sweat of the greatest patriotic minds,

Let's swear on the holy soil of this land that we'll ensure that this nation always lives and shine.
