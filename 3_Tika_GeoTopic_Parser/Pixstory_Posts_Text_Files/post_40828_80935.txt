I got married to him when I was My maternal uncle fixed the alliance and the first time I saw him was at the wedding At I had my son I had an ardent wish of learning to read and write but never gathered the courage to ask my husband Sometimes after dropping off my son at school I would linger around peeking through the windows of the classroom trying to catch whatever was being taught This is how I learned the alphabet I had an intuition that had it not been for my saree or the vermillion in my hair I would have been able to sneak in as a student as I looked and was quite young But again I did not have the courage As my son grew up my husband hired a private tutor for him who used to come at four in the afternoon However that was the time I finally had lunch after being done with the household work Therefore for countless days I missed lunch and sat behind the curtain eavesdropping on my son s lessons trying to pick up the grammar he was taught I even used to tear pages from his notebooks and hide them in the stacks of wheat and rice Later I practiced writing whatever was written on it with the pen I stole from my husband s study I was when the crowds came for us India was finally free but they said this was not our homeland and we belonged to the other side of the border When my husband refused they burned down our house and killed everyone I somehow managed to escape and ended up on the other side of the border where a government official took pity on me and employed me as a help There too I snooped in the private lessons of his kids and stole their books As everything changed around me my desire to learn remained the same It was the constant left in my life At I gave voice to my trauma Image source Google
