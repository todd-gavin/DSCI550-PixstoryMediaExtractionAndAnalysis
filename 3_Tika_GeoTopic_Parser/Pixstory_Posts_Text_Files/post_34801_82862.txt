His first outings were not exciting indeed with many criticisms but in his first as owner Dejan Kulusevski took the chair with a goal and an assist for Keane in which Tottenham beat leaders Manchester City At the end of the match he spoke to the microphones of Sky Sport I have suffered so much in recent months I have never felt like myself Playing the first match as a starter in the Premier League is an indescribable emotion I needed to play without worries We suffered but the goal helped us at the start He also talked about his relationship with the new coach Antonio Conte I feel great with Conte a beautiful situation he just wants to win and if he doesn&#39;t win he&#39;s not happy He works really well and there&#39;s no need for anything else there are no secrets you have to do what the coach tells you and everything&#39;s fine A Greetings to Juve. I wish all my former team-mates a lot of good. I wish them the best
