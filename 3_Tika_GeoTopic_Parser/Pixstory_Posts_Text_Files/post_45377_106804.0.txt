The UEFA Nations League continues this week with a new round of fixtures, with Turkey taking on Lithuania on Tuesday. Both clubs have had different fortunes in the competition and will be looking to win this game.

Lithuania is now stuck to the bottom of their group and has struggled thus far. The away team lost 2-1 to the Faroe Islands over the weekend and will be looking to bounce back in this match.

Turkey, on the other side, has dominated League C thus far and is now leading Group 1. The hosts defeated Luxembourg 2-0 in their previous match and will try to improve on that performance this week.
