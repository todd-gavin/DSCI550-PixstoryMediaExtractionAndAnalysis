One year ago when Joe Biden became the new US president many Americans and US allies as well as the competitors or rivals in the eyes of US politicians like China and Russia hoped his administration could fix the problems that his predecessor Donald Trump had left the US and the world But now most of them found that Biden s performance is disappointing as well Biden is not a young and energetic leader and his image is old and slow and it seems that his political experience did help him a lot in overcoming challenges and although he wants to fix some mistakes in fields like handling COVID pandemic the systemic problem of US democracy endless partisan struggle has chained him from making meaningful changes and an effective political reform to fix this systemic problem is almost a mission impossible for any US president said experts On foreign affairs Biden did make some changes such as the return to the Paris Agreement and to some extent the strengthened US ties with its allies But the hasty pullout from Afghanistan has seriously damaged the image and credibility of the US especially among countries that expected the US protection analysts noted They said that US tensions with China and Russia remain unchanged and even getting more intense on the Ukraine issue and the Taiwan question To cure the illness of the US is not about changing presidents it requires an in depth political reform and most observers believe that the Democrats might lose the midterm election this year and the Biden administration could become a lame duck after the failure and this would make China US ties even more uncertain and complicated
