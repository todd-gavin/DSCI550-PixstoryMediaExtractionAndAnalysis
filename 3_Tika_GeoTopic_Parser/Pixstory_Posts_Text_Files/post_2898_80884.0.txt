‘Trigger warning’ was a topic of discussion long before ‘cancel culture’, ‘critical race theory’ and ‘wokism’ entered the lexicon of popular debates. That, however did not mean the question was settled. A British university put a trigger warning for its undergraduate students taking up for reading Charles Dickens’s ‘Great Expectations’ and Charlotte Brontë’s ‘Jane Eyre’. A lawmaker then ridiculed the move, and the debate is alive again.

‘Great Expectations’ (1861) is the story of an orphan, with the backdrop of poverty, prison ships and fights to death. ‘Jane Eyre’ (1847) is a romance with the backdrop of an orphan’s unhappy childhood – a regular, tear-jerking theme in nineteenth century English novels.

Salford University made the thoughtful gesture last month for several literary works, including Christina Rossetti’s 1862 fantasy poem ‘Goblin Market’ and Robert Browning’s 1836 poem ‘Porphyria's Lover’. The university advised the students: “There are scenes and discussions of violence and sexual violence in several of the primary texts studied on this module. Some students may find the content of the following texts distressing.”

Critics called it absurd. Conservative parliamentarian Andrew Bridgen said it was ridiculous that adults “have to be protected from the stories that generations of children have been able to cope with without being damaged”: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10382323/Read-Jane-Eyre-dare-University-students-given-trigger-warnings-classic-literature.html

Meanwhile, the film/TV versions of classics such as ‘Great Expectations’ came with ‘PG’ or ‘12A’ certificates, welcoming all except quite young children. But that’s a different medium, at once far more dramatic and yet aimed at family audiences.

In the US, trigger warnings were introduced for any content of racist, misogynist or controversial nature, but in 2014 the American Association of University Professors criticized the idea: https://www.aaup.org/report/trigger-warnings

Apart from the political positions on it, however, when it comes to sexual violence there could be a strong case for letting a student know what they are in for. For those who have suffered distress, some descriptions on page or screen can be deeply traumatic. Since earlier generations ignored psychological travails, it does not follow that the readers should not be told beforehand now.
