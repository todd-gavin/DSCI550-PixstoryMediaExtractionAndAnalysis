How important is a language? In interviews? For connection? In life? 
Language is never of utmost importance, but giving importance to language is utmost. Posting this on the occasion of "Hindi Diwas", remembering the times I used to be a top kid in Hindi but left it due to its little or no importance in the current world.
शुभ हिन्दी दिवस :)
