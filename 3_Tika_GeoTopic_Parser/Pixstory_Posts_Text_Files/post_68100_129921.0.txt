Today the North East United Football Club will look for redemption against host Army Green at the Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium, Sarusajai in Guwahati.

Earlier NEUFC were humbled 6-0 by a strong Odisha FC in their first group D match on August 17th and they do well to shrug that off mentally and believe that they can come back to winning ways against an Army Green side with plenty of new faces from last year.
