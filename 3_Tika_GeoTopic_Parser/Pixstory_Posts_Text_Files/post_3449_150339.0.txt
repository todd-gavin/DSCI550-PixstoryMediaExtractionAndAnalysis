It all started when Delhi Police arrested prominent Indian player S. Sreesanth, Ankeet Chavan and Ajit Chandila on the allegation of spot-fixing in the IPL. This was the first time in the country that players were put behind bars. As the inquiry advanced several other shocking revelations came to light and the matter reached Supreme Court,. BB Misra, the then head of the narcotics bureau was appointed by the Court to investigate the players and board members. Misra got in touch with many journalists to get leads about different developments and the people involved. He reached out to me too and there were certain intriguing details and inside stories that I got to know of.He narrowed down his probe to one of the top players of the Indian Cricket team. Misra arranged for a meeting between the player and a bookie who had named the player being on his take. The meeting never took place as the bookie withdrew at the last moment and Misra's plan to confront them together had failed. Since Misra had limited time to complete his findings, he could not conclude his probe. However, he did mention in his report that only further investigation against the player can prove whether that player is involved in fixing or not.Among the many fall outs of that betting scandal was the exit of .N Srinivasan, who had to step down as Board president as his son-in-law was charged with betting on his own team, the Chennai Super Kings. i detail in my book several such incidents, giving new details and fresh perspective to them.
