The author notes in the book that I am invisible simply because people refuse to see me- which takes the book into showcasing levels of racism.

‌Invisible Man is a novel by Ralph Ellison. It deals with many of the social and intellectual issues faced by African Americans in the early twentieth century, including black nationalism, the connection between black identity and Marxism, and the reformist racial policies of Booker T. Washington, as well as questions of individuality and personal identity.
‌
‌The novel is very deep and deals with several political issues. The author is named as it could stand for black American representation. It talks about many issues including how easily African Americans are labelled as mad. It also talks about how single-faced ideologies cause trauma and nothing more. 
‌
‌Invisible Man won the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction in 1953, making Ellison the first African American writer to win the award.
‌
‌Time magazine included the novel in its 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005 list, calling it "the quintessential American picaresque of the 20th century," rather than a "race novel, or even a bildungsroman."
‌
‌In 1998, the Modern Library ranked Invisible Man 19th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.
‌
‌ Malcolm Bradbury and Richard Ruland recognize an existential vision with a "Kafka-like absurdity."  According to The New York Times, Barack Obama modelled his 1995 memoir Dreams from My Father on Ellison's novel.
‌
‌Critic Orville Prescott of The New York Times called the novel "the most impressive work of fiction by an American Negro which I have ever read," and felt it underlined "the appearance of a richly talented writer. Novelist Saul Bellow in his review found it "a book of the very first order, a superb book...it is tragi-comic, poetic, the tone of the very strongest sort of creative intelligence." George Mayberry of The New Republic said Ellison "is a master at catching the shape, flavour and sound of the common vagaries of human character and experience."
