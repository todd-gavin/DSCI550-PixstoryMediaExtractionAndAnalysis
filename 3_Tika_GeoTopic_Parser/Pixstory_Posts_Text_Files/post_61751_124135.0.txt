Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, David Robinson, Scottie Pippen, John Stockton, Karl Malone, Clyde Drexler, Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkley are some of the greatest players in NBA history.

The one thing they all share in common, besides being in the Hall of Fame, is that they won the gold medal in the 1992 Olympics for the United States of America.

On this day in 1992, USA defeated Croatia 177-85 in the gold medal game at the 1992 Olympics, forever immortalizing themselves as the “Dream Team.”

The main reason why the Dream Team is such a big deal, besides the fact that they won a gold medal in the Olympics and were comprised of some of the best basketball players in the world, is because they were the first USA Olympic Men’s Basketball Team featuring NBA talents.

Prior to 1992, professional athletes in all sports were not allowed to partake in the Olympics Games due to the reason that this competition between countries around the world was supposed to happen with “amateur” athletes.
