We’re finally getting back to normal and I am here for it. The spirit of Boston Marathon is back! 

Unicorn costumes were worn by several of the attendees. Music is being played by bands. Trampolines are used by children to jump. And the most deafening Wellesley scream tunnel anyone can recall. 

US News reported that for the first time since 2019, the Boston Marathon had a full field and was held in the spring, and fans along the course threw a coming-out party for an area still recuperating from the COVID-19 pandemic. 

“We were so glad that we were able to do it,” Boston Athletic Association President Tom Grilk said Tuesday, a day after Evans Chebet and Olympic champion Peres Jepchirchir broke the tape on Boylston Street. “It was Boston at its finest.”

The world's oldest and most renowned annual 26.2-mile race returned to its customary Patriots' Day slot in the schedule six months after its delayed, then cancelled, then delayed again 125th edition — and the mood was back as well. 

Crowds lined the route from Hopkinton to Boston's Back Bay, which passed through eight cities and towns. 

The scenes were as beautiful as they get! Edna Kiplagat, the 2017 champion, gave a high-five to one of the boys. To obtain the finest view, some kids blew bubbles and sat on their parents' shoulders. There was dancing, music, and drummers. 

One man encouraged the female leaders by chasing them around with a big cutout of Will Smith's head. The students at Wellesley College continued up the "scream tunnel" practise that had been reduced six months previously by masks near the halfway point.
