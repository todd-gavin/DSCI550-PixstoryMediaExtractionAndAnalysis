Fulham FC announced the arrival of Benfica player, Carlos Vinicius on a three year deal. The cottagers will have to pay £5m for the striker as he makes his return to the Premier League. Vinicius was part of the Spurs’ squad in the 2020-21 season on loan from Benfica.
The Brazilian spent the last season too on loan to Dutch side PSV Eindhoven. It was a two year long deal but Benfica chose to cut short that to arrange for his transfer to Craven Cottage. This also means that the Eredivisie team will be entitled to a sizeable sell-on clause and other bonuses if depending on the player’s performances.
Speaking to Fulham's club channels, Vinicius said: “I’m really happy to be here. I think it’s a big club with good people, so I’m really, really happy. I’m happy to be back in the Premier League again. I’m more experienced now and I think I can help the Club.”
The West London club had a busy deadline day, announcing other signings for themselves. PSG left-back Layvin Kurzawa was brought in via a loan deal, whereas the Cottagers also announced the signing of Willian on a free transfer. Further in the last hours of the deadline day, they were also able to secure Daniel James from Leeds on a season long loan deal.
Fulham have made a solid start to the season with 8 points from 5 games. They sit in the top half of the table and this start has enabled them to attract these new signings to the club. Striker Aleksandr Mitrovic is in prolific goal scoring touch, having scored 5 goals already. He only sits behind Erling Haaland in Top Scorer charts.
Manager Marco Silva has already stressed on how important it is for Fulham to develop a healthy squad. He has firm desires on competing at the top level after the Cottagers have had a period of promotion from the Championship followed by immediate relegation in the Premier League.
