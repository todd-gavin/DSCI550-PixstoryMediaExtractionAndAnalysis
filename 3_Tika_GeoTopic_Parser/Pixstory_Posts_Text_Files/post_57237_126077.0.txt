Opting in to use online services is always accompanied by a certain level of risk. Today, it's nearly impossible to use an online service without sharing one's personal information or data.
 So it's not surprising that 64% of people globally stated that they accept certain risks to their online privacy to make their lives more convenient, while 79% of people agreed that consumers had lost all control over how their personal information is collected and used by companies.

Besides all this, what we can do to safeguard our privacy is less, but still, these steps can be taken to bring a little change. 

Commit to sharing less online.

Use strong, unique passwords and two-factor authentication.

Tighten privacy settings for your online accounts.

Purge unused mobile apps and browser extensions.

Block search engines from tracking you.

Browse online with a secure VPN.

Don't ignore software updates.

Disable ad and data tracking.

Use encryption to keep data from prying eyes.

Revoke unnecessary 3rd party app connections.
