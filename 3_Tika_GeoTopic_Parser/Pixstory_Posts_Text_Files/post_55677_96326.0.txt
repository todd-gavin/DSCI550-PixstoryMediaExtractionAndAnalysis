Australia and the United Kingdom have a long history of military cooperation. The military partnership has developed dramatically in response to the advent of non-state players in the Middle East, a powerful military threat in the form of China, and a more polarised world order. 

Eurasian Times reported that due to a shortage of British Royal Air Force manpower and worries about the stress of piloting lethal unmanned aircraft, Australian Air Force pilots and private contractors were reportedly recruited to help operate UK armed Reaper drones over Syria and Iraq in the fall of 2020.

According to ABC News, Australia's Department of Defense has revealed for the first time that Australian pilots had been deployed to the United Kingdom on a "covert mission" to remotely fly British armed drones, including destructive missions over the Middle East. 

In answer to a Freedom of Information request, the department reported that 32 ADF members are now embedded with "unmanned aerial system units" in the United Kingdom, with one operating in the United States. The nature of their deployment, on the other hand, is uncertain. 

According to the IPA, RAAF pilot recruitment was supporting the RAF in overcoming a personnel shortage blamed on the psychological stress of flying risky unmanned aircraft by military observers.
