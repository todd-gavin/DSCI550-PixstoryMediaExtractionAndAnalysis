Lazio president Claudio Lotito has returned to talk about the protests against him by the Biancocelesti fans. For me it&#39;s a mystery. The truth is that transparent management eliminates certain privileges. so now instead of highlighting what we do they are all trying to demolish it I remain convinced that sporting and economic results can be combined I want to spend not squander Lotito continues like this Lazio for years was a cash cow where everyone demanded I have turned off the taps I have become an enemy to put down I have tried without hesitation to enforce the rules for everyone and will continue to implement every action aimed at preventing and repressing illegitimate behavior Clearly the artificially false or one-way news spread almost every day they don&#39;t help The last example Sarri&#39;s contract everyone questions him to row against Instead the signed contract Final comment on Lazio&#39;s goals For the future the only thing missing is the Scudetto but we&#39;re working on it Money isn&#39;t everything We won with many ideas trophies including a super cup against Mourinho&#39;s heavily armored Inter Now winning the championship is not a dream but a goal
