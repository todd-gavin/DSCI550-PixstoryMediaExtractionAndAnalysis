After all, the host nation of Qatar is scheduled to take the field in the opening match of its own World Cup event, and only 100 days before the tournament begins, as US News reported.

It was further reported that the speaker requested anonymity because they were not permitted to speak about the situation.

The suggestion will be presented to a committee made up of Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, and the executives of the six continental soccer associations, the source said. This week, a decision is anticipated.
