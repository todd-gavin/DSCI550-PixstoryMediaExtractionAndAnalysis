You re not crazy if you hear Daniel Caesar s Best Part and feel a sudden urge to fall in love While some songs stimulate greater feelings than others the scientific tie between music and emotions such as love is very real Hearing music produces a litany of internal neurological processes unlocking various emotional experiences Music produces not only hormonal effects but physical effects as well Those chills you may get when listening to a great song are the result of your brain s reaction to the song Music doesn t stimulate lovey dovey feelings in everyone but there is evidence that it can It has power beyond what we can see So next time a song brings you a desire to find the one don t fret It s natural
