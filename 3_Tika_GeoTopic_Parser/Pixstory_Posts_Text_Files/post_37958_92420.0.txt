 Wayne Rooney had commented about Cristiano Ronaldo and Pogba on Monday Night Football. The Derby County manager had suggested that Cristiano Ronaldo is no longer at the top of his game at 37. Rooney had even claimed that Cristiano Ronaldo lacks the hunger of a youngster.

Hence Wayne Rooney had asked Manchester United to let go of Cristiano Ronaldo in the summer and focus on the youngster. These comments had picked up a lot of heat and they seem to have reached the Portuguese icon as well! 

Cristiano Ronaldo seems to have replied to these statements through a comment on Instagram. And this comment has since garnered a lot of interest from the football fraternity. 

Wayne Rooney had posted a picture with David Jones, and James Carragher from the Monday Night Football studio on Instagram. Cristiano Ronaldo has left a comment on this post saying "Two Jealous" now. 

It is not known if this was an inside joke between the two players or if it was a reply to Wayne Rooney's comments. But it certainly looks like Cristiano Ronaldo didn't enjoy what his former Manchester United partner had said. 

 

Should Ronaldo continue with United? 


Cristiano Ronaldo is certainly not the player that he was 10-15 years back. The Portuguese international has transitioned into a striker from a winger. But this certainly does not mean that he is not capable of playing for Manchester United anymore.

With 18 goals in 32 games in all competitions, Cristiano Ronaldo is the top scorer of Manchester United this season. His low numbers are also based on the fact that the Red Devils have failed to create many chances this season. Hence we believe that the 37-year-old can still play at the top level but he would require better service to help his club in the best way.
