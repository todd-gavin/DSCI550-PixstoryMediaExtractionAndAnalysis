In a season where Manchester United have struggled on all fronts, it is Cristiano Ronaldo who has stood out with his magnificent performances for the Red Devils. Often regarded as the problem by a few pundits, the Portuguese striker has already managed to score 23 goals this season, becoming Manchester United’s top goal-scorer by a huge mile. In fact, all eight of the club’s last goals have been scored by the veteran striker.

Erik ten Hag has been confirmed to take charge at Old Trafford from next season, as Ralf Rangnick ends his tenure as the Interim Manager. Cristiano Ronaldo made a grand return to Old Trafford on a two-year contract, which runs out in the summer of 2023. However, with Manchester United certainly out of the top four race, and unclarity regarding the new manager’s tactics, Ronaldo’s future hangs in the balance.
Speaking after the 1-1 draw with Chelsea on Thursday evening, Ralf Rangnick has commented on Cristiano Ronaldo’s future at the club. The German has stated that he will have a word with all parties involved, once the season gets over. Hence, he believes there is no point in having a discussion now, given that there are three games still remaining in the season.

"We will have to speak about it between us; with Erik [ten Hag], myself and the board," said Rangnick, as quoted by ESPN.
"Cristiano has another year of contract and it's also important to see and find out what Cristiano wants to do and see if he wants to stay. I haven't been able to speak with Erik so far and it doesn't make sense to speak about it [Ronaldo' future] right now,” the German manager added.

However, Ralf Rangnick has revealed that the focus will be on bringing a few more strikers this summer. "There has to be a focus on bringing in a couple of new strikers, this is for sure," he continued. He also lavished praise on Cristiano Ronaldo’s exploits this season, stating that he can be a big help to the team in the next season.
