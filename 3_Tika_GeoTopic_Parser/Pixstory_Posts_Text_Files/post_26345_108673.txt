The collection is centered on the concept of simplicity as a choice and represents one of the fashion and trend ideas that interest us. According to Miuccia and Raf, the intention was to design clothes that people could actually wear but that had an impact. The location was completely different from those to which we had become accustomed Large white spaces divided by paper walls from which stylized windows open, curtains also in gingham print paper and cardboard seats The show opens with some simple black suits, indeed very simple, with a clean cut the unmistakable signature of Raf Simons Then the turn of some tight-fitting tank tops and leather shorts or rather Tyrolean lederhosen fetish clothing from Miuccia&#39;s childhood The collection continues by merging the two elements the shorts are combined with checkered shirts or typically pradesque dusters to then finish with total denim look with an American flavor The two souls, the two styles and the stories of the two creatives blend perfectly in one of the perhaps less surprising but more intellectual and successful collections since the beginning of the collaboration between the two geniuses Ph Filippo Fior
