The journey of our lives begins with school.
Most children start attending school at 4 or 5, which is a very tender age to learn and explore.
And as far as concrete skills and learning are required, it all happens at school.
The methods of teaching may vary, but the aim is never compromised.
If we start looking at the pros and cons of everything, there would be so much to talk about; the same is valid with the school argument.
Calling schools inappropriate, useless or waste is not done.
It is essential to understand that other than distributing knowledge, they help to shape every individual by providing them with a space for critical and analytical thinking.
Also, the point which remains unseen is the efforts of teachers.
Calling school waste is akin to calling teachers waste.
This, in every way, disrespects their profession, but the amount of hard work and effort they put into shaping a child's future is ineffable.
They help students form social skills and understand the difference between right and wrong.
If said the other way, the teacher is a second parent to a child instead, a first parent because most of the parents are so equipped in their work that they are only left with the option of leaving their child in school.
There are many aspects and roles of a school, and we can't just go on blindly saying everything that doesn't justify the idea.
