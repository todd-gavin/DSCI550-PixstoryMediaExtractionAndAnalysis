The older we grow, the more we see our bodies change in ways we thought was never possible. 

I like to think of it as the story of the knight in shining armour. When the knight was a young boy, full of life and joy, he would parade around on his high horse with his new armour glinting in the sun. He loved it when people called him the knight in shining armour because it dazzled them as much as it dazzled the young boy who wore it. 

But as he grew older... And went to wars and had to cut down enemy after enemy to barely stay alive, he realized that his armour wasn't shining anymore. It was battered and dented in places the foes had struck him, caked in dirt and blood. Rusted in the rain. He realized he was getting bigger and stronger and the armour didn't fit him all that much anymore. 

Our bodies are like that. They grow older and lose their shine. But they change the way we change as human beings. They grow harder, with better reflexes and muscle memory. 

You will not always feel your best, but that shouldn't stop you from being the best version of yourself. Take care of yourself, cut off the bad habits that you know you should. Because deep down you know your body is your home. It's the armour you live in... And there is no reason to look in the mirror and not love what you see.
