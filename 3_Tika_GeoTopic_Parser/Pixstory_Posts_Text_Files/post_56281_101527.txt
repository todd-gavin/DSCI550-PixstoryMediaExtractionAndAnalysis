The biggest ongoing roster question surrounding the Los Angeles Lakers this offseason involves the future of point guard Russell Westbrook Ever since the Lakers season ended it seemed as if it was a foregone conclusion that the team would part ways with Westbrook one way or another But recent reports have called that into question as the Lakers apparently have been asking potential coaches in interviews how they would utilize Westbrook within their system This led to many wondering if the Lakers planned on keeping Westbrook around and Phil Jackson s reported favorable view of Westbrook only furthered that belief But it sounds as if the Lakers would still prefer to rid themselves of Westbrook this offseason In NBA insider Marc Stein s last Substack he says that while the Lakers won t rule out the idea of Westbrook staying with the team the preference is still to move on from him in some form or fashion That fresh start is extremely important for a Lakers team looking to return to its former glory from just a couple of seasons ago LeBron James and Anthony Davis have proven they can lead this team to a championship but the Westbrook piece just didn t fit the way anyone hoped The difficult part for the Lakers is finding a trade that will allow them to deal Westbrook without having to give up one of those future picks they greatly desire The team is still giving away picks from the Davis trade and losing another just to get rid of Westbrook is not ideal This offseason will be one of the most important in recent Lakers history and making the right decisions on a number of issues will shape how the franchise looks in the years to come
