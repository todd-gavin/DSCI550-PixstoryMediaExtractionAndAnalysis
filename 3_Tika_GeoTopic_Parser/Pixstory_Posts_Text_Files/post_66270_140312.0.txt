In case you're living under a rock, let me give you the news that the whole world knows by now. 
The last colonial monarch Queen Elizabeth II passed away last night, and the twitter has had a field day with it. 
While most of the users have had fun at the expense of the Royal Family's loss, there were some "The Crown" stans who were worried about the future of the show. 
While it was a popular theory that "The Crown" would end the show by around the 2000s period, now the writers would have to stretch it by a couple of seasons to make sure that they show the Queen's death as a part of the show. 
Twitter users were making fun of the writers saying that they'll now have to slave away on more seasons!
