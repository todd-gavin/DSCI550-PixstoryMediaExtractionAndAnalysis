Ah Halloween. Isn't it the most fun time in all the year. Kids and grownups alike indulge in myths, lores and fictions to dress up as and get into character as😁
Sometimes you go out and buy costumes and sometimes they're homemade 😄
I do appreciate the pun in this one specially😂🤭
Parents have their own fun with it too😂
