As the International Community is trying to avert the collapse of Afghanistanâ€™s economic and social collapse by Injecting money, $32 million in cash arrived in Kabul on Sunday, January 23, 2022.

In a statement, Afghanistan Central Bank-Da Afghanistan Bank announced that the money had arrived in Kabul and was transferred to Afghanistan International Bank, AIB.

The money is part of the process that the United Nations has pledged to be going on until March 2022.

The amount of cash planned to be conducted every week is good timing as Afghanistan desperately needs money to prevent the collapse of the banking system.

The international community has provided Afghanistan $200 million worth of humanitarian assistance in the past two months.

The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has welcomed aid and support from the International Community. Still, it has constantly reiterated that the world should flourish its economy so that they work and survive.
