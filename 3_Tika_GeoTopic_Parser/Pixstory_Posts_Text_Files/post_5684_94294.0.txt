The time of Fajar at Jama Masjid. Fajar Namaz is performed at the time of Twilight before the second dawn.

Thousands of worshippers gather every night before sunrise at Jama Masjid to pray Fajar throughout Ramzaan.

During the holy month, the Grand Mosque is illuminated throughout the night, that is one of the most beautiful sights.

People start gathering around 3:30 in the morning, some families are sitting on the grounds. Children are seen playing in the outer area of the mosque. There are hundreds of people doing ‘Wudu’, at the Hauz inside the Masjid.

The time of Fajar at Jama Masjid during Ramzan is relaxing and soothing. There is just something about the air, that makes it a tranquil experience.
