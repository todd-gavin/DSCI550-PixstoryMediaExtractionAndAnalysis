India's own UV manufacturer, Mahindra & Mahindra, is in the midst of a launch frenzy. Mahindra has recently debuted the new 2022 Mahindra Scorpio-N in India after presenting the XUV700 and new Thar. In India, the three goods are all doing incredibly well. While Thar and the Scorpio-N, which Mahindra just debuted, are still taking reservations, the XUV700 has a 2-year waiting list, and the situation with the Scorpio-N is similar for Thar. The three goods, each under Rs 15 lakh in price, have already established themselves.

Mahindra recorded a solid YoY gain in June 2022 sales thanks to a strong SUV range. From 16,636 units in June 2021 to 26,640 units in June 2022, the dealer dispatches saw an increase of 60%. While it's somewhat true that the XUV700 and Thar were the automaker's growth drivers, Mahindra Bolero actually drives sales and, surprise, is still the most popular Mahindra vehicle in India.

Despite newer products making headway in a cutthroat market like India, Mahindra's top-selling SUV Bolero had an increase of 37% over the previous year. In comparison to the 5,744 Bolero cars sold in June 2021, Mahindra sold a respectable 7,884 Bolero in India in June 2022. Thirty percent of all Mahindra sales in India come from the Bolero.
