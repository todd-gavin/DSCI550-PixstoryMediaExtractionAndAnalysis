Even before the US was founded Native Americans were a part of American culture The surrounding tribes however have largely disappeared as a result of centuries of persecution and many have assimilated into contemporary culture However those who are still in touch with their culture will recall these incidents and desire that they be remembered The purpose of Native American Day is to alter how people perceive Native Americans Native American Day honours Native Americans as the name suggests They are believed to have been the first Americans to settle in and live in the country Before the first European explorers and immigrants arrived North Americans had already colonised the entire North American continent This covered the entire length of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans as well as the northernmost parts of Canada and the Gulf of Mexico There should be a day set aside to recognise Native Americans because they have obviously had a significant impact on American history Source DOY
