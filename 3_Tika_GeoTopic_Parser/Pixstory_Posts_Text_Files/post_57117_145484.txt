It s absolutely true taking criticism can be a difficult thing but the world of art is solely dependent on the opinions and reviews that even validate works and at times prick them to become better Living in a world where most minds are so opinionated we need to accept certain thoughts and ideas that would affect our work positively Instead of developing a conflicting sight of criticism it is necessary to admire and appreciate it Working relentlessly without accepting feedback would not justify your work How easier would it be to keep working without finding flaws in your work No doubt very easy but it is harmful whether you re selling or performing whether it s a product or service listening and acting on those honest views will tell you precisely what s good and what can be done better It can sometimes be unbearable but using the ideas to change your performance will strengthen it Moreover work should be done to create a better understanding of criticism realising that what is being said is not aiming to silence your work but instead is focused on your betterment If you find the fine line between this criticism will never negatively affect you
