Rafael Nadal writes another page of his legend and he does so by overcoming the American Taylor Fritz in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon after a battle of five sets and more than hours of fighting After losing the first set on the second Nadal feels discomfort in his abs and against the advice of his father who waves his arms from the stands to signal him to retire returns to the locker room and comes out stronger and more focused He will win the second set then again the third set will be the prerogative of Fritz and again one for Nadal In the fifth and decisive set Nadal wins the super tie break with a peremptory and earns a very difficult semifinal against the new Nick Kyrgios who knocked out the Chilean Garin in three sets
