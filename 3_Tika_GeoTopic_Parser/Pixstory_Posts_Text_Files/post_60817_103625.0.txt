Hey everyone! I'm Suhaani
One word to describe me is music. Singing has been a part of my life since my childhood, I'm someone who is always up for jamming sessions. I look forward to getting to know different people everyday. Mountains feel like a happy place. All i need is my guitar, hills and good food. I might be cranky sometimes, but a good pizza always does the trick. 

Really excited for the pixstory journey!
