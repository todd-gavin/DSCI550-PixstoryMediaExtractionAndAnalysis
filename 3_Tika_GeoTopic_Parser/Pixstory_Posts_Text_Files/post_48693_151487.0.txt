Indonesia football tragedy is the world's '2nd deadliest stadium disaster' with at least 129 killed (after Peru, 1964).
Law enforcement used aggressive conflict resolution techniques, including the use of tear gas and physical assault with the fans came to watch the match. This just qualifies as police brutality.
There was no point of using teargas, and the results are just here — obvious and in the open. So many families broken, so many lives lost and so many traumatized. Not only was it an aggressive way of approaching a restless crowd but it's also dodging the responsibility of people's security by the law enforcement. 
How many more lives will police brutality take?
