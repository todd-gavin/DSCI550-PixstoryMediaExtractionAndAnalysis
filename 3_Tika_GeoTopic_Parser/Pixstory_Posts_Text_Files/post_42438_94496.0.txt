Harshvardhan Kapoor and his father Anil Kapoor are coming together for a film named “Thar” and today they released the trailer of the movie and watching the trailer, one thing I want to say that, that the trailer is looking amazing and the movie is giving fresh vibes to the audience.

After watching the trailer, I understand a few things about the trailer which are as follows:-

1. This movie will be a murder mystery for sure.

2. Anil Kapoor and Satish Kaushik are playing the role of cops and will be solving the murder mystery.

3.Harshvardhan Kapoor is playing a role of a guy who is fond of collecting antiques but somehow, he is the main suspect in the murder.

4. Thumbs up to the director of the movie, who didn’t reveal what’s the main conflict and who got killed.

Thar is releasing on 6th May 2022 and you can watch it on Netflix. I am eagerly waiting for this movie.
