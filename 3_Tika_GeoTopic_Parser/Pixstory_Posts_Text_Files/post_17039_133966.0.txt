In a recent interview, Alia Bhatt had spoken about nepotism, trolling and more and stated that 'If you don't like me, don't watch me'. This led to massive social media trolling and its effects are being witnessed on Brahmastra. Once again, Boycott Brahmastra is trending on social media.

On Twitter, many are calling for the Boycott of the film starring Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor that is directed by Ayan Mukerji. The trend comes after Alia Bhatt's fans tried to do some damage control by trending We Love Alia Bhatt on Twitter. It appears that two contrasting opinions are clashing on Twitter over Alia Bhatt and Brahmastra and it is all over entertainment news.
