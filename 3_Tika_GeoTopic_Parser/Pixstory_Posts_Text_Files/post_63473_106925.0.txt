Newly-arrived Manchester United Manager Erik Ten Hag has made clear his intention to offer Anthony Martial a shirt at the club provided he impresses during the summer preseason.

The 26-year-old forward has been erratic in form since his arrival at Old Trafford 7 years ago as flashes of brilliance from the French international has been too few and far between over the years. This culminated during his disastrous campaign last season as he battled for fitness due to injury and struggled for game time in both Manchester United and his loaned club Sevilla. 

The striker only managed to rack up a combined 2 goals in the just concluded season having spent the second half of the season on loan at Sevilla. Recovering from injury, Martial has however expressed his wish to be handed a chance to prove himself at Manchester United next season. 

Martial has been heavily linked with a move away from the Red Devils following his poor stint at the club but reports from The Athletic has now suggested that United boss Erik Ten Hag intends to look closely to Martial in preseason. 

This implies a possibility of the striker being retained at the club against the upcoming campaign should he put up an eye-catching performance at the preseason. 

Manchester United preseason preparation will begin when they face league rival Liverpool on the 12th July in Bangkok, Thailand. The tour will then continue for the following two weeks in different cities including Melbourne, Australia and Oslo, Norway â€” with the latter been the venue where they will take on Athletico Madrid on 30th July as a final preparation before the commencement of the 2022/23 Premier League Season.
