The referee blows the whistle after Benfica’s free-kick is collected by Donnarumma. There are tempers flaring in the middle. The commotion started by an argument between the PSG keeper and a Benfica player. Neymar gets involved too. Slightly frustrating for PSG as it had chances and possession to take three points home. Benfica too was in the confident and was denied a win only because of some splendid saves by Donnarumma. The two take one point from the game and now have seven points from three matches. Both teams are still the prime contenders to make it to the knockouts even after Juventus beat Maccabi Haifa 3-1 in the other Group H match. That’s it from this match. See you for game week four of the Champions League group stage next week.PSG wins a corner from an Mbappe attack. The set-piece is cleared but Fabian Ruiz tries a long-range effort which goes flying over the goalpost.
