Why I chose to study nutrition.

Food is the language of love, both in its making and it’s core existence. The make, bake and everything in between. 

Science behind food is so complex and interesting, that it’s the job of the nutritionist & dietician’s to simplify it for the greater public.

Food and nutrition involved not only the study of chemistry between the molecules or the techniques involved in cooking different varieties. It also includes culture, emotions and  geography. 

People choose to express themselves in the kind of food they like or make, which speaks volumes in itself.

And as we all know, for the survival of the fittest, food will never get out of fashion.
