The art Cost recognizes the mutual purpose of cooperatives since it is one of the most important historical experiences in fact the republic recognizes the social function of cooperation in the nature of mutuality What does it mean It means that several members come together in a common body to pursue a certain common purpose They they were the first experiences of trade union association workers&#39; cooperatives date back to the end of they are experiences that date back to the beginning of the industrial revolution and even perform very important functions the first protections in the field of accidents of occupational diseases against dismissal date back to spontaneous initiatives by workers which from a legal point of view coalesced in the form of a cooperative Numerous cooperatives today pursue the mutual aim, i.e. to distribute job opportunities called work cooperatives In this case the mutual aim therefore the objective of the cooperative company is to distribute job opportunities work How does it relate to the regulations of the cooperative society with that of subordinate work In subordinate work the cause in the contract consists in the exchange between service and salary the contract of subordinate work for consideration and corresponding benefits In work in cooperatives instead the cause is not exactly that of subordinate work because the member, carrying out his own activity, participates in the common purpose of the cooperative company instead of conferring goods and money, participates in the purpose of the cooperative through his own activity, therefore the mutual cause is no longer the exchange of performance vs remuneration.
