This honestly hurts my heart to watch this movie. 
I love these books so much and The Scorch Trials movie was so far off from the book I had to pause it many times just to scream in a pillow. 
The whole beginning to the 2nd book and how they entered the scorch trials was completely different compared to the movies, the book had a much better storyline in my opinion. 
The scary parts and eeriness of the book was one of my favorite parts, and they had close to none of that in the second movie. 
Like the scary creatures in the end right before they are ‘saved’ and the killer metal balls while going through the underground tunnel, and lastly they completely changed the way Teresa was supposed to betray Thomas in the first place with Aris. 
If you haven’t read the books, I definitely think you should watch the movies because I used to love these movies! 
But if you have read the books I wouldn’t get your hopes up and make sure to bring a pillow to scream in if you do watch it, cause your gonna need it!
