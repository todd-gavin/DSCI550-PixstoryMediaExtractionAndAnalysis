Brief History Of National Games:
Before India gained independence in 1924, the inaugural Indian Olympic Games were held in Lahore. Three successive years of the Indian Olympic games were held in Lahore.
The National Games were given their current name for the eighth edition, which was held in Kolkata in 1938.
The first National Games after Independence were hosted in Lucknow, but the first (modern) National Games were modelled after the Olympics in New Delhi in 1985.
The national competitions showcase and recognise India's rising sporting potential. The National Games give athletes from many states the chance to compete against one another in the games' many sports-related categories.
