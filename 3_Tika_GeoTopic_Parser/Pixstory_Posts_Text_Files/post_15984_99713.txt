Maritde Jong Sanne A E Peter Abstract Aims Diabetes has been associated with a greater excess risk of cardiovascular disease CVD in women than men We investigated whether there are also sex differences in the association of diabetes duration and the risk of CVD Methods Data were used from women individuals with type diabetes without a history of CVD in the UK Biobank Sex specific incidence rates were calculated by diabetes duration Cox proportional hazards analyses estimated multiple adjusted sex specific hazard ratios HR and women to men ratio of HRs RHR Results Over a median follow up of years women CVD events were documented Compared with men women had lower multiple adjusted incidence rates of CVD per person years for all categories of diabetes duration Duration of diabetes was associated with an increased risk of CVD in both sexes A year increase in diabetes duration was associated with an approximately similar excess risk of about for each of the three endpoints in both sexes Conclusions Interpretation The increased risk of CVD associated with longer duration of diabetes is similar in women and men and thus cannot explain the higher excess risk from diabetes in women in this study population Sources
