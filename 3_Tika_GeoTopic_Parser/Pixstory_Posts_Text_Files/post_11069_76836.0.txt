Foreign funds donated to Indian NGOs fell 87% over two years, from Rs 16,490 crore in 2018-19 to Rs 2,190 crore in 2019-20, as the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi tightened an already opaque law, which has disallowed foreign donations to more than 16,000 such organisations. As the income of the poorest 20% of Indian households halved since 2016—the first such decline in 31 years—we report how the government is criminalising thousands of NGOs and hindering assistance to its poorest during a pandemic.

Even as the third wave of Covid-19 unfolded, nearly 6,000 Indian non-governmental organisations (NGOs)—many of whom perform critical relief work that the government cannot or will not—were on 1 January 2022 barred from receiving funds from foreign sources. 

Nonprofits are starved of funds at a time when the poorest 20% of Indian households—who had not witnessed an income decline in 35 years since 1995—experienced a halving of income in 2021 compared to 2016, the Indian Express reported on 24 January 2022, quoting the latest data from the People’s Research on India’s Consumer Economy (PRICE), a Mumbai-based think tank.

The new year brought uncertainty and panic to nonprofits, as the ministry of home affairs refused to renew licenses under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) 2010, the law that regulates how nonprofits in India receive and use foreign funding.
 
The decision has come in the aftermath of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2020, which amended the FCRA in September 2020 and provided for stricter requirements and regulations for NGOs to receive foreign donations.

These restrictions, claimed to enhance “transparency”, as the government put it, are quite the opposite in effect: either vaguely worded or minutely specific and allow officials greater subjective interpretation and opacity. 

They include a ban on transferring foreign funds from one NGO to another; lowering the ceiling on use of such funds for “administrative expenses” without specifying the definition of the term; introducing other undefined terms allowing subjective interpretation by government; and requiring NGOs to receive foreign donations only through one branch of a state-run bank.
