"I'm Nobody! Who are you?" is a short lyric poem by Emily Dickinson first published posthumously in 1891 in Poems, Series 2. It is one of Dickinson's most popular poems.
The speaker in the poem introduces herself as nobody, and later provides reasons for her ironic statement. To her, publicity and fame bring challenges to a person longing for them.

I'm Nobody! Who are you?
Are you – Nobody – too?
Then there's a pair of us!
Don't tell! they'd advertise – you know!

How dreary – to be – Somebody!
How public – like a Frog –
To tell one's name – the livelong June –
To an admiring Bog!
