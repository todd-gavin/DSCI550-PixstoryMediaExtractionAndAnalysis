Things started taking slight turn towards the brighter part of their journey when recently they decided to bring back one of their very own and legendary defender Paolo Maldini, to the club. This time in the administration role, where he put his head down like he did as a player and began working to take his club back to the top. New owners came in, who helped in the market where they got smart picks and kept building on with the momentum.

Only a year ago, AC Milan found themselves back in Europe's elite competition but the return was not they expected as they bowed out in the group phase finishing last which turned into a blessing in disguise for Pioli and his men decided to stay focused and perform in the league where they find themselves right at the top and only a point away from winning a major trophy (league) after 11 years. The sleeping giant was finally awake and it couldn't be any sweeter and it couldn't come any sooner for the Rossoneri who would most certainly wish for this to continue for years and years to come. AC Milan were right back on the radar among the best, now it is upto them to hold onto that and keep delivering for the club, it's faithful and most importantly for the football world. It needs stories like these and clubs like these.
