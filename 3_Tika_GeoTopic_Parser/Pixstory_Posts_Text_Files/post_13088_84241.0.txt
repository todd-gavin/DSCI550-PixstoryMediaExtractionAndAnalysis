An American journalist's description of Ukraine as a civilized country, unlike in Iraq and Afghanistan, angered and apologized to many social media users.

CBS correspondent Charlie Dagata in Kiev said Ukraine was not like Iraq and Afghanistan, which had been in crisis for decades, it was relatively civilized.

"Tens of thousands are trying to leave Kiev," the American correspondent told CBS News Live Friday night.

He added: "This (Ukraine) is not a place like Iraq and Afghanistan that has been in crisis for decades. "No one expected such a situation."
Some social media users say that the American journalist not only insulted the people of countries like Afghanistan and Iraq (which the United States invaded) and called them uncivilized, but also insulted Ukraine, which called the country "relatively civilized" and He called it "relatively European."

At the end of a three-minute live interview about the current situation in Kiev, Mr. Degata apologized for not being careful in his choice of words and phrases the following night (Saturday night) in another news segment on CBS TV.
