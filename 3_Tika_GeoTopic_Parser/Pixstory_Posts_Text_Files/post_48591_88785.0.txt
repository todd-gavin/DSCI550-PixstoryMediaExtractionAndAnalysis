Frazier is a vital figure in the league's 75-year history, just as he is a key figure in the Knicks' 75-year history.

Frazier played in 74 games in his first NBA season, averaging 9.0 points, 4.2 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game. He was named to the All-Rookie First Team. In his second season, he nearly doubled his scoring to 17.5 points per game, with 7.9 assists and 6.2 rebounds, while receiving NBA All-Defensive First Team honours and helping the Knicks to a 54-28 record. New York would still lose in the Eastern Division Finals, no matter how good it had grown.

Frazier truly started to shine in Year 3 of his career.

Frazier made his first of seven straight All-Star selections in 1969-70, averaging 20.9 points, 8.2 assists, and 6.0 rebounds while leading the Knicks to a 60-22 record, good for first place in the East. Frazier, together with Willis Reed, Dick Barnett, Dave DeBusschere, and Bill Bradley, led the New York Knicks to the NBA Finals in 1970, where they faced the Los Angeles Lakers.

With 36 points, 19 assists, and seven rebounds in a winner-take-all Game 7 against a Lakers club that included Elgin Baylor, Wilt Chamberlain, and Jerry West, Frazier led the Knicks to their first-ever NBA title at the age of 25.

From 1969 to 1976, Frazier was one of the league's finest point guards, averaging 21.2 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 6.5 assists per game, appearing in seven All-Star games and earning six All-Defensive First Team honours, four All-NBA First Team selections, and two All-NBA Second Team selections.
