There were 2 gold Mohurs stolen and smuggled from India in 1980s. Mukarram Jah, then Ex Nizam of Hyderabad was interrogated by Australian Customs to ascertain whereabouts of the Mohurs. 
One of the Mohurs, whose photo is in question was 1.100 Kilograms. The other Mohur was 14.6 kg. Imagine!
Since 1988, the missing mohurs were on target of Interpol and CBI because of Being taken illegally from India. 
Now the Mohur whose weight is 1 KG + has been found in Museum in Kuwait. Bought illegally. 
Imagine ruckus created of Nazi illegally acquired assets. But artefacts of ‘poorer’ countries are on lower plane. 
Now that It’s established that the Mohur is in Kuwait, Interpol should seize the Asset. 
Else Govt of India should move International Court of Justice to reclaim the asset on which Kuwait has no right.
After Second World War, much was made over Stolen assets by Nazis.
Imagine the effrontery of Kuwait that they display a stolen item with sheer impunity
