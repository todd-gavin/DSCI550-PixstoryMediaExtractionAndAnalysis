But this end is a beginning of a healthy start of something. 

A source tells ET that Kanye "Ye" West has told Kim Kardashian that he's "going away to get therapy" and has agreed to quit bothering her and cyber bullying her boyfriend, Pete Davidson. 

"For the sake of their kids, Kanye informed Kim he's not going to make any public appearances or incendiary social media posts, and he'll go away somewhere to get better," the person added. At this time, it's unclear whether Kanye is receiving therapy at a facility or not.
