Bonjour!
Myself Harshita, an extroverted loaner residing in Delhi currently pursuing political science honours from Delhi University.
I love to explore new places and meet new people.  I prefer visiting monumental and natural places more than sitting in cafes. I love to anchor and host events as it gives me adrenaline rush. I'm also fond of swimming. I love to cook, act, dance and sing even though I'm not extremely good in doing them all. Though my career choices keep on changing after exploring more and more options but my persistent goal in life is to remain happy and peaceful. 
Thanks for reading!
