The Dunk Something so iconic that a fan even got it tattooed on himself The Knicks led Chicago with less than a minute remaining in the Eastern Conference Finals If they can hold on they ll have a lead over Michael Jordan s Bulls and be two wins away from their first trip in the finals in two decades Off a pick set by Patrick Ewing John Starks drove to his right with the ball in his hands He couldn t see anything but Knicks blue paint One dribble two dribbles for Starks He set off running on both feet only to be met by Bulls centre Horace Grant Starks sped by the defender like a cardboard cut out cocked his left arm back and slammed the ball into the net The Garden faithful were ecstatic and rightfully so The finest dunk in NBA playoff history was just witnessed The jam put an end to the Bulls season and gave the Knicks a series lead Unfortunately for New York it would be the series final victory Jordan s Bulls would come back to win four straight games and sweep Pat Riley s Knicks in the series A month later in Phoenix they won the NBA Finals
