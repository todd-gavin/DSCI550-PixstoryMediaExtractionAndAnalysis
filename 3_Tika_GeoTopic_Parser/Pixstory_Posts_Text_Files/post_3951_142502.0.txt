A sip to this freshly brewed Turkish coffee made me fall in love with this one instantly. That sip where the flavour of coffee gushed to my mouth. I'm not a huge fan of coffee but this one definitely made me fall for it. 
And as one of the Turkish proverbs says "the memory of a cup of coffee lasts for forty years". 
I don't think i could wait for long, and i will return soon to taste on you dear Turkish coffee, you are on my food list when I fly back. 
Thanks for coming to me ❤️. 
Do give it a try when you get a chance
