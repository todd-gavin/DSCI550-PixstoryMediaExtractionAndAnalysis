I chose Juve with the idea of playing more attacking football because the coach was Sarri. He has a great reputation for what he did with Napoli and Chelsea and I thought I had a more similar style to Ajax. Ligt released in an interview with ESPN immediately after his official presentation with Bayern Munich The Dutchman spoke about his experience at Juventus and why he chose to join Juventus left side where he has been deployed many times I think I am better on the center right I feel more comfortable At the beginning at Juve it was difficult to play on the left then in the middle of the season Bonucci and I switched sides We were a good couple we won the Scudetto In the year then I often went back to playing on the left Not that I didn&#39;t want to play it of course but I knew I was safer playing on the right it was still important for my development
