It has been known for years now that most mood disorders start with inﬂammation of the brain which ultimately causes our brain cells to die. This inﬂammatory response starts in our gut. Therefore, a powerful regulator of our mood is anti inﬂammatory omega-3 fatty acid intake. These fatty acids regulate neurotransmission, gene expression, and directly affect neurogenesis and neuronal survival, act as antioxidants and have potent anti-inﬂammatory properties. One of the most powerful tools that I have applied as a clinician is modulating the gut microbiome. The ﬁrst step involves general observation followed by assessment of nutritional status, biochemical markers and food sensitivity tests. Using elimination diets and removing inﬂammatory triggers, building the gut microbiome with probiotics and nutrient supplements have been the most gratifying steps in my approach till date . Something which almost never fails and is too accurate to ignore. Removal of gluten containing grains like wheat, rye and barley along with cross reactive grains like soy, corn and oats has been a game changer. Also, good to note that reintroduction of any of these grains because of cheating or mistakes or any kind of disruption of the microbiome with antibiotics causes a sure shot impact on my patients’ mood proﬁles. A case in point was a brilliant young girl Nina who was prescribed a cocktail of antidepressants that made her almost dysfunctional. She had disrupted sleep cycles - slept during the day and was awake through the night - ultimately having to drop out of college. Her behaviour included regular outbursts, abusive language, violent encounters and impulsive acts. No amount of therapy or counselling was helping her effectively. The family was at their wits' end with rounds of visits to experts including neurologists, psychiatrists and psychologists . They arrived at my centre with a complete sense of helplessness.
