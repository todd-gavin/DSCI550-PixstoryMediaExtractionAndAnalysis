In China s Chang e mission sampled more than a kilogram of Moon rock and soil and brought it back to Earth The samples contain countless tiny beads of glass created when asteroids hit the Moon and splashed out droplets of molten rock around the impact site We have analysed these glass beads and the impact craters near where they were found in great detail Our results published in Science Advances reveal new details about the history of asteroids hitting the Moon over the past billion years In particular we found traces of several waves of impacts occurring at the same times as impacts on Earth including the Chicxulub impact million years ago that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs Billions of years of space rocksThe destructive power of meteorite impacts has been seen throughout human history Recently notable event from the spectacular Chelyabinsk meteor that injured hundreds of people was a relatively minor occurrence compared to historical impacts Impacts of various scales have happened throughout Earth s long geological history Only about impact craters have been found around the world because erosion and geological activity are constantly modifying our planet s surface and erasing evidence of past impacts On the Moon where impact craters don t go away several hundred million are recognisable It is not difficult to imagine Earth experienced a similar staggering barrage of projectiles early in its life As the Solar System evolved over the last billions of years the number of asteroids declined exponentially over time as space rocks were swept up by Earth and the other planets However the details of this process remain murky Was there a smooth decay over time in the number of impacts on Earth Moon and other planets in the Solar System Are there periods when collisions became more frequent against this general background of decline Is there a possibility that collisions may suddenly increase in the future Read more
