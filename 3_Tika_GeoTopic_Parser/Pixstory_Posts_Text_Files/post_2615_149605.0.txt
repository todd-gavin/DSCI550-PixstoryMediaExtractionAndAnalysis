Britain’s been considered a major world economic power since at least the reign of Queen Victoria, but you wouldn’t know it by how global financial markets reacted to the budget the UK released couple of days back. All of a sudden it’s starting to look a whole lot like an emerging market.The budget included major tax cuts for high earners and scrapped a planned hike in corporate taxes. It also spelled out just how much the government plans to spend to subsidize energy bills: £150 billion.And no offense to newly installed PM Liz Truss, but the markets reacted to the bigger-than-expected package like they don’t quite trust the British government to handle its financial situation:Investors couldn’t sell off short-term government bonds fast enough, pushing rates way up. Borrowing costs on five-year bonds had their largest ever one-day rise.The British pound fell more than 3% against the dollar to the lowest it’s been since 1985.This combo of soaring bond rates and plunging currency is usually what countries without sound economic governance experience—not wealthy nations like the UK, signaling major concerns over public debt and inflation.What now? All eyes are on the Bank of England, which before the budget dropped said that a recession had already begun. British Central Bank to save the pound is now expected to raise rates even more aggressively.State of other countries in Europe is worse. Totally dependent on ‘Kabhi Haan Kabhi Na’ of Russia.Meanwhile Euro and Pound are plummeting against Dollar and the Rupee. As things stand $=€=£ against the rupee. Rupee will strengthen against all major currencies upto 30th September in anticipation of a jump in Repo rate.
