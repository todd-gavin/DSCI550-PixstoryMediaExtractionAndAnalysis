Trying to lose fat but ALWAYS hungry? &
Start focusing on these guidelines - they'll help A LOT with losing that 20-30 lbs you've been trying to shed.

1: FOCUS ON FILLING FOODS
The goal - get as much fullness as possible for your calories. The most filling foods per calorie:
I. Lean protein 2. Fibrous carbs 3. Fats

2: BUILD MEALS AROUND PROTEIN
Plan your protein source for each meal (ideally 20q+) first. This ensures it will be a filling meal, and that you're getting the amino
acids needed to maintain/build lean muscle.

3: MOSTLY AVOID FOODS HIGH IN MULTIPLE MACROS A diet of foods that are "mostly carbs",” mostly fats", etc. will usually equate to much higher food volume (a.k.a. more food per calorie).

4: WHOLE FOODS > LIQUID CALORIES
swap a solid food source for liquid calories.

5: REDUCE CALS FROM OILS, DRESSINGS, & CONDIMENTS
Look for lower calorie swaps here - you won't notice the difference between using a 20 calorie salad dressing & a 150 calorie one, or o
calorie cooking spray instead of olive oil.
