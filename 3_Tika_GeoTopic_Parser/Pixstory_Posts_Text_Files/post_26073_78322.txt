Naina wasn t just a character she was a feeling That feeling that resides in each and every girl She wants to leave all her worries behind and move ahead with a new spirit of joy self acceptance and a little boost of confidence Ambitions family education we are all done with it I want to think about myself what I like what I aspire to do She realizes her inner beauty that was hidden behind the barriers of the society Naina always doesn t has to find a Bunny Maybe there is a Bunny out there who needs Naina to open him up and introduce him to his real self If you are a Topper Naina before the Manali trip then dig deeper into you maybe you ll find the post Naina who knows what she s capable of Right there to shoot for the moon and reach the stars
