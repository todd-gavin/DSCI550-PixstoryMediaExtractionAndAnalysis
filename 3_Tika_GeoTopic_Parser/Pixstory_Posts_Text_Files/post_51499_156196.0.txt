A goalscorer during El Clasico, Fede Valverde talked about his thoughts to the press after his side, Real Madrid dismantled eternal rivals Barcelona and moved to top of the table. 
The Uruguyan was asked about his favorite position and he replied: "I always said in the middle but I'm playing out wide often right now. I try to enjoy myself in every position give everything I have."
"I know I can provide lots of goals and assists up top. I'm pleased because I knew I wouldn't get a lot of opportunities to score today, but I managed to do it."
On the match
"We knew it would be tough but I'm happy with the win, the effort and the team's commitment. I'm exceptionally happy from a personal point of view."
"We worked well as a team, we defended and dug in brilliantly. We were strong defensively and going forward and we were able to use the space to our advantage."
On Carlo Ancelotti's orders
"The coach tells me not just to stick out wide but to drift inside as well. We have to keep working hard and bringing that energy in the middle in order to keep the spaces that open up to create goal-scoring opportunities."
