The Margan Top, which is perched at a height of 14,000 feet and is one of the most picturesque mountain peaks in south Kashmir's Himalayan area, has recently gained popularity as a tourist destination. This mountain pass, which is located 35 kilometres from Kokernag, serves as the entrance to Warwan, a hidden valley. The Margan Top, which is surrounded by lovely meadows on all sides, offers a 360-degree panorama of the Warwan Valley and Kashmir Valley. Its name is a combination of the words mar, which means death, and gan, which means valley. It was a valley of death until a road was built there barely ten years ago because of its erratic weather.
Margan Top is graced with four exquisite little lakes collectively known as Choharnag or four lakes. These high altitude lakes, which are located at a 3 km distance from the main road, offer a calming atmosphere at the peak of the mountain. The Margan Top's surrounding meadows come alive with colour in the summer when the wild flowers bloom simultaneously. The Gujjars and Bakerwal tribesmen bring hundreds of sheep and goats here to graze for a few months, and they live in the great, grassy stretches.
