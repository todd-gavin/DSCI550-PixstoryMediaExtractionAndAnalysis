Spanish club Sevilla have a challenge on their hands in keeping star player Jules Kounde at the club this summer The French defender had already agreed a move to Stamford Bridge last season only for it to be blocked by Sevilla With another impressive season for the defender under the belt Sevilla will find it even harder this year to hold off interest for their man Sevilla general manager Jose Maria Cruz de Andres admits that the club will struggle to hold on to Chelsea transfer target Jules Kounde this summer Speaking to Sport Witness Cruz de Andres explained The case with Jules Kounde is very similar to the case of Diego Carlos Not in the timing because we received offers for Jules Kounde in the last two seasons but always in the summer market We have rejected because we thought that this player can improve his performances It was better to wait because the market at the time was depressing We thought that waiting a while would help us obtain more money Again the player I am sure respects Sevilla FC He is happy with us In the case of Kounde it is not a matter of money It s a matter of him wanting to play in a more competitive team than Sevilla FC The center back is the target of many European clubs including Chelsea FC Barcelona and Bayern Munich Further elaborating about the situation Sevilla s general manager had to add It s the same case we had some years ago with Cl ment Lenglet He was very happy but he thought after playing some years at Sevilla FC he was prepared to go to FC Barcelona The first time we received an offer for him was a season before he was transferred He Lenglet and his father told us they didn t to leave Sevilla then because they preferred to stay here and play a lot of matches However Sevilla s chances of holding onto their players just keep decreasing as the summer window progresses
