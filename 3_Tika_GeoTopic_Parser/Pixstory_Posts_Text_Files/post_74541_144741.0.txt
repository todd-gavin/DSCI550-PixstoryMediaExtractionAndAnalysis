Despite doing good business, the movie has been receiving a lot of negative reviews online.Amidst its all, leading lady Alia Bhatt is reacting to the negative reviews and has the best possible response. Scroll below for all the details.😱😱😱😱😱😱Alia Bhatt along with Ranbir Kapoor and director Ayan Mukerji were in Ahmedabad to promote Brahmastra. The trio was asked about negative comments about the film, and Alia reacted, “We have only one life and two options in it. We can either focus on the positive things or think about negativity.”✅And recently, whenever anyone asks us a negative question, we genuinely want to say with all of our consensus that we are not thinking about it.”✔️✔️Alia Bhatt added, “Whenever media asks a negative questions, we try to not divert ourselves into it.Criticism, reviews,opinions and feedback are the audience’s right.We just hope to come across more positive things rather than anything negative.Film release hone k baad aisa lag raha hani positive hi ja raha hain warna jo box office me aag lagayi hai woh hota nahi (Ever since Brahmastra has released,Ithink it has been positive, otherwise, how has it set the box office on fire)”🙏🙏🔥🔥She further said, “So the reviews that you are talking about,that is their opinion.We just hope that the positives are more than the negatives.After the release of the film, it looks like it is more on the positive side otherwise it would not have done so well at the box office.”🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Well, many fans have also pointed out and are disappointed with Alia’s role in Brahmastra as they felt her character was not strong enough.Speaking about the same, director Ayan Mukerji had told during a conversation, “In some ways,her incredible acting chops has almost become something that some people are seeing as it is getting in the way of fully appreciating her.👍👍But again, I am waiting for this (film) to spread far and wide in the country. I still think there will be a lot of acceptance for her, playing this positive, happy girl in the film. But, noted. In part two we will do more with Alia🙏🙏🔥
