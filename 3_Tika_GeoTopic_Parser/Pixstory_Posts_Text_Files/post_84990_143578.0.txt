2) Brenden Aaronson
Brenden Aaronson has been having an incredible breakout season at Leeds United. The 21year old footballer joined Leeds United for an undisclosed fee during the summer of 2022and signed a five-year deal, locking him to the club until 2027. The American midfielder has seen regular game time under his manager Jesse Marsch, who is also from the United States. In this time he has already racked up a couple of goal contributions and will only develop and improve as a player under Marsch.
1) Christian Pulisic
Who other than Christian Pulisic to top this list? Pulisic signed for Chelsea during the
January transfer window in 2019 from German side Borussia Dortmund, for a fee of Â£57.6m. Pulisic is arguably the biggest American player to join the Premier League. After years of success in Germany, Chelsea's gargantuan bid for the winger was fully justified and everyone had high expectations which he did not fail to deliver on. The American has had great European success since joining Chelsea. Pulisic has won the Europe League, the Champions League, the Super Cup, and the Club World Cup at Chelsea.
The American winger has scored 34 goals in the Premier League for Chelsea so far,
registering 19 assists too. Christian Pulisic has performed under multiple managers such as Maurizio Sarri, Frank Lampard, and Thomas Tuchel showing their ability to adapt to different managers and their styles of play. He will now aim to stand out under Chelsea's new manager who recently left Brighton, Graham Potter.
