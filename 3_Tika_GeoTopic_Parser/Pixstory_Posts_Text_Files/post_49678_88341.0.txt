‌Racism is a prevailing factor in the US; Black people are always under the light of oppression. Here the bill The CROWN Act, which stands for Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair Act, becomes a relief. 
‌
‌The bill would ban any kind of race-based hair discrimination at work, federal program or public accommodation. The bill comes after years of pushing it for a policy change. The discrimination on the basis of hair is rooted in systemic racism. Even the dreadlocks or afros are not much as romanticized as the straight 'frizz-free' hair. Even though it's slowly changing the change seems to be unequal and scattered. Many instances such as In 2019, a Black teen in Texas was suspended from school and compelled with expulsion if she did not cut her dreadlocks. The officials had said that dreadlocks were too long. The bill would help to put the hairstyles of African Americans into 'the norms'. 
‌
‌‌As the bill heads to Senate, a thin Democratic majority in the Senate may not be sufficient to get the CROWN Act ratified despite President Biden expressing strong support for the bill.
‌
As per the NPR, The White House said, "The President believes that no person should be denied the ability to obtain a job, succeed in school or the workplace, secure housing, or otherwise exercise their rights based on a hair texture or hairstyle."

Meanwhile, Colorado Republican Lauren Boebert had made a racist remark by calling the Crown Bill as 'Bad hair bill'. When the Republicans argue about the need for CRT and call it intolerance or a reminder of Racism. Please understand the racism rooted in your spirits!
