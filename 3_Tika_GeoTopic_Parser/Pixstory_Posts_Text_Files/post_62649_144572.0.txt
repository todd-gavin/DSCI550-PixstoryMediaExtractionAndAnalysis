Dark circles are a common concern for many people. They can make you look tired and stressed, and they may even lead to social isolation. Fortunately, there is help available!
One of the most common causes of dark circles is lack of sleep. When we don't get enough sleep, our body releases cortisol - the stress hormone - in response to chronic stressors or perceived threats. Cortisol blocks melanin production, which results in darker skin tones around the eyes & eyelids. It also reduces collagen production, which contributes to wrinkles and baggy eyesight.
To treat dark circles naturally, try taking melatonin before bedtime to help your body release more serotonin (a calming neurotransmitter). Also keep track of how much you're sleeping each night and adjust your routine as necessary: cut down on caffeine late into the evening; stick to a regular schedule rather than going back between work shifts; avoid working out right before bedtime; etc. If you find that supplements aren't helping enough, speak with your doctor about prescription treatments such as hydroxyzine (Atarax) or minocycline (Minocin).
