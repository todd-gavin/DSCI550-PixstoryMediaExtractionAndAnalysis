Phil Mickleson Has been paid 200 million dollars to join Liv Golf. 
DeChambeau Paid a similar amount. But prize catch is Tiger Woods. If Woods joins it, PGA will buckle down.
He is equal to all the tours. TV viewership doubles when he plays. 
He is already the richest Sportsman in the world and this when in last 13 years, it’s more controversies than Golf. 
In his prime he used to charge 5 million dollars plus expenses per tournament outside PGA. 
Saudi Funding is already 2 billion dollars for Liv Golf. Though why Saudis are investing in a game they hardly play and nearly all LivGolf Tournaments are outside Saudi Arabia.
Godfather has the immortal dialogue:
‘I’ll Make him an offer a He can’t refuse!’
So what will be the offer for Tiger woods?
