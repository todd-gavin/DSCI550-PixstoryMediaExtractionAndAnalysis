Just odd second on the clock last night and the Etihad had already erupted into a frenzy Riyadh Mahrez cut inside effortlessly gliding past three or four Real Madrid defenders and placing the ball into Kevin De Bruyne s path The Belgian known for his ball striking ability from range obliged scoring a header he ll remember for quite sometime now Both because it is rare even for a player of his quality to score so early in such a big game and because in his case he doesn t score many diving headers The goal caught the eye not because of Mahrez s brilliance or Real Madrid s passive defensive shape but because De Bruyne s finish As soon as the goal went in the statistics manics got into action and wrote about the time on the clock seconds happens to be the quickest goal in a Champions League semi final Even though in the Champions League as a whole Roy Makaay of FC Bayern Munchen holds the record for the quickest recorded goal He scored just seconds into his side s Round of tie against Real Madrid Gabriel Jesus doubled City s lead soon after but the game saw a flurry of missed chances on City s end Phil Foden s goal at would ve been game set and match but Real Madrid once again showed their remarkable ability to show up late and make a difference They will now head to Madrid with a deficit but one they can hope to overcome The isn t in all honesty a good result for either team both of whom will have hoped for more Regardless games like these are what the average neutral lives for And goals like the one De Bruyne scored only add to the excitement of the competition
