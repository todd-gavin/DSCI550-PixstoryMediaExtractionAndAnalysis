I am myself a food lover and love to cook I like to know all kinds of multicuisines around the world MasterChef Australia is one of the shows that delivers entertainment contestant all around the world as well as fair competition all around the same time In each episode I always ends up having some knowledge of cuisine of one or the another country The show is known for its great versatility which makes it different from the other MasterChef shows It brings some really amazing chefs around the world It is just amazed to see great personalities like Gordon Ramsay to Nigella Lawson and sharing their experiences and struggles which is so inspiring The Standard of MasterChef Australia is quite high As most of the contestants on other shows are limited to the cultural background they belong to and it just limits the possibilities that a cookery show can offer Masterchef Australia has showcased a variety of cuisines from Indian to British to Vietnamese The old judges were such amazing people They were kind hearted people which is not generally expected from any reality show judge But this show is just an eye opener for the other shows around the world that without having drama or any showing any rudeness of the judges a show can still win the hearts of the people The judges Gary Matt and George take it to another level Their feedback is never to put down a contestant but to uplift them and encourage them to do better They are gone now unfortunately But the new judges are pretty cool Definitely worth bringing them to the show Sometimes it s not even about the food and cooking but seeing people journeying to live their dreams It is perhaps one of the shows that do not include any nasty dramas It is amused to see that how the contestants were so kind to each other and how they support each other clap for each other hug each other cry for each other How much the show is actually about the contestants about their perspective about human connection and about food
