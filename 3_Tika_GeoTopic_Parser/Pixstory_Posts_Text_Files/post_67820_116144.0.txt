BCCI announced India Women’s T20I squad for the upcoming Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. The 15-member squad looks well rounded when it comes to quality and talent but there have been a few inclusions and exclusions that have left many wondering and surprised. To start with, Taniya Bhatia who hasn’t played a T20I since March 2020, has been included while the likes of Richa Ghosh and Poonam Yadav are in the stand-bys.

Looking at the squad, it is clear that the selectors have looked for batting depth by picking Sneh Rana who was rested for the recently concluded Sri Lanka tour. Rana’s off-spin coupled with some brilliant lower-order batting has helped her make it to the squad again.

Not that she is a bad pick but leaving out a wicket-taker like Poonam Yadav can turn out to be fatal for India. Very few must have forgotten the way the leg-spinner ran through Australia’s line-up in the opening game of T20 World Cup in 2020 against Australia. Also, with all the matches set to be played at Edgbaston in Birmingham, the venue which has already hosted a lot of cricket this summer, the pitches are bound to get slower and be conducive for spinners.

The veteran has played 72 T20 Internationals in her career since making her debut back in 2013 and has picked up 98 wickets. But over the course of time, she has gone down the pecking order having last played in the format in February this year. However, it is startling to see her not getting picked much in the shortest format given the fact that Poonam has gone wicketless only on six occasions in last 25 innings. 

Also, among those 25 innings, 15 times she conceded 7 runs or less per over during her spells. Interestingly though she has never played a T20I in her career but then, not many from the current team have that experience either. Clearly, Poonam Yadav should’ve been part of the line-up for the Commonwealth Games.
