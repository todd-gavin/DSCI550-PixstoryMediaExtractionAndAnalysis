You do not shoot at us you at our neighbor To this depressed heart of sorrow Do not shoot this broken heart of your war The pages of our lives are full of national ethnic religious and terrorist wars Death has become a normal thing the nation is so carefree that we are being sacrificed in the most heinous way and its revenge is a proclamation a national mourning One wonders what to do when repetitive human crimes happen every day We die for the dream and wish for peace we become your victims O savage Talib From what sorrow should I say from yesterday or today from last year or this year From immigration or child play from wasted children or from rape from fortune telling or backwardness In what language should I say we are in pain let us live let us breathe Students who shoot one seed every day Years of insomnia and effort to get there Why are students attacked when they are harassed without harm Why is human value ignored when the president s ten seats You have guns and tanks but we have pens and books Your wish is sedition and war but your wish is empathy and love But blood is shed because we are in school and university We are condemned to live because we are striving for tomorrow Do not shoot at the fog you wild savage To university to course to home to child To the generation of pens To the generation of change To the young generation To this depressed heart of sorrow Do not shoot this broken heart of your war Do not shoot at the dreams of tomorrow Do not shoot the passionate madness of your history To this depressed heart of sorrow Do not shoot this broken heart of your war I wrote this poem in Persian then I translated it into English I hope I have expressed my feelings
