We have created such a world where you are only appreciated and complimented if you share how great your doing how happy you re and how much you ve achieved A world where if you express your pain or loneliness or say that you re not ok people will think you re simply trying to gain attention or sympathy And so no one talks about how they really feel We need to save this world and change it s perception before it eats us all from inside Those who are listening please listen with your heart and soul Stop trying to be a machine stop not caring just stop If you re not ok say it loud If you feel like killing yourself say it loud If you think you need help but don t have the energy to get it SAY IT LOUD
