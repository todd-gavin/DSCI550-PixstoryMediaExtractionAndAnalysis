High-flying On Friday night, Denmark will host Croatia at Parken Stadium in Copenhagen in a
UEFA Nations League match.

The Euro 2020 semi-finalists are in great spirits after winning eight of their past nine competitive
international matches, scoring at least twice in six of them.

The Danes, on the other hand, have lost their past two games with Croatia, including a 3-2
setback on penalties in the 2018 World Cup quarter-finals.

Croatia has had a terrible start to their Nations League campaign, losing 3-0 at home to Austria
in their first match and drawing 1-1 at home to France on Monday.Croatia has only won two of
its 12 Nations League games since the league began in 2018, and in nine of those games, they
have surrendered at least two goals.The Checkered Ones have also surrendered in each of
their past five encounters with Denmark, so they'll have to be at their best on Friday if they want
to take all five points.
