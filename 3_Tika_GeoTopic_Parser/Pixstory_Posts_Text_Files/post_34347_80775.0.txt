India secured an emphatic 96-run victory over the West Indies to secure a historic first clean sweep win over the side in ODIs. The side bowled the Windies out on 169 after putting 265 on the board after opting to bat. This is also India's 11th successive ODI series win over the Windies. It was a disappointing performance from the visitors right from the start of their run-chase, as they lost three wickets within the first five overs. Deepak Chahar picked two wickets in his second over, removing Brandon King (14) and Shamarh Brooks (0) after Mohammed Siraj provided India with the early breakthrough, dismissing Shai Hope (5). Krishna, then, removed Darren Bravo on 20 to break a crucial stand for the Windies before dismissing Jason Holder on 6. Kuldeep Yadav, who made a return to the XI after over six months, removed Fabian Allen (0) and Nicholas Pooran (34) as the Windies sunk further. Alzarri Joseph (29) and Hayden Walsh (13) forged a gritty 47-run stand but the latter's wicket ended any hope for an unlikely comeback for the visitors. Both teams will now travel to Kolkata for a three-match T20I series that begins on February 16.
