Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the supreme leader of Iran, set up a reward for his assassination. He lived in hiding for almost ten years, frequently changing residences and unable to let his children know where he was. It wasn't until the Iranian government announced in 1998 that it wouldn't implement that "fatwa" or order that Mr. Rushdie started to come out of hiding.
