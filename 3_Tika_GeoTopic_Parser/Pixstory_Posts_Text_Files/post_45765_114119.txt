NASA announced on Tuesday that a million spacecraft intended to try out a skewed lunar orbit has lost contact but agency engineers are confident they can rectify the issue As per BS the space agency reported on Monday that it could no longer contact with the Capstone spacecraft after one successful communication and two partial ones NASA spokesman Sarah Frazier said on Tuesday that engineers are working to identify the reason of the communications hiccup and are hopeful they can repair it When contact was lost with the spacecraft which was launched from New Zealand on June after spending nearly a week in Earth orbit and being successfully launched for the moon Frazier said The pound satellite is the size of a microwave oven and will be the first spacecraft to try out this oval orbit which is where NASA wants to stage its Gateway outpost Gateway would serve as a staging point for astronauts before they descend to the lunar surface The orbit balances the gravities of Earth and the moon and so requires little maneuvering and therefore fuel and allows the satellite or a space station to stay in constant contact with Earth
