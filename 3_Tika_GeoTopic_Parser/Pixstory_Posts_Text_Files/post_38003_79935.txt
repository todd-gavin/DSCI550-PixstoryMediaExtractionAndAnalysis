As stated earlier the Blues have been negotiating with Antonio Rudiger to find a solution But as per the Mirror the Chelsea defender has increased his wage demands and this could affect the deal Antonio Rudiger currently earns around per week at Chelsea as per reports The Blues are ready to offer him an improved deal of a week but the German defender has declined the offer As per the report the year wants an improved deal of a week to commit his future with Chelsea To add to this Rudiger has also demanded a signing on bonus from the Blues Real Madrid have also been in contact with the defender Los Blancos had offered him a contract of a week But Antonio Rudiger has even rejected the offer of the Spanish giants The German defender reportedly wants to commit his future with the Blues but he will sign the contract only if Chelsea meet his demands Rudiger has already said My kids were born here in London so that tells you that my family feels great here The rest is up to other people to make decisions and then we will see if we come together or not As stated earlier Antonio Rudiger would be out of contract at the end of the season Hence the defender is now free to talk to clubs without consulting with Chelsea Hence the Blues would have to hurry up if they want to keep the German at the club Should the Blues retain Rudiger Antonio Rudiger joined Chelsea in Since then the year old has made appearances in all competitions In this the defender has scored goals for the Blues as well If Chelsea agree to let Rudiger leave they could face a struggle next season The Blues would have to pay a high price to sign a centre back of Antonio Rudiger s calibre in the summer Hence it would be best if Chelsea could find a solution with the defender in the next few days
