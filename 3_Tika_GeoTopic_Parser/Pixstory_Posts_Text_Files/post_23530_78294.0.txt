On January 31, BIGHIT MUSIC announced on Weverse that BTSâ€˜s Jimin tested positive for COVID-19.

The statement explained that Jimin experienced sudden abdominal pain, along with a mild sore throat, on January 30 in the afternoon. After noticing his symptoms, Jimin visited a hospital emergency room for a thorough examination. After the examination, Jimin was diagnosed with acute appendicitis and was tested positive for COVID-19.

He underwent successful surgery following physician advice early morning on Monday, January 31, and is currently recuperating. He is receiving in-patient treatment and, although he is currently experiencing a mild sore throat, is making a speedy recovery.

It has been over a month since BTS returned from America and has been on their extended vacation. Yet, despite finishing their quarantine time, Jimin had no contact with the other members during the infectious stage.

- hope he gets well soon ðŸ’œðŸ’œ
