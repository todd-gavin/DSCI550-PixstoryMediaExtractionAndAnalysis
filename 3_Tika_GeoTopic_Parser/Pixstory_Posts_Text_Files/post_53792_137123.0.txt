The cost of living crisis is dominating headlines at the moment. With so much conflicting information flying around, it can be hard to work out what is the best way to look after your household finances.
Banks, energy providers and shops will often try to blind you with big numbers and confusing mathematical terms – often preying on people’s fear of mathematics. However, even if you count yourself as a numberphobe, there are a few very simple steps you can take to use maths in your favour and save some money.
The trouble with averages
For most people, the biggest impact on the cost of living will come from hikes in gas and electricity costs. This is tied to the price cap, which is set by Ofgem. But much of the reporting around this cap is somewhat misleading.
Last week, the October price cap was announced as being £3,549. But that price is based on an average household. The very nature of an average is that roughly half of households will use more energy than this, and roughly half will use less.
Therefore, it is very useful to have an idea of how much energy your own household actually uses in a year. If you have lived in the same house for a few years, you can look at your usage over previous years as a guide. If you’re in a new home, you can make an estimate by factoring in the size of house, number of people who live there and other information using an energy consumption calculator.
Your energy bill for each type of fuel is based on two values – a daily standing charge (SC), which you pay every day regardless of usage, and a cost per unit of energy (CPU). Once you know how many units (u) of that fuel you use per year, you can easily calculate your expected bill for a given year by computing (365 x SC) + (u x CPU).
