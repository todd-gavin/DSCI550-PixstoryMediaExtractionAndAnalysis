Following a complaint from the Union government, YouTube has pulled the most recent song by the late Punjabi musician Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu, also known as Sidhu Moosewala, from its site in India. However, the song is accessible in other nations. 
According to reports, the song brings up a number of divisive topics, including the Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal, which is still under construction and has been a point of dispute between Punjab and Haryana for the past forty years.
