Pandit Dattatreya Vishnu Paluskar (28 May 1921 - 26 October 1955), popularly known as Pt. D. V. Paluskar, was an exceptional Hindustani Classical Vocalist of the Gwalior Gharana of Hindustani Classical Music Tradition.
The extraordinarily gifted son of an illustrious father, Vishnu Digambar Paluskar, Dattatreya Vishnu Paluskar was born on May 28, 1921. He started his classical music training at a very early age under the guidance of his legendary father, Pt. Vishnu Digambar Paluskar. Dattatreya was only ten years old when he lost his father and was subsequently trained by disciples of his father, Pandit Vinayakrao Patwardhan and Pandit Narayanrao Vyas. He was also trained by Pandit Chintamanrao Paluskar and Pandit Mirashi Buwa, a disciple of Balakrishnabua Ichhalkaranjikar. Pt. D V Paluskar gave his debut performance at the Harballabh Sangeet Sammelan in Jalandhar, Punjab at the age of fourteen. He inherited the styles of the Gwalior gharana and the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya, but gave a new dimension to the Gwalior gayaki through his unique, distinctive style, which was very sweet to hear but extremely difficult to render. A very quiet, modest and humble person, wholly immersed in his music, D V Paluskar had a clear and melodious voice and a unique, effortless enchanting style. His music, like his personality, was straightforward and touched the very heartstrings. He was a master at presenting an attractive and comprehensive picture of a raga in a very short duration. This, in tandem with his beautiful renditions of bhajans made him very popular with both the lay listener and the cognoscenti. He is also famous for an unforgettable duet with Ustad Amir Khan in the film Baiju Bawra. The only other film he sang for was a Bengali film called Shaap Mochan. His rendition of Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram made the Bhajan a favourite of Mahatma Gandhi 
 He cut his first disc in 1944. He died from encephalitis in 1955 when he was only 34.
