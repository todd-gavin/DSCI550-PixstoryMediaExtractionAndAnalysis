People often see the Hajj as an example of Islam s global transnational community However even the possibility and experience is shaped and reflects influence from such hegemonic influences It is not a melting away of national distinctions in transcendental unity The harmony of the Hajj is simply not based on any kind of unity of any significance Its order and concord derive from on the one hand the dominance of Saudi monarchy and Western influence establishment and on the other mutual indifference among Muslims which is sad gloomy Hajj is a carefully managed entirely conventional instance of internationalism and geo politics West won t allow the current regime to use Hajj as a foundational platform to work in line with OIC They would rather approve of all the ritualistic practices of Hajj but the actionable agenda behind it Because of the consequences we see the devastation of Muslim communities happening at the hands of ruthless state institutions in Palestine Mynmar Rohingya crisis Syria Yemen and other major regions where muslims are distress misery The political interests and economic might doesn t even allow Muslim nations to take a solid stand for their own nations In lieu of the selfish stand conflicted zones and the people living there suffer and become scapegoats thus torn between the power game Coming from the conflicted Himalayan hills of Kashmir my heart longs for this platform to become a bridge urging the two nuclear powers of Indo Pak to resolve the issues to bring back the fragrance of harmony in the valley This event platform can very well serve the requisite long pending cause brewing between these two nations By persistent steady engagements Muslim nations can urge them to fix the problems halting peace in the region If work is done over these goals the conferences organised on the context that I witnessed during the time of Hajj can prove to be fruitful in resolving such issues and getting disputed governments on the same table therefore resolving the most critical issues faced by the Muslims in the geo politics
