Not only drooling over the K- drama extremely handsome and tall heroes , the progressive yet conventional story lines are what that keeps you glued to the screen. I just started watching them. Well, they have got it all covered! The subtle, aesthetic and realistic stories take you into their own world. The rom-coms are unbeatable. They incorporate the value of consent, healthy communication and mutual respect for each other. While an Indian hero may woo you with his expensive gifts, the forced dance tracks amidst the movies ,the Koreans have an exemplary way of showcasing their love. From Vice chairman Yeong-Jun from the series What’s wrong with Secretary Kim to Park Jae-eon from Nevertheless your admiration won’t stop. 

Even the second lead male actors are adorable (That’s what I feel) They are men in real love who understand the 
value of personal choices. The drama ‘A love so Beautiful’ has a simple storyline - high school sweethearts falling for each other yet the intricate details without over-drama heightens your emotions and you desire to have someone as them in your life. The saas- bahu conflict is what is missing! 

K - dramas are addictive ✨
