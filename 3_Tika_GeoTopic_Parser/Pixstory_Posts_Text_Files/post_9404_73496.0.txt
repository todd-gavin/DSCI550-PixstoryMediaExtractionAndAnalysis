The name "French fries" actually originated in Belgium, rather than France. They are prepared by cutting the potato into even strips, then drying and frying it, usually in a deep fryer. Most french fries are produced from frozen Russet potatoes.

We truly agree that most of the people like to have French fries and I am one of them.
