Well, well, well. Louis Tomlinson just teased us with something. (FINALLY!) The pop track "Bigger Than Me" from Louis Tomlinson's upcoming album, Faith in the Future, serves as a teaser and honestly, I can't wait! The song was written by Mike Crossey, Tomlinson, Rob Harvey, and Red Triangle.
The singer's second studio album, Faith in the Future, is due out on November 11 and is currently up for preorder. Numerous collaborators, including Rob Harvey, Dan Grech, Nico Rebscher, Joe Cross, and Hurts leader Theo Hutchcraft, contributed to its production and songwriting.
Louis said, “It was my first moment of excitement making this record, and where it felt we were on to something which honors the live show. I’ve always strived to be a very normal, humble person in this life, but there’s a line to that and a responsibility that comes from being in this position. I realized from doing those live shows what it means to my fans and how everything I do is bigger than me. It’s almost a coming of age for myself and putting opinions about myself to the back of my mind and thinking about what it potentially means for other people.”
“After living with this album for a while I can’t wait for you all to hear it,” he wrote on Twitter. “Thank you for allowing me to make the music I want to make.”
