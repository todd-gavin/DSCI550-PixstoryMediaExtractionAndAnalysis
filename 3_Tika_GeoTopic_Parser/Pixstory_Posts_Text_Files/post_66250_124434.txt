Based on the French graphic novel La Transperceneige Bong Joon ho s Snowpiercer begins in the extremely not too distant future as mankind launches a final attempt to halt the spread of global warming once and for all Needless to say the plan backfires spectacularly and plunges the world into a new ice age that causes the extinction of all life forms Luckily before all this happened wealthy industrialist Wilford an inspired bit of casting that I dare not reveal taking several pages from Ayn Rand constructed a high speed luxury train that can circle the globe without stopping or suffering the effects of the weather outside Now humanity s last remnants reside on the train the well to do people living in comfort in the head cars with the poor and downtrodden masses stuck in back in cramped quarters and forced to subsist on protein bars made from well don t ask what goes into the protein bars From a visual perspective Snowpiercer is never less than stunning as it provides thrilling images ranging from the desolate landscape outside to a full size aquarium with beauty that is outdone only by its implausibility Despite the close quarters Bong also comes up with a lot of inventively staged action sequences the most memorable of which include a first person look at a savage brawl in a completely dark car as seen through a pair of night vision glasses and a visit to a classroom run by a teacher with an unexpected lesson plan From a dramatic standpoint the film is effective in the way that it includes the expected pulpy thrills and weirdo humor but also some unexpectedly affecting dramatic moments There is one moment in which a character remarks that because of conditions on the train I know what people taste like and I know babies taste best It sounds like a sick joke but the line is delivered with the utmost seriousness and because we care about who is saying it it turns out to be al moment of human drama amidst the chaos Likewise the film s final shot is impressive in the way that it suggests triumph and potential terror at the same time
