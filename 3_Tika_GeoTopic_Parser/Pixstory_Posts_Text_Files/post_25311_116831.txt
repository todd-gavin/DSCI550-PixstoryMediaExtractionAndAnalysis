I think this was the first time a book got me extremely hooked up even though I already had high expectations This book is just genius can t wait for it to be released on Netflix I was really surprised when got into the book because there were so many twists I didn t see coming only a few twists that already expected didn t surprise me I felt so bad for Evelyn but I also admired her so much She started from zero and got huge all by her own for me she s a really smart woman because she knows how to act in different situations But no matter how much money or fame she had at the end of the day she was lonely left alone and it was too late for her to stop that because you can t just turn back time Her life made me realize once again that stars are also just human beings and that the media isn t always true but would rather spread false gossips Famous people can make their lives seem perfect but in reality they might suffer mostly because they re not allowed a lot of things because of the media I was so ready to cry when some characters died and the end The end just left my heart shattered Though have to admit that Evelyns life was so adventurous I couldn t stop reading because always got so curious what she s going to do next The book is set from the s till the s which made everything just so freaking much better You see the changes from the people and the politics from that timeline And it also leaves you with a nostalgic feeling There s just so much could write about this book but I m always trying to keep it short
