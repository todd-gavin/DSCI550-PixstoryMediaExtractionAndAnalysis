There have been four rounds of sanctions against Russia by the European Union, the bloc has shown remarkable unity. However, it may have made little difference to Russia's advance into Ukraine. Now a fifth round of sanctions are being discussed and it is here that the differences are out in the open.

Poland and the Baltic states of Lithuania and Latvia are asking others to impose sanctions on exporting oil and gas from Russia. Something that others like Germany are not willing as they still depend on Russia for energy. Ukraine has been asking the bloc to stop Russia from benefiting to the tune of $600 million per day. Ukraine has called for a full energy embargo "that could significantly reduce funding for the war and push Putin to sit down at the negotiation table."

Lithuania's foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, has set the tone before the EU discussions by saying that it was "unavoidable to start talking about the energy sector" especially oil, which he said was "the biggest revenue to the Russian budget" and "also quite easily replaceable" for the EU.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine may have prompted the EU to think of a fresh way forward that is not on Russia for its energy needs, but that may be little further away for several Eastern and Central European countries. 

The crucial European Council meeting on March 24 and 25th has several things on the agenda, but the most important discussion could be on energy imports from Russia. President Joe Biden will be joining other EU leaders during the first day of the European Council, and it is not clear if he will also press for cutting energy supplies from Russia.

Germany has been non-committal, publicly on the line it would take on imposing new sanctions against Russia. In the meantime, the Kremlin has warned that an oil embargo would have "a very serious negative impact on Europe's energy balance".
