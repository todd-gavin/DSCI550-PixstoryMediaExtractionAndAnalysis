I've never been a fan of keeping cats as a pet. Not only they are too high maintenance but also hard to keep. They're very fiercely independent, they like their freedom. Hence why they often go missing, run away from their owners and what not.

But if you are keeping one as a pet, it is just cruel to keep them caged. It's in their nature to be free and wander around and even hunt. That's how cats are supposed to be, they are predatory animals. You can't take that away from them.

If you choose to keep a cat, you're gonna have to fulfill the duties of being a cat owner. You can't take the easy way out. Keeping a predator animal fron hunting or an independent animal from going out is animal abuse.
