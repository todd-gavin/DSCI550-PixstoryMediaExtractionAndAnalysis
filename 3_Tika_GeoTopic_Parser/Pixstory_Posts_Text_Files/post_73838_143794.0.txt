Some songs are special because not many people don't know about them . They are absolute trasures hidden in plain sight you just need to look at them . This song is one of those . 
The song ohh meri laila from the 2018 film titled Laila Majnu sadly the film didn't do well on the box office despite being great . Same goes for its songs , the film 's album is wonderful. Yet mist people don't know about it.
