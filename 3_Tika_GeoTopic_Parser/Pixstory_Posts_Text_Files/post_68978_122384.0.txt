Indian ace sprinter Hima Das failed to qualify for the women’s 200m final after finishing outside the top eight in the semi-finals at the Commonwealth Games 2022 in Birmingham on Friday.
Hima Das, who has recently made a transition to shorter races from 400m, clocked 23.42s to finish third in the semi-final 2 at the Alexander Stadium.
Overall, Hima Das was 10th among 24 semi-finalists and missed out on the qualification for the final by 0.02s. The Indian sprinter has a personal best of 22.88s in the 200m.
Only the top two from each of the three women’s 200m semi-finals and the next two fastest runners across the three groups qualified for the eight-woman final on Saturday.
Jamaican legend Elaine Thompson-Herah, who has five Olympic gold medals to her name, topped the semis with 22.63s.
In the women’s 200m heats, Hima Das, a former world junior champion and Asian Games silver medallist in the 400m, also managed a 23.42s in the heats. The time was enough to qualify her for the semis.
Hima Das will be in action next in the women’s 4x100m event on Saturday.
