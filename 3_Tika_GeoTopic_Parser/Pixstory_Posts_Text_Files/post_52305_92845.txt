Football is a physically demanding sport It is a football style with roots in early forms of Rugby and Gaelic football but it is uniquely Australian Its rules were codified in and it most likely predates all other modern forms of football including American Canadian Rugby Union and League Association Soccer and Gaelic football Today it is a multimillion dollar enterprise with a National Competition and numerous smaller leagues Despite the fact that interest in the game is at an all time high both within and outside of Australia some parts of the country are still lukewarm in their support for their team in the AFL and the game has yet to take a firm hold overseas
