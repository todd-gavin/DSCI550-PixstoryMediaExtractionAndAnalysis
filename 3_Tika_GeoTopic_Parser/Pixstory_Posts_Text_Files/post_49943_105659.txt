The latest move of Russia in their master plan of weaponisation of energy for a political purpose is at a state where Russia is all set to cut off natural gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria and more recently Finland parts of Germany and potentially Denmark and the Netherlands The war is going to worsen global warming along with the side effects it already has That s why it makes perfect sense in the short term for the US to improve both the amount of liquified natural gas LNG it exports to the European Union and countries across Asia and stimulates its investment in carbon free energy production Natural gas is a lot cleaner than other energy sources like coal In fact in the US nearly all the profits in emissions reductions over the past years have been due to the thriving use of natural gas to produce electricity in place of coal That s why the US should increase exports of LNG which would not only improve geopolitical strength by helping to supply energy to other nations in their time of need but also lessen global dependence on harmful energy sources like coal Shifting from coal to gas can cut greenhouse gas emissions by about half and therefore help to decarbonize economies This does not mean we are completely not relying on fossil fuels Make no mistake the essential is to avoid a degrees Celsius global temperature increase which climate scientists concede would reduce the threat of climate disturbances and avoid a climate catastrophe
