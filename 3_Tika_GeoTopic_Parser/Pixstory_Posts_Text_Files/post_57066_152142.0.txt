You know what, with ebooks there are always some drawbacks.
All of it begins with technology and ends there. 
You need to charge your device, keep a track of the battery and of course there are not always networks available, so here we lose our favourite books.
With paper books, it's just you and your book and no other hindrance.
And ebooks are kind of designed in a way to distract you, afterall it's an online business that needs to be promoted.
So here you click on one link then another.
It breaks your attention and then it is hard to focus.
And yes paper books are not hard on your eyes although e-books are!!
To read an e- book, you need to constantly stick your eyes on tablets, phones or computer screens that can cause eye -strain.
I think we are already so attached to technology so it should be a break when it comes to books.
