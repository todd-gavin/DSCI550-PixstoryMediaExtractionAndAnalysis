In Galatians, Paul wrote: "For you were called to freedom, bretheren..."
He asserts: "Stand firm, then, and don't submit to the yoke of slavery."  
Liberty arises as the natural consequence of our relationship to God and is not bequeathed to us as the result of the benevolence of government or man made law.  

Liberty and liberty alone was the core premise around which the Nation was founded.  It was only for Liberty that the Revolutionary War wintertime soldier marched through frozen woods with bloodied feet.  No one held the line at Pickett's Charge for Social Justice. There is no Statue of Fairness in New York.  
It was only for preservation of Freedom that Army Rangers climbed hand over hand up the dunes of Normandy.  

Man within his relationship to God is free and unfettered.  We are to use our freedom to advance the will of the Creator.  Paul writes: "...do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another." 
Thus free women and men within this context are naturally diverse, equal under the law and just one to another.  

Where does Liberty come from?  The Creator.  For whom is it available?  All of us, independent of gender, race, age or income.  To the extent that we adhere to and covet our Liberty, the Nation will flourish.  Ours is the greatest nation to the extent that it remains the freest nation.  The author of Natural Law is the Creator and the gift of Natural Law is Liberty.
