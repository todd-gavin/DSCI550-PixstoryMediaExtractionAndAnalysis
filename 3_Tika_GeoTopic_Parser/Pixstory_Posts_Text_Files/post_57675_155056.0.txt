The relationship between cinema and literature is undeniable and indelible, and it has existed since the origin of both.
Although literature has a long history but people have tried to portray literature through different forms of expression.
Speaking of today, the discussion becomes more apparent as we see literature in movies.
Films are made and adapted from different canons of literature.
It is interlinked so skillfully by the writers, directors and everyone who is involved in replicating the art into movies.
It's a great work, undoubtedly, and the results are in themselves a piece of art.
It resembles and resonates with the author so perfectly that you feel more enlightened by watching a movie.
One of the best advantages of putting a book's narrative into movies is that we can see the characters and setting come alive.
It sort of widens your imagination which is sometimes unclear or blurred by reading books.
Furthermore, if you're watching an adaptation of the book you already read, then it's a bonus point for you.
It gives a chance to analyse and compare your imagination with what is portrayed in the movie.
Besides, it's a task to touch a great work of literature and then accurately put it in the movies. And here, even a little mistake could disappoint or annoy the readers and the audience that wanted to keep the original work as authentic and untouched. 
But despite everything, movies, if they correctly portray the literature, can enliven your experience both as a reader and an audience.
