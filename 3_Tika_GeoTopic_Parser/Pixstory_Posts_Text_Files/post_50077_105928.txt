Joyce Kilmer Trees I think that I shall never see A poem lovely as a tree A tree whose hungry mouth is prest Against the earth s sweet flowing breast A tree that looks at God all day And lifts her leafy arms to pray A tree that may in summer wear A nest of robins in her hair Upon whose bosom snow has lain Who intimately lives with rain Poems are made by fools like me But only God can make a tree We ve received some extraordinary artistic portrayals of trees over the years However Kilmer s portrayal positions trees in the highest regard The human like qualities he gives trees are metaphorically innocent and the final couplet drives home his arguments significance even further by claiming the medium he s utilising isn t even worthy of such a gorgeous feature of nature The poem begins with the speaker stating that he will never see a poem that is more wonderful than a tree He does not believe that humanity is capable of giving rise to something better than what God has made The following lines are devoted to the type of tree he has in mind It will have an intimate connection to the earth and its elements There will be birds nesting in the branches in the summer and gentle snow on the tree s bosom in the winter The poem concludes with the speaker explaining that no matter what humankind does no poem or piece of art will be more beautiful than what already exists on the planet Throughout Trees Kilmer explores themes of God s creation wonder and nature The poem celebrates the world that the Christian God created and wonders over its vast complexness The speaker knows very clearly and fully that he ll never see write a poem as lovely as a tree Through this statement he is admitting his incapacity to live up to the creation of the natural world The power to make something as beautiful and wonderful as a tree is reserved for God
