The special one has done it again. Jose Mourinho lead AS Roma to glittering triumph, bringing home the club's first European trophy in as long as the supporters can remember. The city has been absolutely livid for the past week and a half, with murals and banners regarding Mourinho as a saviour going around the Rome.

Following the victory however, multiple sources on the outside cited a summer switch for the Portuguese. Mourinho has in the past been linked with a return to Real Madrid and the Portuguese national team job but neither vacancies are available at the moment. PSG emerged as a potential place for Mourinho to land, with the Parisian club in need of a serial winner like Mourinho.

To this, Mourinho responded vehemently “I love being at Roma. I don’t love it when I lose, and I lose more here than at other clubs, but the people love me and I have this great feeling of empathy with the people both inside and outside the club."

Pochettino is set to be relieved off his duties in France this summer, but Mourinho isn't interested.

“Nobody lied to me, nobody conned me or promised things on the transfer market we couldn’t achieve. I am there because I love it.” he assured the AS Roma faithful.

Mourinho's football, his charisma and his treatment of a relatively youthful squad have most impressed the Italian fans. Italy is of course the country where most believe the special one feels most comfortable. At PSG, Mourinho would have to deal with a relatively star studded squad, supposedly infinite revenue and massive global reach.

For now however, he prefers the comfort of knowing the Roma fans back his ways. The heritage of the historic city seems to have engulfed even the special one, after two wear-and-tear jobs in England with Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur.
