You can t burden your children with the burden of upholding the kind of relationship YOU want with them You chose to have kids the kids didn t choose you as their parents You did them no favor Why do we think our children owe us anything for the choice WE made Why are we under the impression that we re doing them a favor and they must name their lives in our name Our children don t owe us anything Neither their time nor their respect We have to earn it You can t force someone to respect you You can instill fear sure but you can t force them to respect you And remember one thing people get over fear With time people learn how to conquer fear especially if they are associated with their childhood Be it the monster under the bed or the parent trying to control them When they re adults they distance themselves from us and we put the blame on them But in all reality we deserve it We deserve whatever they throw at us when they have the upper hand when we do not hesitate to throw at them the cruelest ways when we have the upper hand We keep forgetting one very basic thing that children are people They re not our programming machines They are going to make their choices You made choices good and bad while raising them and so can they at least for their own selves
