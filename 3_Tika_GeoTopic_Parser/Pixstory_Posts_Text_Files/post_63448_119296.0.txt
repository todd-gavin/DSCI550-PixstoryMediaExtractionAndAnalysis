West Ham United have completed the signing of Gianluca Scamacca from Serie A side Sassuolo, per transfer Football expert Fabrizio Romano. 

The Italian striker penned a 5-year deal with the Hammers for a reported fee of €36m plus €6m add-ons and 10% sell on clause becoming the fourth signing of the summer, with David Moyes already signed Alphonse Areola, Nayef Aguerd and Flynn Downes on permanent deals ahead of the new season.

The 23-year-old forward — who scored 16 goals in Serie A last season was heavily linked with a move to PSG as the French giant were already in advanced talks with the player — but preferred the Premier League as his destination instead of welcoming the chance to join a star-studded PSG team. 

Gianluca Scamacca has not featured in a preseason game this summer as he was left out of Sassuolo’s preseason camp and will be hoping to register an appearance in West Ham’s final preseason game come Saturday  against Lens in France.
