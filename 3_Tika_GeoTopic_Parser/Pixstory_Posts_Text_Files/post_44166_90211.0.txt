After coming off the bench to score late in the charity match, the former England international received the loudest applause of the afternoon. Paul Gascoigne scored a hilarious goal for Rangers in their 3-2 loss to a World Legends XI at Ibrox on Saturday.

Jorg Albertz, Ronald de Boer, Barry Ferguson, and current Rangers manager Giovanni van Bronckhorst represented Scotland in a charity match against a Rest of World team that included legends such as Luis Figo, Claude Makelele, and Gheorge Hagi.

During the game, the crowd was treated to plenty of goalmouth action, but the loudest applause was reserved for former England, Tottenham and Rangers midfielder Gascoigne, who came off the bench late on to score with a completely mistimed shot, albeit with little assistance from the opponents.

Rangers Legends were defeated 3-2 by a World Legends team at Ibrox this afternoon to commemorate the club's 150th anniversary.

There was a carnival atmosphere surrounding Ibrox as the legends rolled back the years once more as Alex McLeish coached the Gers in front of a tremendous crowd of just over 38,000.

The scoreline was flipped on its head as the game approached the hour mark, with Nuno Gomes lifting the ball over Neil Alexander with a superb finish to make it 2-1.

After several tries throughout the afternoon, World Legends made it 3-1 in the final ten minutes, with Quaresma finally finding the net with the outside of his right boot.

The loudest applause of the afternoon came when Paul Gascoigne made his long-awaited return to Ibrox following years of health troubles, going on for the final five minutes before scoring a late, late goal and claiming man of the match.
