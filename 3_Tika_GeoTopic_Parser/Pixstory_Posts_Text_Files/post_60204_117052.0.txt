England Menâ€™s all-rounder Ben Stokes, has declared his retirement from one-day international cricket after Tuesday's Royal London International match against South Africa.

With 104 ODI appearances under his belt, Stokes will conclude his international career at the Seat Unique Riverside, where he grew up playing.

Having won Player of the Match in the 2019 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup final at Lord's, the 31-year-ODI old's career will go down in history.

England won the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup for the first time in the most thrilling of circumstances thanks in part to Stokes' undefeated 84, which helped to force a Super Over.

Since making his ODI debut in 2011 against Ireland, Stokes has scored 2919 runs, including three centuries, and 74 wickets.

He has been an inspiring leader and captained the ODI team in last summer's 3-0 Royal London Series victory over Pakistan.

Ben Stokes said: "On Tuesday in Durham, I will play my final ODI for England. I have made the decision to stop using this format. Making this choice has been really difficult. I have cherished every second of playing for England alongside my friends. The trip there has been amazing.

"As difficult a decision as this was to make, accepting the truth that I can no longer give my teammates my all in this format is easier. Nobody should wear the England shirt less honourably.

"Three formats are simply no longer manageable for me. Because of the schedule and the demands placed upon us, I feel as though not only is my body failing me, but I am also depriving Jos and the rest of the squad of a player who can give their best. It's time for another cricketer to develop and create unforgettable memories, just like I have over the past 11 years.

"I will give Test cricket my all, and now that I've made this choice, I feel like I can also give the T20 format my all.
