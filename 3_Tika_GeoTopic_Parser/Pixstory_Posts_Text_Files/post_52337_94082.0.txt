Footpath space along the western side of Castlereagh Street from Liverpool Street to King Street will be nearly doubled under the City of Sydney proposal to meet demand from local businesses for alfresco dining spaces.

The 800-metre cycleway will connect to cycleways serving the eastern suburbs, inner west, north shore, and city south, and will fill a gap in the bike network connecting the north and south of Sydney.

"Improving this historic street will benefit workers, residents, visitors, and businesses seeking to recover from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic," said the Lord Mayor.


Castlereagh Street designs by the City of Sydney include:

1 Continuous access for emergency vehicles

2 Loading zones are available on the eastern side of Castlereagh Street.

3 Peak-hour bus lane, as well as a taxi drop-off and pick-up location

4 Designated drop-off and pick-up location for visitors to the Castlereagh Boutique Hotel

5 Access to properties and driveways was maintained

 6 More trees have been planted along the street.
