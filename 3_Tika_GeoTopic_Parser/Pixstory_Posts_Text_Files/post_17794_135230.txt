Many people are angry with Meghan Markle for equating her union with Prince Harry with Nelson Mandela s release from jail This includes Mandela s grandson To be fair The Duchess of Sussex claims that someone person drew the analogy but making it public backfires on her She recently told The Cut about an interaction she had at the live action Lion King film s London premiere claiming a South African cast member told her When you married into this family we rejoiced in the streets the same we did when Mandela was freed from prison However Mandla Mandela Nelson s grandson told Daily Mail that he doesn t believe that conversation ever took place based on surviving the harsh year apartheid rule in South Africa after years of colonialism Therefore it cannot be compared to being the same As you know under Apartheid rule Mandela served years in prison for sabotage and treason before his release and Mandla doesn t think South Africa s joy for that event can be fairly compared to Meghan marrying into royalty
