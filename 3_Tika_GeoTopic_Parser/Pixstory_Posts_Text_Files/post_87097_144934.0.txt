8 Daniel Sturridge
Sturridge certainly stamped his authority at Chelsea by giving opportunities to their young players. He was signed from Manchester City in 2009, and despite playing on the wings, he was also used as a false nine in the 2011-12 season, scoring 13 goals. Under new manager Roberto Di Matteo, he lost his place, but he won the Champions League and later left for Liverpool. He made 96 appearances and scored 26 goals in such a short time.

7 Tammy Abraham
Abraham came through the academy and was a key factor, even though he was loaned out to develop but was later called upon by Frank Lampard, under whom he was a technical player who made the most of the opportunities he was given at Chelsea, but many thought he did not deserve the amount of playing time he received under new manager Thomas Tuchel. Despite this, Abraham has scored 30 goals in 82 games for Chelsea, including 21 in the Premier League. He moved to Roma, where he has blossomed into a premier striker under Jose Mourinho.


6 Samuel Etoâ€™o
Eto'o began his new life under the same manager, Jose Mourinho, and despite not scoring many goals for the club, he was an important player for him. He arrived at Chelsea after a notable season with Inter Milan, and many questioned his age as he approached his early thirties, but the Portuguese manager praised the striker and said he still inhabited his nose for goal-scoring ability. After a year at the club, Eto'o scored many spectacular goals and left having made 35 appearances and scoring 12 goals.
