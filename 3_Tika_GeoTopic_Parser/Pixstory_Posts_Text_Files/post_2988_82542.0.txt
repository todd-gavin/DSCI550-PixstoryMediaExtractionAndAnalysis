‘My own belief system is smart and sound, I don’t fall for those conspiracy theories, only loony folks do.’ Trouble is, everybody thinks so. It would’ve been funny if the matter was not so grave. What is it that makes conspiracy theories so sticky? After a survey, a research team offers some clues to their hold on our reasoning capacity. (But, hold on – how different ‘conspiracy theories’ are from new thinking in science and society that challenged received wisdom but came to be accepted afterwards?)

The team of political scientists, computer scientists, and literature and culture critics made a list of 27 well-known beliefs like those about the Kennedy assassination, 5G cellular wireless technology, Obama’s birth certificate, Covid-19 and climate change. They surveyed a representative sample of 2,023 Americans in March 2020 and 2,015 in October 2020. Their finding: Nine out of 10 Americans believed in at least one conspiracy theory (which are proven wrong with incontrovertible evidence).

For explanation, they turn to two dimensions: “the first regards partisan and ideological identities, while the other is composed of anti-social orientations, such as narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and acceptance of political violence”: https://jspp.psychopen.eu/index.php/jspp/article/view/5649 

Among other interesting findings:

*Republicans or democrats, nobody is especially proof. All fall for it, provided the theory shows the other side in bad light or supports your notions about them.  

*Some conspiracy theories are about the kind of topics in which only experts know the right from the wrong – like health or science – and therefore the rest of us are not in position to debunk them. 

*Many such theories are like astrology, a fun diversion that remains harmless. The rest can be outright harmful to some individuals, groups, businesses or nations. 

*Powerful people are usual targets. Sometimes it’s worth analyzing theories not in terms of the target (say, Obama), but who the theory could be helping, who could be the source. 

Since conspiracy theories are no longer about UFOs and Elvis Presley but deal with (and impact) elections outcomes, the subject should be taken with utmost seriousness. Enthusiastically debunking others is welcome, but subjecting your own blind spots is more important. Try this:
