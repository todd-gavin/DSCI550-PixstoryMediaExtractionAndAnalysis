A person with knowledge of the situation said Monday night that Kevin Durant has reiterated his desire to be dealt to Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai, which he initially made about six weeks ago. According to the source who spoke to The Associated Press under the condition of anonymity because neither the venerable All-Star nor the Nets organisation publicly confirmed the conversation's specifics, Durant also expressed his concerns to Tsai regarding the team's direction under head coach Steve Nash and general manager Sean Marks. Details of the most recent Durant-Tsai meeting were first published by The Athletic.
Tsai tweeted on Monday night, "Our front office and coaching staff have my backing. "We'll make choices that are best for the Brooklyn Nets,"
