Hustle was a very refreshing movie for me as a basketball player and a fan After movies like Coach Carter The Way Back etc there hadn t been too many good basketball movies but this was it First off every basketball fan knows that Adam Sandler is a huge basketball fan himself and loves to play the game So a movie which he co produces with Lebron James I expect it to be good and it sure didn t let me down Anything that gets me more info into how the NBA functions is just my thing It s a must watch movie and the fact that Anthony Edwards was the main antagonist made it much more fun I don t necessarily like him irl lmao
