Mother-to-be Alia Bhatt, who is all set for the release of her upcoming film Brahmastra, shared a few pictures on social media from the film's pre-release event in Hyderabad.✅🎬

Since Alia Bhatt joined husband Ranbir Kapoor for the promotions of their film Brahmastra, she has been putting up stunning appearances without making much effort to hide her baby bump. 🤰🏼✅✅
At a promotional event in Hyderabad on Friday, Alia went all the way to flaunt ‘baby on Board’ written on her back. The actor was in a dark pink sharara and proudly turned around to give the guests a better glimpse at the message on the back. 😇😇😱😱😱😱
The ensemble also had the word “love" embellished in gold. Needless to say, Alia looked breathtakingly gorgeous in the outfit. Fans also gave a big thumbs-up to Alia’s cute outfit. 😍😍😍😍😍

Alia paired her look with heavy earrings and hair in soft curls. Ranbir was a complete contrast in an all-black look as he stood beside Alia while she showed the design on her back to the audience. Her look went on to become a rage on the internet in no time.✅✅😇😇😇

Reacting to a paparazzo video of Alia from the event, a fan wrote, “Baby abhi se promotion me help kar rha hai (the baby is already helping them in promotions).” Some also wrote “awww” and “cute” in the comments section. “This is so cute,” read yet another comment. Praising the attire, a fan also said, “Wow dress kamal ka hai (the dress is amazing).” ❤️❤️❤️✅✅✅

Brahmastra's pre-release event also included Ranbir Kapoor, Mouni Roy, Nagarjuna, Karan Johar and SS Rajamouli among others. Actor Jr NTR was also present at the event as its chief guest ✅✅🎬🎬🎬

Ayan Mukerji's Brahmastra will have a three-part release. Its first part is all set to hit the big screen on September 9. The film was in talks since 2014. Brahmastra marks the first collaboration between parents-to-be Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt.✅🎬❤️
