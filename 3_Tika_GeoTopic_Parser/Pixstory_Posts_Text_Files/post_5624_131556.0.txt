While hearing a plea from a couple seeking protection, Delhi High court said that a girl can marry on attaining puberty without the consent of her parents under Muslim Law.
The couple went to the high court after the girl's parents registered a case against the man for kidnapping their daughter.
According to the parents, their daughter was 15 years old while the man was 25 years when they got married.
The parents of the girl, registered a case in Dwarka district under sections 376 of the Indian Penal Code and section 6 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act on March 5 alleging that the minor was kidnapped. The couple got married on March 11.
The couple then moved on to the high court seeking protection. The girl's council submitted her Aadhar Card citing that she is 19 years old and, thus, not a minor.
They also argued that the girl wasn't kidnapped and married out of her own will and consent.
The girl also informed the court that she was beaten by her parents and was forced to marry someone else against her will 
Justice Jasmeet Singh observed, "A girl on attaining puberty could marry without the consent of her parents under the Muslim laws and has the right to reside with her husband even when she is otherwise minor. The provisions of POCSO will not apply to the husband."
"It is thus clear that that as per Mohammedan Law, the girl who had attained the age of puberty could marry without the consent of her parents and had the right to reside with her husband even when she was less than 18 years of age and thus otherwise a minor girl," observed justice Singh in an order of August 17, 2022, which was released on Monday.
