Fear, in my opinion, is only useful when it is kept to a minimum. For complete mastery of this feeling only leads to overthinking, which pacifies all of our mental faculties; and in this case, dread is a dangerous and unnecessary phenomenon. When used less emotionally as a tool, however, the emotion in question can provide us with enormous benefits. Anxiety enhances all of our abilities by causing a natural defensive response that causes increased focus. Although such a state is brief and exhausting, it allows us to solve a specific problem in an efficient and effective manner. As a result, when used correctly, fright can influence certain events.
