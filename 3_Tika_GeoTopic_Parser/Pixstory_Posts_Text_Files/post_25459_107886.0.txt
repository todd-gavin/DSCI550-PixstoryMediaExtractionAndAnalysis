For the first time, she goes into detail about what her experience with school trips has been like over the years.
The first time her junior high school planned a trip to Kyoto, Komi was completely alone and didn't have any friends at all. To further compound her problem, she didn't have a way of communicating during that time, not even by notepad as she does now. When the teacher had the students select their groups, Komi was naturally left out, and she was only added to a group through a game of jankenpon (rock, paper, scissors). This made Komi feel like an inconvenience to the other students, especially since she couldn't tell if they found her bothersome or if they were actually okay with her being in their group. In the end, she skipped going on the trip.
In the present, Komi is experiencing similar anxieties, as the current school trip is triggering painful memories for her. Tadano tries to reassure her that this trip won't be like her junior high school one because she has friends now. When Komi tries to point out that her current group of friends has better friends who are easier to talk to, Tadano is quick to argue out that she has him and Najimi, who will always be by her side. Komi then reminds him that their teacher established a rule that there would be groups of three boys and three girls, with no mixing of the genders. This means that Tadano won't be in Komi's group, and it's uncertain if Najimi will be in her group since their gender is unknown.
With all doors seemingly closing on a pleasant school trip experience, Tadano suggests that they both skip the school trip together, but Komi advises against it. He then suggests that they go to Kyoto together -- just the two of them -- and Komi hangs up. This causes Tadano to panic, as he thinks she construed this as creepy behavior. Komi reassures him that they should go on the school trip with their class and that she is excited to go this time.
