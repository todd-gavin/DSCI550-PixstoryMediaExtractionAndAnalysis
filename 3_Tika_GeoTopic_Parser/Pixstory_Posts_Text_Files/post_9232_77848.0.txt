On Martyr's Day, I pay homage to the father of nation, Mahatma Gandhi, and other freedom fighters who sacrificed their everything for the nation.

Let's come together to build the India of their dreams!

Do you know?
This is not the only Martyrs’ Day that India observes. March 23 is also marked as Martyrs’ Day, the day on which Bhagat Singh, Shivaram Rajguru and Sukhdev Thapar were hanged.
