Tibet-China Relations

In return, the Lama would teach the Patron and his non-Tibetan subjects, pray for them and conduct the religious services deemed necessary for their well-being. By this system, the protected was entitled to all assistance, including military services, of his Protector, and the Protector was obliged by his religious duty to provide these services. The Mongols and Manchus followed these mutual obligations, and even during the Manchu rule over China, Tibet was not taxed, an exemption which had been started by the Mongols. In fact, Tibet was the only area of the Mongol Empire which was not subjected to taxes.

One of the Mongol Khans, Goden (a.k.a. Koten), second son of Ogodei, and cousin of Kublai, had just begun his advance into Tibet in 1239 CE after moving from Sichuan into the territory of the Tibetan Golok community, in present-day Aba Autonomous Region, in preparation for an attack on Dali in Yunnan, when his father Ogodei’s death halted further Mongol campaigning. When Goden returned in 1244 CE, he had decided to acquire religion, and ‘invited' Tibet’s most renowned scholar, 62-year old Sakya Pandita to his camp in Wuwei, 1700 km away, in what was virtually a summons. His acceptance of Buddhism and the appointment of Sakya Pandita as the Mongol agent in Tibet in 1246 CE marks the beginning of the Choe-Yon relationship. 

Many other Mongol princes of Chinggis’ family also made separate Choe-Yon relationships with other Tibetan Budhhist sects and monasteries as well, but from this point onwards Sakya Pandita’s Gelugpa sect had officially almost become the temporal rulers of Tibet, under Mongol military authority.
