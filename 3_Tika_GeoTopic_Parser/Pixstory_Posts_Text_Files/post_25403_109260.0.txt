The story centers on Mio, a high school boy who lost his parents at an early age. Shun, a gay aspiring novelist living near Mio's house on a remote island in Okinawa, noticed Mio sitting for hours at a bench on the beach.
They grew closer to each other, but Mio had to leave Okinawa. Three years later, Mio returns to face his feelings.
My rating: 5/5
