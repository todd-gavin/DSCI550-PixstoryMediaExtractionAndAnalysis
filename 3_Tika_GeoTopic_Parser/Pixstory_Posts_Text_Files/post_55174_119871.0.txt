It is also known as the fierce snake or small-scaled snake and it is found in cracks and crevices in dry rocky plains where the Queensland, South Australia, New South Wales and Northern Territory borders converge

Reclusive and rare, the inland taipan hides out in its remote, rocky habitat. This snake only makes the top 10 because of its highly toxic venom, considered to be the most potent of any land snake in the world; it has the potential to kill an adult human within 45 minutes.

Hunting in the confined space of the burrows of the long-haired rat, the inland taipan uses its potent venom to finish off prey quickly, injecting more than 40,000 times the amount needed to kill a 200g rat. The prey has little chance of fighting back.

Only a handful of people (all snake handlers) have been bitten by this species. Each survived with first aid and hospitalisation.
