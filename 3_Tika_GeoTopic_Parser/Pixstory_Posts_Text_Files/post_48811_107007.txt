It s always good to be reminded that Ronaldo already admitted to the rape in his first deposition It doesn t matter what happens in court we know it happened by his own admission No matter how much his fans protest it will not change the fact that he violated a woman without her consent Ronaldo paid Mayorga a few months later as part of an out of court settlement In exchange Mayorga signed an agreement to never talk about her accusations that Cristiano Ronaldo had raped her Now many people are shaming Mayorga for taking the money as a way of staying silent but that s an entirely different thing neither does it change the fact that Ronaldo is a filthy rich man with an insane fanbase and has much power over his victim s It does not change the fact that he in fact committed such a heinous act and admitted it in a leaked conversation with his lawyers But hey ignore ALL THAT and punish the victim because the evidences were brought by illegal means This man is getting away with rape but the victim is paying the fine for fetching the evidences in the way she could AND is forbidden from filing a plea again You couldn t pay me enough to believe this system is anything if not against women The entire system is rooted in patriarchy where women time and again are paying the price for being the victims It s not on us to decide whether or not it happened because when the public is the jury the verdict often comes against the victim Our conclusion would not change the truth that the soccer player admitted himself What s funny is he lost no support whatsoever unlike the female accused in any case The misogynist public never fails their nature after all
