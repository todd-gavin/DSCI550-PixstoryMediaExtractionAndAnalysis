Russo has an eye for gold, as she has 3 assists, more than her tally of 1 assist in the previous season. However, she ranks 1.00 per 90 in passes which leads to shots compared to last season where she ranked 2.54 per 90. Her defense splitting passes are low as Marc Skinner is slowly easing her into the first team, and we shouldn’t forget that in 2020/21 matches she had only played 4 matches. Russo has already made a name for herself but this is just the beginning.

She ranks 2.00 per 90 in successful dribbles, having 94 percentile. 

Defensive Actions


Coming to her defensive actions, she doesn’t rank great in defensive actions. It is understandable as she is a striker.But she tracks back a lot, when her team needs her.Ona who is a right back, usually drifts narrow to help her team,so Russo has to track back and cover the wide positions, which is left exposed by the wingback. Russo has made 14 tackles out of which she was able successfully to dispossess opponents 9 times. She ranks only 0.94 per 90 in tackles she has made and if we compare it with her last season it was 1.29 per 90. The Mancunian has made a total 16 of shots stopping interceptions and 18 goal-line clearances. Russo ranks 1.07 per 90 in intercepting shots, passes, crosses, and dangerous passes and 1.20 per 90 in important goal-line clearances.
