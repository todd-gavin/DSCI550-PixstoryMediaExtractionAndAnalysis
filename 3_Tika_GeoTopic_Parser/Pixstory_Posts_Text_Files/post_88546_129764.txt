By the end of Tuesdays the week may seem long annoying and hectic what we really just need is a break in order to get some mid week motivation to keep going Taking a break is all about self love midst of work load Thing which keeps me motivated during the monotonous schedule is by taking a break from the routine and start working on my hobbies and interests For example to learn a new guitar chord to write my own song or poetry to go for a long walk in the evening and stop by a cute cafe for a cup of coffee
