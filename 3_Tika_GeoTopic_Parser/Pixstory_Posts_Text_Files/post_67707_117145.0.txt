I know that i am not perfect but i always look for new opportunities and experiences which can reduce my negetive points. To say about myself there are not very long story. I am a just normal student who is not very much highly qualified or has a remarkable history is academics but the thing which distinguish me from other people is the always positive mentality. What the situation has arrived in my life I always stick to my points and did what i wanted to do. This type of attitude sometime fall me into trouble . I am not influenced by other people easily as I have a strong belief on myself and by credibility. But I have some negative points that i can't take decisions easily. So this fall me into trouble sometime as processes take long time to complete. I am a person who is always eager to learn and I want to try different subjects and different fields. This different tastes make me another type of people who has no common goal  but a different journey. I have a plan to become a master in many fields but it is not like multitasking . In multitasking we try to do work simultaneously but no work is done without scrolling from one wirk to another. It can be understood by an analogy. When we was kid we learn many things like speaking, walking etc but this things are not happen simultaneously this happens oneby one So plan is to do the work in this manner.
