Did you know that 2.5 km of Uluru is underground?

Uluru is a massive rock in Australia's red heart, surrounded by scrubland and revered by several Aboriginal tribes. It is one of the few places on the planet that has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site on both the cultural and ecological levels. 

As per travel nation, surprisingly, roughly 2.5 kilometres of the rock is assumed to be beneath, connected to the Olgas, from whence it emerges 16 miles away. 

The greatest way to appreciate Uluru's stark beauty is to see it after sunset, and after dark, the pitch-black skies show a plethora of dazzling stars. Uluru is easily accessible from Alice Springs, either by plane or as a stop on the Ghan, the Adelaide-Darwin railway.
