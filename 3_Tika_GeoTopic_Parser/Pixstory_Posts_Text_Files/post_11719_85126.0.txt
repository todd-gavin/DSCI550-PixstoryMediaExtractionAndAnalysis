Let's find out the benefits of this trending oil


•Rich in oleic acid, a very healthy fat 

Avocado oil is the natural oil pressed from the pulp of an avocado. Almost 70% of avocado oil consists of heart-healthy oleic acid, a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid. 

This fatty acid is also the main component of olive oil and is believed to be partly responsible for its health benefits. Additionally, around 12% of avocado oil is saturated fat, and about 13% is polyunsaturated fat. 

•Reduces cholesterol and improves heart health 

Avocado oil is rich in unsaturated fatty acids, which are linked with better heart health. 

In a small crossover study in 13 subjects, participants were first given either a control meal using butter (25 grams of saturated fat) or a test meal (25 grams of unsaturated fat) with avocado oil. 

•High in lutein, an antioxidant that has benefits for the eyes 

Avocado and its oil are relatively good sources of lutein, a carotenoid and antioxidant that’s naturally found in your eyes. 

Research has shown that a diet rich in lutein and another carotenoid called zeaxanthin is essential for eye health and may reduce the risk of cataracts and macular degeneration, which are common age-related eye diseases.
