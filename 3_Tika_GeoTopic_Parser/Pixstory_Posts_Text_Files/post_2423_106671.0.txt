When girls are on periods (menstruating) we get lots of food advice. Don’t eat this, eat that. So what is it that we should be eating ?


MY Answer
First and most important advice. 
Keep a diet which is low on salt  and is easy to digest. 
Simple things like a khichri -rice and lentil porridge or Dal Chawal (lentil broth with rice) is good .
Have soups and cooked vegetables. 
Dals-the light ones not the heavy ones like red beans. 
Lot of people ask me if eating chocolates is fine- the answer is yes it’s fine . You can also improve your periods by having more jaggery and sesame seeds -which are warming foods . One should also avoiding cold foods and foods which are not too spicy either. 
Probiotics help .
Supplements like magnesium and primrose  also help but take them under supervision.
