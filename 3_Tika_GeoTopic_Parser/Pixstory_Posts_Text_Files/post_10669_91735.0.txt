Indian men win the battle of Penalty Corners, as Dutch eves put 10 past USA

Lausanne, Switzerland: India and England played out another thriller as a back and forth match saw 7 goals, all from penalty corners, 4-3 in favour of India. England took an early lead in the match as they had done last night. But India went back level through Manpreet and never trailed again. India’s Harmanpreet Singh scored a hat-trick notching his 100th goal for India and while England twice managed to reduce the deficit to 1 goal, they could not find a leveller and India took all 3 points.

Netherlands with a second dominant win in two days against their lower ranked opponents, USA. The Dutch were a lot more clinical today scoring 10 goals, with 6 players getting on the score sheet, with Yibbi Jansen scoring a hat-trick. USA showed much more intent in attack compared to the last game, but it left them exposed on defence, and despite Kelsey Bing’s usual brilliance, they conceded 10 to their clinical Dutch counterparts.

India vs England (men) - Kalinga Stadium, Bhubaneswar (IND)

England coach Zak Jones spoke before the game about the threat India posed from the Penalty Corners and after a terrific effort from his team in yesterday’s game on that front, the floodgates opened up today as India won 10 of them, converting from 4, to snatch a win in another thrilling contest that kept the fans on the edge of their seats till the 60th minute once again.

The game started much more evenly, but England once again got the first goal through an innovative penalty corner that was deflected in by Sanford, who scored his first ever international goal for England. India countered back with a similar routine from a penalty corner routine and scored via Manpreet Singh who got his first goal since 2019. Two more penalty corners from India in a dominant 2nd quarter saw Harmanpreet give India a 3-1 lead into the half time, but the English team never stopped believing.
