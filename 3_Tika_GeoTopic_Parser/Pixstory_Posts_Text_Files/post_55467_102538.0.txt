Nothing is simple.
Everyone arrives holding something different. Values,
experiences, goals.
Usually, showing up for your mental health is portrayed as a linear path. But it's much more complicated than starting therapy or meditating every day.
Sometimes, it's about acknowledging how difficult this can be. It isn't linear, and it isn't easy.
I started my counseling journey six months ago, initially attended all the sessions and worked so hard to better myself. After a few sessions it felt like a burden, and so I left.
It may have not been the right decision but all I know is I shouldn’t have given up. And so I started journaling, I started talked to my friends about how I feel.
Therapy is a spectrum and it’s best to find yourself in any part of it. Even a little is a great deal. 
And that's why we all keep going.
