In the streets of Kabul, dozens of very young children dart in and out of traffic chasing cars and begging for money. Store shelves and vegetable markets are well stocked yet hardly anyone can afford to shop. In a Kandahar hospital, emaciated children lie motionless in two in a bed too weak even to cry at a peak time for severe acute malnutrition A 25-year-old mother of five told me her family survives on a diet of bread and water This is the story of the Director General of the UNICEF Catherine Russell at the end of a three-day mission in Afghanistan And things are set to get even worse Our projections for the million-plus children will need treatment for severe acute malnutrition Nearly millions of children will need humanitarian assistance Illnesses such as measles and acute watery diarrhea will continue to spread Till of all Afghan families could be living below the poverty line within months This is no way of life Afghanistan&#39;s children cannot be held hostage by politics Decisions and the actions taken today will determine whether these children live or die whether they suffer or thrive and ultimately whether the country survives or decays UNICEF is on the ground and doing everything it can to assist the children We are training teachers establishing community-based classes vaccinating children against preventable childhood diseases by improving access to water and sanitation and providing treatment for severe acute malnutrition I urge the de facto authorities to translate their promises on women&#39;s and children&#39;s rights into concrete action and enable all girls to go to school and all women to return to work without further delay I urge you to do your best to get services back up and running including paying teachers health workers and other civil servants
