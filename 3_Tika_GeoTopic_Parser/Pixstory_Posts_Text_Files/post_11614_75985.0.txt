Here are some more tips to help you build muscle on the keto diet:Stay patient. If you’re new to keto, you may experience an initial drop in strength and performance. It’s important to note that this drop is temporary, occurring as your body adapts — so be patient and don’t quit early.

▪️Track your carb intake: This helps ensure that you eat fewer than 50 grams of carbs per day to stay in ketosis.

▪️Prepare for initial side effects: When some people start this diet, they may experience the keto flu — a collection of symptoms, such as fatigue, nausea, irritability, and insomnia, that occur as your body adapts to its new regimen.
