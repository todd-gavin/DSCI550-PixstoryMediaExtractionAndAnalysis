Andy Cole
Cole is one of the best strikers in Premier League history, with 187 goals to his name, trailing only Alan Shearer and Wayne Rooney as the competition's top scorers. Cole was another Manchester United player who made his reputation before going on to the Red Devils' rivals later in his career.
He played for United for six years, scoring 93 goals in the Premier League. He was also a member of the 1999 Champions League-winning team, as well as a five-time league champion. Cole's only season with Manchester City was in 2005/06, when he scored ten goals in 23 appearances across all competitions.





Brian Kidd
It only seems right to include someone on this list who excelled at City rather than United. Kidd began his career with United, where he played in the first squad for seven years. With 52 goals in 203 league games, he didn't have a remarkable goal scoring record. He was, however, a member of the 1967/68 United team that won the European Cup.

Kidd signed with City in 1976 and stayed for three years, scoring 44 goals in 98 appearances. Kidd went one step further following his playing days by joining the coaching staffs of both clubs. Between 1991 to 1998, he worked as Sir Alex Ferguson's assistant at United. He has been at Manchester City since 2009, serving as assistant manager during the club's most successful period.
