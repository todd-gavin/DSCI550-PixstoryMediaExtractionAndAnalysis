Out of all Premier League sides, the Hammers had the least lineup changes (61) of any team throughout the course of the season, with Chelsea topping the same chart with over 130. That was one of the criticisms of Moyes' approach, which regarded that he had a few clear favourites and other players that simply did not play. The final game of the group stages in Europe and a few other late-season Premier League games were the few countable times they rotated the team well. 

West Ham ended the season poorly, losing 3-1 to Brighton and Hove Albion having lead at half time. Crystal Palace beat Manchester United in the corresponding fixture, which meant that a win at Brighton would've sent West Ham back to the Europa league and Man United to the conference. They found themselves in fourth come January, well on course for a Top 6 finish but things simply went wayward from there. Still, they can pride themselves over the fact that they've done better than most other mid-table teams in competing with the best.

Hit of the Season: Declan Rice. Rice was the standout player at the London Stadium alongside Jarrod Bowen this season. His physical presence in midfield, added to his technical skills gave Moyes the perfect box to box midfielder for high-intensity European fixtures.

Flop of the Season: Nikola Vlašić. The Croatian was brought in for €30M last summer, but failed to catch the eye. He can play across midfield, and on the wings and might be a formal replacement for the outgoing Mark Noble next season.

Top Scorer: Jarrod Bowen. Rice ran the show but Bowen did West Ham's business in the final third this season. 12 Goals and 10 Assists in a team which was desperate for goals during vital stretches of the season. Exceptional stuff, but that England call-up is still distant.
