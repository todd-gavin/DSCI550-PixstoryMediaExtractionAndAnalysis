Mikel Arteta, Premier League side Arsenal's current coach, is one of the most renowned names in world football at the moment. His brilliant piece of management and amazing knowledge of the game has put him in the list of elites already. 
The man who made it both as a pro footballer and also a coach has proved his worth in both aspects of the game on several occasions. Born in 1982, Arteta who began his senior career way back in 1999 in Barcelona want provided with much game time. With time he began to make moves (both permanent and via loans) to different clubs including PSG,Rangers , Real Sociedad and Everton. 
Despite getting some success under Pep Guardiola in Arsenal after joining for them in 2011, he failed to have any majorly significant moments during his period with the gunners too except winning a couple of domestic cups. The sequence of events that followed thereon weren't desirable for Arteta which lead to his retirement in the year 2016. 
After retirement, Arteta had been provided a handful of options to kick start his managerial career. He got offers from Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham. However the option he found most appropriate for himself was to join Manchester City as an assistant coach alongside pep Guardiola, whom he has worked with earlier during his time in arsenal. 
As Manchester City's coach, Arteta bagged a couple of Premier League trophies, an FA Cup and two EFL cups. It was in the period of 2018-19 that Arteta began strongly being linked to his former side Arsenal. It was in December of 2019 that Arteta was appointed as the head coach of the gunners.

His first victory as a manager for Arsenal came in January 2020 when Arsenal handed Manchester United a 2-0 defeat at home. Things got even better for Arsenal under Arteta when they won the FA cup by outplaying Chelsea 2-1 in the finals.
