In all honesty American Christians can really contradict Christ at times They follow Christ but do what they want instead of what Christ says They say they love God but do not obey what He says They say they are Christian but behave in an un Christlike manner towards other people Some of them would hate to admit it but there are times when they just follow their own principles They read the Bible but fail to obey it Here are some classic examples When they don t give grace to others The Bible says that it is unbecoming of Christain when they fail to pass on the grace of god and make sure that there fellow man is not suffering However it s ironic that there are laws in America which prohibit homeless people to rom sitting sleeping or resting in public spaces There are laws which criminalise being homeless to the point that asking for money is chargeable with fines and penalties in many cities across America When we are self righteous Self righteous is inherently un Christlike Jesus never acted as if He was the only one who never committed any sin The imposition of abortion laws on women in America in the name of saving a life which has been proved scientifically that there is no life to be saved within the legal period allowed for abortion in itself is a different height of Self Righteousness This need to be self righteous and holier than thou attitude is not only hurting the spirit of a nation but is also regressive to the point where its hysterical that there is a debate on women s bodies where their opinions aren t being adhered to It s quite clear that Christianity and its true principles need to find its roots in America before such tragic misgivings destroy a nation and an entire generation as a whole
