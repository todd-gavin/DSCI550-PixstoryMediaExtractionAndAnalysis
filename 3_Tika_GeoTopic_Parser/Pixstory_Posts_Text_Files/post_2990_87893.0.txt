British-Iranian aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and dual national Anousheh Ashouri have left Iran after spending years in detention. The Iranian regime accused Zaghari-Ratcliffe of plotting to overthrow the government and spent six years in prison. Ashouri spent five years.

But the reason for her Zaghari-Ratcliffe's imprisonment was something else. Iran was using her as a pawn to force the U.K. government to pay its $530 million debt to Tehran. The debt has been owed for nearly 40 years. The debt included the main part of the prepayment (and its interest) that Iran had given to Britain for Chieftain battle tanks that had not been delivered to Iran.

Wearing a blue dress and a yellow scarf, the colours of Ukraine, Zaghari-Ratcliffe landed at the Oxfordshire airbase in the early hours of Thursday morning in a chartered flight from Oman. She had reached Oman from Iran. ( https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/17/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-anoosheh-ashoori-returns-uk-six-years-iran-prison )

Although Britain's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said that her country "took every precaution" that debt repayment would not be used to buy weapons by the Islamic regime, it is unlikely to cut much ice in Britain. ( https://www.arabnews.com/node/2044426/world )

According to Iranian media, the plane carrying both the people took off only after the Iranians received the money. Britain has never disputed that it owed money to Iran. Still, because of international sanctions and its close relations with the U.S. it had become almost impossible for the country to pay it back.

Iran's Revolutionary Guard had claimed that Zaghari-Ratcliffe participated in the "design and implementation of cyber and media projects to cause the soft toppling of the Islamic Republic." She was arrested in Tehran in July 2016 when she was returning to U.K. after visiting her parents in Iran.

But with Zaghari-Ratcliffe's detention becoming International news and a source of embarrassment for Britain, it had very few options.
