With artists like K/DA and aespa on the rise in the K-Pop industry, the music genre is growing ever more creative with its use of virtual reality and AI.

While these two artists are the most well-known among K-Pop fans, there’s another completely virtual artist that most are probably unaware of. And not only that… She’s also a rabbit.

Meet Apoki, the AI-generated rabbit K-Pop idol who may just blow you away with her musical talents.

Apoki posted her first video on YouTube on April 22, 2019, which was a cover of Kehlani‘s “Honey”. Since then, she has posted numerous vocal and dance covers by Korean and American artists alike.

She made her debut as a K-Pop idol herself on February 22, 2021 with the song “Get It Out”… And the music video and song are both fire.

Apoki even has a page on KProfiles, which states that she enjoys TWICE and BTS, and that she describes herself as “A rabbit drawing a map for future virtual influencers”.

She’s active on many different social media platforms apart from YouTube, including Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook. Her biggest platform is TikTok, where she has 3.4 million followers!
