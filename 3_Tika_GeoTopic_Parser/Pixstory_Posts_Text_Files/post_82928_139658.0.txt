THE PEN IS MIGHTER THAN THE SWORD
 The famous saying signifies that  writing is a very powerful tool then brutality. It was said by an English author Edward Bulwer  Lytton in 1839. A pen can achieve more than a sword. It shows that the power of writing is under dying or everlasting. It defines that thinking and writing is more powerful than the violence. Sword may be bigger in size than a pen but it does not have the power as a pen. 
The power of sword shows death, destruction, etc. But the power of pen shows inspiration, motivation, etc. A  sword conquer the physical existence of a person while a pen conquer the mind. It says the power of writing.
