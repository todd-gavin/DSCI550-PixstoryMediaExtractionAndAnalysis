The Portugal National Football Team on paper is one of the best teams they have world class players all over every position and have amazing backups as well The Portugal Manager Fernando Santos usually employs either the or formation he employs a defensive approach to the team and they play on the counter Many have criticised his approach but he won the Euro with the same style So he ll most definitely use the same tactics The Playing will be a little hard to choose as all of them are performing at a great level domestically The GK will most likely be between the pair of the veteran Rui Patricio or Diogo Costa The Defensive Line has almost chosen itself Cancelo as RB Pepe and Dias are the CBs and finally Nuno Mendes as the left back The Midfield will mostly likely feature a double pivot of Ruben Neves and William Carvalho Bruno Fernandes will play more of an attacking midfielder role in the team The front three will likely consist of Rafael Le o from the left Cristiano Ronaldo as the centre forward and finally Bernado Silva from the right Now this is just a probable line up and Santos can always chop and change as he has options like Andre Silva Palhinha Felix Jota and others This Portugal Team is one of the favourites to go all the way through to the Finals
