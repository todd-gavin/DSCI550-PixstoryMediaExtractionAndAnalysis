Khardung La is not for the thin blooded Although it s an easy winding climb up But it s the sheer altitude which ensures that you don t take it lightly One minute you can be fine posing in front of the feet board feeling giddy to be on top of the world and the next minute the on top of the world giddy feeling gets real and acute and you are slightly sick Fortunately help is at hand and after some pure oxygen and piping hot tea you make sure you get down to the lower reaches of mother earth ASAP But it seems the lack of oxygen has affected our brains a bit because we can t resist stopping again some way down to have an icicle battle The melting snow has exposed them right along the road The descent on the other side seems lesser till we realize that the slope has plateaued before falling down into the serene valley and the turquoise Shyok winds its way at the bottom It s a sunny warm valley with the mighty Karakoram mountains flanking one side Wow One had only read about them in school books and now here we are across the last range of the Himalayas and knocking on the doors of the next great range Fantastic One leg of the valley heads off towards Siachen and the other towards Turtuk Due to paucity of time Darn that factor again We make pit stops nearby only At the hot spring in Panamik which is enroute to Siachen there is a basic structure with clean men s and women s sections It is deserted and the water is hot and thankfully not smelly at all In the warm haze we see whirlwinds dancing across the valley floor near Diskit The monastery seems to have grown organically from the mountainside The imposing statue of Maitreya Buddha near it looms large as it looks benignly westwards The monastery houses apart from statues of some pretty fierce looking deities a mummified head and an arm of a medieval soldier It takes a little searching in that room full of ancient relics To be continued
