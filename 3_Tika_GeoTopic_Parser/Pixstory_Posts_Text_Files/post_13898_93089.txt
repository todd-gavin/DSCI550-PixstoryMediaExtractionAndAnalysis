One day in when I was a cub reporter with the newspaper Greater Kashmir I was discussing a story idea with a senior editor when a man walked into the newsroom and called my name I asked him to sit down and inquired about the purpose of his visit mistaking him for one of those people who would often walk into the newspaper s office with a grievance they desperately wanted to get into print But he said he was a sub inspector with the crime investigation department and had to ask me a few questions Routine work he assured me speaking in Kashmiri and Urdu He then proceeded to ask me about my parents my address and my favourite books and authors Then the polite policeman asked me something with such frankness that I felt both amused and repulsed Were you ever associated with any militant organisation he said and smiled Lashkar e Taiba I said and returned the smile By now the senior colleagues in the newsroom were also smiling suggesting that this was a familiar ritual to them Before leaving the CID man said in a half apologetic tone that he was only carrying out the orders of his bosses My seniors told me there was nothing to worry about All of them had undergone this baptism which I learnt was called the BG note or background note One editor said it was the government s way of inventorying a newcomer into journalism The CID could have discovered those facts about me without that fleeting interrogation Why then enact a police station quiz in a newsroom The seniors had figured out the answer the very point of the exercise was to brazenly intimidate journalists Soon after my interrogation a senior colleague told me one of the wisest points I have ever heard about Kashmiri media You should worry and worry seriously when they stop threatening you It is ok as long as they talk to you and threaten you suggesting that for a journalist working in the state intimidation should be seen as a regular phenomenon whereas silence would suggest that something more sinister might be underway
