F Driver Carlos Sainz who drive for Scuderia Ferrari since last year extended his contract till which means Carlos Sainz will be a member of Ferrari till until and unless Ferrari sacks him for bad performances in the future In a statement Carlos Sainz said I am very happy to have renewed my contract with Scuderia Ferrari I have always said that there is no better Formula team to race for and after over a year with them I can confirm that putting on this race suit and representing this team is unique and incomparable My first season at Maranello was solid and constructive with the whole group progressing together The result of all that work has been clear to see so far season I feel strengthened by this renewed show of confidence in me and now I can t wait to get in the car do my best for Ferrari and to give its fans plenty to cheer about The F is proving to be a front runner which can allow me to chase my goals on track starting with taking my first Formula win So let s hope for more pole positions and podiums for Carlos Sainz and I wish he remains the smooth operator for Ferrari in the future also
