Many researches indicate that the demand for global energy will rise by more than 25 by 2040, taking into aunt of the increase in population and incomes. Even in the most assertive low-carbon scenario, oil and natural gas will meet approximately half of that demand, without them it will be a great task to tackle given that we have advancement but less access to harnessing renewable sources. 

Reliable and affordable energy is the most important factor here as we humans need to survive and do our daily activities. So best is to responsibly harness all forms of energy if we are to meet growing global demand and simultaneously tackle the challenge of climate change.

The choice is not between fossil fuels and renewable energy, but rather, how to stimulate the growth of renewables while lessening greenhouse gas emissions from the use of fossil fuels.

We also are investing in energy-efficient cogeneration technology to curtail emissions from burning petroleum coke and export low-carbon power. This will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2.5 million tons per year, equivalent to eliminating 550,000 vehicles from the road. People need to understand that cutting out fossil fuels is not the option but using energy whatever its source efficiently for human use is the most important factor here.
