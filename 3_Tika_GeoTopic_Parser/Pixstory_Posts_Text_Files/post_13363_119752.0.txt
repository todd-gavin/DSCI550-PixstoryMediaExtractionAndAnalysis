life was supposed to be more beautiful, men and women were supposed to work together. have fun, go to school and university, the number of rapes against women and girls was not supposed to increase day by day, suicides and self-immolations, field courts, ear and nose cutting were not supposed to make women more isolated, every year that passed. Hopes turned into despair, the fear of raising the flag of the Islamic Emirate again made many people flee from this land, and most of all women, whoever found a way to escape did not hesitate for a moment, this is no place to live. I rarely heard about my coming to Kabul from time to time Don't read it in my ears with a look devoid of hope and enthusiasm, I don't intend to ignore everything that has happened in these years, but what has become a source of pride and pride for the men of Afghanistan's political profession in these years, I believe, was more a demonstration of the power of the people, the statesmen. Wherever Afghanistan was looking for money and credit and winning the hearts of western allies, women were dragged in the middle.
