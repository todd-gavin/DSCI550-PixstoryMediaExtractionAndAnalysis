On the 10th episode of¬†tvN's 'Twenty-Five Twenty-One' , Nam Joo Hyuk (who plays a 23 years old man) confessed his love to Kim Tae Ri (who plays a 19 years old high school student). The scene ended with Kim Tae Ri accepting his confession.¬†

But, shortly after the broadcast, netizens expressed their criticisms for showing a relationship with the minor and media publicly romanticizing it.

In Korea, the age of majority is 19 (int'l age, not Korean age). You're an adult once you turn 19. You go to a high school and you graduate when you are 19 years old(17~18 years old) and you become an adult when you are 20 years old (18~19).

 Why do Viewers feel uncomfortable watching a 19yrs old high schooler accepting an confession of a college guy . Quite a lot of girls in schools (who were 16-19 yrs then) were dating college dudes 3-4 years older than them and no one batted an eyelid as it was quite common.
