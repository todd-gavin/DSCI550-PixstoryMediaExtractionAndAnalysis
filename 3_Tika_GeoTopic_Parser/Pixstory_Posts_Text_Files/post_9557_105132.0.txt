International Community in
Afghanistan continues...

The process of ‘state-building’ in Afghanistan took shape in an accord called the Bonn Agreement, reached between the anti-Taleban forces in December 2001.

Under the Bonn Agreement, a 30-member interim authority, chaired by Hamid Karzai, was immediately established and the UN Security Council authorized the deployment of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), by its resolution 1386 (2001), in Kabul and the surrounding areas. Like international state-building projects elsewhere, large numbers of international and UN state-builders were engaged in “humanitarian” activities and to indirectly run the state while local actors were projected as the forces of change.

This chapter analyses the war on terror and its implications for Afghanistan. After studying the speculations associated with the attack, the response of the American Congress and the President of USA, the American understanding of Al-Qaeda and the Taleban and Pakistani reactions to 9/11, the chapter proposes to discuss the repercussions of the Operation Enduring Freedom, which led to the fall of the Taleban and the signing of the Bonn Agreement (see Annexure 1) a blueprint for political, economic and social reconstruction designed by the international community under the aegis the US.
