Just before that, Madrid had a wonderful chance to tie the game up, but Vinicius Junior lost his footing while attempting to go around Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, and subsequently protested for a penalty in vain.

The game was virtually over as a battle within two minutes of the start of the second half. Despite Ancelotti's double half-time substitutions, Barcelona continued where they left off. Following more woeful Madrid defending, Torres made it 3-0 with a crisp finish into the top corner after Aubameyang found him with a beautiful pass.

As Aubameyang received his brace four minutes later, there was some disagreement. After seeing a raised flag from the assistant referee, the former Arsenal attacker chipped the ball over Courtois and into the back of the net. The goal was awarded following a VAR review since the whistle was not blown and replays showed no offside.

The result could have been even more emphatic, but that won't matter on a day that continued to suggest Xavi's team has a bright future ahead of them. Barcelona has now won five games in a row in LaLiga and are unbeaten in 13 games in all competitions.
