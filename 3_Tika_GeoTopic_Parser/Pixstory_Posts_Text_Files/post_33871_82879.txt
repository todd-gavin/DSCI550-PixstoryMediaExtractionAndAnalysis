This is how Sinisa Mihajlovic presented the next Serie A match between her Bologna and Spezia at the press conference I always look for the positive side of things I understand the last month and a half but looking at the positive side I say that we are close to our seasonal goal with a game to recover We still have time but we have to start getting results starting tomorrow Lo Spezia with the results they are achieving in the second round of the UEFA Cup but we have worked well we are better and we must play this game with serenity The good environment is bringing back enthusiasm even in the absence of results and this positive Reaching our goal is difficult we know how to climb a mountain There are ups and downs and we must be great to maintain a balance and be confident I believe it as I believed it three and a half years ago when I arrived here The accounts are finally done And then he left a comment on the delicate situation between Russia and Ukraine Given what I&#39;ve been through, seeing images like this has a bad effect Unfortunately, however, it often happens that we gradually give less importance to that news and this is wrong Apart from this there is no winner in wars The color is red that of blood If one had experienced what I have experienced he would never think of such a thing and let&#39;s hope it doesn&#39;t happen that they find an agreement A war in one thing absurd
