A horrifying story out of Canada four members of a Gujarati family were found frozen to death at the US Canada border on Thursday Hailing from Dingucha village in North Gujarat the family were part of a larger group who were trying to immigrate The four persons were a man and wife and a teenager and baby The family spoke very little English and had walked across the border in the expectation of being picked up by someone on the other side Seven people were arrested in connection with the case as it is indicative of a much larger human smuggling racket Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has addressed the incident and stated that his government is doing all it can to prevent such smuggling incidents He said that someone had taken advantage of the family s desire to build a better life It is a sad indictment of the state of affairs that someone would be so desperate to immigrate that they would risk freezing to death
