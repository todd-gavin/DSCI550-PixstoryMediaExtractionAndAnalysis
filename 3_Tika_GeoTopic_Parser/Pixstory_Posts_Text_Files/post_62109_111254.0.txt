Nadal had a scare in his Wimbledon opener on Tuesday, thankfully it did mean his exit as he started fighting back relentlessly from dropping the third set and falling a break down in the fourth to eventually see off Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo.

Nadal has not played on grass since Wimbledon 2019, where he lost to Federer in Semi-finals. First time on grass in 3 years, and he never looked like he skipped a beat. Nadal was always on point in the match and was painting the strokes like the Picasso of the sport. 

After coasting through the first two sets on Centre Court, he surrendered an early break in the third set and then had to claw his way back from 3-1 and 4-2 down in the fourth.

Nadal has already won Australian Open and French Open this year, if he wins Wimbeldon open and US open, he would be the first man to win a Calendar Slam since Neil Armstrong stepped foot on the moon, which is 1969.
