Bremer can leave Turin as long as the right offer arrives Granata president Urbano Cairo said so on the day of the presentation of the La schedules for the new season There is a fair price for Bremer C but I don&#39;t think it is fair to say it he said speaking of the rumors about the defender very close to Inter at certain figures All relative because if I hear talk of millions for Skriniar I think Bremer is worth more than the figures circulating My goal is to satisfy him and I will do it because in any case those who can afford it will be high-level teams A proposal has been rumored about the Nerazzurri youth team player Casadei Casadei from Inter I know he&#39;s a promising young player but I don&#39;t know him well In addition to Inter there are also Milan and Juventus interested in Bremer President Cairo seems willing to sit at the table of anyone who has the right proposal in harmony with what was promised to the defender I am on excellent terms with his agent and I spoke well to him The player is an extraordinary boy I told him that when a suitable offer would come I would sell him
