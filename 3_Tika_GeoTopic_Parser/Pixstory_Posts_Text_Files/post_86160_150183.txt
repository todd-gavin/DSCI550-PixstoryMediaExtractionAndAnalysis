Things I would change about Gurgaon Improve safety security and basic amenities like electricity and water these are all things one can t otherwise take for granted in Gurgaon The sheer number of malls is quite staggering and some of them have a lot to offer in terms of shops restaurants cafes pubs and entertainment zones Adding on to this congestion in the certain parts of the city around Cyber City and Golf Course Road in particular really needs to be taken care of The commercial complexes housing corporate offices boast of world class infrastructure can t alone add to the glory of the city The proximity to the airport makes the city can be made more accessible which will add to it being a preferred business centre
