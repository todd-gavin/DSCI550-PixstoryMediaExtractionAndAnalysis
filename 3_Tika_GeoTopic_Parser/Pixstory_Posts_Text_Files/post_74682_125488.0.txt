Lal Singh Chaddha released on 11th august with the high expectation of makers and fans. But ended not even upto markkk!!👎💯

After a break of four years, Aamir Khan surely would have expected better theatrical prospects and expectations from his drama, Laal Singh Chaddha. According to early estimates, the Advait Chandan film had collected in the range of Rs. 7.75 to 8.25 crores on Friday, Day 2 and on Day 1 the movie even performed low at the box office and earned ₹ 12.00 Cr India net.🎬
It was a very poor show for the film across the board for the second consecutive day with only the national multiplex chains being the saving grace…
The script ,the movie , the plot is not upto mark as per the critical reviews of spectators !💯
The movie is given the 4.5 out of 10 IMDb which is lowest rating of the whole career for Amir khan !! ⬇️⬇️

The makers of Laal Singh Chaddha are going for a nation wide release for the film with around 3500 screens across the country,including Tamil and Telugu markets with Budget of 180 crores INR ..

Butt Shockingg!!!!!! approximately 1300 shows of Laal Singh Chaddha have been reduced !!
As we all know the occupancy on the very first show was very low as 10 to 12 people in maximum shows. Seeing the no-show, the exhibitors decided to reduce the showcasing of film on the second day to save up on the overheads and increase occupancy in the limited shows !👎👎⬇️⬇️
From the sources it has been known thatt - “despite the voluntary show reduction, many shows of both the films were cancelled on Friday morning due to no audience. It's a disastrous scenario on the ground." 💯💯

Such a critics lowers your self esteemed definitelyy!!!🎬💯
So i would conclude that this is a bigg flop of amir khan amidst other flopss!!! 

Guys to tell your viewsssss????!!!!!!
