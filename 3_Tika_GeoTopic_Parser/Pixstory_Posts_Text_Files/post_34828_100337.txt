It is now official Matteo Berrettini will not take part in Roland Garros The news had been in the air for a while now he confirmed it himself on social networks in which however he made it known that the improvements after the hand operation are constant as well as the resumption of training at high intensity But the Parisian tournament has one feature that made him give up namely the five sets After receiving very positive updates from my medical team I am finally back to training on the court at a high level My hand has reacted very well to the stresses and I am working hard to get back in top form My team and I have nevertheless decided that participating in Roland Garros where you play in the best of sets would not be a fair choice for the path we have taken so far For this reason I have decided to plan my return for the season on the grass
