Declan Rice is prepared to snub interest from Manchester United in the summer in favour of a move to his former club Chelsea.

The Blues released the 23-year-old as a youngster, and he has gone on to establish himself as one of the best midfielders in the Premier League at West Ham United.

However, the Daily Mail reported on the 6th of February that the 23-year-old is waiting for Chelsea to make a move in the summer.

The Red Devils are keen, but it seems as if Thomas Tuchel's side have the advantage.

The Hammers have slapped a Â£100million price tag on Rice, but that is unlikely to put either Chelsea or Manchester United off.

The only problem for Chelsea is that they would have to sell one of their current central midfield players to make room for Rice.

The player most likely to depart is N'Golo Kante because the former Leicester City man is now in his thirties.

Rice would be the perfect replacement for Kante, especially as he has added goals to his game this season.

The England international also seems to be playing a more box-to-box role this season, and his future looks very bright.

Now, I believe he could stay at West Ham, but only if the Irons finish in the top four or win the Europa League.

If they don't, I can't see Rice staying at the London Stadium and then it would be a straight shootout between the Red Devils and Chelsea.

If Chelsea were to make an offer, then it seems as if the player would prefer a move back to Stamford Bridge.

This would be a huge blow for Manchester United, but what a signing he could be for Chelsea.
