💁The world is still not a supportive and enabling environment for most women who want to breastfeed.

💁 Countries can rapidly improve breastfeeding practices by scaling up known interventions, policies, and programmes.

💁Success in Breastfeeding is not the sole responsibility of a 
woman—the promotion of breastfeeding is a collective societal responsibility.

💁The breastmilk substitute industry is large and growing, and its marketing undermines efforts to improve 
breastfeeding.

💁The health and economic costs of suboptimal
breastfeeding is largely unrecognised.

 💁Investments to promote breastfeeding, in both rich and poor settings, need to be measured against the cost of not doing so.

💁Political support and financial investment are needed to protect, promote, and support breastfeeding to realise its advantages to children, women, and society.
