There have been a lot of bad days for the climate in the Australian parliament. Days that make you rage. Days that make you weep.

That infamous vote in 2009 sinking Kevin Rudd’s carbon pollution reduction scheme. Years of apocalyptic screeching about nonexistent carbon taxes. The repeal of the clean energy scheme. That day when Scott Morrison brandished a lump of coal supplied by the Minerals Council of Australia and told MPs across the chamber not to be scared.

Too many bad days. A dark period where the Liberal and National parties abrogated a core responsibility of being a governing party – the responsibility to face the future. The responsibility to keep citizens safe. The responsibility for finding opportunity in change.
