Election Day will be a day off for the NBA.

All 30 teams in the league will play on November 7, the evening before the midterm elections, according to the league's schedule for the upcoming season. The NBA is hoping that teams will take advantage of that night to drive fans out to vote and emphasise the importance of civic involvement. But no NBA teams are set to play on November 8, which is election day. In the weeks running up to November 8, teams are urged to communicate election information with their fan communities, such as registration deadlines. The NBA family's focus on fostering nonpartisan civic involvement and inspiring fans to create a plan to vote during midterm elections, the league stated Tuesday, led to the scheduling choice.
