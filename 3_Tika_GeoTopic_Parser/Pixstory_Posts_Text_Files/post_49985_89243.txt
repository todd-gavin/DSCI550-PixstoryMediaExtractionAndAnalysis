I totally degree first of what is masculinity And what is femininity These concepts don t have particular characteristics Basically gender is a social construct Very conditioned propaganda in which humans get trapped Let s look at this from a very wider perspective if a girl defies the traditional norms attributed to her she tends to be masculine Why does being brave independent outspoken be classified as masculine Simply why is riding a bike or a pixie cut masculine Similarly a boy crying or doing household chores or dancing or being polite immediately become feminine This very concept of masculinity and feminity is a challenge to humans This very idea should be changed schools should not adhere to gender roles but equal participation to all the students We should not cultivate a feeling as secondary or the other to any children Hence they will treat their peers equally Schools should teach the consequences of gender roles and introduce gender studies in the topics at a very small age We teach incomprehensible formulas at a very young age gender studies is a piece of cake Children should be taught on issues like body shaming and schools should not encourage slut shaming body shaming or ragging Teach children to respect the decision of their peer and firmly agree to disagree Gender roles are rules on how to behave and live as an individual Humans get trapped in this vicious cycle Let children learn to embrace themselves their character Let them learn from mistakes and have the courage to be themselves and choose peace of mind over anything
