On March 21, the first wave of ticket sales came to an end.

Have you gotten your tickets for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar yet? Have you missed the first round of ticket sales? Don't worry, you'll get another chance.

On March 23, at 1:00 p.m. Doha time, tickets for the 2022 World Cup will go on sale (3:30 pm IST). The sales period will close at noon on March 29. (2:30 pm IST).

Unlike the first phase, when fans had to apply for tickets and wait for them to be allocated, this phase will sell tickets on a first-come, first-served basis.

Tickets are expected to go on sale through FIFA's website.

The World Cup will kick-off from November 21, 2022, and the final will be held at the Lusail stadium on December 18, 2022.

The first-ever World Cup in the Middle-East has generated huge interest in the region as well as across the world. The most interest in the 2022 World Cup tickets has come from countries like Argentina, England, Mexico, USA, Spain, Germany, UAE, India and Brazil.

Tickets will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis throughout this sales period, and ticket orders will be handled as a real-time transaction, subject to availability. All successfully purchased tickets will be confirmed to ticket applicants as soon as possible.

We recommend that football enthusiasts apply as soon as the sales period opens, on March 23, because tickets will likely sell out rapidly.

Payments for allotted tickets from the first Random Selection Draw, which ended on February 8, 2022, are no longer being accepted.
