THRILLING COME BACK WIN

In the final match against Manchester United, opponents went up two times and Chelsea fought back to level it. Then came two stunning strikes- Reiten and Kerr, which confirmed the win and the title. 
Score 4-2. 

HATRICK TITLE WIN

Most of the time in the season, Chelsea were second below Arsenal. Emma's girls fought with grit to come up and clinch the title. 

"We're the title winners because we've won enough games for us to be in this place, but we've done it from a difficult place. In January, we were down to 13 or 14 players, tops, for about eight games. For me, that eight game stretch was where the title was won" Emma said after the title win. 

"For me, this is the proudest title", she added, "because, everyone played their part. No one was a passenger". 

This was their 5th title in total. 


SAM KERR 

Sam Kerr's second goal was outrageous. The ball was cleared by Manchester keeper, which came as a second ball to Kerr. With keeper out of position, she took the shot over the keeper with a turn, and scored. 

With that goal, the Australian has finished as top scorer in the league with 20 goals ahead of Arsenal's Miedema(14). It's her second golden boot achievement in succession. Earlier this month, she also won Football Writers Association Women's Footballer of the Year, along with Mohammed Salah. 


Ji, Drew leaves with title 

South Korean Ji So-yun has been part of this team since 2014. The 31 year old has decided to depart after this season. 
"She is one of the best midfielders in the world and our fans will love her." Emma said about Ji. Ji has been part of 11 major trophies with Chelsea, playing 208 matches and scored 68 goals. 

Drew Spence,29 year, has been part of the team for 10 years. She was also a midfielder, playing a very integral role in title wins. Since 2009, she has played 238 matches and scored 50 goals. 

Chelsea will play Manchester City on 15th May in the FA Cup final at Wembley.
