This speech by Phoenix will always be relevant It sums up the supremacist behavior of human within and outside our community I think at times we feel or are made to feel that we champion different causes But for me I see commonality I think whether we re talking about gender inequality or racism or queer rights or indigenous rights or animal rights we re talking about the fight against injustice We re talking about the fight against the belief that one nation one people one race one gender one species has the right to dominate use and control another with impunity I think we ve become very disconnected from the natural world Many of us are guilty of an egocentric world view and we believe that we re the centre of the universe We go into the natural world and we plunder it for its resources We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow and steal her baby even though her cries of anguish are unmistakeable Then we take her milk that s intended for her calf and we put it in our coffee and our cereal We fear the idea of personal change because we think we need to sacrifice something to give something up But human beings at our best are so creative and inventive and we can create develop and implement systems of change that are beneficial to all sentient beings and the environment Joaquin Phoenix Oscars Speech
