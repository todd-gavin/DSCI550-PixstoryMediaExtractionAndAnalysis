Behold the Child among his new born blisses A six years Darling of a pigmy size See where mid work of his own hand he lies Fretted by sallies of his mother s kisses With light upon him from his father s eyes See at his feet some little plan or chart Some fragment from his dream of human life Shaped by himself with newly learn e d art A wedding or a festival A mourning or a funeral And this hath now his heart And unto this he frames his song Then will he fit his tongue To dialogues of business love or strife But it will not be long Ere this be thrown aside William Wordsworth
