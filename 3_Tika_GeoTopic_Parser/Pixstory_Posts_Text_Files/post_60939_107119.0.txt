According to the World Health Organization, World Blood Donor Day is commemorated every year on June 14 with the goal of raising awareness about the need for safe blood and blood products for transfusion (WHO). The day also recognizes the vital role that unpaid and voluntary blood donors play in saving lives in health care systems.
The day is marked to support and provide a chance for health authorities to provide enough resources to improve blood collection from unpaid, volunteer blood donors, as well as to manage blood and transfusion access. According to the WHO, it also helps "national blood transfusion services, blood donor organizations, and other non-governmental organizations enhance and grow their voluntary blood donor programs by boosting national and local campaigns."
