When Tomiyasu arrived from Bologna last summer and hit the ground running he looked to be a real gem He was a key component of a solid Arsenal back line and his massive defensive attributes and clear technical quality was a joy to watch The Japanese International won absolutely everything in the air and rarely lost a ground dual either Arsenal had signed Tomiyasu for just m and the defender was just years old it looked like a masterstroke However injuries have disrupted that shine somewhat From January to the end of the season Tomiyasu suffered reoccurring injuries to his calves which kept him out of the squad for far more time than he was in it The loss of the defender was unfortunately a key reason behind Arsenal s failure to secure Champions League football This season Ben White has moved to right back following the return of centre back William Saliba White has been superb in the right back role sharing some characteristics of Tomiyasu White is also extremely technical and superb on the ball Defensively he is astute Good in the air and smart in his duals Arsenal have only benefited from the Englishman s position change However Tomiyasu simply cannot be forgotten His place in the Arsenal squad is still a massive benefit to Mikel Arteta Tomiyasu s performance on Thursday against Fc Zurich served as a reminder of that The defender was extremely solid and his passing of the ball was brilliant completing all of his attempted long balls While Ben White is flourishing at right back right now the competition of Tomiyasu should act as a constant reminder of the quality waiting behind him It also should be noted Tomiyasu has the quality to play in both full back positions and centre back too Personally Tomiyasu comes across as a determined yet patient character A manager s dream In what will undoubtedly prove to be a long congested season the presence of Tomiyasu in Arsenal s squad will be majorly appreciated
