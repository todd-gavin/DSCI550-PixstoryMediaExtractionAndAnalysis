I remember how proud my parents were when I got selected in the college of my choice It was due to my hardwork and diligence and because of that I toiled in college and was able to secure a good job after college Because I understood that college is a privilege because I would have to pay off loans I understood the value of education And cancelling student debt undermined that value This cancellation of debt is literally like government literally paying for a kid to go to college to get all the resources and world class education only for that kid to waste four years of his life partying Is this the kind of America we want to build Student debts is the reason why people understand the value of educational resources It is because of debts that students feel a sense of responsibility and it helps them to become responsible adults Moreover it is not the case that students with poor financial backgrounds are not able to attend colleges Our country offers hundreds of scholarships to DESERVING students and I have seen many talented kids get a full ride to Ivy League colleges So what is exactly the purpose of putting this burden on the economy America is a capitalist economy where people are responsible for their own financial decisions Forgiving student loans is just an abuse of the loan system
