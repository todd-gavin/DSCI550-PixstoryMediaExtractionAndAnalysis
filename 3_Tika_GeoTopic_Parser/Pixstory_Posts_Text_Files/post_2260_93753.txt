It is often alleged that the Congress insulted Father of Indian Constitution Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar also known as Babasaheb Ambedkar by denying him the due respect he deserved The political rivals of the Congress claimed that the grand old party promoted only one family and did not look beyond it Prime Minister Narendra Modi has often said that the Congress belittled Ambedkar s contribution in nation building and always suppressed his thoughts There is also a charge against that the Congress that while it honoured the members of the Nehru Gandhi family with the Bharat Ratna it deliberately ignored Ambedkar He was finally bestowed with the country s highest civilian award by the VP Singh government in Similarly no stamp was issued by the successive Congress governments to honour Ambedkar In fact the BJP has alleged that the Congress also conspired to see that Ambedkar does not reach Parliament by ensuring his defeat in the elections That said the architect of the Indian Constitution is remembered by political parties only for the vote bank politics Attempts have also been made to erase his memory from the public mind but his strength and contribution are so huge that the people of India continue to hold him in high regard BJP leaders also claim that the establishment of centres at five locations related to Ambedkar as a memorial was done only by their government The Congress did not even celebrate the Constitution Day fearing qualities of Ambedkar would get highlighted and the family might be overshadowed they added Throughout his life Ambedkar was considered a bitter critic of the Congress and its leaders especially Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel He felt that the two were responsible for the poor condition of the Dalits in the country Ambedkar had a bitter fallout with Mahatma Gandhi over the Poona Pact that promises separate electorates for Dalits The Father of the Nation opposed this by holding a fast unto death Even in his book What Congress and Gandhi have done to the Untouchable written in he was very critical of Gandhi
