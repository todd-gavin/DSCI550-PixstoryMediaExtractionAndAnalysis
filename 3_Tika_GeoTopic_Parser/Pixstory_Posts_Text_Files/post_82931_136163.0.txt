Flowers make me happy. It can bring smile on every single person's face. This sunset and this flower make this image more beautiful. Today I was standing looking at the sky, looking at the sun, looking at the flowers and the nature around me, and I found it so peaceful. It was really enjoyable. Flowers in my hand and the beautiful sunset in front of me. The colour of the Sun, the colour of the flowers, and the colour of the sky everything was refreshing. The green background describes the beauty of the nature. 
Just look at it, doesn't it feels so good staring at it. I really love it.
