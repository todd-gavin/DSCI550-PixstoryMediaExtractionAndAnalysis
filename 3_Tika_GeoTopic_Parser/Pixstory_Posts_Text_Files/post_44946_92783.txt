Arsenal let five players depart in January and are again short of bodies amid an injury crisis as they fight for a top four spot in the Premier League However Mikel Arteta has defended Arsenal s decision to let five players depart without replacements in January But as he attempts to rebuild a depleted team devastated by injury while simultaneously competing for a spot in the Premier League top four the Gunners manager now anticipates a busy summer with at least a striker at the top of his list Arsenal is short on men well before Saturday s match against Brighton with Kierney and Thomas Partey both facing season ending injuries However Arteta argues that allowing Pablo Mari Ainsley Maitland Niles Calum Chambers Sead Kolasinac and Pierre Emerick Aubameyang to go was not a mistake They were guys who we didn t really utilize he explained And now that you ve put them in perspective I m not sure how big of a role they d have played You have no idea and I have no idea We made a choice based on what we thought was the appropriate thing to do for the squad and for the individual players who had been asking for a chance to play football for several months and had not received any Arsenal lacks firepower with Aubameyang in excellent form for Barcelona and Alexandre Lacazette without a goal in his past three outings Arteta believes that large money will be available in the summer not just to buy a top tier striker but also to bolster a group that may compete in the Champions League I am expecting so certainly the Gunners boss responded when asked if he expects a busy summer If you have the financial means I d want outfield players and three goalkeepers Whether it s the Champions League or the Europa League I believe both demand a much larger team Now it will be amazing to see who Arsenal ends up buying in the transfer window
