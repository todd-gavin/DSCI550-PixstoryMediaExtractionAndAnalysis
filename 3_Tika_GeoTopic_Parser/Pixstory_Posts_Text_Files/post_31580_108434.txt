What has been feared for years for the future today already seems to be a reality A water battle between large users is predicted but the short blanket for everyone there is not much room for contention over a water resource that has never been so scarce and that must see the rivers represented in the institutional tables legitimate owners of the water that we withdraw for production purposes It is in fact necessary to ensure that the outflow is guaranteed along all the river branches to avoid their biological death derogating from the vital outflow obligation would bring very few advantages in terms of water availability in agriculture but would cause potentially irreparable environmental damage Numerous testimonies of the suffering of Lombardy rivers due to the low flow rate and its effects on the concentration of pollutants eutrophication and overheating of the water which, as the season progresses, risk causing deaths generalizations of the fish fauna At the point where we are, every effort must be made to limit the damage to agriculture but as we have been repeating for years the real problem is not the scarcity of water but the fact that we use too much of it in a climate that has by now changed Our life has always been Italian region by far more endowed with water reserves but for two decades these reserves have no longer been a guarantee of unlimited availability It is necessary to introduce more efficient irrigation techniques and also to modify the cultivation systems by diversifying the crops now dominated by the two most demanding species in terms of irrigate rice and above all corn The association also warns against what appear to be easy solutions such as the creation of small reservoirs for water storage the small reservoirs can be interesting for situations that do not have them but Lombardy has a capacity of massive water storage Facing enormous expenses to increase water storage potential by one or two percentage points really does not seem like an effective response, it runs the risk of becoming a diversion to delay the priority actions which are policies and investments for reducing the water needs of the Lombard agriculture concluded by Legambiente Lombardia
