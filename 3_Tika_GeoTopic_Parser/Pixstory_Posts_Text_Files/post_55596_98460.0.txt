Foxtel has stated that they intend to continue producing Australian drama. 

However, as the Daily Mail reported, the pay TV behemoth wants to reduce its commitment to producing local drama by half, as required by broadcast rules. 

Foxtel said they want to develop lifestyle, documentary, and entertainment programmes by cutting drama spending by 5%. Amanda Laing, Foxtel's Chief Commercial and Content Officer, told TV Tonight that the company's need for more regulatory flexibility was not a hint that it was abandoning local drama. 

Laing recently stated at a TV industry convention that Foxtel was the only business with a statutory 10% media commitment. She said: “The streamers don't have that. Free to airs don't have that.”

As A. James writes, Foxtel requested that the government change the broadcast legislation last June, but the request was denied by a Senate report. 

Foxtel, according to Laing, is a leader in local drama production, and any insinuation that the firm would produce less if it weren't controlled was unjust.

Let’s see what happens next!
