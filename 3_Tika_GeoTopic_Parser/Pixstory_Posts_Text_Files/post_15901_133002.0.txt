Abstract
Background
Alexithymia is common in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Although the estimated prevalence of alexithymia in patients with T2DM is widely reported, these results have not been synthesized.
Aim
To systematically assess the prevalence and characteristics of alexithymia in patients with T2DM.
Methods
We searched for relevant publications in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database, Wanfang Database, Chinese Biomedical Database, and Weipu Database. The prevalence of alexithymia, the mean scores, and standard deviations of the total scale of the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) were pooled using random effects meta-analysis in Stata 13.0, with studies stratified by study location in this meta-analysis.
Results
This meta-analysis included thirteen articles. Pooled prevalence of alexithymia (TAS-20 total scores ≥61) were 43.0% (95%CI 35.0–51.0%), and the prevalence of alexithymia was higher in China (45.0%, 95%CI 36.0–54.0%) compared with non-China (41.0%, 95%CI 29.0–54.0%). The pooled mean score for the TAS-20 total scale was 57.70 (95% CI 55.25–60.15). Leave-one-out analysis showed that none of the studies significantly impacted the overall pooled results.
Conclusions
This meta-analysis indicated a high prevalence of alexithymia in patients with T2DM. Thus, clinicians need to be aware of and assess appropriately for alexithymia in patients with T2DM.
