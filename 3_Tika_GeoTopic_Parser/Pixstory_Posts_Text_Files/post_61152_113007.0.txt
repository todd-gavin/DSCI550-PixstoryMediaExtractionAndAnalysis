Yesterday i went to this cafe ie cafeteria &co it is located in Hudson lane (Delhi) with my friends. This cafe is quite famous in Hudson lane. 
We ordered greek pizza, quesadillas, orange blood drink and 2 sangria. Pizza was good and their Bestseller. Drinks were good too but quesadillas were not at all good I personally didnâ€™t like it.
