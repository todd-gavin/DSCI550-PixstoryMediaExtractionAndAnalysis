The Amravati Police paid a visit to MLA Ravi Rana's home in Khar, Mumbai, on Saturday to serve him with a bailable warrant issued by the Bombay High Court's Nagpur bench. According to sources, the warrant was issued this week after the MLA failed to answer to the Bombay High Court's notification. Rana must appear in court on Monday, according to the warrant.
