Whatâ€™s the point of Black Lives Matter Movement if leaders physically removed from mayoral debate? Is this the society we are fighting for?

A dramatic video circulating online depicts the moment a Black Lives Matter leader in Los Angeles was forcibly removed from a discussion between mayoral contenders. 

According to the Los Angeles Times, Melina Abdullah, a BLM organiser and a Cal State Los Angeles professor, said she was "brutally removed" from the closed event because she did not have a ticket. 

Debates should be public ... especially at a public university," Abdullah said in a statement to the outlet, noting there was only a small attendance at the "near-empty theater."

Fox News reported that videos of the incident show campus police officers taking Abdullah from her seat and transporting her from the premises, each holding one of her arms. Several supporters of Abdullah gathered in front of the officers, blocking their way or yelling at them for their actions.

No one will acknowledge it openly but this was a racist hate crime. Officially it be sugarcoated but everyone knows that this is because of the skin colour of Melina. The question is, how many people will raise their voices?
