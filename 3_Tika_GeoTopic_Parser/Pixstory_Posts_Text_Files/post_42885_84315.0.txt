When Denis Villenueve makes a film, there are high expectations, his recent Sci fi venture Dune adapted from the novel exceeded expectations and even got oscar nominations. 

But Arrival has to be considered as his most audacious venture in movies, Arrival is a movie about a mother who is stuck in extraordinary circumstances. Being a movie buff and having watched many movies it takes once in a while that a movie completely bamboozels you and you’re left wondering how did the story went there, Arrival is certainly one of them. It completely takes you out for a journey where you cannot possibly know what’s next. 

Amy Adams is a tour de force in this movie as she completely owns the movie since the beginning till the end…. And the other way around. Jeremy Renner is a breath of fresh air every time he appears on screen. 

At the end only one thing can be said that go in with plenty expectations for this movie and you still won’t be disappointed. This is one of the best of Denis, if not the best.
