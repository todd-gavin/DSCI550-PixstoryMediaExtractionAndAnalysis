Yup, I disagree. I'm pretty sure the universe wasn't created last Thursday but last monday. I'm a big proponent of Last Mondayism.
God created the world on the last monday of September 2023 and made it look older only to test us and our faith in Him and His creation. I'm pretty sure it was created on Last Monday.
I mean, prove me wrong? 🤷‍♂️
