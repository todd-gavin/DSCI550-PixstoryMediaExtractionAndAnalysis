The key challenge of the third day of the Internazionali d&#39;Italia is undoubtedly the match between Fabio Fognini and Jannik Sinner The only two Italian representatives of the Roman event would have gladly avoided meeting so soon but the scoreboard has decided so In this way at least one Italian will arrive for sure in the round of 16 of the tournament Sinner is the favorite in the world for the first match between the two but Fognini in the world does not give up easily Both won in straight sets in the previous round Fognini eliminated Thiem for Sinner&#39;s victory against Martinez was easier for The match will start at 12:00 and whoever wins will have to face Andrey Rublev who eliminated Krajnovic in the third round
