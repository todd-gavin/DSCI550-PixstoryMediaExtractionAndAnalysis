Sources close to Nick Pope report the goalkeeper might be on the verge of a summer transfer to Fulham. Burnley, relegated from the top tier of English football last season will now spend a season at the very least in the championship. Pope, who's been the first choice keeper for sometime now since his £1.3 Million move from Charlton Athletic in 2016 is reportedly set to move away.

Pope is valued at a costly £40 Million as of this week, but Burnley are only willing to listen to offers in the region of £10 Million and upwards. Southampton and Nottingham Forest are both said to be interested in signing the Englishman but Fulham have emerged as the most realistic outlet — with the owners being assured of the price tag Burnley have set for their goalkeeper.

Forest on the other hand, have goalkeeping business of their own to tend to. Manchester United are said to have sparked interest in a third consecutive James Garner either on loan or on a permanent deal. Elsewhere, Burnley will try their maximum to sign Manchester City youth product Arijanet Muric. Vincent Kompany is soon to be announced manager at Burnley, and he's said to be a fan of several of the players the side are linked to.

Nick Pope should hope that a Premier League team come looking for his signature in the weeks that follow. The £40 Million price tag set on him by his current employers perfectly depicts the situation of the current market. Pope might be overvalued, but he remains an excellent shot stopper and a brilliant handler of the ball. Overall, a well-rounded man in between the sticks for any of the three Premier League teams aforementioned.
