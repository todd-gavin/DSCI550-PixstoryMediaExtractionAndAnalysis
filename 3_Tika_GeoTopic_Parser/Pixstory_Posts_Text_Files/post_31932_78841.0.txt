Liverpool are set to revisit the signing of Fabio Carvalho from Fulham in the summer.

Fabrizio Romano reported on the 1st of February that the Reds are "confident" they will be able to sign the 19-year-old at the end of the season.

Jurgen Klopp's men agreed a deal with the Cottagers on transfer deadline day to sign Carvalho.

The player completed his medical, but the paperwork didn't go through in time, and the deal was called off (Sky Sports).

However, it doesn't appear that the Reds will need a tribunal, and they should eventually get their man in the summer.

Carvalho has been tearing up the Championship for Fulham this season.

In 18 appearances, he has scored seven goals and provided four assists (transfermarkt).

Now, considering this is his first season playing regular first-team football, those are impressive statistics, and the kid looks to have a huge future in the game.

If Liverpool do sort out a deal for him, they will be sealing the signature of a hugely exciting talent.

Carvalho has been a key player for Fulham so far this season, and he has helped Marco Silva's side to the top of the Championship.

However, his future looks to be away from Craven Cottage, and it seems pretty likely that he will end up at Liverpool.

Given some of the players that the Reds currently have in their squad and the team they are building, Carvalho seems like he would be one for the future.

However, this would still be a huge move for the 19-year-old born in Portugal, and I hope for his sake that the deal goes through in the summer.

He has done more than enough so far to prove that he is ready for the next step in his career, and a move to Anfield could be perfect.
