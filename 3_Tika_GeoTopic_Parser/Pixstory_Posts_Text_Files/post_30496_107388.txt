The progress shown by the national football team led by Roberto Mancini in the first games of the Nations League met with an abrupt stop in suffered by Germany At the end of the game Gigio Donnarumma presented himself to the Rai microphones as team captain We are angry there are no excuses now we go to the locker room we look at each other and set off again to prove that we are not these Tonight we missed everything maybe there was even a little tiredness after five games in days at the end of the championship but we don&#39;t want an alibi We are so sorry for the fans for what they saw During the interview there was also space for a spat with the Paris Saint Germain goalkeeper who didn&#39;t take well some comments on his ingenuity committed in the match We all made mistakes there are no culprits I too could have evaluated certain situations better but after mistakes grow Then if you say it&#39;s my fault I take my responsibilities and go ahead with my head held high
