We don't truly realize the value of homemade food until we leave our homes. Being a college student, I always relied on takeouts and fast food joints to fill my stomach just to get by the day. Meals were no longer for filling the hunger of our hearts and soul. It merely became a ness city to stop our stomachs from growling. However, going back home for the vacation and tasting homemade food brought back so many memories and nostalgia of the good times when our worries were minor and when times were simple. It is always a wholesome experience when you get to taste homemade food.
