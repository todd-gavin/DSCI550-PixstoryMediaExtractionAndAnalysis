Chandigarh: Five months old Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Punjab has now come under hammer for delaying the salaries of three lakh government employees for the month of August.
While Punjab Finance Minister, Harpal Singh Cheema, claimed that the delay was not due to the shortage of funds but it stuck in the process, the opposition spared no punches in hitting the Bhagwant Mann-led AAP government for its 'inability' to run the government.
The AAP party came to power in March this year with a promise to revive the Punjab economy and make the state debt free. But the opposition alleged that the AAP government has already borrowed more thanÂ  Rs 9,000 crore as there is "no" sign of economic revival as AAP claimed.
While AAP is rubbishing opposition allegations as mere political propaganda, salary delay of employees has nonetheless put the government on the back foot.
This gave the opposition parties in Punjab including Congress and BJP another opportunity to target the Mann-led government as "inexperienced" and "incapable" to handle a big state like Punjab. 
Before winning Punjab, AAP was handling only the administrative affairs in the smaller territory of Delhi. 
As the matter regarding the delay in salary got media attention on Wednesday and a few associations also showed resentment, the Mann government was quick to credit the salary.
