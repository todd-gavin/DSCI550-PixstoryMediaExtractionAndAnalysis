Dreams

BY LANGSTON HUGHES

Hold fast to dreams

For if dreams die

Life is a broken-winged bird

That cannot fly.

 

Hold fast to dreams

For when dreams go

Life is a barren field

Frozen with snow.

 The poem is small but persuading. The importance of dreams is being reminded in the poem. You should always dream as without dreams life will be like a broken-winged bird that cannot fly. Dreams make you fly. Go head over heels at victory. Dreams are the breath to live. Poet again points out that life without dreams is like a barren land in the frozen snow-endless, clueless, monotonous, and boring.

Always dream of living as intact as the fuel to reach your goals. Some people live for their dreams to come true, they strive to work hard for their dreams. So what's your dream?
