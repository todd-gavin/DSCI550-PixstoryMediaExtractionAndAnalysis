For me I d say I haven t read the books completely just bits and pieces I found on the internet but I ve seen the Netflix show And being a keen reader I ve always believed that books are better than their movie adaptations but I found the show really really good and I can t even think how cute the books would be Its in a comic book format and god its so cute the pannels the art stylr and everything The book is so well and sweetly written that each scene of them looking at each other holding hands and Nick s gay panic was crazy My ratings Its one of the best gay romance series books I ve ever come across and mind you all that I ve read a lot of gay romance and this one is in the top for sure pride recommendations
