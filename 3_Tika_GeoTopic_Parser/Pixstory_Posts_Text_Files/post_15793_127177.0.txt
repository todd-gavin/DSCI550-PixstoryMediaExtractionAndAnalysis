Old Delhi, which is known for its jam packed roads and hustle bustle neighborhood comes to a halt on the occasion of Independence Day.

The Red Fort is part of the walled city, during the days coming to 15th august, PM protocol is followed as the Prime Minister of India hoist the national flag on Red Fort.

A strict security protocol for the celebrations of Independence Day on the Red Fort is followed.

But no matter the reasons, looking at the walled city as so quiet & empty feels strange.
