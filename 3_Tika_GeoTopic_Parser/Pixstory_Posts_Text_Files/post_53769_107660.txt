This phrase is the standard that astronomers will be applying to a curious signal captured with China s Sky Eye telescope that might be a transmission from alien technology An article reporting the signal was posted on the website of China s state backed Science and Technology Daily newspaper but was later removed So have astronomers finally found evidence of intelligent found life beyond Earth And is it being hushed up We should be intrigued but not too excited yet An interesting signal has to go through a lot of tests to check whether it truly carries the signature of extraterrestrial technology or is just the result of an unexpected source of terrestrial interference And as for the deletion media releases are normally timed for simultaneous release with peer reviewed results which are not yet available so it was likely just released a bit early by mistake An eye on the sky Sky Eye which is offically known as the Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope FAST is the the largest and most sensitive single dish radio telescope in the world A engineering marvel its gargantuan structure is built inside a natural basin in the mountains of Guizhou China The telescope is so huge it can t be physically tilted but it can be pointed in a direction by thousands of actuators that deform the telescope s reflective surface By deforming the surface the location of the telescope s focal point changes and the telescope can look at a different part of the sky FAST detects radiation at radio wavelengths up to cm and is used for astronomical research in a wide range of areas One area is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence or SETI SETI observations are mainly done in piggy back mode which means they are taken while the telescope is also running its primary science programs In this way large swaths of the sky can be scanned for signs of alien technology or technosignatures without getting in the way of other science operations For special targets like nearby exoplanets Read more
