Embrace is the only refuge of man If it were not for kisses and hugs people would die in the cold of relationships A hug is a hotbed of human emotions When you realize that you are getting cold take refuge in the embrace you want Embrace heaven A woman s arms are the safest place in the world When you are exiled in the arms of a woman sorrow pain suffering and sorrow escape The pains are gone the wounds are flying out of the window the tree of my hopes is sprouting again In this world of seven billion people I only believe in your arms this is how I can take refuge in you In this world of horror only your arms are the most accommodating place in the world I have taken refuge in you to discover the secret of your eyes
