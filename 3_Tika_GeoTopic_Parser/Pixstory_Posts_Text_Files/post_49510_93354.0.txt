Even if the animal is endangered, humans do not have the right to catch it, separate it from its family, and imprison it. Animals are abused, given insufficient space and exercise, and are stressed and depressed. Many people die young as a result of poor nutrition, little exercise, and terrible living conditions. It is much better to not be born at all than have a life full of torture and imprisonment. Someone comes to your house, tears you away from your family and jails you for life. How would you feel? 

Animals' normal behaviour is restricted in zoos, such as how they hunt, rummage, or swim in rivers, and live independently in forests. Keeping them in cages is unethical.

Zoos are more like jails than homes. In a zoo, an animal may live longer, but it is a depressed and lonely existence. It can be a source of pleasure for us and a source of revenue for some, but from the animal's perspective, it's no different than living in a confined environment with little to do away from home. Which is why actions should be taken to outlaw all zoos and free the animals that reside within them.

Animals are not here for our entertainment. They're their own species. They are meant to live their own lives. It is disheartening that people advocate for abusing animals because "it's fun to see that".

There's no such thing as an ethical or a good zoo. Sure they maybe less bad than the others but they're still taking animals away from their habitat, still tearing apart their families, still treating them like commodities, still sexually assaulting them, still forcing them to breed unnaturally and so much more. Reminder that animals are not on the Earth for the entertainment of human beings and it's cruel and selfish to think that they are.
