The internet has gone crazy after NASA's Curiosity rover spotted what seems to be a "alien entryway" on Mars. 

The photo, which was shot on May 7 in Mars' Mount Sharp region, went popular on social media, with some saying it was a hoax. Alternatively, it could be the entryway to an alien temple. 

The smooth 'way,' the straight borders, and the cast shadows all look quite realistic. And strange.

However, geologists claim that the 'doorway' is not what it appears to be. 

The gap isn't so much an entrance to a Martian temple as it is the consequence of "natural erosion," in which a chunk of rock has been eroded away by natural forces, leaving a shallow but oddly clean-cut gap behind.

Mars Science Laboratory project scientist Ashwin Vasavada told Gizmodo the “space between two fractures in a rock” formed from “ancient sand dunes” that have been piling up over centuries.
