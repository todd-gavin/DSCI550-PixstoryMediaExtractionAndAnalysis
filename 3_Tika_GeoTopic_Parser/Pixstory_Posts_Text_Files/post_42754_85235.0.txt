This song by Billie Eilish has my heart. Talking about body shaming, I relate to it to my core. Here, what it says is so true regarding this generation of ours that is so quick to insult and so slow to support. 

They have opinions about almost everything and are so quick to spread hate over spreading love. So quick to shame others. It's like they like seeing others weak, over helping them at such vulnerable times, and supporting them. 

They all have a box; if one fits in it, they like them; if they don't, they won't. 

We are so quick to judge, aren't we? We jump into assumptions and judge the book by its cover. Why? And as Billie rightly says-

"Is my value based only on your perception?
Or is your opinion of me, 
Not My Responsibility?"
