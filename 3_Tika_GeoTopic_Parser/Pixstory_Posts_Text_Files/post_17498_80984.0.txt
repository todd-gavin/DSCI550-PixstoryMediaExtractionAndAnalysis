It wasn’t the most explosive trade deadline, but LeBron James sitting idly as power moves were being made was an unfamiliar sight.

The Los Angeles Lakers had nothing to give but needed plenty, and usually that means James’ unspoken pressure tightens the vice on even the most seasoned general managers, yielding something, anything.

But it was quiet on the Lakers front, as teams turned down Russell Westbrook. Perhaps the Lakers were unaware other teams have seen the film or taken advantage of his wayward play this season.

The Lakers’ desperation got them to this point and couldn’t bail them out. James has a few objectives as he heads toward his golden years: catch Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the league’s all-time leading scorer, compete for championships and play alongside his son, Bronny, a junior in high school.

He looks well on track for the first, not so much on the second and the third remains to be seen. The most pressing, annoying issue is his excellent play hasn’t translated into wins. Arguably the biggest reason why is his fingerprints from the offseason.

He pressed for Westbrook, and therefore feels as responsible for his team’s debt as Lakers team president Rob Pelinka. Pelinka didn’t get this far by telling powerful people no, and the Lakers needed something drastic to keep pace with the Phoenix Suns — while being wholly unaware the Golden State Warriors would be back with a vengeance.

Where’s the line between player empowerment and being the steward for a franchise? It’s almost impossible to draw, so it’s not an indictment in full on Pelinka. You want your star players to be as invested as possible at every turn. If he isn’t, there’s a risk of him checking out emotionally, practically.
