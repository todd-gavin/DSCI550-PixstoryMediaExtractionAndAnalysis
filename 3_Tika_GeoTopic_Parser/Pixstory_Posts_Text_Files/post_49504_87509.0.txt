TRENDING: Randy Gregory

Randy Gregory has been trending on twitter for more than two hours straight. Here's why.

The Cowboys have revealed that they will not re-sign Randy Gregory, just moments after announcing that they would.

According to various sources, Gregory has turned down a contract offer from the Cowboys in favor of a deal with the Broncos.

The contract's financial terms are said to be the same: A five-year, $70 million contract with $28 million in guaranteed funding. Gregory, on the other hand, appears to have opted to take that contract with the Cowboys, only to change his mind and take the same contract with the Broncos.

That's astounding because the Cowboys announced Gregory's signing on Twitter, and Gregory's agent told the Dallas Morning News that Gregory would be staying in Dallas. By the time that happens, the deal is usually done.

But nothing is official until a contract is signed, and Gregory appears to have changed his mind and accepted a Broncos offer instead. Gregory won't be able to sign the contract until tomorrow afternoon, and it's possible he'll change his mind. Gregory, on the other hand, appears to be on his way to Denver for the time being.
