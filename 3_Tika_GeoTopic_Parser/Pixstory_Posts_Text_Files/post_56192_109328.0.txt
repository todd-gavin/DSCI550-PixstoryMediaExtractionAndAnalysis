For September More than 300 children with a statement of Special Educational Needs (SEN) are without a school place according to BBC. This includes 91 children waiting for a place in a special school and 202 attempting a place in a mainstream school.

The Education Authority (EA) said there had been a "significant rise" in the need for special school places. According to statistics from the Department of Education (DE), more than 22,000 school pupils in Northern Ireland have a statement of SEN.

A statement sets out an explanation of a child's needs and the help that is anticipated to meet them in school. About 6,650 of those pupils attended special schools in 2021/22 but the EA said that 668 more children needed a place in special schools by September 2022.

In response to questions from BBC News NI, the EA said that 91 of those 668 children still did not have an ascertained special school place - around 12% of those seeking a place. Meanwhile, another 148 children are still seeking places in specialist knowledge support units in mainstream primary and post-primary schools.

Those are special classes or units which provide extra assistance to pupils with additional needs. That means almost a quarter of children (22%) with statements of SEN who need a place in specialist requirement in a mainstream school still do not have one.
