Britain is in political chaos at the party gate. The Prince of Wales is said to hope the nation does not return to “bickering“ after the emotion of “togetherness” that over-whelmed the platinum jubilee.

In the Big Jubilee Lunch in the Oval, south London, Charles and his wife, Camilla, kicked off the final day of festivities to mark the Queen’s 70-year reign. 

The couple interacted with the 450 guests who included people from a variety of organisations, as well as locals and a group of 70 volunteers from the Royal Voluntary Service.

Sarah Friar, CEO of neighbourhood app Nextdoor, was one of those to meet Charles when he sat opposite her at her table.

“He said at the end how great it was that everyone comes together this weekend,” she said. “We see it with neighbours, right? I’m from a company called Nextdoor, so people come together with the best coming out. People who don’t know each other are out having fun.”

Friar, who lives close to San Francisco but is originally from Sion Mills in Co Tyrone, said that Charles commented: “When it comes to Monday are we going to go back to all the bickering again? Let’s hope we don’t do that.” Friar said it was “a wonderful thought” for all of us.

Charles and Camilla viewed a 6-metre x 1.5-metre tea party-themed felt art piece by Lucy Sparrow when they came to the event at the cricket ground. The piece will be exhibited later this year at the grand entrance of Buckingham Palace.
