I once read something somewhere Reading is not a chore Reading is theft It is a robbery Someone smarter than you has spent years beating their head against the wall trying to solve the problem you re dealing with You can steal that hard won knowledge and make it yours That is power Reading makes you powerful It gives you access to a world you d not otherwise have access to Whether it s fiction or nonfiction something as basic as your textbooks reading only gives An author puts years of research years of hard work to find something worth writing in a book You get that knowledge within hours You get the wisdom gained in years within days If that s not power I don t know what is How does fiction help you would ask Fiction in my opinion is the greatest source of wisdom People don t write fiction through material research while it may be a part of it they write fiction through raw knowledge They leave a part of their ideology in their books every character is a part of their imagination Through a fictional book you experience the life of many people Experience brings wisdom It s like learning from other people s mistakes It opens you to the kind of people you d most probably not meet in their truest form It shows you what happens in their head behind closed doors when they re not pretending It makes you empathetic and bold Makes you smart in a way only life could What you won t learn in different theorems and inventions you ll learn in a book about someone who doesn t even exist
