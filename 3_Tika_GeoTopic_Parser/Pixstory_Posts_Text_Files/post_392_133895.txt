These two towers were symbol of corrupt builder official nexus that has seeped into our society and they had to go After a long long time system has worked the way it should be and we should take heart that all hope is not lost The feeling was once the towers are erected it would be difficult to raze them down But our judicially proved these assumptions wrong and ordered the demolition Many fake arguments were peddled to stop the demolition but the Supreme Court did what was right Now many are arguing that the demolition would cause pollution and I find this argument laughable since it s not an issue of pollution but of corruption Noida s residents deal with harmful pollution every day due to non stop construction activities They should fight with every day pollution by forcing the administration to force construction companies to deploy anti pollution tool while carrying their activities The demolition will sting all those construction companies who think they are above It s a day to celeberate victory of law And I hope the demolition is carried on without causing any trouble to people who live in nearby societies
