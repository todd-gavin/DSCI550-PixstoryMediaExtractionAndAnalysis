Some of the most challenging ailments to identify are neurological problems. Symptoms are similar for a variety of illnesses, and they can vary significantly between people, making diagnosis difficult. Individuals will have to wait longer for the therapy they require as a result of delays. However, for more than 50 inherited neurological and neuromuscular illnesses, a new DNA test is currently fixing the problem.

Huntington's illness, Lou Gehrig's disease, fragile X syndrome, myoclonic epilepsy, and several inherited muscular or motor neuron diseases are among the ailments covered by the new test.

Short-tandem repeat expansion diseases are the umbrella term for these conditions. The name, which is inherited from parents, refers to the common element that causes these issues: extremely lengthy DNA sequences that repeat over and over in a person's genes.

The new test use a technology known as nanopore sequencing, which involves scanning a patient's genome for 37 genes linked to short-tandem repeat expansion disorders. When the test detects the genes, it checks to see if they're part of these long, repeating sequences and, if so, what those sequences are, determining the person's condition.

Although there is currently no cure for any of these disorders, early detection allows doctors to manage any problems and plan for future symptoms.

Doctors and patients had to rely on less reliable genetic screening before this test. The new method is less than $750 and employs technology similar to that of a stapler. It can also detect new repeated sequences, which could lead to the discovery of previously unknown diseases.
