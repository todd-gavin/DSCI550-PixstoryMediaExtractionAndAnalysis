Itâ€™s kinda unfair how little attention we pay to bats. Yes, they are not as cute as other animals but they are relevant too. Today is the day we celebrate bats!

Depending on where you encounter them, bats play roles that are both grim and humorous throughout literature and history. The bat is most frequently associated with vampires, but there are many other literary and filmic characters, including the silly bat from Ferngully (Batty Coda). However, bats play a significant part in our eco-system, and some of them are in risk of extinction. International Bat Night aims to increase public awareness of the importance of protecting our flying rodent companions. 

Every year on March 31st, the public can participate in a variety of bat events around the world as part of International Bat Night, a celebration of these animals. These events give you the opportunity to help bat conservation and to learn more about these creatures.
