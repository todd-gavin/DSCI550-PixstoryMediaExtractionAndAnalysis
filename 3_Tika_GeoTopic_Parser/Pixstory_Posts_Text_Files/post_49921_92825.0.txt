‌In an interview with Vox, a sex worker from America said: "Everybody has Sex; the only difference is that we pay for it". Every job should be respected. Prostitution is still considered to be a demeaning job (Irony Prevails). It is high time that this stigma is eliminated. Won't legalising sex and protecting their rights provide a safer environment for sex workers? 
‌
‌What are the main problems faced by sex workers? All of their problems stem from the criminalization of sex work. The criminalization creates a stigma for them which denies respect to sex workers and most exploit them. According to a survey, 27 per cent of the abuse they face is from police. Those who talk about criminalisation take advantage of them.  In a 2008 study, one respondent said she had been “made to perform sexual favours to avoid being charged with prostitution" to police officers.
‌
‌ A major part of the battle for sex workers’ rights has been a push for decriminalization, or removal of criminal penalties for selling and buying sex. Some of them advocate that the porn industry is a robust one; why do they restrict sex work? There is no federal law banning sex work but laws differ in the states. In some states, sex workers are penalised as sex offenders. Moreover, safe environments and proper legalisation prevent the spreading of STDs.
‌
‌Further, studies have shown it could highly control rape.  A 2018 study found that the 2003–2009 decriminalization of indoor prostitution in Rhode Island curtailed sexually transmitted infections (female gonorrhoea incidence declined by over 40%) and fewer rapes (reported rape offences fell by 30%).  A 2017 study found that the introduction of legal prostitution zones in the Netherlands substantially reduced drug-related crime, sexual abuse and rape (the latter two by 30–40% in the first two years).
‌
‌When sex work is a crime the plight of sex workers is hard. Encounters with law enforcement cause great financial difficulty for sex workers. Sex workers fight for their rights. They too are humans. It's their choice. One should not be discriminated against, based on their profession.
