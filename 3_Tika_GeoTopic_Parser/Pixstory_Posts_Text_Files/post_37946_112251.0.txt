Football is a skill that is easy to pick up and hard to master. Players need years of practice at the highest level to reach the top. Here are five players who have played their best football in recent years and have heftily been rewarded for it:

5. Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United)– £ 385,000 a week:

The 37-year-old football legend is in the twilight of his career. But Ronaldo is still going strong, he ended the 21/22 season as the highest scorer for Man United, hence justifying his price tag.



4. Mohamed Salah (Liverpool) – £ 400,000 a week:

The Egyptian has been the engine of Jurgen Klopp's setup at Liverpool. Salah has been consistent since joining the Reds. Hence he has been rewarded with a hefty salary extension.



3. Neymar (Paris Saint-Germain) £606,000-a-week:

Neymar joined PSG on a record €222m transfer in 2017. Since then, the Brazilian has cemented his legacy at the club and is presently one of the most skillful players on the planet.

2. Lionel Messi, (Paris Saint-Germain) – £ 960,000 a week:

Alongside Ronaldo, Messi is one of the best players to ever grace the game! His transfer to PSG last summer raised a lot of headlines and also added a lot of money to his pocket. However, Messi is yet to justify his price tag at his new club.


1. Kylian Mbappe (Paris Saint-Germain )– £1,000,000-a-week

Earing £1m a week, Kylian Mbappe's new deal is surely "Blockbuster". Just rising in rank, the PSG star still has a long way to go in his career and things are looking very positive for the same reason!
