 In Buchanan s time the upper part of the main temple had fallen the porch in its front also having lost its roof Inside the shrine was a pretty large pedestal supporting small images of Surya Ganesh etc though it was originally meant for some larger image which no longer existed in the shrine Cunningham during his visit found the figure of Surya in height He later explored the shrine floor and discovered a larger figure of Vishnu in height which he thought was the original image enshrined in the temple He mentions that if that would have been the case then the Surya image must have been from the adjacent temple which was completely in ruins and hence may have been shifted Garrick came across a local story that the small image of the Sun God was discovered by the villagers in the debris of the main temple and was later installed in the smaller temple Both the temples were ornamented with carved bricks On the dedicatory block of the little of the doorframe of the shrine was a representation which neither Cunningham nor Buchanan could identify Garrick during excavation came across a highly sculptured gateway belonging to the ancient temple Dr Patil mentions the similarity of the site with the nearby site of Deo Barunarak and concludes that the temple may have been originally dedicated to the Sun god and was later converted to the worship of Vishnu To be continued
