The Snow Lion and the Dragon:
Tibet-China Relations continues...

These four factors effectively prevented Tibet from putting up any successful military resistance to Chinese incursions from 1905 onwards, though there were times when they had temporarily managed to restore 
the situation.

 However, while the Tibetan military resistance to the Chinese from 1905 to the 1960’s and even 1970’s could form a book in itself, a few important events or milestones during the period from 1905 to 1950 are worth noting. Zhao Erfeng was energetic and possessed of maniacal cruelty. His campaign started with the division of eastern Tibet into what were named as the Chinese provinces of Qinghai (Amdo) and Xikang (Kham). His campaign to ‘integrate’ the  ‘barbarians’ began with the wholesale slaughter of monks, desecration of 
monasteries and atrocities against Tibetans, which earned him the nickname of ‘Butcher Zhao’ to the Tibetans and everlasting notoriety. 

When the Manchu Empire collapsed in 1911, the provincial warlords all declared independence from central rule, and in Amdo and in Kham continued the campaign against the Tibetans with the aim of expanding their own possessions.

 When the Nationalists came to power in 1928, they were not initially able to do much to ‘re-integrate’ Tibet and Mongolia, but they maintained that these areas were part of China since they had been part of the Manchu Empire. To drop the claim was to have lost ‘face’, and was therefore unacceptable to Chinese nationalism.
