 In the report of Cunningham mentions that he again visited Kurkihar with the object of exploring the hill to the north of the town as it was the scene of some of Maha kasyapa s miracles and eventually of his nirvana or death He mentions the account of Kurkihar as given by Fa Hian Translation by Herbert A Gilles as follows The great Chia yeh Kasyapa is at present at the mountain He split the mountain to get in The place where he entered will barely admit a man Going down to a great distance there is a niche in which stands a full length image of Chia yeh Outside the niche is the place where he used to wash his hands and the people of the district if they have some headache use this earth from that spot for plasters and are at once cured Therefore since that time there have been Lo hans on this mountain and when the devotees of the neighbouring countries come yearly to make their offerings to Chia yeh the Lo hans appear by night to the steadfast ones converse with them and resolve their doubts then they suddenly vanish On this mountain there are quantities of trees also a great many lions tigers and wolves so that the travelers have to be cautious He further mentions that Hiuen Tsang mentions the hills as lofty and scarped with three bold peaks that spring into the air These peaks have been identified by Cunningham already with the three peaks of the Murali mountain nearby at miles from Kurkihar According to Hieun Tsang twenty years after he had received Buddha s instructions Kasyapa ascended the Kukkuta pada mountain on the north side and walked along towards the south west He struck the rock with his staff and cleft it into two and then marched boldly into the heart of the mountain On reaching the middle peak he took up Buddha s chivara dress The three peaks approached and retired or closed and opened according to his mere wish When Maitreya visited the mountain Kasyapa presented him with the Chivara of the Buddha and after performing some miracles entered into nirvana
