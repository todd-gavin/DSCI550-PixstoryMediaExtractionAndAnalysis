Sight Dark tree trunks shadows overhanging limbs across the path seen at the last second clumps of bushes barely visible black trails snaking through the undergrowth moon shining through a lattice of leaves patchy sky stars seen in glimpses through tree breaks tall shadowed pines stretching up like arrows into the sky streaks of cloud against the Sounds Wind slipping through leaves cracking undergrowth with each step creaking tree trunks the flutter of wings unseen snapping twigs grass and weed sliding against pant legs breathing sounds coyote calls fox yipping wolves howling if within location snarls padding feet along a trail a grunt of pain at catching a root or tripping on dead fall a rip of Smells Rich earth rotting leaves pine needles fresh air a slight scent of flowers earthy fungus tree sap wild animal musk if close possibly the spray of a skunk if around green growing things spring summer moss Tastes Sweat on lips dryness in throat sometimes a cold metallic tang if lots of stone is present Touch Cobwebs in face cold dewy leaves sliding across skin slipping on wet leaves and mushrooms tripping on bumpy roots stones dead fall thorns scratching skin scrapes and cuts on hands from falling in the dark pine needles embedded in skin during fall twisting and jerking at every unfamiliar sound holding hands out to ward off unseen obstacles like tree Evening and Night The evening sun cast long shadows on the ground The sky was ablaze with the fire of the setting sun The night sky was aglow with bright city lights The pale crescent moon shone like a silvery claw in the night sky We looked up at the blanket of stars that stretched to infinity The same place can look and feel very different at different times of the day Take a park for example At daybreak it is cool and invigorating full of songbirds walkers and joggers At midday it is sleepy hot and still In the evening shadows lengthen and coolness returns But at night it can be a frightening place with dangers lurking in the dark shadows of the foliage
