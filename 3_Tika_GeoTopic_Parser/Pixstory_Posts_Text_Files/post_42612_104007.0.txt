The day has come when Gareth Bale, a Real Madrid club legend announced that he is leaving the club and will not play in a Real Madrid jersey from next season.

I started watching football in 2014 and by the time I started supporting Real Madrid, Bale Benzema and Cristiano were at their peak. Now, I feel very lucky that I got to watch how good Gareth Bale was for Real Madrid because nowadays fans criticising him a lot after the “Wales.Golf.Madrid” controversy.

He is leaving the club after nine years and he won many trophies with Real Madrid which are as follows:- 

1. Five UEFA Champions League 

2. Three La Liga

3. Four Club World Cup

4. Three UEFA Super Cup

5. One Spanish Cup

6. Three Spanish Super Cup

With Real Madrid, Gareth Bale scored 106 goals and made 67 assists.

Now you are leaving our club, I think football fans will start respecting you and your contribution to taking forward the legacy of Real Madrid.

You came here as a boy and now leaving the club as a legend. Goodbye Gareth Bale.
