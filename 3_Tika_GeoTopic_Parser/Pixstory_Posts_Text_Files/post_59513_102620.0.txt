At the Eden Gardens in Kolkata, Patidar hit an unbeaten 112 in just 54 balls to lead RCB to a magnificent 207/4 batting first. 
Patidar, who was brought in midway through the season as a replacement for Karnataka batter Luvnith Sisodia, ended up rewriting a few records. 
- Patidar is the first uncapped player in the IPL's playoffs/knockouts to make a century. 
He hit his century in 49 balls, which is the second-fastest century by any player in the IPL playoffs or knockouts. Patidar tied the record set by Wriddhiman Saha in the 2014 IPL final, when he struck 115 off 55 balls for Kings XI Punjab.
