It was dismal, unremarkable and all in all terrible football from Manchester United as they
lost to Liverpool in the Premier league late on Tuesday. The hosts scored four without reply
as they catch onto United's rivals City in the title race which continues to intensify.

 United
meanwhile, have gone from one low to another. If last week's loss against relegation
candidates Everton meant anything this game has only helped reconfirm the same.

Cristiano Ronaldo rescued a 3-2 win over Norwich at the weekend but he wasn't present at
Anfield, where the Merseyside club ran all over Ralf Ragnick's side. The lack of intensity,
desire and organisation was basically what Liverpool took advantage of, United were by all
means â€” outclassed. 

The likes of Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire once again caught
headlines for under par performances while Jadon Sancho caught the eye.

For Jurgen Klopp's team, Sadie Mane and Mo Salah ran riot. The two wingers were
rampant, making up for three of their team's four goals on the night. Midfielder Thiago
Alcantara bossed the game for the Reds, making United's players look like amateurs.

 A
rebuild is in the works at United, Ragnick confirmed with the imminent appointment of Erik
Ten Hag. Bruno Fernandes claimed Liverpool were fighting for the title while his side did not
have the same competitive desires.

CR7's absence obviously played a role but it isn't to say that United's catastrophic defending
wouldn't have lost them the game anyways. Apart from Jadon Sancho, midfielder Hannibal
Mejbri was an impressive talking point. With his five minute cameo at Anfield, his
performance got United fans on twitter talking. With some claiming that younger players like
the Tunisian must start games.

 In any case, that isn't far from the truth for Manchester
United who seem to go from one low to another.
