Pakistan lost the final of the Asia Cup to Sri Lanka and in all honesty, they deserved to lose after what was a pathetic showing. The pace bowlers provided the team a great platform to dominate proceedings as Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf ran through Sri Lanka’s top order. Sri Lanka must be given praise as they showed tremendous fighting spirit to post a total of 170. Pakistan’s batting order was ruthlessly exposed by Sri Lanka and we will look at why the Men in Green’s opening pair is both their biggest strength and weakness in T20is.
Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan have opened for Pakistan in T20is for the last coupleof years. It was under Misbah Ul Haq’s tenure that this opening pair was formed, and they have been somewhat of a success. In the ICC T20 World Cup 2021, they enjoyed huge success as an opening pair, especially in run chases. They created history in Pakistan’s first group game against arch-rivals India as they chased down a target of 152 without losing a wicket. One factor why they are the team’s biggest strength is the fact that they bothpossess technical qualities and do not make rash decisions. Babar Azam is one of the mostelegant players in world cricket and his ability to play pure cricketing shots has been there to see.
Another reason why they are Pakistan’s biggest strength in T20is is due to the fact that Pakistan’s middle order is extremely weak. This has been on display throughout the Asia Cup as after one of the opening pair loses their wicket, the middle order struggles to kick on and finish the innings off strongly. Fakhar Zaman has endured poor form in T20is in the last couple of years and he failed to create any impact in the Asia Cup too.
