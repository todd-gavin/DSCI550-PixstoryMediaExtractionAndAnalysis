The advertisements were first broadcast during the first Test match between England and New Zealand. One of the adverts sees four men having a conversation at a deserted store. The men are debating who will take the “shot” as there are four of them and only “one shot”. As the men discuss the topic, a woman is shown in the ad. She turns back to berate them as she thinks they are conversing about her, but later realises that their talk is centred on the last remaining bottle of the Layer'r perfume. 
Several people also tagged the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) and demanded that it take the advert off air. The ASCI had responded saying that “The ad is in serious breach of the ASCI Code and is against public interest". The body added that it has "taken immediate action and notified the advertiser to suspend the ad, pending investigation.”
