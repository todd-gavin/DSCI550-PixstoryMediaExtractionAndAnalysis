Erik Stenberg MD PhD Erik N slund MD Abstract Background While metabolic surgery is known to improve type diabetes T D as well as established heart disease separately it is not known whether the outcome is influenced by T D status in patients with established heart disease Objectives To evaluate the risks for major cardiovascular events MACE or mortality in patients with established heart disease with or without T D Setting Nationwide registry based Methods Patients with established heart disease operated with sleeve gastrectomy or Roux en Y gastric bypass in Sweden from until were matched to normal population controls using a two staged matching exact matching on T D followed by optimal matching on propensity score for age sex dyslipidemia chronic obstructive pulmonary disease type of heart disease T D duration county of residence and level of education The risk for MACE was evaluated separately depending on T D status Results In total patients who underwent surgery and matched controls were included Reduced risk for MACE and mortality were seen after metabolic surgery for patients with heart disease and T D compared to controls adjusted HR CI p and adjusted HR CI p respectively and for patients with heart disease alone compared to controls adjusted HR CI p and adjusted HR CI p respectively Conclusions Metabolic surgery was associated with a reduced risk for MACE and mortality in patients with preexisting heart disease and T D as well as in patients with heart disease without T D Patients with heart disease and T D seem to experience the highest risk reduction Sources
