When a craving strikes midday or gets you right before bed, it can take all sorts of self-control to ignore them. Snacking can be difficult when trying to stick to a specific diet, because it can be hard to know what foods are suitable and which are probably better to skip without consulting the ingredients list or doing a Google search.

Nuts are always a good choice when it comes to healthy snacking, as they are high in fiber, protein, and healthy fats. If your goal is weight loss, Livestrong recommends nuts for their ability to keep you fuller longer than other snacks. While all nuts are nutritious, certain ones offer different benefits. 
If you’re craving for something you can have these almonds but yessss make sure that don’t overdo.
