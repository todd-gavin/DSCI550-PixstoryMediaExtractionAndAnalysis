India, abstained vote against Russia.  As the explaination of India’s vote, India’s Permanent Representative to the UN T S Tirumurti said “India is deeply disturbed by the recent turn of developments in Ukraine. 

We urge that all efforts are made for the immediate cessation of violence and hostilities”.

Dialogue is the only answer to settling differences and disputes, however daunting that may appear at this moment. It is a matter of regret that the path of diplomacy was given up. We must return to it. For all these reasons, India has chosen to abstain on this resolution,” Tirumurti said.

With this India has survived to hold its balancing act for another day, despite the substantial pressures from the West to get off the fence, as well as pressures from Russia.

India’s ambivalence at this crucial situation of the world politics roots from its friendships and strategic alliances on Russia and Ukraine. 

Russia, being India’s biggest and time tested supplier of defence weapons, Moscow has a large role in boosting India's defence capabilities with S-400 defence system. Russia has also stood behind India at the UNSC on all issues.

Moreover, India has an intense partnership with the United States, including defence pacts, trade and investment, technology, and Indian diaspora prevails in US with hundreds of students at US. The same is with Europe and France. 

219 Indians, mostly students studying medicine in Ukraine, footed off the Air India aircraft that flew them home from Bucharest in Romania — the first batch of Indian nationals evacuated Saturday under Operation Ganga after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 

Union Minister Piyush Goyal, who was at Mumbai airport to receive those evacuated, said: “We are happy that 219 of our citizens who are mostly students, the majority of them girls, have come back safely.
