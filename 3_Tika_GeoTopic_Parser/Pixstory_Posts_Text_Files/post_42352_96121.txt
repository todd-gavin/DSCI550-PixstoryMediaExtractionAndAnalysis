Today On the nd of April whole world is celebrating Earth Day and today everybody will become an expert on how to save our earth and how Governments of different countries can make new policies to make Earth better than ever but they will never think once that how they can help the Earth to be better Today I ll become one of those experts and will give you my advice on how to make our Earth better than ever So I live in India and in terms of hygiene and cleanliness India s rank in the World tally is very low There are many reasons that our country is not fully hygienic and the people of India didn t concentrate on the cleanliness of the country The first and most important cause of this problem is that there is no strict rule from the government to punish people who didn t care about the hygiene and cleanliness of the place they are living or traveling to Last November I traveled to UAE and there I saw the real strictness of the police and how the people of UAE care about their country and they are doing their bit to save their country Coming back to India here people s mentality is worse because if one person saw another person who throws a wrapper of food or throws a bottle from their car or bike first person will think that if the second person didn t care about cleanliness so why should I be so careful And this mentality is making our country worst day by day As a citizen of India we should concentrate on the hygiene and cleanliness of our country and even if we clean the area outside our homes believe me you are doing your bit to make this country as well as this Earth better than ever Note down the ways that you think our Earth can become better
