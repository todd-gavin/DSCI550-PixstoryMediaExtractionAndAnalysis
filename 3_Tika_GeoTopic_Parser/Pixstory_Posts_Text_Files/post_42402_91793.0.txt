As a fan of Real Madrid club football, whenever my team wins a match, usually I enjoy the win and think that Real Madrid deserves this win. 

But in the last match against Celta Vigo, my thoughts are different this time. Real Madrid won the match by a 1-2 scoreline but I still think that Celta Vigo deserves to win this match because of many flaws from the referee and VAR (Video Assistant Referee).

The first big mistake from the referee happened in the 39th minute of the match when the referee gave the Celta Vigo goal an offside, as a viewer of football for the last 8 years, it was onside, and the goal should be given to Celta Vigo.

But Celta Vigo played intense football and scored a leveler in the 52nd minute of the match and from here the match was even for both teams.

In the 70th minute of the match, when Real Madrid defender Ferland Mendy got a pass from L. Vazquez and he entered the Celta Vigo box and dived when a Celta Vigo defender was closer to him and the referee gave another penalty to Real Madrid and Benzema scored the winning goal of the match.

After watching that clip many times, I am very sure that the dive from Mendy was fake and the refereeâ€™s decision of giving a penalty was wrong. 

As a Real Madrid fan, I want my team to win the match where no media person or football experts can raise their voice or write bad things about Real Madrid. 

The next match of Real Madrid will be against Chelsea FC in the quarterfinal of the UEFA Champions League and I expect Real Madrid to show the fighting spirit against the former UCL champions and emerge as a winner of the match.
