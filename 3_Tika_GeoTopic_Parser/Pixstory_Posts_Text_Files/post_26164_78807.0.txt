Tom Bradyâ€™s football career traced an arc that bordered on mythical, his ascent from sixth-round N.F.L. draft pick to seven-time Super Bowl champion quarterback and global celebrity. And it has ended, after more than two decades of unparalleled brilliance in his sport.
Brady, who once said that he would retire only when his performance began to decline, has decided to leave the N.F.L. still, at age 44, at the apex of his powers. He announced his retirement on Instagram on Tuesday, after leading the league, in his 22nd season, in passing yards (5,316), completions (485) and touchdowns (43) for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who lost in the divisional round of the N.F.C. playoffs to the Los Angeles Rams.
