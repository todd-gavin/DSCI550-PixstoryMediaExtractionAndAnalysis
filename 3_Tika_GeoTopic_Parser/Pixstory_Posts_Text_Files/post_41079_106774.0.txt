Camille Vasquez, a lawyer, has shot off rumours that she and actor Johnny Depp are dating. 
During Mr Depp's six-week defamation trial against Amber Heard, Ms Vasquez was one of his key counsel. There was social media speculation throughout the high-profile trial that Ms Vasquez was dating her Hollywood client, which she has now addressed. 

In an interview with People, Ms Vasquez said, "I guess it comes with the territory of being a woman just doing her job."

She added, "It's disappointing that certain outlets kind of ran with it or said that my interactions with Johnny - who is a friend and I've known and represented for four-and-a-half years now - that my interactions in any way were inappropriate or unprofessional. That's disappointing to hear."

Further, Ms Vasquez also said she "cares very deeply" about her clients. She insisted that the "entire team" became closer during the proceedings. "I'm Cuban and Colombian. I'm tactile. What do you want me to say? I hg everyone. And I'm not ashamed about that," she added. 

Camille Vasquez has recently been promoted to partner at Brown Rudnick. During the trial, which took place in Virginia, she became a bit of an internet celebrity. As she grew in popularity among Mr Depp's fans, she received social media posts and tributes.
