Samuel Sandoval, one of just four surviving Navajo code talkers from World War II out of a total of 29, passed away recently surrounded by family and friends at his West Virginia home.

The Navajo code talkers were 29 members of the Navajo community who were recruited to utilize their own language to transmit communications to American forces abroad.

Due to the fact that the Navajo language was unrecorded at the time, decoding the code by the adversary was almost impossible.

Essentially, the code connected a Navajo term with a certain military tactic. This system enabled Navajo code talkers to deliver approximately 800 communications during the fight of Iwo Jima, giving the United States a much-needed edge as acknowledged by military leadership at the time.
