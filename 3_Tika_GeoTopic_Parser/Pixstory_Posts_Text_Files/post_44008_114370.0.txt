Bernd Leno is one of the seven players on the Gunners’ list who have been put for release this summer transfer window. 

The newly-promoted “Whites” had earlier shown an interest in Leno, who could be swayed by the opportunity to stay in London. And now, both sides are close in reaching an agreement for the German keeper. The 30-year-old is in the final year of his contract with Arsenal. 
Bernd Leno had lost his chance to start the games for Arsenal to Aaron Ramsdale last season and the arrival of Matt Turner has made it easy for the German international to leave. 

Fulham manager Marco Silva wants to sign a new goalkeeper ahead of the new campaign to increase the chances of his team staying in the Premier League. Leno’s agent had confirmed that “The Whites” are trying hard to wrap up a deal for the German. 

Leno is searching for a move that can offer him a first-team place ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup which is to be held in Qatar. Arsenal continues to pursue a deal for Ajax defender Lisandro Martinez, but outgoings may need to have a similar focus as Arteta looks on reshaping his squad ahead of the next campaign. 

Record signing Nicolas Pepe, Hector Bellerin, Lucas Torreira, Pablo Mari, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Reiss Nelson are all up for a sale along with Leno. Gabriel Jesus, Fabio Vieira, Marquinhos and Turner have cost around 83 million pounds so far but the Gunners are looking forward to spending more on signings. 

Meanwhile, Fulham claimed to accept a 10 million pounds bid for Manchester United outcast Andreas Pereira. Defensive midfielder Joao Paulhinha has already signed from Sporting Lisbon in a transfer potentially worth 20 million pounds. Sources have also confirmed that Fulham has agreed on a loan deal for Shakhtar Donetsk winger Manor Solomon.
