Purpose Acute neurovascular imaging including MRA and or CTA are routinely performed in the emergency departments ED for patients who present with suspected transient ischemic attacks TIA Given the current emphasis on mitigating the rising cost of health care nationally and promoting high value practice we sought to determine the value of acute neurovascular imaging in patients presenting to the ED with TIA like symptoms and whether these neurovascular studies led to a difference in management strategies Method We retrospectively reviewed ED patients who presented with transient neurological deficits and underwent neurovascular imaging from We reviewed diffusion weighted imaging DWI and neurovascular results by patient demographics baseline risk factors final diagnosis treatment management dispositions and three month follow up Results of patients were diagnosed with true TIA whereas patients were deemed to have a non vascular etiology Total rates of positive MRA CTA for severe intracranial and cervical vessel stenosis were and Patients with positive DWI scans had significantly higher rates of severe vascular stenosis versus intracranially and versus in the neck compared to those with negative DWI scans All patients were treated with multi pronged medical therapies with no immediate surgical intervention A follow up stroke was equally likely in TIA patients with or without severe vascular stenosis Conclusions In patients presenting with TIA like symptoms and DWI negative scans the overall rate of positive neurovascular studies is very low Triaging with DWI can reduce the frequency of unnecessary neurovascular imaging Abbreviations TIAtransient ischemic attackEDEmergency DepartmentCVScervical vascular stenosisIVSintracranial vascular stenosisHTNhypertensionDMdiabetes mellitusAFatrial fibrillationDWIdiffusion weighted imagingCVAcerebrovascular accident stroke CEAcarotid endarterectomy
