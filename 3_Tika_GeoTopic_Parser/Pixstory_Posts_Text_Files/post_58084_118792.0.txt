How to protect heroine 's older brother is a masterpiece in terms art and story. I absolutely love it üòç , it is based on the novel of the same name . The webtoon illustration is done by Juniljus and is already on its second season. Roxana is my favourite protagonist, she is  dark ,  unhinged and morally grey . She makes choices that benefit her the most and her wardrobe and dresses help maintain that aura . 

She has fabulous dresses  that give her a fallen angel / goddess like appearance. The art and asthetics keep up with the dark , psychological, brutual pacing of the story .
It is a must read if you are into thriller, psychological, murder genre .
