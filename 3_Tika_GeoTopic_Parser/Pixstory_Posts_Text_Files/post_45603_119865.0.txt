Even if we'd like to know what Spencer and his friends will be doing after this, the time isn't right yet. The fifth season of All American won't air next month. 

All American Season 5 premieres this month, although we wish we could say that instead. The CW will not be airing the programme again this summer. For one of the most popular series on the network, that is just absurd. 

It will take a little while to learn what Spencer and his friends are doing next. We need to wait a little bit longer to find out if Spencer and Liv can maintain their connection as well as what Coop has planned for the future.

The good news is that the end of the tunnel is in sight. We at least have a premiere date confirmed.
