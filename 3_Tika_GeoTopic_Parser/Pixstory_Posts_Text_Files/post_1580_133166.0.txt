Is there such thing as perversion? 

To many people that word seems to not exist in these modern times. 

I went to see a modern rendition of A Mid Summer Night’s Dream tonight in DC with our 10 and 12 year old children. 

They called it A Mid Summer Night’s Nightmare. Their words not mine. 

I regret that I took them. The play was a twisted and perverse version of the original play that left us all feeling awful with the unending graphic sexual, beastial, homosexual and trans etc. references. 

So, I am curious… what do you think? 

Is there such thing as perversion? Can love be perverted? 

Or is that an ancient word that is insensitive and not up with the times?
