A revolting but predictable demonstration happened in Minneapolis when black lives matter protestors arrived at the apartment of a woman whose unit had been shot up by a stalker who was ultimately killed by police. The protestors arrived to protest the death of the man. They confronted the stalked woman who was present in the apartment with her children at the time of the shooting and they accused her of being a liar.

This is the chief problem with modern protests: enormous groups come to protest a topic that they know little to nothing about. They go out, scream at dissenters, and create havoc in neighborhoods because the mob commands them to do so without first acquiring knowledge of the facts.

These demonstrations are typically devoid of rational argument. What normally occurs is that we see a large group of people opposing an occurrence because they believe in a principle, but they have not bothered to consider if the occurrence they are denouncing is consistent with the principle they hold.

This is why these demonstrations often divide rather than unify individuals for a shared cause. In this instance, for example, a woman who was almost murdered is being labelled a liar; she may have protested with those individuals during the George Floyd rallies, but it is now impossible to envision a future circumstance in which she would align herself with them.
