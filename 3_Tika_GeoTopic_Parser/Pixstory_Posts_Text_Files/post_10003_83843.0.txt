I wish the day would come when there would be peace all over the world and everyone would live together without fear or apprehension.  The day will come when we will not lose our loved ones and tears of mourning will not spring up in our eyes.  I wish children, young people and the elderly to laugh from the bottom of their hearts and never let despair knock on the door of their hearts.  In the hope that one day all people will breathe in an atmosphere full of love and intimacy with their loved ones.  No drops of blood should be spilled anywhere on the scorched earth.  And no lover should wear the clothes of mourning in the longing for his love;  No mother's heart beats longing to see her child!  Wars spawn.  Tanks and air fighters - be destroyed, soldiers give each other roses instead of bullets.  On the battlefield, write letters in memory of their dancing mistresses, speak of love, and say: The world leaders have agreed to turn the world into a land of tulips and anemones.

 O politicians of conscience, please end up on the battlefields, so that the flames of murderous rage may die and man may become attached to living in this ruined world.  Call the innocent warriors, so that they do not split each other.  War is not a joke.  Let the rose season come and the seedlings of love and friendship be fruitful, let the soldiers return home with bunches of red roses and lay their heads in the lap of their love.  O dirty politicians, let us adorn the earth with kindness!
