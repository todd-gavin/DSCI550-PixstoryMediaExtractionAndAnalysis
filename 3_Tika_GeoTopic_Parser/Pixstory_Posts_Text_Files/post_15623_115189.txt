What do you see in this photo Pasta uhm fuocono in reality they are penne made only from lentil flour so it looks like pasta but they are PROTEINS topped with Sicilian pistachio pesto PDO good oils and fats especially bruschetta gluten-free bread from ancient grains for me as I am celiac but for the others are fine bread even with gluten with seasonal tomatoes zucchini with flowers pan-fried ahhhhhh heresy Pan-fried Exactly With a drizzle of oil, water and a LITTLE salt who said vegetables must necessarily be steamed sad or worse boiled that loses all the vitamins etc in the cooking water It seems to you the sad meal of a person on a diet Not to me Among other things vegan and gluten free Sorry if not much
