Just watched the season finale episode of Marvel’s web series “Moonknight” and one thing I want to say is that this is the perfect ending of the not-so-perfect web series.

The fifth episode ended on a note where we saw that the hearts of both Steven and Marc got balanced but while fighting with the villains, Steven died and Marc felt helpless in front of the queen of Tawaret.

The final episode begins from the same scene and Marc asks Queen of Tawaret that is there any way that Marc can bring back Steven and fight against Harrow. Queen of Tawaret helped him, I am not telling you how and after that what happened was total madness.

Expect the unexpected from this episode and marvel fans got what they were asking since episode number got aired and that thing lived up to the expectations.

The only thing that I didn’t like about this whole series is that Marvel didn’t show us proper action scenes because if you are calling your main lead “Vengeance” then this “mediocre” type of actions scenes will not work in the future.

If I talk about acting in this whole series, Oscar Issac shined like a bright star and other actors complimented him as well.

Moonknight will come back with another season and with new characters too and as a Marvel fan, my only request to Marvel is, to show action sequences without any hesitation, and with that only, your series will achieve new heights for sure.
