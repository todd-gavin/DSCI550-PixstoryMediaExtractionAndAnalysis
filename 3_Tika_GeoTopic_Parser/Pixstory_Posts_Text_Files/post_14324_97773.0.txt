POWERING AWAY - Since the introduction of three points for a win, this could be only the second Serie A season in club history in which Juventus have obtained more points away than at home. At the moment the Bianconeri have collected 31 points at the Allianz Stadium, 35 away.

OPEN QUESTION - As a percentage, no team has conceded fewer goals from open play than Juventus this season (60%). Furthermore, no team has conceded less than the Bianconeri overall from open play, with just 18 goals leaked.

TANGO TARGET - After his ninth of the campaign on Monday, Paulo Dybala requires one more goal to become the fifth Argentine player in Serie A history to reach double figures in at least six different seasons, after Gabriel Batistuta (nine), Hernán Crespo (eight), Abel Balbo (seven) and Mauro Icardi (six).

BEING KEAN - With the winner against Sassuolo, Moise Kean took his tally to five goals so far and is just one away from his personal best of six strikes in a single Serie A season (2018/19).
