Rhode posted a post on Instagram giving a few tips on how to stay hydrated in and out

1) drink a lot of water 

2) layer glaze with your favorite SPF to lock in hydration and protect your skin

3)restore sun-soaked skin + lips with a generous dose of BRC and peptide lip treatment

4)mix glaze with your favorite foundation for a dewy, skin-first makeup look

5) refresh and reset with a good night's sleep


These steps seem accurate and healthy.
