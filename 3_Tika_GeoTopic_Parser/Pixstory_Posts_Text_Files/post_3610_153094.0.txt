By BestMediaInfo Bureau Quite recently, media reports surfaced that a bunch of international advertisers like Dyson, Mazda, Forbes, PBS Kids, among others, had pulled out their advertisements from Twitter as their ads were being displayed alongside tweets promoting child pornography and sexual abuse of children. According to reports, Coca-cola and Disney were also among the brands that found their ads appearing on the profile pages of Twitter accounts sharing illicit material. In India, the Delhi Commission for Women has sought a CBI investigation on the availability of child porn on Twitter. Although social media platforms including Twitter, do take action against such malpractices, brand safety is compromised a lot when such situations arise. Twitter too banned more than 57 thousand accounts for promoting child porn and nudity in India between July 26 and August 25 this year. According to experts, if Twitter doesn’t pay heed to the advertisers’ concerns, they will soon be looking at the spending going elsewhere on the internet. Shradha Agarwal, CEO, Grapes Digital, stated that due to brand image and safety issues, Indian advertisers have mostly stopped advertising on Twitter. She stated in another five years, she does not see Twitter being a major part of media plans. “It is the last place marketers use for brand awareness or new launches,” she said. Earlier this year, Twitter admitted to overestimating its user base by 1.9 million users each quarter for three years. While brands still dealing with overstated reach issues, brand safety has become a bigger challenge for advertisers on Twitter.
