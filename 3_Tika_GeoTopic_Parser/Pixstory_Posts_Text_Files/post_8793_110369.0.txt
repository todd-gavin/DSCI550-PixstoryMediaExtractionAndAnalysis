My Years in the Supreme Court continues....

When I went to Hyderabad, members of the judiciary and the Judges of the High Court were used to a very leisurely pace of work. 

Cases proceeded slowly and leisurely and took a good deal of time to decide. When I started deciding 10 or 12 cases every day while sitting on the bench of the Supreme Court, the High Court Judges. also speeded up their pace and the work proceeded at a greater speed than before. Hyderabad people are fond of good food. Their Urdu is delightful; there is no mixing of words of different languages. in their talk. I found most of them very cultured and refined. 

A very interesting story was told to me by one of the ministers of the State during the period of Razakar movement. Negotiations for accession of the State were proceeding between India and the Nizam. 

In a full cabinet meeting of the ministers presided over by the Nizam, the Chief Minister proposed that the State should accede to India on her terms. It is well known that those terms were most favourable to the Nizam and under those terms he would have kept Hyderabad as a federal unit in the Union of India without much interference from the Centre.

The Chief Minister advised his colleagues that these terms should be accepted and the Cabinet endorsed his suggestion. The Nizam also agreed and the Chief Minister was directed to proceed to Delhi to finalise the relationship between the Union of India and the Nizam on the basis of the terms offered.
