“Freedom is the open window through which pours the sunlight of the human spirit and human dignity.”
Freedom is a different meaning to everyone and what I think Freedom for me is being able to select the way of my future by myself. Being able to select that I want the way to highest studies or job ; that I want to be a content writer or reporter; that I want to get a government job or private job ; this is all the freedom I want to being able to select the way ; that I want to walk on by myself so that there is no regret in my life even if it was a failure.
