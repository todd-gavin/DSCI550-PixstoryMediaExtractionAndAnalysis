Good news for Marcell Jacobs The Olympic gold medalist in the meters finally healed from the injury to his left hamstring as evidenced by the control MRI he underwent on Wednesday The champion and his staff can therefore look at the World Championships positive even if most likely Jacobs will get there without making any official competition so as not to force too much The situation has returned to normal, explained Jacobs&#39; coach Paolo Camossi The scrupulous therapies followed have borne the hoped-for results Now it is a question of continuing to work progressively to arrive in Eugene in the best conditions It means that before the World Cup we have no race scheduled If otherwise we see that it will be worth including one we will evaluate the possibility carefully This means that Marcell Jacobs will miss both the Assoluti di Rieti scheduled for Saturday June and the Diamond League stage in Stockholm on Thursday June We will see him again directly at the World Championships in Eugene hoping to celebrate once again with him in July when the final of the meters is scheduled
