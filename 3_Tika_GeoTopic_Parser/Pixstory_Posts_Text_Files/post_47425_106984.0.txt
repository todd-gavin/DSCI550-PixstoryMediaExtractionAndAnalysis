The transfer window is in full swing in England. Manchester City have announced the signing of 
Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund whereas Liverpool are on the verge of closing the deal for talented Darwin Nunez.

On the other hand, Manchester United are nowhere near completion of the deals.

However, they have a lot of outgoings in the summer transfer window. They are offloading Eric Bailly and Axel Tuanzebe.

Axel Tuanzebe, raised in Rochdale, was seen as the next big thing at Old Trafford when Jose 
Mourinho gave the player the gametime. Under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the player was about to 
be the regular starter before the injuries marred his career.

Following the arrival of Raphael Varane, he was sent on two loan spells across Europe. Before joining Napoli on loan, he was a part of Steven Gerrardâ€™s line up.

The options are very less for the Englishman but Brighton and Hove Albion might be interested in securing the services of the versatile defender.
