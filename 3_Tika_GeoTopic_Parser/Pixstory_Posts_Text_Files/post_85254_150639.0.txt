On October 1, SC Freiburg will face Mainz in the German Bundesliga. The game will begin at 19:00 local time.
The Freiburg team has had a solid start to the season, both regionally and in the Europa League, and their latest 3-0 success over Olympiacos, a stalwart of the continent, demonstrated their offensive prowess. Though Freiburg entered this game with three straight clean sheets and 6 for the season, it's not just their offensive play that is earning praise. 
Mainz has performed inconsistently and indifferently in comparison, dropping them to eighth place in the standings despite being only two points behind Hoffenheim in fourth. It would be a step up for Mainz to finish in the Europa Conference League spots after manager Bo Svensson led the team to ninth in his first full season in charge.

SC Freiburg vs Mainz 05: Prediction
There are only three points separating the two teams, but recent performance and home advantage may end up being the deciding factors. Freiburg enters the match having kept three clean sheets across all competitions, but Mainz's recent performance has been a little less certain.
