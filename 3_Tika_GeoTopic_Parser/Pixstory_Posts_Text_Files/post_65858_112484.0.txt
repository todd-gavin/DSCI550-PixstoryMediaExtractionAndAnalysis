It was the evening after India’s defeat at the 2019 World Cup against New Zealand in Manchester. The loss was yet to sink in. India had failed to chase down 240 and the dream of winning the trophy had come to an end. The man most in the line of fire was Pant for throwing his wicket away. He was called overrated, overweight, reckless and more. His approach to batting was slammed.

Ganguly’s words were hard to believe but he was always fond of Pant and, in the circumstances, it sounded like a huge overstatement.

Exactly three years down the line, one has to agree with Ganguly. Two series defining knocks in Australia, hundreds South Africa (1), England (2) and Australia (1) and the pace at which he bats, Pant is fast elevating himself to the status of a modern day great.

Sitting in a Manchester restaurant, Sourav Ganguly once said, “He will be your biggest match winner in the next 10 years. Mark my words. 

Yesterday Pant's heroics helped India reach 400+ score, which otherwise would've been no more than 250 at best. 

Turns out Ganguly's words about Rishabh Pant are coming true
