Lord Byron was a gifted poet, and a leading light of the Romantic Movement. Byron's long poems 'Childe Harold's Pilgrimage', made him famous. Byron was a dynamic personality with a passion for travel.

He travelled to Italy, and resided there from 1819 to 1824. He wrote the great long poem 'Don Juan,' during this time. 'She Walks in Beauty,' is a lovely short lyric poem penned by him. 'The Giaour,' 'The Bride of Abydos', 'Parisina,' and 'The Siege of Corinth,' are some of his other famous works. Byron left Italy in July, 1823 to join hands with rebels who were waging a war of independence against the Ottoman Empire.

However, he succumbed to fever at Missolonghi, in Greece. Though Byron was born in 1788, his poetry is widely read, even in 2017.
