Bad atmosphere in Milan after the heavy declarations of Paolo Maldini lo and Massara expiring and not respectful that Gazidis and Elliott have not sat down to talk to us These are the words of the Head of the Rossoneri Technical Area I like to be a sort of guarantee for the AC Milan fan I&#39;m not the right person to do a project that doesn&#39;t have a winning idea The reality is that the owners have never sat down at the table with us and this isn&#39;t good Lo and Massara we&#39;re expiring and we haven&#39;t renewed For the route fact and the Rangnick affair I find it disrespectful that the CEO Ivan Gazidis and Elliott have not even sat down to talk Serious statements from Maldini who is throwing fuel on the fire at Milan&#39;s home The Rossoneri company currently managed by the Elliot fund indeed seems to have more of an internal problem if a character decisive for the conquest of the scudetto like Maldini expresses his disappointment in this way
