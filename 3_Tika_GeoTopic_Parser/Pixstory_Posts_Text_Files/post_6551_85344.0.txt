In the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, thousands of Indian students were left stranded. Many of them made distress videos from their universities in Ukraine, while several others criticised the government’s delayed or inadequate response after returning home. This has given rise to a barrage of misinformation and propaganda on social media and mainstream media alike, attempting to shift the blame of the students’ predicament on the students themselves. Alt News debunked a video where a false quote was attributed to mock a student. In another instance, a student was falsely accused of “pretending” to be in Ukraine.

Now, a video is viral that shows students mocking television news media’s coverage of events leading up to the invasion. While some students can be heard denying the possibility of a war, others can be heard saying that Russia has withdrawn some of its troops. This clip is being shared on social media to claim there were “enough warnings” issued by the government ahead of Russia’s assault on February 24, but the students did not take them seriously.

The video has also been shared by multiple users on Facebook.

Misleading
We rummaged through the replies to tweets carrying the video and came across multiple links to the YouTube channel that had originally posted the video on February 16.

The complete video starts with a montage of different clips from Indian television news. In one clip, a news anchor says “only 1 hour and 23 minutes left” before the war begins. From the very beginning, the tone of the vlog is established – a light-hearted mockery of how dramatically events were presented by TV news. At 2:33 minutes the interviewer (Sourav) laughs saying Russia is going to invade in 1 hour 20 minutes.
