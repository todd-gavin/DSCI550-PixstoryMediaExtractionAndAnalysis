On Tuesday, US Vice President Kamala Harris spoke to the American people about the importance of a) being aware of the Child Tax Credit conditions and b) to take action to ensure that they did not lose out. 

VP Harris on the Child Tax Credit

To assist you with what you need to know and do, we have summarised the details of the key aspects of the American Rescue Plan, which, besides approving a third round of stimulus checks to every eligible American for up to $1,400, enhanced and expanded several tax credits for the 2021 fiscal year. Households with children could especially benefit from these changes resulting in a larger tax refund when they file this year.

A few of the tax credits the legislation enhanced include the Child and Dependent Care Credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, which also came with an advance payment scheme in 2021. Households that welcomed a new member to the family last year could potentially see another $1,400 stimulus check. But you will need to file a 2021 tax return in order to take advantage of the changes.

Parents that welcomed a new member, or members, to their family in 2021 might be able to claim a $1,400 third Economic Impact Payment, better known as the third round of stimulus checks, for each of the new additions. On 2021 tax returns you can claim the amount that your newborn or adopted child would have received had the IRS known about their existence when the $1,400 payments were sent out.

Taxpayers with an adjusted gross income (AGI) below a certain threshold qualified for the full amount. Those income limits were as follows: up to $75,000 if single, $112,500 as head of household or $150,000 if married and filing jointly.

But in the third round, the corresponding amount tapered off faster than the previous two rounds of stimulus checks. Taxpayers did not qualify for even a partial payment if their AGI was at or above $80,000 if single, $120,000 as head of household or $160,000 if married and filing jointly.
