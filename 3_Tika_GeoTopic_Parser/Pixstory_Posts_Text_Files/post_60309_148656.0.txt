On the fifth and final day of the summit clash on Sunday, West Zone defeated South Zone by a huge margin of 294 runs to claim the 2022 Duleep Trophy victory. With an unlikely win target of 529, South Zone, who had started the day at a perilous 154 for six, were all out for 234 in the opening session of the fifth morning. Yashasvi Jaiswal (265 in the second innings), Sarfaraz Khan (127 in the second innings), and the bowlers, led by seasoned left-arm seamer Jaydev Unadkat, all contributed significantly to the West Zone's decisive victory.
After handing their opponents a 57-run advantage in the first inning, West Zone scored a massive 585 for four in the second inning.
