Child abuse should be addressed as a social problem.
Because of ignorance and dependency on the abusers, children often are unable to express that they are abused. There are various types of child abuse like physical, sexual, and psychological abuse and neglect. It is important to note that child abuse is a great deal that affects the heart and soul of a young child and can give him/her a nightmare for life. As adults, it is our responsibility to observe child behaviour and encourage them to speak up.
