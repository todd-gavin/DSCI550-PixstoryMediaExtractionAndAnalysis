John Raskin a member of the house committee investigating the Jan 6 attack on Capitol has promised the media that they will reveal some explosive news. 

"The hearings will tell a story that will blow the roof off the House," Raskin said to NBC News. Raskin said the committee will submit strong proof that proves that shows the major involvement of then-President Donald Trump and his inner circle and his supportersÂ who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6 in an attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election.

He said: "No president has ever come close to doing what happened here in terms of trying to organize an inside coup to overthrow an election and bypass the constitutional order," he said. "And then also use a violent insurrection made up of domestic violent extremist groups, white nationalist and racist, fascist groups to support the coup."

He said that this is the worst face of fascism America has ever seen. If the evidence comes off strong I believe no one who has sense would vote for the Republicans and the Trump especially. The followers of Trump I mean what are they up to, demeaning, throwing threats at women, challenging democracy and whatnot.
