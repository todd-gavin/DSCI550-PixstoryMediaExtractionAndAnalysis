Taj Mahal is a symbol of love. Emporer Shah Jahan built this wonder in honor of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who gave him 14 children and died in labor. It is a white structure that took more than 20,000 laborers and 1,000 elephants to complete. The construction of this worldâ€™s richest grave was begun during 1632. An immense mausoleum of white marble, the Taj Mahal is the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage.
