Cycle-ball, also known as "radball" in German, is a bicycle-based version of association football. Each team has two members who ride a fixed-gear bicycle with no brakes or freewheel. Except when defending the goal, the ball is controlled by the bike and the head. 

Nicholas Edward Kaufmann, a German-American, invented the sport in 1893. In 1929, it held its inaugural global championships. In Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, and Switzerland, cycle-ball is very popular. The Pospil brothers of Czechoslovakia were the most successful players, winning the world championship 20 times between 1965 and 1988. 

Artistic cycling, in which participants do gymnastics on bicycles, is closely connected.
