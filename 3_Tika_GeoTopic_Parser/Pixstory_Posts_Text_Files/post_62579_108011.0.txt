Banana is the frenemy fruit of most people. Some love it, some hate it but none can change the fact that it's a punch of nutrients. Potassium and manganese, which are crucial minerals for keeping our skin supple and healthy, are abundant in bananas. Manganese aids in the production of collagen in human skin. Collagen is a type of protein produced by skin cells that softens the skin and reduces the appearance of wrinkles on the face. Bananas contain vitamin A, which helps to rehydrate and heal damaged skin. Apply a mashed ripe banana to dry skin, being careful not to get it in your eyes. Leave on for 20-25 minutes, then rinse off with lukewarm water for moisturised skin right away. The sugars in the banana peel aid in the removal of fluid from itching mosquito bites. Anti-inflammatory qualities in bananas help to lessen the look and redness of acne. Banana peels might help to relieve puffiness around the eyes too. How cool is that! One fruit, so many benefits. And these are just the skin benefits. Banana is amazing for hair, gut health, digestion and your overall health too. Literally a superfood.
