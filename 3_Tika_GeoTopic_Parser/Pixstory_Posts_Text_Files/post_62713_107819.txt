Dislikes Poor grammar and spelling Aside from copious numbers of selfies and political memes which have no place on a social page that is used for business in any case poor spelling and grammar are the top most annoying things to social media users as a whole according to market research There is a meme for everything Some situations shouldn t be turned into a meme That s just my opinion You never truly know who you reach And you never truly know how your post is taken and used Someone could repost without crediting and change the intention of your original post Likes I have been inspired by social media in so many ways I ve read books downloaded apps watched movies tv shows tried styling outfits differently and learned so much from others Most of what we share on social media are the good sides of our lives It feels good when others recognize the good in us It s great to be an inspiration to others It feels good to have your content liked I have reconnected with family and friends and built some really cool relationships Sometimes time and distance causes a disconnect that social media can bridge You can easily catch up by viewing others timelines Social media lessens the distance
