Anime has comprised the childhood of many of us from Dragon Ball Z, Bayblade, Naruto, Fullmetal Alchemist, Hunter X Hunter, Berserk, Tokyo Ghoul, Death Note etc among many others, and we undeniably hold them dear. But an unfortunate fact that we who love anime and manga must face is, that modern anime-manga industry has declined significantly in terms of both quality and quantity.
 
 For those who wonder why I state it as an absolute fact and not merely opinion, well the study is long  and detailed, but for now suffice it to say that time has not done wonders for the anime industry.
 
Much of the anime industry is driven by the demands of the Western, particularly US market. And what this market has been demanding is more and more perversion in anime, in the form of ecchi sometimes borderline hentai anime with some sort of harem setting. Even the demands of the domestic Japanese industry are getting similar to the US based demands for creating anime based on borderline vanilla pornography.
 
It is not as if anime is completely in decline, we still have the likes of Re Zero,
Demon Slayer, Violet Evergarden. So much of animes these days are focused on fan service and driven by some sort of stereotypes. For action animes,  the stereotype is the MC being beaten to the dirt, going all Rocky Balboa with some emo J-rock music in the background, coming back to beat the villain or something like that. Not all mind you, but a lot of them.
 
Then another key factor is the drop in animation quality. With things going more in the digital route, animation is far less fluid and detailed and more focused on creating the illusion of being good due to being HD. For example, compare the animation of DBZ with DB Super and you’d know what I am talking about.
 
 Then there is the lack of ideas these days, with one writer stealing from the other, coming with the most unoriginal stuff there is. Either way, the world of anime that we knew is ruined and is in steep decline.
