A smile always on their face and with their inner child lighted up, they welcomed us as their children. I'm talking about the mothers who are in the elders home. They come with questions of did you eat and asks to stay for some more time to talk. And this just fills our hearts always. 

The innocence and and the amount of excitement they have while we prepare for some activity for them just gives us more courage and motivation for doing more activities for them. 

Their smile is really blissful and we talk with each other with no barriers, as if like we had a connection before. 

The most sad part was when few of them still expect their children to return and they live in that expectations that they will take them back home. That was the hardest part when we had to move away with silence. 

We couldn't do a lot for them but we did something thatÂ  bought some smiles on their face for a moment and their love is something we would cherish. 

While we were making these along with the cards they were curious of what we were doing. They constantly asked all the possibilities like are you going to dance ? Or do any other program ? And so. We just didn't wanted to break the surprise and so maintained it among ourselves for a while. 

And when we visited them with the cards and with the activity they had to do, they were just so surprised and excited and this was that moment when we all equally felt we achieved what we wanted from them. It was just that raw emotions that we saw and which spoke so much to us.
