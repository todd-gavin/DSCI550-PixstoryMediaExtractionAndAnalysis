Hong Kong has reacted angrily to what it calls "unfounded and ludicrous charges" made in important reports from the United Kingdom and the United States, which claim that the territory's democratic rights and freedoms are deteriorating. 

AlJazeera reported that the UK, which administered Hong Kong as a colony before handing it over to China in 1997, said in a six-month update released on Thursday that "alternative voices in Hong Kong's government, legislature, civil society, and media have been all but obliterated." 

In a report covering the period from March 2021 to March 2022, the United States came to a similar conclusion: “(Chinese) authorities took actions that eliminated the ability of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy opposition to play a meaningful role in the city’s governance and effectively criminalized peaceful political expression critical of the central and local governments,” it said.

The Hong Kong government quickly rejected the assessments.

“We strongly oppose the unfounded and ridiculous allegations against the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government made by foreign countries through various reports,” it said in a statement, adding that Hong Kong continued to enjoy “a high degree of autonomy” under the “one country, two systems” that was adopted on its return to Chinese rule.
