Tottenham has received a boost in their quest to sign Villareal defender Pau Torres. The centre-half was watched by Spurs scouts during Villarealâ€™s Champions League clash against Liverpool this summer.

According to the Daily mail, Torres has a buyout clause set at 55 Million pounds and wants to leave Villareal this summer.

Those in attendance would have been impressed with how Torress performed during 
the first hour of the contest until a stirring Liverpool comeback saw them concede three 
goals in quick succession.

Chelsea and Manchester are also being tipped to make an official approach for the Spanish International as they look to improve their backline.

For his part, the 25-year-old would only move to a club in the Champions League and may be reluctant to leave Spain in a World Cup year.

Josko Gvardiol or Red Bull Leipzig is another target for Spurs, as Conte looks to refresh his backline.

Spurs to finally end their long term pursuit? 
Centre-back is an area where the North Londoners absolutely must strengthen ahead of the next term.

After all, Conte uses a three at the back formation, which in and of itself calls for the 
need to have a healthy amount of reliable options.

Thus, Torres would be a great addition looking at how he has become a leading presence in the backline for the Yellow Submarines and the Sapin National team. He would undoubtedly make the North Londoners a better side.

Tottenham still needs to deal with Manchester clubs if Daniel Levy can reach an agreement with Unai Emery's side. Fortunately, it is good to know that the 25-year-old is willing to leave his club.
