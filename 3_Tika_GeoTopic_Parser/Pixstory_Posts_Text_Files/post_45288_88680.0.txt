As matchday officials battled to put out the fires, the Eredivisie match started later than expected.

Ajax's match against Feyenoord was postponed on Sunday after a banner caught fire in front of a packed Johan Cruyff ArenA.

Feyenoord travelled to Amsterdam for a crucial top-of-the-table Eredivisie match, which resulted in a 3-2 victory for the visitors.

However, the game might not have taken place at all if matchday officials had not acted quickly to put out flames in the stands just before kick-off.

What went wrong?

While the players were on the pitch waiting for the game to begin, a banner set up by fans in the stands behind Ajax's goal caught fire.

The fire was accidently started by a flare fired off by home fans, according to reports, with thick black smoke rising up towards the stadium's dome.

With no reported injuries, safety personnel were able to put out the fire, and the referee was eventually given the go-ahead to begin the competition.

Ajax wins a tense Eredivisie match.

The tense pre-match theatrics were a fitting prologue to an end-to-end contest at Johan Cruyff Arena, with Feyenoord taking a surprise lead through Luis Sinisterra after just eight minutes.

In the 24th minute, Sebastian Haller equalised for Ajax, but Guss Til put the visitors back in front, and they held on to their lead until the second half.

Erik ten Hag's team eventually equalised when Dusan Tadic scored 12 minutes from time, and they completed the comeback when Antony turned in a cross from the left, eliciting loud celebrations from the home crowd.

The Brazilian's jubilation was short-lived when he was sent off in stoppage time, but Ajax held on to win and go two points clear of PSV.
