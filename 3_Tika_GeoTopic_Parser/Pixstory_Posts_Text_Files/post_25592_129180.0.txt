Loki season 2 filming is already underway, and we saw a bunch of exciting images from the set. We’ve also seen the first plot spoilers for season 2, but they’re not very detailed yet. We can’t even tell if those leaks are accurate. What’s clear is that the number of Loki season 2 leaks will increase in frequency, and the next exciting spoiler concerns the show’s villain.

Well, it’s not the villain that you expect, considering how season 1 ended. It’s another bad guy, with Marvel reportedly casting a huge actor to play the character. None of this is official news, however.

Season 1 concluded with Sylvie (Sophia Di Martino) outmaneuvering Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to kill the milder variant of Kang (Jonathan Majors), who maintained the Sacred Timeline. He Who Remains wasn’t necessarily the first season’s villain. Similarly, the Kang variant who leads the TVA now might not be the villain of Loki season 2.

Sylvie’s actions had immediate consequences on the timeline, unleashing the multiverse. We’ve already seen the consequences in the MCU. The spell that went wrong in No Way Home and the multiverse shenanigans in Doctor Strange 2 are the kind of events that the TVA would have kept in check while He Who Remains was in charge.

This brings us to the claims of an MCU leaker who goes by the name CineStealth. This person provided accurate details about Marvel shows in the past, suggesting they have some well-placed connections.

The leaker now claims Loki season 2 will be “crazy as hell.” Expanding on that statement, CineStealth said that a “super huge actor ‘might’ have been cast as a villain” to debut in Loki season 2. “If true, it would break the internet"

They did not reveal who this mysterious villain might be other than to say it’s not Kang.

We expect Loki season 2 to continue to explore the multiverse. And since we’re in the Multiverse Saga, anything goes.
