MX Player, one of the largest OTT players operating on the AVoD (advertising video on demand) model, announced ‘MX Gold’ earlier this year. This enables paying subscribers to enjoy the platform’s content without ads and other benefits such as downloads and more. Similarly, we have seen platforms like Zee5, AltBalaji and Disney+Hotstar, offering a hybrid model to users where some content may be restricted behind pay-walls. 

This raises an important question while a number of OTT platforms in India were initially running on AVoD models, what is making them go the SVoD (subscription video on demand) route now? 

According to PwC's Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2022-2026 report, the total OTT revenue more than doubled in 2020, partly driven by the absence of public entertainment and people being forced to spend additional time at home. 

“This trend continued in 2021, with revenue nearly doubling again. While growth rates will slow, the market will still expand at an impressive 14.1% CAGR to reach Rs 21,032 crore in 2026. It is subscription services that are driving this rapid growth, accounting for 90.5% of revenue in 2021 and set to account for 95% in 2026,” said the report. 

On the other hand, according to TMT Predictions 2022 report by Deloitte, India currently has about 102 million SVoD subscribers and this number is estimated to increase at a CAGR of 17 per cent to reach 224 million by 2026. The report said, “India’s AVoD market is expected to increase its current rate from $ 1.1 billion in 2021 to $ 2.4 billion in 2026. Over the same period, SVoD is expected to grow from its current $ 0.8 billion to $ 2.1 billion. The overall OTT space is expected to grow at a CAGR of more than 20 per cent to reach $ 13-15 billion over the next decade.” 

Cost of production a challenge? 

A spokesperson from a leading Indian OTT platform said that the audience is today used to quality content and stories.
