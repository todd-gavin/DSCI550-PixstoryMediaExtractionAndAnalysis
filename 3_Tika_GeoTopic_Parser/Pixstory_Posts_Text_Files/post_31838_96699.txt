According to the survey commissioned by Facile it to the research institutes mUp Research and Norstat, there are more than million Italians who still have a landline phone at home But how much does a home landline cost today The average cost for those who opt for a voice line with ADSL connection Fiber optics equal to just over Euros a year If instead you give up the internet and choose only the voice line with unlimited calls, the price is equal to Euros. or even reversed compared to that of a mobile phone Anyone who continues to have a landline at home claims to do so mainly for safety reasons in the event of an emergency or as a means of communication reserved for a few close friends explains Mario Rasimelli Managing Director Utilities of Facile it In short, once the close contacts used to be the only ones we gave out our mobile numbers today they are the only ones who can reach us even when our smartphone is off
