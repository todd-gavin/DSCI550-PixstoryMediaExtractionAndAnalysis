Former National Archives and Records Administration director David Ferriero who resigned in April reportedly initiated the federal investigation into former president Donald Trump s handling of classified documents The director is obligated under federal law the Federal Records Act to inform the Archivist and then commence an action via the attorney general to recover the records Hillary Clinton deleted at least emails containing classified information and possibly more Despite being the director of NARA at the time Ferriero did not notify the DOJ about these missing emails This issue demonstrates clear hypocrisy and a blatant targeting of Republicans or at least protection of Democrats Hillary Clinton s e mail scandal was well documented and proven and the type of behavior she exhibited in relation to the classified documents is strikingly similar to that of Donald Trump she reportedly communicated classified information on a private server and then deleted the classified information just as Trump allegedly brought classified information to a private residence and then destroyed the classified information Many directors of federal agencies are so corrupted with bias that they have not only acted in an unprincipled manner but they have also acted in a manner that they know is unprincipled yet continue to do so to benefit themselves and their parties
