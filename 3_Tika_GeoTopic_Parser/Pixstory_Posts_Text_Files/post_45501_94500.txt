Prior to Roma s Serie A match against Napoli on Monday Jose Mourinho used the opportunity to pay tribute to Argentina legend Diego Maradona The Giallorossi are in Naples for their next domestic match and there are plenty of paintings and shrines dedicated to the World Cup champion in that area of the world Maradona who died in November won two league titles and a UEFA Cup with Napoli during his seven years in Italy and will be regarded as an all time great Have Mourinho and Maradona ever met Over the years Mourinho and Maradona developed an unexpected relationship with the two larger than life figures exchanging messages before and after games After learning of the South American legend s death the man currently in charge of Roma who formerly worked with Chelsea Inter Real Madrid and Manchester United said The world knows Maradona and the world never forgets him Even though my kid was born after he was a player I made sure that he learned a lot about him I m confident that when my son becomes a parent he will not let his children forget I never saw Alfredo Di Stefano play football but my father made sure I learned all there was to know about him We had players from our generations playing with these generations and my generation was the one everyone knew Then there s Diego who is a character in his own right That s the one I m missing I regret not spending more time with him I would have liked to I believe his family friends and co workers are fortunate to have had the opportunity to get to know him and spend time with him I knew him well enough that he would always contact me after one of my major setbacks Never in any of my major triumphs But I shall miss Diego and while I am sad I grin since every minute I spent with him was spent laughing
