Small electronic waste collection nearby Almost the tons of smartphones, small household appliances and energy-saving light bulbs that have been transferred to the EcoIsole WEEE of the Ecolight consortium With a growth of more than the previous year, they represent a possibility to increase the collection of this type of waste but also a tool to raise awareness of WEEE and the need for their conscious and environmentally friendly management from small electrical and electronic equipment. In fact, they are located near large points of sale, shopping centers and places of public interest so as to guarantee correct management of electronic waste. We are talking about small appliances, consumer electronics and fluorescent and energy-saving light bulbs identified with the WEEE R and R groupings which are difficult to intercept and which mainly include everyday objects such as mobile phones, remote controls, mouse chargers and household utensils as well as light sources observes the general manager of the Ecolight consortium Giancarlo Dezio It is estimated that only one in five follows a correct management path The remaining part often remains in the houses at the bottom of a drawer or in the cellar or even follows irregular channels The importance of this waste in its high recovery potential is in fact recyclable for more than its weight, thus being able to make an important contribution to the circular economy The WEEE EcoIsoles in operation last year demonstrated the importance of a change of approach in collection no longer and not only the possibility of conferring this waste to the ecological islands of the Municipalities but an expansion of the offer in collection There were over a thousand people who used them in the twelve months thus allowing the collection of almost kg of fluorescent and energy-saving light bulbs and over tons of small appliances
