This is the famous Gujrati refresher,Â  Komal .... it is nothing but the coconut buttermilk. 
The word komal means soft and that's exactly how it tastes.
Komal is a summer beverage created with simple components such as coconut milk, jeera, hing, and chilli. Surprisingly this beverage contains both coconut milk and curd.
