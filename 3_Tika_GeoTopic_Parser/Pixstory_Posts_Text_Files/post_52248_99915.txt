Despite being a relatively small city four million people at basically the end of the earth Melbourne has food that s up there with places like New York City or London and has the kind of variety you won t find anywhere else Cutler Co Australian Cutler Co Co is the perfect example of A Melbourne Restaurant Simple bistro like food maybe some roasted flounder to start and then a giant rib eye to share done in a fine dining setting that somehow also feels casual and relaxed The same chef is behind a bunch of other fantastic restaurants in town and you should definitely get to one before you leave Cumulus Inc is an all day no reservations small plates operation with the best tuna tartare in the city Cookie Thai Cookie is like that one sweater that s been shoved in the back of the closet sometimes people forget it s there but then they eat here once and never forget it Not that Cookie is ever empty or quiet but it s been around for so long and is so consistently good that Melbourne kind of takes it for granted They serve some of the best Thai in town in a huge space that s half bar half restaurant and fully one of our favorite places to eat in the city Kaprica Pizza On a quiet street in Carlton right near Melbourne University is a pizza place that feels like it s actually on a quiet street in Rome The menus are handwritten photocopies and often covered in red wine stains wine is poured into tumblers and the seating is so cramped you ll definitely be involved in the relationship debrief happening at the table next door Chin Chin Vietnamese This no reservations modern South East Asian spot on Flinders Lane in the heart of the city is a very Melbourne take on Asian dining halls and is always a lot of fun Minamishima Japanese Minamishima is a true outlier offering one of the only omakase menus in town and using both local seafood and fish imported straight from the Tokyo fish market
