While Trump's election loss removes the greatest obvious threat to US democracy, the fissures and anti-democratic forces that propelled him to the presidency remain. This is due in large part to two realities in US politics: presidential power is intrinsically limited, and the problems that beset domestic politics reach deeper than any single person's presence on the political stage. 

The first truth is that Biden will not be able to reverse the anti-democratic trends that have formed over the last six years on his own. It is a misconception that presidents are all-powerful actors who can shape political reality to their liking. Presidents are limited actors operating inside a complicated system of individuals, each with their own goals and objectives.

As a result, presidents are frequently unable to effect the reforms they wish. 

East Asia Forum tells us that despite being elected with the biggest number of votes ever received by a presidential candidate, Biden's capacity to effect real change on his own is limited. For example, Biden has yet to get his 'Build Back Better' agenda or voting rights legislation passed. 

The second reality is far more disturbing. The problems that afflict US politics are systemic, and no amount of electing or removing a president will solve them. The tone of American politics is becoming increasingly acrimonious, with political attachments established frequently out of rage and dislike. In a political climate characterised by 'negative partisanship,' political identities, policy positions, and democratic beliefs are shaped by the parties and leaders that govern.
