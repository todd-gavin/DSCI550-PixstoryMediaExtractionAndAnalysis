After the second wave of Covid-19, all the colleges of Delhi University have reopened today. However, only the final-year UG and PG students have been allowed inside the colleges.

Students and teachers are rejoicing at the prospect of returning to normalcy. College is a crucial period of any student’s life. It plays a crucial role in the overall development of the individual. 

While online classes and exams were a somewhat suitable substitute for academic requirements, they cannot mimic or replace the environment of a college. Fests, extra curricular activities and the learning environment of a classroom cannot be created over zoom or Google Meet. 

Some are very apprehensive about this decision of reopening the university in the wake of covid 19. 
But for how long can this move could have been postponed? Already two years of some students have been compromised and we cannot risk to future this with yet another batch. 

What will be the future of students who have scored 10 cgpa and get into prestigious PG colleges by copying and pasting answers in the open book examination. 

Coronavirus is here to stay and its high time to make our peace with this “new normal” and resume our lives as they were before covid to the best of our abilities. Furthermore, with vaccination for children, the situation is not that dangerous and hence we need to take this leap of faith and make education of the graduates our new priority. 

What do you think about this decision?
