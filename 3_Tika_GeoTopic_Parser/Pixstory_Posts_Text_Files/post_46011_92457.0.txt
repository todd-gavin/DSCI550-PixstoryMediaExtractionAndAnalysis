If you have attended public school in America like me, one of your major memories consists of an American flag in every classroom. When I was a kid, I just accepted it and it never occurred to me to question as to why it was so necessary to have one in every classroom. 

People say it is a symbol of patriotism, of loyalty to your country and your flag. But is it really? There is an American flag right in front of students but in the same classroom, black students, Native American students are discriminated against. In the same classroom, shooters enter with a gun and kill the students and teachers mercilessly. So what is the relevance of this flag? 

Moreover, we have seen reports from all over the country how Black Lives Matter flag, pride flags and ripped off of walls and are given no place in the whole campus on the grounds that schools are a place of education and they should be totally free from any kind of “propaganda”. If that is the case, aren’t national flags also political propaganda? 

Although now the presence of flags in classroom is not as prevalent as it was in my time, we still need to ponder on what are we teaching our students. Instead of whitewashing the image of America as the “greatest country” we should be telling the kids the truth: because all of us know that our country as a checkered past and a questionable future.
