Bella Hadid's time in the spotlight has been marked by her forthrightness. Bella hasn't been shy about sharing her struggles in the industry in the past, especially as she continues to live with Lyme Disease. She's now opening up even more.

Bella revealed more of the emotional toll that has accompanied her modelling career on the April 2022 cover of Vogue, as well as addressing the constant speculation about possible plastic surgery. "People believe I completely messed up my face because of a picture of me as a teenager looking puffy, "said the model. "I'm sure you don't look the same as you did when you were 13, do you? I've never used filler before. Let's just put a stop to it. I don't have a problem with it, but it's not for me."
