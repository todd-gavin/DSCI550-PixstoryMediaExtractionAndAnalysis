Sancha tea boutique was established in 1981, with their first tea gallery 'Aap ki Pasand' in Darya ganj. They offer 75 varieties of green, herbal, black, white, oolong, matcha tea among others. Their teas are vegan, gluten-free & herbal. My favorite is 'Sleeping Beauty', which just like the name suggests helps you to a good night's sleep. 

The Aap Ki Pasand Tea Gallery is decorated with colonial furniture that gives it a typical colonial feel of pre-independence India. Customers can unwind in their handcrafted furniture, listen to soothing music, and, most importantly, taste and purchase over 75 different tea varieties. The Aap Ki Pasand Tea Gallery, located a few minutes away from the historic Red Fort, is worth a visit for anyone who enjoys a good cup of tea.
