“PSG is a club that has been growing for ten, eleven years. It has a lot of ambitions and a lot of desire to continue growing. It has a lot of room for growth. It has a lot of power to be able to do so. 

I think that today it is one of the biggest clubs in the world. It is developing even more and getting bigger. I think that today it has nothing to envy from the big and historic clubs.

Winning the champions league is complicated because it is a competition where the best are playing, because any detail, any mistake can knock you out of a competition, competing against such great clubs and teams.

I think we have the team to try to win it. I think we are very excited and we are very eager to achieve it, but we have to be calm, because as I say, it is difficult to win the Champions League.”
