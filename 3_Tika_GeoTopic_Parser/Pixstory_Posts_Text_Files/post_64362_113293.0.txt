I do agree that children who grow up in an unhealthy and stifling environment tend to develop mental issues that affect them over the long course of time. As parents, people should understand that it was not their child's individual choice to be born and that's why not providing them with the right setting to evolve themselves is an outright example of failed parenting. Often I have observed how parents keep reminding their children about how they have done so much for them which makes children feel guilty about themselves. I understand that parents have invested a lot in their child's upbringing, however, making them feel every time as if they did a favour for them is completely wrong as it not only creates an excessive burden on the child but also makes him think a lot about such small things, distracting him from his actual path. Children also become underconfident as they start to question their abilities and strengths which is bad for them.
Parents should keep in mind that their child is trying his best. Too much involvement in the child's life may also sometimes lead to adverse outcomes. As parents, you should give proper space to your child and also respect his decisions and views so that he feels acknowledged and face no such overwhelming issues in his life.
