When asked why tennis superstar Novak Djokovic was not permitted to enter the United States to play in the US Open, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stated, "it's two different things" in an attempt to skirt the administration's blatant hypocrisy in its handling of foreign entrance into the United States.

Obviously, they are not two different things. Daily, thousands of unvaccinated or unknown-vaccination-status migrants cross the southern border, and they are permitted entry into the United States, posing a grave threat to the nation's health.

It would be so simple to have consistent rules, wouldn't it? Obviously not. The Biden administration must placate its supporters by giving the impression that it cares about both the protection of Americans and open borders. An open border and a safe health policy are inherently incompatible, since you must sacrafice one to have the other.  Yet, it seems that these terrible policy choices will continue to hurt us for no other reason than to keep people happy at the cost of rationality and out safety.
