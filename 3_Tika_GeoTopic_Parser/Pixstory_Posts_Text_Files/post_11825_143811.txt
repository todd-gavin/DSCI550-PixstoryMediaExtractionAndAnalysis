Underboob sweat season is officially upon us Let s face it to be clear we ve got nothing against a bit of sweat After all it s an entirely natural biological process which helps regulate our body temperature and literally keeps us alive But one of the biggest bugbears is the itchiness that goes hand in hand with underboob sweat especially when you peel off a sports bra only to uncover an unsightly rash Underboob sweating is your body s natural way of regulating heat When can it happen Large breasts Wearing synthetic material Humid weather Vigorous Workout What can we do about it Ditch the synthetic material Use a moisturising powder to help prevent chafing and rashes Avoid tight tops and bras Try using a gentle exfoliant Stock up on foods that reduce body heat nbsp Use panty liners to mop up sweat Keep a bottle of argan oil handy Keep a packet of wipes in your handbag If you re silently dealing with the issue remember that while sweating under your breasts is annoying it s also totally normal and nothing to be ashamed of Instead embrace underboob sweat as it shows you re working out hard and you re well hydrated
