Hence a goal scoring option must be available to the team who might be able to replace the Frenchman whenever needed The team also has been filled with several inefficient players in the past few seasons to everyone s surprise Marco Asensio who was being considered the generational talent for the Los Blancos in the times to come has not been the same since after having suffered an ACL tear His decline in form and being unable to create chances from the wing position has cost his side a lot Mariano Diaz is another player who hasn t been able to have any sort of impact despite staying at the club for several years now Opportunities The Real Madrid side has no doubt been one of the most dominant sides in whichever competition they ve been a part of in recent times The team which won both the league title as well as the UCL last year will be looking to achieve similar heights this year too In addition to the Laliga and UCL titles the Madrid side will also be looking to lift the Copa del Rey and Spanish super cup as well New signings of Antonio Rudiger and Aur lien Tchouam ni will hopefully help the team achieve their objectives Threats A major threat for the side has been the untimely injuries to its star players on a regular basis right from the start of the season The side has to deal with a ridiculously bad series of injuries that several players in the squad had sustained in the season The story seems to continue this season too as Karim Benzema and Eder Militao who were first hand choices to start for Madrid in the crucial Laliga as well as UCL matches are already sitting out with injuries With such difficult situations arriving this early in the season the upcoming times are indeed going to be extremely tough for Carlo Ancelotti s men hereon The team will need the majority of its players to be in proper shape so as to achieve its purpose of lifting trophies this season
