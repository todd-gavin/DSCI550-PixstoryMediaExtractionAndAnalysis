On Thursday, June 9th, the UEFA Nations League returns with a pair of League C matchups,
with North Macedonia taking on Georgia.

Georgia is presently leading their group after winning their first two games. They crushed
Bulgaria 5-2 last week and will be confident going into the match against North Macedonia.

On the other hand, North Macedonia is in second position and will need to improve this week.

They won 2-0 over Gibraltar in their recent game and will aim for a good outcome against
Georgia.

North Macedonia vs Georgia: Prediction

In the previous version of the Nations League, none of these teams could be separated in either
match. It wouldn't surprise me if this match followed a similar path. North Macedonia will
surpass Georgia in Group C4 if Georgia loses, so expect them to play a careful game, taking no
risks and focusing on defensive solidity. With that in mind, a low-scoring match appears to be on
the cards.

Prediction: North Macedonia 2-1 Georgia
