Manchester City reportedly have a "deal in place" to complete the signing of Erling Haaland in the summer. For this, the Sky Blues could be paying up to £100m for the player's services. 

According to the report, Pep Guardiola's side have understood the framework that is required to complete the transfer. City have also reportedly discussed personal terms with Erling Haaland's agent regarding the move. 

Manchester City would reportedly be paying around £100 million to complete the signing of the Norwegian striker. This includes the transfer fees and the other agent fees that the club would have to pay. 

Erling Haaland has been an integral part of Borussia Dortmund since joining the club in January 2020. The Norwegian striker has 80 goals in 79 appearances in all competitions for the Black and Yellows. 

The 21-year old has scored an impressive 16 goals and provided 5 assists in just 14 Bundesliga games in the 2021/22 season. But Haaland has had a few struggles with injuries that have kept him on the sidelines. 

Manchester United, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Paris Saint-Germain are also monitoring the situation of Erling Haaland. Hence it has to be seen if Manchester City can complete the signing in the summer.
