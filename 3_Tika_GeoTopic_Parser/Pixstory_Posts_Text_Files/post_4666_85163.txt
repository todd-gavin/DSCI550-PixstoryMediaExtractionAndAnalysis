The site of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in northern Ukraine has been surrounded for more than three decades by a square mile square kilometer exclusion zone that keeps people out On April Chernobyl s reactor number four melted down as a result of human error releasing vast quantities of radioactive particles and gases into the surrounding landscape times more radioactivity to the environment than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima Put in place to contain the radioactive contaminants the exclusion zone also protects the region from human disturbance Apart from a handful of industrial areas most of the exclusion zone is completely isolated from human activity and appears almost normal In some areas where radiation levels have dropped over time plants and animals have returned in significant numbers Some scientists have suggested the zone has become an Eden for wildlife while others are skeptical of that possibility Looks can be deceiving at least in areas of high radioactivity where bird mammal and insect population sizes and diversity are significantly lower than in the clean parts of the exclusion zone I ve spent more than years working in Ukraine as well as in Belarus and Fukushima Japan largely focused on the effects of radiation I have been asked many times over the past days why Russian forces entered northern Ukraine via this atomic wasteland and what the environmental consequences of military activity in the zone might be Some scientists have suggested the zone has become an Eden for wildlife while others are skeptical of that possibility Looks can be deceiving at least in areas of high radioactivity where bird mammal and insect population sizes and diversity are significantly lower than in the clean parts of the exclusion zone I ve spent more than years working in Ukraine as well as in Belarus and Fukushima Japan largely focused on the effects of radiation Full story at The Conversation Image Credits
