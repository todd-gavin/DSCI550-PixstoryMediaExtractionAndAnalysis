Shiragaki 37'
Tanikawa 52'
Takaoka 90+2'
Goal 1 
While Canada were trying to shift into an attack, 3 Japanese girls put pressure on the Canadian midfielder around the middle-third of Canada's half. The ball came to Mao Kubota. She turned and took a shot which slipped through the air and curved into the goal. Goalkeeper Lallier got a hand on the ball but couldn't push it out. 
Goal 2 
Shiragaki's left footed shot bounced up from Canada player Renee Watson's legs and fell into the net over and beyond the goalkeeper. 
Goal 3 
Tanikawa scored a wonderful goal to make it 3. After receiving the ball at the left wing, outside the box, she got away from the sliding defender, came into the box with the ball and turned away from another defender before firing a low shot beyond the goalkeeper. Composed finish. 
Goal 4 
The 4th goal came from a penalty, when a Canadian defender pushed a Japanese player near the 5 yard box while trying a header for a cross from the left. After the VAR check, the referee awarded a penalty but the kick hit the crossbar. Takaoka hurried to tap in before the goalkeeper could claim it. Initially, the goal was denied for a foul on the goalkeeper but VAR overturned that decision and awarded the goal. 
Japan will face France in their third group match, who lost to debutants Tanzania 2-1 yesterday. It looks difficult for France to reach the second round even if they win against Japan. 
In yesterday's other matches, China lost to Colombia (2-0) and Mexico beat Spain in a nail biting match (2-1).
