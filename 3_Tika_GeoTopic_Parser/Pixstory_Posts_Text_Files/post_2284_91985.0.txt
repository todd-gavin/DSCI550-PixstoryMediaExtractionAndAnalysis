Home minister Amit Shah came face to face with former home minister P Chidambaram in Parliament today. 

Both greeted each other with Namaste. Some netizens called it the picture of the day. 

When Chidambaram was the home minister, the CBI had arrested Shah in 2010 in a fake encounter case. 

And during Shah's current tenure as the home minister, Chidambaram was arrested in the INX Media case.
