Consider what life would be like if you didn't have access to the services of your friendly neighbourhood garbage hauler. Every home and business would have mountains of garbage built up in front of them. And that would be disgusting! 

Fortunately, there is a group of tenacious and dedicated workers that collect and dispose of your garbage on a regular basis. As a result, Global Garbage Man Day is an opportunity for everyone to take a break from whatever they're doing and appreciate the hard work of these dedicated individuals.

Sanitation professionals – also known as garbage men – are vital for functioning, hygienic civilization. But despite their daily toil, they don’t always get the appreciation they deserve for their work.

As per DOY, Global Garbage Man Day seeks to address this injustice. It is an opportunity for regular people to appreciate the efforts and dedication of committed waste experts in their local community and across the globe.
