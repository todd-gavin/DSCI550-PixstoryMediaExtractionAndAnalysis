Neighborhoods across Queens, such as Flushing and Jackson Heights, may be well-known for their dense Asian populations. But quickly joining those ranks is one of the borough’s smaller residential pockets: Long Island City. According to a recent census, the number of residents who identify as Asian and call LIC home has grown five times in number since 2010. In 2020 alone, more than a dozen new Asian-owned businesses in the neighborhood opened their doors to locals.

Find out what the riverside community has to offer—scallion pancakes, sashimi, stylish streetwear and much more—at these favorites below. 

Hupo

  Spice lovers can unite at this contemporary Chinese dining spot, which specializes in the piquancy of Szechuan cuisine. Start with cold appetizers, like zingy wood ear mushrooms or a bowl of spicy dan dan noodles. Then gear up for a family-style feast of winners like the mapo tofu, tender tea-smoked duck and the Chongqing whole-roasted fish. Fans of dry pot can build their own bowl from a list of assorted add-ins. Need something to quell a fiery tongue? A robust menu of handcrafted cocktails, spritzers and milk teas awaits.

Multisweet

The next time your sweet tooth calls out, pay a visit to this charming dessert café that spotlights Asian homestyle baked goods. A neighborhood newcomer, Multisweet has won over patrons with items like durian custard pastries and Earl Grey pudding. If you’re looking for a savory bite, try the pork song song: a soft bun, encased in mayonnaise plus a coating of dried seaweed and sweet Chinese pork floss. Pair your snack with a cup of your favorite espresso drink and cozy up indoors or head out to the patio space. 

Möge Tee

If planning a tea tour is your goal, add Möge Tee to the list, but be warned: its menu is extensive. To avoid decision fatigue, go straight for a blended fresh fruit tea—strawberry and watermelon are fan favorites—with cheese foam topping. If you’re feeling adventurous, consider the bubble milk tea made with fresh purple yam. For small bites, choose from delights like handmade tofu puddings, sweet mochi and crepe cake slices.
