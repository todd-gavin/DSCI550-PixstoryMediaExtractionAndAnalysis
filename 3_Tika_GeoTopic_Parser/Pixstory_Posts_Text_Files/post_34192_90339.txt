Italy midfielder Jorginho spoke to Rai Sport microphones after the defeat against Macedonia It&#39;s a huge disappointment It hurts so bad Speaking of football I think that was not lacking because we have always created and dominated the matches but we have not managed to finish Not blame no one but reality In these last few games we haven&#39;t been able to finish and we&#39;ve made some small mistakes that have made the difference where the others have found goals that didn&#39;t happen before It&#39;s difficult because we have to look at reality We haven&#39;t been able to conclude and I&#39;m putting myself in this too and it hurts me to think about it Going there twice and not helping your comrades and making your country happy Now they say go ahead but it hurts
