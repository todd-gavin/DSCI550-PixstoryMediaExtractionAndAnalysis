Threatened with only their third relegation in the history of the British football pyramid, Everton Football Club found themselves in a sticky position going into the final few gameweeks of this year's Premier League season. As things are, they avoid the drop by a
respectable four points. Following a desperate close to the season, the Blues and Leeds
now remain in the Premier League for 2022/23.

Season Overview:

The beginning of the season under Rafa Benitez was bright, with the Toffees averaging
above two goals per game and conceding a lot less. 

The football wasn't so smooth and free
flowing but it was evident that this was a team built on character, discipline and organisation.

All that lasted very little though, as the games came at them thick and fast and they quickly
lost sight of what was past them. A 3-0 loss against Aston Villa was followed by a Carabao
Cup elimination at QPR. Everton then went three months without a win, finally salvaging a
victory over Arsenal in December.

That though, was followed by more turmoil as losses against Crystal Palace and Brighton
were all it took for the board to turn against Benitez.

The football had gone stale by the turn
of the year, multiple sources cited internal issues at Everton and in came Frank Lampard.

The former Chelsea boss was unproblematic and simple with his approach. Following the winter acquisitions of struggling midfielders Delle Alli and Donny Van De Beek he set about
to mix and match till an obvious path presented itself.

Mix and match he did, but the results were still not going Everton's favour. Following an early season victory over Burnley, they were fourth and now they stood closer than ever to their first relegation since the 1950's â€” mid February with 5 defeats in six Premier League
fixtures.

Everton made it only till Crystal Palace in the FA Cup but saving a Premier League
spot was what Lampard was focusing on.
