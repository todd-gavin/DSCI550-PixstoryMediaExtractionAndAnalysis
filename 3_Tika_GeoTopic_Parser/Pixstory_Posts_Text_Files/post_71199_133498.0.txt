Stand aside Tacos, Falafels and invader Shawarma. The poor man’s Shawarma is here.

The Kashmiri street food lavasa masala, sometimes referred to as masala tchot, is a wrap filled with cooked yellow split peas and hot chutney. You can commonly find vendors selling them outside schools and institutions

The Kashmiri version of a wrap or taco ,called  masaal tchot is a Lavasa bread that is used to encase channa, a meal that has a hummus-like flavour, and radish chutney. Although the dish is filling and will satisfy your hunger but not the cravings.
