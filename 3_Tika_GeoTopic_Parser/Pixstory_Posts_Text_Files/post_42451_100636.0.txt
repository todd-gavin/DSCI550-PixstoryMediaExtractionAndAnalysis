Just watched the match between Newcastle United and Arsenal and Newcastle United wins the match by a scoreline of 2-0 

And I think Arsenalâ€™s hope of finishing the Premier League in the fourth position is over because at the moment Tottenham Hotspur is sitting in the fourth spot with 68 points after playing 37 matches and on the other hand, Arsenal is now in the fifth spot with 66 points after playing 37 matches.

Losing the Uefa Champions League spot from this situation will be heartbreaking for Arsenal.

Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur will play their last match in the premier league against Everton and Norwich City respectively where Arsenal should win the match and will wish that Spurs will lose the match against Norwich City to secure the Champions League spot.

On the other hand, Tottenham Hotspur just needs one point to secure the fourth position in the premier league and a Champions League spot for next season.

The last day of the Premier League is gonna be a thriller.
