According to rumors, Liverpool attacker Sadio Mane is poised to leave the club this summer, 
which might indicate the club is looking for a successor, with choices available across a number of Europe's top five leagues.

Mane joined the Reds in 2016 and has already scored 90 goals in 196 Premier League outings. 
In the 2018-19 season, he earned the Golden Boot and helped the Reds win the Premier League, the Champions League, the FA Cup, and the Carabao Cup, as well as triumphs in the Super Cup and the Club World Cup.

So, these are the top three potential replacements. Whom might Jurgen Klopp sign to take Mane's place?

1. Darwin Nunez

Darwin Nunez, a young Benfica striker, has garnered the attention of Europe's top following his outstanding season with the Eagles. Last season, the 22-year-old scored 26 goals in 28 games in the Primeira Liga.

The Benfica midfielder is a constant source of energy in and out of possession, and he can play in the center on his own as well as from the left wing, which is ideal for the Reds' 4-3-3 style.

With Diaz and Salah both being more productive from wide positions, Nunez is in the running for a central attacking role.

The addition of Nunez is expected to cost roughly Â£70 million, which may be too much for the Reds to pay given their "spend what we earn" attitude. However, the young Uruguayan has a lot of promise, and if anybody can develop raw talent into a premier center striker, it's Klopp and his team.
