Rovigo land between Adige and Po where nature embraces history, art and culture A widespread heritage that is revealed in traditions, flavors and landscapes A perfect union revealed by ancient villages Venetian villas churches and abbeys rural estates full of charm Enchanting views like in a fairy tale thanks to a plot linked to the continuous and yet always different interweaving of land and water An irresistible charm made of silences that alternate with bird songs and flashes of mullet along the Adige the Canal Bianco up to the valleys and wild sandbars of the Po Delta populated by very different species of birdlife
