A meeting of the Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) was chaired by party chief Sonia Gandhi on Sunday to discuss the issues to be raised in Parliament during the second part of the budget session commencing Monday. 

The deliberations came hours ahead of a crucial meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party's highest decision making body, to discuss the debacle in the assembly elections in five states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur. 

"We held a discussion on the issues to be raised in the upcoming Parliament session. We will try to raise the issues of inflation, unemployment, MSP for farmers and medical students returning from Ukraine," said Mallikarjun Kharge, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha.
