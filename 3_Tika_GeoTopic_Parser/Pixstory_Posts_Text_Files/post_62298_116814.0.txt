World Emoji Day has been celebrated on July 17 every year since 2014. Based on the way calendar emojis are displayed, Jeremy Burge, the founder of Emojipedia, decided on the date for celebrating the 'World Emoji Day'. The date of this celebration holds significance in the tech world. 

The World's First Emoji Set : SoftBank, known as J-Phone at the time, releases the SkyWalker DP-211SW mobile phone on the 1st of November 1997, with the world's first known emoji set. The set includes 90 distinct emoji characters, among them one of the most iconic emoji characters in the Unicode Standard, the poo emoji.
