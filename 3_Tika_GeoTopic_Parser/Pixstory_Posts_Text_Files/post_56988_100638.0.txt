Camilla Cabello to be joining the panel of coaches on The Voice for its upcoming season.
“The Voice” is produced by MGM Television and Warner Horizon Unscripted Television in association with Warner Horizon and ITV Studios The Voice USA, Inc. John de Mol, who created the series, serves as executive producer alongside Mark Burnett, Audrey Morrissey, Amanda Zucker and Kyra Thompson.
Cabello would be replacing Kelly Clarkson, who has served as a judge for the last eight seasons of the show. It would be her debut as a judge on a reality show. 
She announced it on a TikTok post where she wrote, "See you this fall."
Earlier in the 21st season, she was featured as a part-time advisor; the last season ran from September to December. It would be her first time joining the show as a full-time coach.

Voice keeps on changing its group of judges, so there might be an opportunity for Clarkson to come back. 
Last season also had Ariana Grande, who replaced Nick Jonas on the show.
This season, the other judges joining the panel are Blake Shelton, John Legend, and Gwen Stefani.
