An impalpable, at times unwatchable Atalanta falls at home against Verona and sees their path in this Serie A championship become even more complicated. After their elimination from the Europa League, Gasperini&#39;s men appeared tired, demotivated and not up to the task. Verona, on the contrary, put in a great performance by putting in the nerazzurri and thus returning home with the three points Let&#39;s see together the statistics of the match Atalanta Ball possession Shots on goal Shots blocked Offside Corner Cross Dribbling Fouls conceded Yellow cards Verona Ball possession Shots on target Shots blocked Offside Corner Cross Dribbling Fouls conceded Yellow cards As we can see from the eloquent numbers that Atalanta are unable to be incisive in front of shots on target at the opponent&#39;s goal with as many shots rejected well cross and dribbling led to only one skimpy goal in the final On the contrary the Scala with shots on goal and as many rejected crosses and dribbles manage to win by scoring two goals Something is not right as they say a moment in which everything goes wrong for the Bergamo players who are certainly demoralized after their elimination from the Europa League but are unable to reap the rewards of so much frustrating work There are not even goals from set-piece corners in favor of Atalanta, a sensational fact that should be carefully analysed. In fact, no danger was created for Montip with kicks from the flag. Without finding excuses for the Nerazzurri, we recognize a very serious mistake by Piccinini in the first half. in fact he did not extract the second yellow card against Gnter for holding Zapata Serious episode and certainly the umpteenth in a long series this season The fact is that Atalanta need to reverse the trend if they want to hope to participate in a European cup next year
