PANAJI: Results of genome sequencing released by the directorate of health services have indicated that the third wave was largely an Omicron driven one, with most reports from genome sequencing supporting this.

Like earlier, this time too, the results from genome sequencing arrived only after the wave had ebbed.
A similar situation was seen during the devastating second wave, where it was belatedly reported that the Delta variant was the prevalent one.


Out of 306 samples sent to NIV Pune in January this year, only 186 reports have been received. Of these, 54 were attributed to Omicron and one to the Delta variant.

In February, out of 413 samples sent, only 167 reports were received out of which 148 samples tested positive for Omicron and none for Delta.
Meanwhile, according to Sunday’s Covid update, the number of daily infections had dropped to 20 while one person had succumbed to the infection.


A 78-year-old man from Navelim died within 24 hours of being admitted at the sub-district hospital at Chicalim after experiencing breathlessness. He was vaccinated, but suffered from comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension and liver cirrhosis.

The current number of active cases has dropped to 301 and the state’s positivity rate is at 1.9% from the 1,046 samples tested. No patients were hospitalised, while 20 opted for home isolation.
The state’s recovery rate currently stands at 98%.


North Goa’s weekly positivity rate, at 4%, continues to be higher than that of South Goa which is at 2.15% for the week ending February 26.
