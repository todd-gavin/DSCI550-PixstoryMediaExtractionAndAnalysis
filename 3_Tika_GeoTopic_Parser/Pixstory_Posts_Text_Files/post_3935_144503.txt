A moment of joy was found when I came across this thought A thought when my lungs was filled with water The moment of drowning was pleasant to me It wad an uninvited guest of thought The monster in my head might have come to dusk A moment of thought of survival For the better sunrise Rain or maybe to feel the snow Little moments Maybe for that last part of the ice cream Or for that book My body weighed me down many times But it s finding it s way out from this forest of thoughts
