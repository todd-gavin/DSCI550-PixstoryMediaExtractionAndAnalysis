The answer is 'yes'. Sex during periods can cause pregnancy, although the risk is low. Based on the length of your menstrual cycle, the chances of getting pregnant if you have sex during your periods may not be as low as you may imagine it to be! 

On average, sperm can live, or stay viable (alive and active) in the reproductive tract of a woman upto 5 days after unprotected sex. As a consequence, based on when one ovulates (egg is released) and how long one’s period is, there is a chance of pregnancy even if one has sex during their periods. Simply put, if your cycle length is short, your fertile window may be earlier than you may think it to be. So even if you have sex on your periods, you may ovulate shortly after, and there may be a chance of the sperm staying alive in your system and coming into contact with the egg!

Ovulation roughly happens in the middle of the period cycle. For example, if you have a 28 day menstrual cycle and your periods last for 7 days. This means that you may ovulate roughly between the 12th-14th day. If you have sex on the 6th day of your periods, sperm could stay viable till the 11th day. However, if you have sex on the 7th day then it would be viable till the 12th day. Similarly, imagine your cycle was around 25 days long – that means you ovulate on the 11th day. If you had unprotected sex during the 7th day of your periods, then you are at risk. 

It is therefore untrue that one can have unprotected sex during their periods and not get pregnant! Using birth control like condoms, birth control pills, etc is always a good idea if you aren’t intending on getting pregnant.
