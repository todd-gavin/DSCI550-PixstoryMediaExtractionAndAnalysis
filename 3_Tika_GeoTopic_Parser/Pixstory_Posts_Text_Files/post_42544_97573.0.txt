Today, when Real Madrid will step onto the pitch to play a La Liga match against Espanyol, all players, fans, and manager Carlo Ancelotti will be thinking of only one thing which is to win La Liga today. 

The equation is simple, to win La Liga, Real Madrid has to win today’s match against Espanyol or at least get a draw from the fixture and if Real Madrid will win the match they will be crowned as La Liga champions for the 35th time and players & fans will celebrate the win in Santiago Bernabeu.

But, what if Real Madrid didn’t win or get a draw today?

In this situation, they have to wait for at least a week because after today’s match, Real Madrid still has 4 matches left in La Liga, and in those four matches, Real Madrid has to secure at least one point to be crowned as La Liga champions.

Talking about today’s match, Real Madrid’s manager, Carlo Ancelotti doesn’t have many options to make changes in his playing 11 because players like Alaba, Nacho, Militao, Hazard, and Bale are missing out from the squad, either because of injury or suspension but still, Real Madrid have the squad that can bring out the positive from today’s match.

On the other hand, Espanyol is sitting in the 13th position in the La Liga table after playing 33 matches and right now they don’t have to worry about relegation but I think, they will play the match with their heart out because every team has the dream to win in Santiago Bernabeu.

As a Real Madrid fan, I want my team to win this match and secure the second trophy of the season as Real Madrid already won the Supercopa de Espana in January 2022.

I wish and hope for a good match and positive result but expect the unexpected from football. #halamadrid
