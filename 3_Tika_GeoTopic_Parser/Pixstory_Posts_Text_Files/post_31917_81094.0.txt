Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Edinson Cavani is expected to leave Manchester United this summer.

The Uruguayan's contract expires at the end of the season, and it appears as if his time at Old Trafford is up.

The 34-year-old is expected to push for a move to La Liga as its remains one of the only top leagues in Europe he hasn't experienced (Romano's Twitter account 12th of February).

It appears as if Cavani's time at Manchester United is coming to an end, and it will be fascinating to see where he ends up next.

In 54 games for the Red Devils, the former PSG man has scored 19 goals, but he has also worked so hard for the badge and the team.

Often in games Cavani starts, he sacrifices himself in every way for the good of the team.

This means that he is often out on the right, left, or even deeper to create space for his teammates.

Given his age when he moved to Old Trafford, many thought this would just be a quick payday for Cavani, but he has put a lot of heart and soul into Manchester United, and he will be missed next season.
