Youth Liberation is crucial.
Now I know you're all gonna be like "Has she lost her mind? They're children, they can't choose for themselves!" And that would make sense. 
But I'm not talking about that, I'm not talking about decisions about medical emergencies or something like that, no. I'm talking about their agency. Even when every adult in their lives is endangering them, children are treated as the property of their parents and are unable to exercise their own agency. That's something that we all so conveniently choose to skip on.
We, as a society, fail to see children as people. They're looked at like toys. The "If I told you to hug me, you hug me," attitude from parents for example. We don't care about a child's boundaries because we look at them like our property that is ours to own and control. We don't deem it necessary to ask for their consent before kissing them, we don't care to see if they're comfortable with us picking them up at any time.
Parents should be able to decide for their children but not how we are used to in the current system. We keep parental control over children's wellbeing, when it should be the other way round. Kids shouldn't be forced to go to school or live with abusive parents or require parental consent for important medical stuff like vaccines and sometimes even life saving treatment. Predatory behavior towards children is taken more seriously. Schools don't get to decide for them or put labels on them.
It's not an easy concept to understand but it isn't too complex either. The bottom line is we need a society that treats children as human beings worthy of rights and agency. We need to create a system where parents are willing to invest in healthy parenting and where we keep children's well-being over capitalist competitions, where children are happy and not constantly stressed about their grades or disappointing parents or always having their boundaries violated.
