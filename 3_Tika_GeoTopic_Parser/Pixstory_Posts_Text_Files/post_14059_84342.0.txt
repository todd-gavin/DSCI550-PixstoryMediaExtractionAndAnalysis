A radiant hue, her smile,
Took me a while to realise,
That all of it was real,
My eyes met hers for hours.

I still consider it as a dream,
My hands tremble in reality,
My Heart beats frantically,
Her rhythm has left it in sway.

That mixed dialect,
Reminds me to introspect,
On the years that have passed,
On these feelings that I've stalled.

As her eyes look away, 
I desire for a future there,
With her kindered spirit,
Her sight brings me tranquility.

Her eloquent words take me,
Along with her soft pearled voice,
On a journey of the Afterlife,
As only to the heavens belongs her melody.

The pink silk thread weaves,
The sky with her potrait,
A Dervish said fate lies there,
So, I whirl chanting her name.

My soul is the testament,
My heart the jurisdiction,
My conscience the witness,
To her perpetual divinity.

I'm hopeless again,
I'd wait till the end,
To live or die both,
By her hyperreal innocence.

The wait is like a sword,
My heart the sheath,
I pray to be remembered,
I'm forgotten like a blip.

Her perfect presence lingers,
Binds my heart to hers,
My nerves won't subdue,
Only her gaze ends my fears.

Will there be a next time?
I plead for that now,
To come again and again,
I'm etching it on my soul.

I hope she receives this with love,
Love truly is worship,
I invoke her name with every breath, 
Will she even consider mine?
