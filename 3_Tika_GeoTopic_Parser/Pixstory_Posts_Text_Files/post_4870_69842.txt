Having dreams and aspirations when the world is locked inside sounds weird and similarly hope seems to be crashing for many and I am no exception Sometimes I think it would have been better if I continued working rather than joining a post graduation course in Journalism and the year I did Covid came to the world and hit us all like a wrecking ball From emotionally mentally and physically Covid has added unexpected and unnecessary stress in our lives in every way Especially for students I wasn t even sure whether I ll get admission in any college because life felt very uncertain One becomes a journalist outside the four walls of the classroom and homes but our batch was taught to survive and learn inside the classroom walls We studied what it s like going for reporting and shoots but hardly did we really actualize it On an individual level I decided to work with a few students on documentaries just to learn work and experience things at grassroots level When the farmers protest started I remember going to Singhu border Covid cases were rising during that time but I never felt scared and had doubts about going to crowded places with thousands of unmasked protesters I knew that the field I have chosen as my career will always put me in vulnerable situations but that s what ll be my challenge and I m supposed to learn and work in those circumstances Though my experience in Singhu was enriching within days after my visit there I started showing symptoms for Covid and I tested positive Covid made me very weak and getting back on my feet and going to classes felt a struggle for me I felt skeptical and scared But unlike other students I still spent my post graduation days interacting with my professors wrote scripts for documentaries news stories and ad films in my classrooms learnt voice modulation and spoke in front of the camera along with practising anchoring and one on one interviews with edited clips in the lab To be continued
