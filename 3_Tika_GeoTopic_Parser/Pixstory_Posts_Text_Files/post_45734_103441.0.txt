Days after a historic congressional hearing raised worries about the potential "threats" posed by flying saucers, NASA has apparently stated that it will become engaged in the search for UFOs. 

NASA will assist the US UFO inquiry, according to DailyMail.com.

A NASA spokesperson said it is “evaluating how to provide our expertise in space-based Earth observations to improve understanding of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs)” and “has consulted with multiple government entities”.

Wion said that it has, however, disputed that it is establishing its own dedicated UAP office. 

NASA's decision comes only weeks after the first-ever UAP hearing in Congress in 54 years, during which the sighting of flying saucers was officially confirmed.
