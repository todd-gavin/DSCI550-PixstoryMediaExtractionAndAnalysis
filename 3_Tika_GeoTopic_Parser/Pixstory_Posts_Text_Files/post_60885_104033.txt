Summer is not exactly my favourite season It s scorching hot but my city s geographical conditions are in my favour because it almost always rains My favourite summer activity is to swim I either hit the pool or one of the beaches in South India Other than that I mostly stay indoors and like reading in quiet and cool places I also like visiting the museums whenever I have summer vacations because history and art has always fascinated me Plus museum buildings usually stay cool during the summers I also love going to the local parks and gardens to get a whiff of summer florals You also get to see interesting birds and insects The hot weather is unbearable sometimes but instead of staying still in one place I like to explore and soak up whatever the season has to offer Plus the rain after summers is always rewarding
