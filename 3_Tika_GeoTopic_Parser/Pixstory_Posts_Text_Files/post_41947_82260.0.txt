Born in 1928 in Osaka, Dr Takahashi completed his studies from Osaka University and earned his medical degree. After his graduation, he joined the university's Research Institute for Microbial Disease (RIMD) in 1959.Dr Takahashi spent his days studying about measles and polio viruses. In 1963, he was given a research fellowship at Baylor College in the United States of America.

During this time, his son was suffering from a serious bout of chickenpox. The father's traumatic experience nudged him to focus on combating the highly transmissible illness.After two years, Dr Takahashi returned to Japan in 1965. He began culturing live but weakened chicken pox viruses in animal and human tissue. He dedicated five years to developing the vaccine and it was ready for clinical trials.

In 1974, the virologist had created the first vaccine that targeted the varicella virus which causes chickenpox. "It was subsequently subjected to rigorous research with immunosuppressed patients and was proven to be extremely effective,"
