Juve face Cagliari on Saturday 9th April at 20h45 CEST in a match that pits the team fourth from top against the team fourth from bottom. The Islanders are only three points above the drop zone on the back of their five wins, 10 draws, and 16 defeats.

One of those defeats arrived in Turin the first time the two sides clashed this season, when Moise Kean and Federico Bernardeschi put their names on the scoreboard for the perfect festive send off.

Cagliari have lost each of their last four Serie A outings to the tune of two goals for, 11 against, and have not lost as many as five in a row since Eusebi Di Francesco’s tenure last season, when they collected more home defeats than the current two inflicted by Lazio and Milan.

Against Udinese last weekend, although Cagliari suffered largely on the counter attack, they also conceded from outside the area, taking their total to goals lost from distance to 12 (only Spezia with 13 have done worse so far this season).

No team has scored fewer goals than Cagliari’s two in the first 15 minutes of the match during the current campaign.

PLAYER FOCUS

With the game's opening goal last week in Udine, João Pedro became the second player in club history to score more than 10 goals in three different Serie A seasons at Cagliari. Still a long way short of legend Luigi Riva’s eight.

Among the teams faced at least 10 times in Serie A, Juventus are the opponents which João Pedro has participated in the fewest goals against. His only goal came at the Allianz Stadium on 3 November 2018.

Leonardo Pavoletti has lost all six matches played against Juventus in Serie A. The striker has also only lost against Brescia, Carpi and Livorno, but against none of those opponents has he played more than two games.

Razvan Marin has attempted 33 conclusions without ever finding the back of the net. Only Spezia’s Giulio Maggiore (36) and Udinese’s Walace (37) have attempted more shots without scoring.
