Unfortunately as I was on the way to France I was only able to watch about 30 minutes of the middle of the game so I will provide further analysis upon a more detailed inspection of the game.

But WOW.

The image I’ve selected of Zinchenko perfectly sums up my feelings. The way in which we are able to control games is so impressive and when you sprinkle the amount of technical and physical quality our side possesses we can be unstoppable at times.

This game shouldn’t have caused much of a roadblock but the way in which we dispatched Bournemouth today at their place should be enough to turn a few heads and make rivals pay some serious attention to us.

We have now conceded only 2 goals in 3 games this season, of which both came in the Leicester game through mainly complacency. Consistency in selection is definitely a factor in this, with our defensive line being unchanged in the 3 games we’ve played this season, allowing the players to gel and better understand each other from a positional sense.

Going forward we offer such dynamism and interchangeablility in positions which makes us horrible to be able to track runners against. These young players are finally starting to understand the message that Arteta has been trying to portray to them.

Finally, Gabriel Jesus. Considering we finished in Europa League places last season there should’ve been no way we were able to access a player of his quality. His connection with Arteta and desire for a starting position allowed that, and the rest follows. He’s the driving force in our team and is proving a point to Guardiola that he should’ve been trusted and didn’t really need replacing.

Arsenal are on the up, and this has been a long time coming. We’re not finished in the transfer window but the squad really does look healthier than ever. Exciting times to come.
