YO YO HONEY SINGH 

Honey Singh, a hugely popular rapper, was known for his swag. In Bollywood films, he was cranking out hit after hit song. And there was a reason we were missing his upbeat tunes for so long. He had internal issues that eventually caught up with him.Yo Yo Honey Singh was suffering from bipolar disorder at the time.

Because of the toll the condition took on his health, Honey Singh gained a lot of weight. He found a supportive doctor, went to rehab for a year, and then made a tremendous comeback in the music industry with the backing of his loving family and friends.

In an interview he opened up about it and said “It was scary. One year had passed and I wasn't responding to medicines, until a fourth doctor from Delhi treated me. At one point, I thought I would live in this darkness forever. I had cut myself off from everyone. I didn't come out of my room, forget stepping out of the house. I had a beard and I didn't get a haircut for months. For someone who has performed in front of a crowd of 20,000, I was scared of facing 4-5 people. That's what bipolar disorder does to you.”
