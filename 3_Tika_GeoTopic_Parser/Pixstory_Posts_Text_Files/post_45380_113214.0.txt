According to reports, Christian Eriksen has verbally agreed to join Manchester United this
summer. After leaving Inter Milan, the Dane signed a short-term contract with Brentford and
made his way back to the Premier League in January. Given that he is currently a free agent, his
performances have received a lot of attention. The Bees had intended to keep him on staff, but
he has agreed to a three-year contract at Old Trafford.

United has been looking to bolster its midfield and is currently writing a contract for Eriksen, who
will also undergo a physical. There shouldn't be any problems, but considering the player's past,
all the boxes must still be checked.

While representing Denmark at Euro 2020 last summer, the 30-year-old experienced a heart
arrest. Since he had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, he was prohibited from playing for
Inter Milan under Serie A regulations.

Eriksen had previously shown his talent in the Premier League and was a tremendously
influential character during his brief spell in west London. He performed for a considerable
amount of time at Tottenham, contributing significantly to the team led by Mauricio Pochettino,
which frequently finished in the top four and reached the Champions League final.

Erik ten Hag has had a difficult summer so far and is still trying to finalise the first signing of his
time in Manchester. Eriksen, along with players like Frenkie De Jong and Tyrell Malacia, has
been among those most frequently mentioned in connection with a move to Old Trafford. After
Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic, and Jesse Lingard all left their respective teams after their
contracts ended, the Red Devils have lost a number of their midfield options in recent months.
