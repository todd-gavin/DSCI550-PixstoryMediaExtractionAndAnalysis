Important success of Italian researchers in quantum sciences and technologies The National Research Council first in Europe for number of projects coordinated in the call of the QuantERA Consortium European network leader of research funding organizations from different countries The evaluation of the proposals presented in the context of the first call of the EraNET Cofund QuantERA II a network of organizations from European countries which aims to consolidate cooperation in the field of quantum technologies by funding research projects on the topic The call which made a budget of millions of dollars available to the European scientific community euro international research consortia responded Italian groups of these from the National Research Council CNR participate in the projects admitted to funding, which coordinates projects one with the Institute of Photonics and Nanotechnology Ifn one with the SuPerconducting Institute and other INnovative materials and devices Spin and two with the National Institute of Optics Ino all of the Department of physical sciences and technologies of matter Dsftm Our understanding of quantum mechanics which governs the basic physical phenomena of the universe is translating into ever new applications declares Corrado Spinella Director of the Cnr Dsftm today&#39;s goal the acquisition of disruptive technologies, i.e. in total discontinuity with the current ones which will confer an enormous strategic advantage thanks to applications such as the quantum computer intrinsically secure quantum communication the quantum Internet just to mention the best known The Cnr has always been the protagonist of European research in science and quantum technologies which are among the most advanced topics of the Pnrr Our vision is to create, together with other research institutions, universities and national industrial partners, a new chain of innovation in which the ability to study and manipulate single quantum objects translates into industrial applications E allows the brightest young people to be encouraged to work in Italy on strategic issues for the country&#39;s future
