Having a bad day or week Fret not Australian pumpkin soup is here to make you feel better Australian cuisine is more than just grilled meats and fish There are many vegetarian options available including a hearty bowl of pumpkin soup A bowl of pumpkin soup eaten by the fire best served in the cooler months and easiest to find when travelling south is immensely satisfying For a real Australian rendition use a Granny Smith apple which was initially grown close outside of Sydney As per Skyscanner you need cold weather for delicious soup which is why some online reviewers suggest getting your pumpkin fix at Avalanche Cafe in Thredbo Village Do try it this week
