Magical Realism is one of my favourite genres. The Magical Realist books are an amalgamation of fantasy and reality in a perfect blend that it is almost impossible to distinguish whether between reality and fantasy. Fantastical elements are an important factor in this genre. Magical realism portrays fantastical events in a mundane universe. Fantasy traits given to characters, such as levitation, telepathy, and telekinesis, help to encompass modern political realities that can be phantasmagorical. Magical realism plot lines characteristically employ hybrid multiple planes of reality that take place in "inharmonious arenas of such opposites as urban and rural, and Western and indigenous."
Moreover, most works are political commentaries which are sharp but invisible. 
One of the major proponents of magical realism in America is Alice Hoffman. 

Some of her books are 

The World That We Knew: A Novel

The Red Garden 

Other Magical Realist Books.

Almost all books by Gabriel Garcia Marquez
