Anthony Elanga has been a revelation for the club this season The Manchester United forward scored a crucial goal that helped the Red Devils draw against Atletico Madrid last week The year old Manchester United academy graduate has played Premier League games in the season In this he has started games scoring goals Elanga played the full minutes of the game against Watford in the weekend Manchester United were held to a goalless draw but the youngster shone in the game The Swede created a big chance and also had three shots in the game As stated earlier Cristiano Ronaldo has not had the best of seasons The Portuguese international has scored goals in appearances since his return to Manchester United These numbers are not enough considering the forward s prowess Cristiano Ronaldo has played the best when Edison Cavani has been on the pitch alongside him But the Uruguayan is currently sidelined with an injury Mason Greenwood is also unavailable due to legal action at the moment With Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho having a hot and cold season Anthony Elanga should be promoted Having scored goals in the last games the Swedish striker should play with confidence Should the year old play as the center forward Another option for Ralf Rangnick would be to play Anthony Elanga as the center forward This would move Cristiano Ronaldo to the wings helping him to be more involved with the game The Manchester United manager could also opt to play a front two of Anthony Elanga and Cristiano Ronaldo The year old is quite selfless and this could benefit the Manchester United Hence it has to be seen what Ralf Rangnick decides in the coming days
