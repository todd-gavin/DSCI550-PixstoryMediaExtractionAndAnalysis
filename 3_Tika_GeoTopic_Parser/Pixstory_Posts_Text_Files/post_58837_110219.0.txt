Durgesh Pathak of the AAP defeated Rajesh Bhatia of the BJP in the Rajinder Nagar assembly by-election on Sunday by a margin of more than 11,000 votes. Since voting started this morning, AAP has taken the advantage, which it has maintained as additional ballots have been counted in the afternoon. 

On Thursday, there were about 72,000 ballots cast in the by-election, with a turnout of 43.75 percent. Election officials will soon announce the results and the total number of votes cast.

Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of Delhi, hailed the residents of Rajinder Nagar, saying they had beaten corrupt politicians and backed the righteous cause (of AAP). Outside the Rajinder Nagar counting centre, where they have gathered since the morning, a throng of AAP supporters is celebrating their triumph.

As a result of Raghav Chadha's resignation and subsequent election to the Rajya Sabha from Punjab, the seat was vacant. Raghav Chadha, an AAP member, thanked the voters. "I applaud every Rajinder Nagar assembly constituency voter for once again showing AAP their support and blessing. The "Kejriwal Model of Governance" has been validated by today's success in a by-poll. As I hand the reins over to my brother Durgesh Pathak, best wishes to him," Chadha wrote in a tweet.

Prem Lata, a candidate for Congress, received just over 2000 votes. In the 2020 election, Chadha defeated his nearest rival, RP Singh of the BJP, by more than 20,000 votes.
