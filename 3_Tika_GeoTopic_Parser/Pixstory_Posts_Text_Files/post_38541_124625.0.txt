This time around he scored 10 goals inside the box and 1 goal outside the box.


Comparison between FDJ and SMS?


Savic will be bought on to replace, De Jong but the thing is that both have different profiles. If the move is to be made, the Serb will help in transition from defensive third to middle third of the pitch.While De Jong will help progressing the ball from the goalkeeper to middle of the pitch. Though he will not provide goals which Savic will provide. Buying Savic will not solve FDJ conundrum


How he’ll Fit Into ETH System ?


If he joins United, he will be bound to replace either Fred or McTominay. Compared to both of them, we can see that he is head and heels over them in all the metrics. He might form a midfield trio of Fred-Rabiot-Savic.


Verdict

Erik Ten Hag will be looking to bolster his squad by acquiring Savic. But as aforementioned, will he be the FDJ alternative? That remains to be seen. He is well suited, an all-rounder in his own way, but he won’t solve the De Jong Conundrum.
