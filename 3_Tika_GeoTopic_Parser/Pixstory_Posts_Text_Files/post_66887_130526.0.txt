Pakistan's Captain Babar Azam is in the news for not so bad but hilarious reasons. 
Pakistan cricket team is having a time of their life as they defeated Netherlands in the ODI series with 3-0. But what undermined this fantabulous victory, is captain Babar Azam's post match reference to Netherlands as Scotland. 
We tried our bench strength. Early on the ball wasn't coming on well. We were short in the first innings. But credit to the Scotland bowlers who bowled very well," Azam said.
We are happy as a team. All credit to boys. They bowled very well in the second innings. He's (Naseem) bowling very well with the new ball and in the death overs. Wasim also bowling well. And Dahani,‚Äù he further added.
