Pixstory investor and NBA legend Dwight Howard recently spoke to Forbes magazine at length on a range of issues.

On investing in Pixstory, he said he was concerned about people getting exposed to things on social media that are detrimental to their health-- physically, emotionally, spiritually and mentally.

“I have had long conversations about …how children are receiving information, whether good or bad,” he said. 

“A lot of the time kids don’t understand things they look at on the internet. I have five kids and wanted to find a safe platform for them, their friends and families to tell the truth, hear the truth and not any false information and negativity,” Dwight added. 

On importance of mental health, he said there should be more emphasis on the issue. “I have had to overcome so many difficult obstacles mentally, it’s important to be at a place where my mind is still, like meditation. It is important for all athletes to take time out to just breathe and find stability,” he said.

He told Forbes that he wants to start programmes for kids in India so that they can reach their potential. “We need to create a basketball culture and have good infrastructure in place. I’d like to be someone who’s an ambassador for bringing Indian athletes over to the NBA,” he said.
