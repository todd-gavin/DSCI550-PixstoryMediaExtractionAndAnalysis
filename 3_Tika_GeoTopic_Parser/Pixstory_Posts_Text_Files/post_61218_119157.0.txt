Fishes are small creatures, harmless most of the time yet they are so important in our lives. 
I know it’s weird that how feeding a fish can be beneficial for us when i came to know about it i was quite shocked as well. 
I’m gonna tell you some benefits :
1. Keeping a fish tank in the house helps correct many planets in the birth chart
2. Clams down your heart & mind
3. One gets the blessings of Goddess Laxmi.
4. Removes the negative effects
5. Brings peace and prosperity in  family 

Tell me in the notes did you knew about it?
