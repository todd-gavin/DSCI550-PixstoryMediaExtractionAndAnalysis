Officials of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan said that they have started the delivery of humanitarian assistance aided by China.

Ministry of Refugees and Repatriates of the IEA on Saturday, January 22, 2022, said that the relief assistance comprises 440 tonnes of rice distributed to impoverished people in ten Northern Provinces.

The recently arrived shipment is part of the humanitarian aid that has been pledged by China to the Afghan people.

The spokesperson of the Ministry, Abdul Mutalib Haqqani, said that priority has been given to provinces that are most affected by recent snowfall and where there is a risk of closure of roads.

Officials of the Ministry have also said that other shipments of humanitarian assistance will also reach Afghanistan in the coming days.

Earlier, China had aided winter clothes, foodstuff, medicines, and COVID-19 vaccines with Afghan people since the Taliban takeover.
