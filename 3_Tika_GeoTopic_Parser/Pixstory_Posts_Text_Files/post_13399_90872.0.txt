The ancient celebration, long known as the  Jashne Gole Sorkhe among Afghans, dates back to ancient Balkh and is one of the most  Nowruz celebrations in Afghanistan, held in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif. This celebration has been called the Jashne Gole Sorkhe , because the plains of Balkh will be flooded with red flowers this season. Plains and hills, mountains and hills, fields and gardens, and even the doors and walls and roofs of houses are covered with red anemone flowers.
The Jashne Gole Sorkhe  is a special celebration that is held every year in Mazar-e-Sharif on the occasion of the growth of red flowers. Many people participate in this celebration. The king of Maab province, the Red Rose, also begins.

The rose is the same tulip that is thought to pave the red carpet on the plains and is considered one of the first spring flowers.

Mazar-e-Sharif is the center of the celebration of the rose, which begins every year with the raising of the blessed flag of the pilgrimage of Shah Olia, the rituals of Nowruz. Thousands of people from all over Afghanistan come to Mazar-e-Sharif to participate in this national and religious ritual. For this reason, the citizens of Mazar prepare their guest houses, inns, hotels, restaurants and teahouses in Hout (March) to greet the guests and decorate and light the shrine park, roads and surrounding buildings.

On New Year's Eve, thousands of men and women, young and old, children and adults, gather in the shrine park of Ziarat Sakhi and end the night with joy and anticipation, eagerly awaiting the New Year and raising the blessed flag of Shah Olia.
But this year, the Taliban, who regained control of Afghanistan a few months ago and took control of the country differently from their position during the first period of their rule in the 1990s, said they would not block the red flag ceremony, although they did. Do not act and prevent the celebration of the rose petals
