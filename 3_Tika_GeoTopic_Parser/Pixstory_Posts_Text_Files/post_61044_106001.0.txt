Just to take as a totally random example (and totally not based on me associating with the label or how I’ve spent countless hours scouring the internet for good rep)- asexuality is usually addressed through the loner and aloof character, also hinted at being autistic, unsurprisingly; this is totally not an example of “ the unfeeling nature” associated with both identities (or * coughs* ableism) or the patriarchy’s deploring need to inextricably link romance and sex in order for the monogamous structure to persist. For that matter, nor is it due to the inability of writers to come up with a plotline that doesn’t focus on two characters lusting on each-other, but instead chooses to explore the friendships and/or relationships even if they need a ‘desire’ as such to drive the plot forward or comply with anything but the tried and tested love-cures-everything-happy-ending.

In a once-in-a-corporate-supporting-queer-folks-except-in-june move, there are two notable  exceptions namely Todd from Bojack Horseman and Drea from Everything’s gonna be okay. There’s speculations, obviously, about numerous varied characters- sure, ranging from Yelena Belova in the MCU to Spock and Data from Star Trek- but, honestly, there have been no confirmations from the creators of the show (it doesn’t help that time and again both cinematic universes have employed the very efficient technique of queerbaiting in order to widen their audiences). Another common phenomenon in recent media is that of completely obliterating the asexual part of a charcter’s identity even if they have been explicitly given a rare thumbs-up by their creators- by the fandom this time through shipping them with other characters of the show( Peridot from Steven Universe) which is an accurate example of how asexuality remains somewhat in the background of most discussions even specifically centred around the community.
